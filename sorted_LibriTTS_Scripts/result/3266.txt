had brought her up from babyhood died Miss Benton s death left Billy quite alone in the world alone and peculiarly forlorn To mister James Harding of Harding Harding who had charge of Billy s not inconsiderable property the girl poured out her heart in all its loneliness two days after the funeral You see mister Harding there isn t any one not any one who cares she choked Tut tut my child it s not so bad as that surely remonstrated the old man gently Why I I care Billy smiled through tear wet eyes But I can t LIVE with you she said I m not so sure of that either retorted the man I m thinking that Letty and Ann would LIKE to have you with us The girl laughed now outright She was thinking of Miss Letty who had nerves and of Miss Ann who had a heart and she pictured her own young breezy healthy self attempting to conform to the hushed and shaded thing that life was within Lawyer Harding s home Thank you but I m sure they wouldn t she objected You don t know how noisy I am The lawyer stirred restlessly and pondered But surely my dear isn t there some relative somewhere he demanded How about your mother s people Billy shook her head Her eyes filled again with tears There was only Aunt Ella ever that I knew anything about She and mother were the only children there were and mother died when I was a year old you know But your father s people It s even worse there He was an only child and an orphan when mother married him He died when I was but six months old After that there was only mother and Aunt Ella then Aunt Ella alone and now no one And you know nothing of your father s people Nothing that is almost nothing Then there is some one Billy smiled A deeper pink showed in her cheeks Why there s one a man but he isn t really father s people anyway But I I have been tempted to write to him Who is he The one I m named for He was father s boyhood chum You see that s why I m Billy instead of being a proper Susie or Bessie or Sally Jane Father had made up his mind to name his baby William after his chum and when I came Aunt Ella said he was quite broken hearted until somebody hit upon the idea of naming me Billy Then he was content for it seems that he always called his chum Billy anyhow And so Billy I am to day Do you know this man No You see father died and mother and Aunt Ella knew him only very slightly Mother knew his wife though Aunt Ella said and SHE was lovely Hm well we might look them up perhaps You know his address Oh yes unless he s moved We ve always kept that Aunt Ella used to say sometimes that she was going to write to him some day about me you know What s his name William Henshaw He lives in Boston Lawyer Harding snatched off his glasses and leaned forward in his chair William Henshaw Not the Beacon Street Henshaws he cried It was Billy s turn to be excited She too leaned forward eagerly Oh do you know him That s lovely And his address IS Beacon Street I know because I saw it only to day You see I HAVE been tempted to write him Write him Of course you ll write him cried the lawyer And we don t need to do much looking up there child I ve known the family for years and this William was a college mate of my boy s Nice fellow too I ve heard Ned speak of him There were three sons William and two others much younger than he I ve forgotten their names Then you do know him I m so glad exclaimed Billy You see he never seemed to me quite real I know about him corrected the lawyer smilingly though I ll confess I ve rather lost track of him lately Ned will know I ll ask Ned Now go home my dear and dry those pretty eyes of yours Or better still come home with me to tea I I ll telephone up to the house And he rose stiffly and went into the inner office Some minutes passed before he came back red of face and plainly distressed My dear child I I m sorry but but I ll have to take back that invitation he blurted out miserably My sisters are are not well this afternoon Ann has been having a turn with her heart you know Ann s heart is is bad and Letty Letty is always nervous at such times very nervous Er I m so sorry But you ll excuse it Indeed I will smiled Billy and thank you just the same only her eyes twinkled mischievously you don t mind if I do say that it IS lucky that we hadn t gone on planning to have me live with them mister Harding Eh Well er I think your plan about the Henshaws is very good he interposed hurriedly I ll speak to Ned I ll speak to Ned he finished as he ceremoniously bowed the girl from the office James Harding kept his word and spoke to his son that night but there was little after all that Ned could tell him Yes he remembered Billy Henshaw well but he had not heard of him for years since Henshaw s marriage in fact He must be forty years old Ned said but he was a fine fellow an exceptionally fine fellow and would be sure to deal kindly and wisely by his little orphan namesake of that Ned was very sure That s good I ll write him declared mister James Harding I ll write him tomorrow He did write but not so soon as Billy wrote for even as he spoke Billy in her lonely little room at the other end of the town was laying bare all her homesickness in four long pages to Dear Uncle William CHAPTER II THE STRATA Bertram Henshaw called the Beacon Street home The Strata This annoyed Cyril and even William not a little though they reflected that after all it was only Bertram For the whole of Bertram s twenty four years of life it had been like this It s only Bertram had been at once the curse and the salvation of his existence In this particular case however Bertram s vagary of fancy had some excuse The Beacon Street house the home of the three brothers was a Strata You see it s like this Bertram would explain airily to some new acquaintance who expressed surprise at the name if I could slice off the front of the house like a loaf of cake you d understand it better But just suppose that old Bunker Hill should suddenly spout fire and brimstone and bury us under tons of ashes only fancy the condition of mind of those future archaeologists when they struck our house after their months of digging What would they find Listen First stratum number one the top floor that s Cyril s you know They d note the bare floors the sparse but heavy furniture the piano the violin the flute the book lined walls and the absence of every sort of curtain cushion or knickknack Here lived a plain man they d say a scholar a musician stern unloved and unloving a monk And what next They d strike William s stratum next the third floor Imagine it You know William as a State Street broker well off a widower tall angular slow of speech a little bald very much nearsighted and the owner of the kindest heart in the world But really to know William you must know his rooms William collects things He has always collected things and he s saved every one of them There s a tradition that at the age of one year he crept into the house with four small round white stones Anyhow if he did he s got them now Rest assured of that and he s forty this year Miniatures carved ivories bugs moths porcelains jades stamps postcards spoons baggage tags theatre programs playing cards there isn t anything that he doesn t collect He s on teapots now Imagine it William and teapots And they re all there in his rooms one glorious mass of confusion Just fancy those archaeologists trying to make their monk live there But when they reach me my stratum they ll have a worse time yet You see I like cushions and comfort and I have them everywhere And I like well I like lots of things My rooms don t belong to that monk not a little bit And so you see Bertram would finish merrily that s why I call it all The Strata And The Strata it was to all the Henshaws friends and even to William and Cyril themselves in spite of their objection to the term From babyhood the Henshaw boys had lived in the handsome roomy house facing the Public Garden It had been their father s boyhood home as well and he and his wife had died there soon after Kate the only daughter had married At the age of twenty two William Henshaw the eldest son had brought his bride to the house and together they had striven to make a home for the two younger orphan boys Cyril twelve and Bertram six But missus William after a short five years of married life had died and since then the house had known almost nothing of a woman s touch or care Little by little as the years passed the house and its inmates had fallen into what had given Bertram his excuse for the name Cyril thirty years old now dignified reserved averse to cats dogs women and confusion had early taken himself and his music to the peace and exclusiveness of the fourth floor Below him William had long discouraged any meddling with his precious chaos of possessions and had finally come to spend nearly all his spare time among them This left Bertram to undisputed ownership of the second floor and right royally did he hold sway there with his paints and brushes and easels his old armor rich hangings rugs and cushions and everywhere his specialty his Face of a Girl From canvas plaque and panel they looked out those girlish faces winsome wilful pert demure merry sad beautiful even almost ugly they were all there and they were growing famous too The world of art was beginning to take notice and to adjust its spectacles for a more critical glance This Face of a Girl by Henshaw bade fair to be worth while Below Bertram s cheery second floor were the dim old library and drawing rooms silent stately and almost never used and below them were the dining room and the kitchen Here ruled Dong Ling the Chinese cook and Pete Pete was indeed it is hard telling what Pete was He said he was the butler and he looked the part when he answered the bell at the great front door But at other times when he swept a room or dusted Master William s curios he looked like nothing so much as what he was a fussy faithful old man who expected to die in the service he had entered fifty years before as a lad Thus in all the Beacon Street house there had not for years been the touch of a woman s hand Even Kate the married sister had long since given up trying to instruct Dong Ling or to chide Pete though she still walked across the Garden from her Commonwealth Avenue home and tripped up the stairs to call in turn upon her brothers Bertram William and Cyril CHAPTER III THE STRATA WHEN THE LETTER COMES It was on the six o clock delivery that William Henshaw received the letter from his namesake Billy To say the least the letter was a great shock to him He had not quite forgotten Billy s father who had died so long ago it is true but he had forgotten Billy entirely Even as he looked at the disconcerting epistle with its round neatly formed letters he had great difficulty in ferreting out the particular niche in his memory which contained the fact that Walter Neilson had had a child and had named it for him And this child this Billy this unknown progeny of an all but forgotten boyhood friend was asking a home and with him Impossible And William Henshaw peered at the letter as if at this second reading its message could not be so monstrous Well old man what s up It was Bertram s amazed voice from the hall doorway and indeed William Henshaw red faced and plainly trembling seated on the lowest step of the stairway and gazing wild eyed at the letter in his hand was somewhat of an amazing sight What IS up What s up groaned William starting to his feet and waving the letter frantically in the air What s up Young man do you want us to take in a child to board a CHILD he repeated in slow horror Well hardly laughed the other Er perhaps Cyril might like it though eh Come come Bertram be sensible for once pleaded his brother nervously This is serious really serious I tell you What is serious demanded Cyril coming down the stairway Can t it wait Pete has already sounded the gong twice for dinner William made a despairing gesture Well come he groaned I ll tell you at the table It seems I ve got a namesake he resumed in a shaking voice a few moments later Walter Neilson s child And who s Walter Neilson asked Bertram A boyhood friend You wouldn t remember him This letter is from his child Well let s hear it Go ahead I fancy we can stand the LETTER eh Cyril Cyril frowned Cyril did not know perhaps how often he frowned at Bertram The eldest brother wet his lips His hand shook as he picked up the letter It it s so absurd he muttered Then he cleared his throat and read the letter aloud DEAR UNCLE WILLIAM Do you mind my calling you that You see I want SOME one and there isn t any one now You are the nearest I ve got Maybe you ve forgotten but I m named for you Walter Neilson was my father you know My Aunt Ella has just died Would you mind very much if I came to live with you That is between times I m going to college of course and after that I m going to be well I haven t decided that part yet I think I ll consult you You may have some preference you know You can be thinking it up until I come There Maybe I ought not to have said that for perhaps you won t want me to come I AM noisy I ll own but not so I think you ll mind it much unless some of you have nerves or a heart You see Miss Letty and Miss Ann they re mister Harding s sisters and mister Harding is our lawyer and he will write to you Well where was I Oh I know on Miss Letty s nerves And say do you know that is where I do get on Miss Letty s nerves I do truly You see mister Harding very kindly suggested that I live with them but mercy Miss Letty s nerves won t let you walk except on tiptoe and Miss Ann s heart won t let you speak except in whispers All the chairs and tables have worn little sockets in the carpets and it s a crime to move them There isn t a window shade in the house that isn t pulled down EXACTLY to the middle sash except where the sun shines and those are pulled way down Imagine me and Spunk living there Oh by the way you don t mind my bringing Spunk do you I hope you don t for I couldn t live without Spunk and he couldn t live with out me Please let me hear from you very soon I don t mind if you telegraph and just come would be all you d have to say Then I d get ready right away and let you know what train to meet me on And oh say if you ll wear a pink in your buttonhole I will too Then we ll know each other My address is just Hampden Falls Your awfully homesick namesake BILLY HENSHAW NEILSON For one long minute there was a blank silence about the Henshaw dinner table then the eldest brother looking anxiously from one man to the other stammered W well Great Scott breathed Bertram Cyril said nothing but his lips were white with their tense pressure against each other There was another pause and again William broke it anxiously Boys this isn t helping me out any What s to be done Done flamed Cyril Surely you aren t thinking for a moment of LETTING that child come here William Bertram chuckled He WOULD liven things up Cyril wouldn t he Such nice smooth floors you ve got up stairs to trundle little tin carts across Tin nonsense retorted Cyril Don t be silly Bertram That letter wasn t written by a baby He d be much more likely to make himself at home with your paint box or with some of William s junk Oh I say expostulated William we ll HAVE to keep him out of those things you know Cyril pushed back his chair from the table We ll have to keep him out William you can t be in earnest You aren t going to let that boy come here he cried But what can I do faltered the man Do Say no of course As if we wanted a boy to bring up But I must do something I I m all he s got He says so Good heavens Well send him to boarding school then or to the penitentiary anywhere but here Shucks Let the kid come laughed Bertram Poor little homesick devil What s the use I ll take him in How old is he anyhow William frowned and mused aloud slowly Why I don t know He must be er why boys he s no child broke off the man suddenly Walter himself died seventeen or eighteen years ago not more than a year or two after he was married That child must be somewhere around eighteen years old And only think how Cyril WAS worrying about those tin carts laughed Bertram Never mind eight or eighteen let him come If he s that age he won t bother much And this er Spunk do you take him too But probably he doesn t bother either murmured Cyril with smooth sarcasm Gorry I forgot Spunk acknowledged Bertram Say what in time is Spunk do you suppose Dog maybe suggested William Well whatever he is you will kindly keep Spunk down stairs said Cyril with decision The boy I suppose I shall have to endure but the dog Hm m well judging by his name murmured Bertram apologetically it may be just possible that Spunk won t be easily controlled But maybe he isn t a dog anyhow He er sounds something like a parrot to me Cyril rose to his feet abruptly He had eaten almost no dinner Very well he said coldly But please remember that I hold you responsible Bertram Whether it s a dog or a parrot or or a monkey I shall expect you to keep Spunk down stairs This adopting into the family an unknown boy seems to me very absurd from beginning to end But if you and William will have it so of course I ve nothing to say Fortunately my rooms are at the TOP of the house he finished as he turned and left the dining room For a moment there was silence The brows of the younger man were uplifted quizzically I m afraid Cyril is bothered murmured William then in a troubled voice Bertram s face changed Stern lines came to his boyish mouth He is always bothered with anything lately The elder man sighed I know but with his talent Talent Great Scott cut in Bertram Half the world has talent of one sort or another but that doesn t necessarily make them unable to live with any one else Really Will it s becoming serious about Cyril He s getting to be for all the world like those finicky old maids that that young namesake of yours wrote about He ll make us whisper and walk on tiptoe yet The other smiled Don t you worry You aren t in any danger of being kept too quiet young man No thanks to Cyril then retorted Bertram Anyhow that s one reason why I was for taking the kid to mellow up Cyril He needs it all right But I had to take him Bert argued the elder brother his face growing anxious again But Heaven only knows what I m going to do with him when I get him What shall I say to him anyway How shall I write I don t know how to get up a letter of that sort Why not take him at his word and telegraph I fancy you won t have to say come but once before you see him He doesn t seem to be a bashful youth Hm m I might do that acquiesced William slowly But wasn t there somebody a lawyer going to write to me he finished consulting the letter by his plate Yes he added after a moment a mister Harding Wonder if he s any relation to Ned Harding I used to know Ned at Harvard and seems as if he came from Hampden Falls We ll soon see at all events Maybe I ll hear to morrow I shouldn t wonder nodded Bertram as he rose from the table Anyhow I wouldn t do anything till I did hear CHAPTER IV BILLY SENDS A TELEGRAM James Harding s letter very promptly followed Billy s though it was not like Billy s at all It told something of Billy s property and mentioned that according to missus Neilson s will Billy would not come into control of her fortune until the age of twenty one years was reached It dwelt at some length upon the fact of Billy s loneliness in the world and expressed the hope that her father s friend could find it in his heart to welcome the orphan into his home It mentioned Ned and the old college friendship and it closed by saying that the writer James Harding was glad to renew his acquaintance with the good old Henshaw family that he had known long years ago and that he hoped soon to hear from William Henshaw himself It was a good letter but it was not well written James Harding s handwriting was not distinguished for its legibility and his correspondents rejoiced that the most of his letters were dictated to his stenographer In this case however he had elected to use the more personal pen and it was because of this that William Henshaw even after reading the letter was still unaware of his mistake in supposing his namesake Billy to be a boy In the main the lawyer had referred to Billy by name or as the orphan or as that poor lonely child And whenever the more distinctive feminine her or herself had occurred the carelessly formed letters had made them so much like his and himself that they carried no hint of the truth to a man who had not the slightest reason for thinking himself in the wrong It was therefore still for the boy Billy that William Henshaw at once set about making a place in the home First he telegraphed the single word Come to Billy I ll set the poor lad s heart at rest he said to Bertram I shall answer Harding s letter more at length of course Naturally he wants to know something about me now before he sends Billy along but there is no need for the boy to wait before he knows that I ll take him Of course he won t come yet till Harding hears from me It was just here however that William Henshaw met with a surprise for within twenty four hours came Billy s answer and by telegraph I m coming to morrow Train due at five P M BILLY William Henshaw did not know that in Hampden Falls Billy s trunk had been packed for days Billy was desperate The house even with the maid and with the obliging neighbor and his wife who stayed there nights was to Billy nothing but a dismal tomb Lawyer Harding had fallen suddenly ill she could not even tell him that the blessed telegram Come had arrived Hence Billy lonely impulsive and always used to pleasing herself had taken matters in hand with a confident grasp and had determined to wait no longer That it was a fearsomely unknown future to which she was so jauntily pledging herself did not trouble the girl in the least Billy was romantic To sally gaily forth with a pink in the buttonhole of her coat to find her father s friend who was a Billy too seemed to Billy Neilson not only delightful but eminently sensible and an excellent way out of her present homesick loneliness So she bought the pink and her ticket and impatiently awaited the time to start To the Beacon Street house Billy s cheerful telegram brought the direst consternation Even Kate was hastily summoned to the family conclave that immediately resulted There s nothing simply nothing that I can do she declared irritably when she had heard the story Surely you don t expect ME to take the boy No no of course not sighed William But you see I supposed I d have time to to get used to things and to make arrangements and this is so so sudden I hadn t even answered Harding s letter until to day and he hasn t got that much less replied to it But what could you expect after sending that idiotic telegram demanded the lady Come indeed But that s what Billy told me to do What if it was Just because a foolish eighteen year old boy tells you to do something must you a supposedly sensible forty year old man obey I think it tickled Will s romantic streak laughed Bertram It seemed so sort of alluring to send that one word Come out into space and watch what happened Well he s found out certainly observed Cyril with grim satisfaction Oh no it hasn t happened yet corrected Bertram cheerfully It s just going to happen William s got to put on the pink first you know That s the talisman William reddened Bertram don t be foolish I sha n t wear any pink You must know that How ll you find him then Why he ll have one on that s enough settled William Hm m maybe Then he ll have Spunk too murmured Bertram mischievously Spunk cried Kate Yes He wrote that he hoped we wouldn t mind his bringing Spunk with him Who s Spunk We don t know Bertram s lips twitched You don t know What do you mean Well Will thinks it s a dog and I believe Cyril is anticipating a monkey I myself am backing it for a parrot Boys what have you done groaned Kate falling back in her chair What have you done To William her words were like an electric shock stirring him to instant action He sprang abruptly to his feet Well whatever we ve done we ve done it he declared sternly and now we must do the rest and do it well too He s the son of my boyhood s dearest friend and he shall be made welcome Now to business Bertram you said you d take him in Did you mean it Bertram sobered instantly and came erect in his chair William did not often speak like this but when he did Yes Will He shall have the little bedroom at the end of the hall I never used the room much anyhow and what few duds I have there shall be cleared out to morrow Good Now there are some other little details to arrange then I ll go down stairs and tell Pete and Dong Ling And please to understand we re going to make this lad welcome welcome I say Yes sir said Bertram Neither Kate nor Cyril spoke CHAPTER V GETTING READY FOR BILLY The Henshaw household was early astir on the day of Billy s expected arrival and preparations for the guest s comfort were well under way before breakfast The center of activity was in the little room at the end of the hall on the second floor though as Bertram said the whole Strata felt the upheaval By breakfast time Bertram with the avowed intention of giving the little chap half a show had the room cleared for action and after that the whole house was called upon for contributions toward the room s adornment And most generously did most of the house respond Even Dong Ling slippered up stairs and presented a weird Chinese banner which he said he was velly much glad to give As to Pete Pete was in his element Pete loved boys Had he not served them nearly all his life Incidentally it may be mentioned that he did not care for girls Only Cyril held himself aloof But that he was not oblivious of the proceedings below him was evidenced by the somber bass that floated down from his piano strings Cyril always played according to the mood that was on him and when Bertram heard this morning the rhythmic beats of mournfulness he chuckled and said to William That s Chopin s Funeral March Evidently Cy thinks this is the death knell to all his hopes of future peace and happiness Dear me I wish Cyril would take some interest grieved William Oh he takes interest all right laughed Bertram meaningly He takes INTEREST I know but Bertram broke off the elder man anxiously from his perch on the stepladder would you put the rifle over this window or the fishing rod Why I don t think it makes much difference so long as they re somewhere answered Bertram And there are these Indian clubs and the swords to be disposed of you know Yes and it s going to look fine don t you think exulted William And you know for the wall space between the windows I m going to bring down that case of mine of spiders Bertram raised his hands in mock surprise Here down here You re going to trust any of those precious treasures of yours down here William frowned Nonsense Bertram don t be silly They ll be safe enough Besides they re old anyhow I was on spiders years ago when I was Billy s age in fact I thought he d like them here You know boys always like such things Oh twasn t Billy I was worrying about retorted Bertram It was you and the spiders Not much you worry about me or anything else replied William good humoredly There how does that look he finished as he carefully picked his way down the stepladder Fine er only rather warlike maybe with the guns and that riotous confusion of knives and scimitars over the chiffonier But then maybe you re intending Billy for a soldier eh Do you know I AM getting interested in that boy beamed William with some excitement What kind of things do you suppose he does like There s no telling Maybe he s a sissy chap and will howl at your guns and spiders Perhaps he ll prefer autumn leaves and worsted mottoes for decoration Not much he will contested the other No son of Walter Neilson s could be a sissy Neilson was the best half back in ten years at Harvard and he was always in for everything going that was worth while Autumn leaves and worsted mottoes indeed Bah All right but there s still a dark horse in the case you know We mustn t forget Spunk The elder man stirred uneasily Bert what do you suppose that creature is You don t think Cyril can be right and that it s a monkey You never can tell quoted Bertram merrily Of course there ARE other things If it were you now we d only have to hunt up the special thing you happened to be collecting at the time and that would be it a snake a lizard a toad or maybe a butterfly You know you were always lugging those things home when you were his age Yes I know sighed William But I can t think it s anything like that he finished as he turned away There was very little done in the Beacon Street house that day but to get ready for Billy In the kitchen Dong Ling cooked Everywhere else except in Cyril s domain Pete dusted and swept and puttered to his heart s content William did not go to the office at all that day and Bertram did not touch his brushes Only Cyril attended to his usual work practising for a coming concert and correcting the proofs of his new book Music in Russia At ten minutes before five William anxious eyed and nervous found himself at the North Station Then and not till then did he draw a long breath of relief There I think everything s ready he sighed to himself At last He wore no pink in his buttonhole There was no need that he should accede to that silly request he told himself He had only to look for a youth of perhaps eighteen years who would be alone a little frightened possibly and who would have a pink in his buttonhole and probably a dog on a leash As he waited the man was conscious of a curious warmth at his heart It was his namesake Walter Neilson s boy that he had come to meet a homesick lonely orphan who had appealed to him to him out of all the world Long years ago in his own arms there had been laid a tiny bundle of flannel holding a precious little red puckered face But in a month s time the little face had turned cold and waxen and the hopes that the white flannel bundle had carried had died with the baby boy and that baby would have been a lad grown by this time if he had lived a lad not far from the age of this Billy who was coming to day reflected the man And the warmth in his heart deepened and glowed the more as he stood waiting at the gate for Billy to arrive The train from Hampden Falls was late Not until quite fifteen minutes past five did it roll into the train shed Then at once its long line of passengers began to sweep toward the iron gate William was just inside the gate now anxiously scanning every face and form that passed There were many half grown lads but there was not one with a pink in his buttonhole until very near the end Then William saw him a pleasant faced blue eyed boy in a neat gray suit With a low cry William started forward but he saw at once that the gray clad youth was unmistakably one of a merry family party He looked to be anything but a lad that was lonely and forlorn William hesitated and fell back This debonair self reliant fellow could not be Billy But as a hasty glance down the line revealed only half a dozen straggling women and beyond them no one William decided that it must be Billy and taking brave hold of his courage he hurried after the blue eyed youth and tapped him on the shoulder Er aren t you Billy he stammered The lad stopped and stared He shook his head slowly No sir he said But you must be Are you sure The boy laughed this time Sorry sir but my name is Frank isn t it mother he added merrily turning to the lady at his side who was regarding William very unfavorably through a pair of gold bowed spectacles William did not wait for more With a stammered apology and a flustered lifting of his hat he backed away But where was Billy William looked about him in helpless dismay All around was a wide empty space The long aisle to the Hampden Falls train was deserted save for the baggage men loading the trunks and bags on to their trucks Nowhere was there any one who seemed forlorn or ill at ease except a pretty girl with a suit case and with a covered basket on her arm who stood just outside the gate gazing a little nervously about her William looked twice at this girl First because the splash of color against her brown coat had called his attention to the fact that she was wearing a pink and secondly because she was very pretty and her dark eyes carried a peculiarly wistful appeal Too bad Bertram isn t here thought William He d be sketching that face in no time on his cuff The pink had given William almost a pang He had been so longing to see a pink though in a different place He wondered sympathetically if she too had come to meet some one who had not appeared He noticed that she walked away from the gate once or twice toward the waiting room and peered anxiously through the glass doors but always she came back to the gate as if fearful to be long away from that place He forgot all about her very soon for her movements had given him a sudden idea perhaps Billy was in the waiting room How stupid of him not to think of it before Doubtless they had missed each other in the crowd and Billy had gone straight to the waiting room to look for him And with this thought William hurried away at once leaving the girl still standing by the gate alone He looked everywhere Systematically he paced up and down between the long rows of seats looking for a boy with a pink He even went out upon the street and gazed anxiously in all directions It occurred to him after a time that possibly Billy like himself had changed his mind at the last moment and not worn the pink Perhaps he had forgotten it or lost it or even not been able to get it at all Very bitterly William blamed himself then for disregarding his own part of the suggested plan If only he had worn the pink himself but he had not and it was useless to repine In the meantime where was Billy he wondered frantically CHAPTER VI THE COMING OF BILLY After another long search William came back to the train shed vaguely hoping that Billy might even then be there The girl was still standing alone by the gate There was another train on the track now and the rush of many feet had swept her a little to one side She looked frightened now and almost ready to cry Still William noticed that her chin was lifted bravely and that she was making a stern effort at self control He hesitated a moment then went straight toward her I beg your pardon he said kindly lifting his hat but I notice that you have been waiting here some time Perhaps there is something I can do for you A rosy color swept to the girl s face Her eyes lost their frightened appeal and smiled frankly into his Oh thank you sir There IS something you can do for me if you will be so kind You see I can t leave this place I m so afraid he ll come and I ll miss him But I think there s some mistake Could you telephone for me Billy Neilson was country bred and in Hampden Falls all men served all other men and women whether they were strangers or not so to Billy this was not an extraordinary request to make in the least William Henshaw smiled Certainly I shall be very glad to telephone for you Just tell me whom you want and what you want to say Thank you If you ll call up mister William Henshaw then of Beacon Street please and tell him Billy s come I ll wait here Oh then Billy did come cried the man in glad surprise his face alight But where is he Do YOU know Billy I should say I did laughed Billy with the lightness of a long lost child who has found a friend Why I am Billy myself To William Henshaw the world swam dizzily and went suddenly mad The floor rose and the roof fell while cars and people performed impossible acrobatic feats above below and around him Then from afar off he heard his own voice stammer You are B Billy Yes and I ll wait here if you ll just tell him please He s expecting me you know so it s all right only perhaps he made a mistake in the time Maybe you know him anyhow With one mighty effort William Henshaw pulled himself sharply together He even laughed and tossed his head in a valiant imitation of Billy herself but his voice shook Know him I should say I did he cried Why I am William Henshaw myself You Uncle William Why where s your pink The man s face was already so red it could not get any redder but it tried to do so Why er I it er if you ll just come into the waiting room a minute my dear he stuttered miserably I I ll explain about that I shall have to leave you for a minute he plunged on frenziedly as he led the way to a seat A matter of business that I must attend to I ll be right back Wait here please And he almost pushed the girl into a seat and hurried away At a safe distance William Henshaw turned and looked back His knees were shaking and his fingers had grown cold at their tips He could see her plainly as she bent over the basket in her lap He could see even the pretty curve of her cheek and of her slender throat when she lifted her head And that was Billy a GIRL People near him at that moment saw a flushed faced nervous appearing man throw up his hands with a despairing gesture roll his eyes heavenward and then plunge into the nearest telephone booth In due time William Henshaw had his brother Bertram at the other end of the wire Bertram he called shakily Hullo Will that you What s the matter You re late Didn t he come Come groaned William Good Lord Bertram Billy s a GIRL A wh what A girl A GIRL Yes yes Don t stand there repeating what I say in that idiotic fashion Bertram Do something do something Do something gasped Bertram Great Scott Will If you want me to do something don t knock me silly with a blow like that Now what did you say I said that Billy is a girl Can t you get that demanded William despairingly Well by Jove breathed Bertram Come come think What shall we do Why bring her home of course Home home chattered William Do you think we five men can bring up a distractingly pretty eighteen year old girl with curly cheeks and pink hair With wha at No no I mean curly hair and pink cheeks Bertram do be sensible begged the man This is serious Serious I should say it was Only fancy what Cy will say A girl Holy smoke Tote her along I want to see her But I say we can t keep her there with us Bertram Don t you see we can t Then take her to Kate s or to to one of those Young Women s Christian Union things No no I can t do that That s impossible Don t you understand She s expecting to go home with me HOME I m her Uncle William Lucky Uncle William Be still Bertram Well doesn t she know your mistake that you thought she was a boy Heaven forbid I hope not cried the man fervently I most let it out once but I think she didn t notice it You see we we were both surprised Well I should say And Bertram I can t turn her out I can t I tell you Only fancy my going to her now and saying If you please Billy you can t live at my house after all I thought you were a boy you know Great Scott Bert if she d once turned those big brown eyes of hers on you as she has on me you d see I d be delighted I m sure sung a merry voice across the wires Sounds real interesting Bertram can t you be serious and help me out But what CAN we do I don t know We ll have to think but for now get Kate Telephone her Tell her to come right straight over and that she s got to stay all night All night Of course Billy s got to have a chaperon hasn t she Now hurry We shall be up right away Kate s got company Never mind leave em Tell her she s got to leave em And tell Cyril of course what to expect And look a here you two behave now None of your nonsense Now mind I m not going to have this child tormented I won t bat an eyelid on my word I won t chuckled Bertram But oh I say Will Yes What s Spunk Eh oh Great Scott I forgot Spunk I don t know She s got a basket He s in that I suppose Anyhow he can t be any more of a bombshell than his mistress was Now be quick and none of your fooling Bertram Tell them all Pete and Dong Ling Don t forget I wouldn t have Billy find out for the world Fix it up with Kate You ll have to fix it up with her that s all And there came the sharp click of the receiver against the hook CHAPTER VII INTRODUCING SPUNK In the soft April twilight Cyril was playing a dreamy waltz when Bertram knocked and pushed open the door Say old chap you ll have to quit your mooning this time and sit up and take notice What do you mean Cyril stopped playing and turned abruptly I mean that Will has gone crazy and I think the rest of us are going to follow suit Cyril shrugged his shoulders and whirled about on the piano stool In a moment his fingers had slid once more into the dreamy waltz When you get ready to talk sense I ll listen he said coldly Oh very well if you really want it broken gently it s this Will has met Billy and Billy is a girl They re due here now most any time The music stopped with a crash A GIRL Yes a girl Oh I ve been all through that and I know how you feel But as near as I can make out it s really so I ve had instructions to tell everybody and I ve told I got Kate on the telephone and she s coming over You KNOW what SHE LL be Dong Ling is having what I suppose are Chinese hysterics in the kitchen and Pete is swinging back and forth like a pendulum in the dining room moaning Good Lord deliver us at every breath I would suggest that you follow me down stairs so that we may be decently ready for whatever comes And he turned about and stalked out of the room followed by Cyril who was too stunned to open his lips Kate came first She was not stunned She had a great deal to say Really this is a little the most absurd thing I ever heard of she fumed What in the world does your brother mean That she quite ignored her own relationship to the culprit was not lost on Bertram He made instant response As near as I can make out he replied smoothly YOUR brother has fallen under the sway of a pair of great dark eyes two pink cheeks and an unknown quantity of curly hair all of which in its entirety is his namesake is lonesome and is in need of a home But she can t live here Will says she shall But that is utter nonsense cut in Cyril For once I agree with you Cyril laughed Bertram but William doesn t But how can she do it demanded Kate Don t know answered Bertram He s established a petticoat propriety in you for a few hours at least Meanwhile he s going to think At least he says he is and that we ve got to help him Humph snapped Kate Well I can prophesy we sha n t think alike so you d notice it I know that nodded Bertram and I m with you and Cyril on this The whole thing is absurd The idea of thrusting a silly eighteen year old girl here into our lives in this fashion But you know what Will is when he s really roused You might as well try to move a nice good natured mountain by saying please as to try to stir him under certain circumstances Most of the time I ll own we can twist him around our little fingers But not now You ll see In the first place she s the daughter of his dead friend and she DID write a pathetic little letter It got to the inside of me anyhow when I thought she was a boy A boy Who wouldn t think she was a boy interposed Cyril Billy indeed Can you tell me what for any sane man should have named a girl Billy For William your brother evidently retorted Bertram dryly Anyhow he did it and of course our mistake was a very natural one The dickens of it is now that we ve got to keep it from her so Will says and how hush here they are he broke off as there came the sound of wheels stopping before the house There followed the click of a key in the lock and the opening of a heavy door then full in the glare of the electric lights stood a plainly nervous man and a girl with startled appealing eyes My dear stammered William this is my sister Kate missus Hartwell and here are Cyril and Bertram whom I ve told you of And of course I don t need to say to them that you are Billy It was over William drew a long breath and gave an agonized look into his brothers eyes Then Billy turned from missus Hartwell and held out a cordial hand to each of the men in turn Oh you don t know how lovely this is to me she cried softly And to think that you were willing I should come The two younger men caught their breath sharply and tried not to see each other s eyes You look so good all of you and I don t believe there s one of you that s got nerves or a heart she laughed Bertram rallied his wits to respond to the challenge No heart Miss Billy Now isn t that just a bit hard on us right at first Not a mite if you take it the way I mean it dimpled Billy Hearts that are all right just keep on pumping and you never know they are there They aren t worth mentioning It s the other kind the kind that flutters at the least noise and jumps at the least bang And I don t believe any of you mind noises and bangs she finished merrily as she handed her hat and coat to missus Hartwell who was waiting to receive them Bertram laughed Cyril scowled and occupied himself in finding a chair William had already dropped himself wearily on to the sofa near his sister Billy still continued to talk Now when Spunk and I get to training oh and you haven t seen Spunk she interrupted herself suddenly Why the introductions aren t half over Where is he Uncle William the basket I I put it in in the hall mumbled William starting to rise No no I ll get him cried Billy hurrying from the room She returned in a moment the green covered basket in her hand He s been asleep I guess He s slept most all the way down anyhow He s so used to being toted round in this basket that he doesn t mind it a bit I take him everywhere in it at the Falls There was an electric pause Four pairs of startled questioning fearful eyes were on the basket while Billy fumbled at the knot of the string The next moment with a triumphant flourish Billy lifted from the basket and placed on the floor a very small gray kitten with a very large pink bow There ladies and gentlemen may I present to you Spunk The tiny creature winked and blinked and balanced for a moment on sleepy legs then at the uncontrollable shout that burst from Bertram s throat he faced the man humped his tiny back bristled his diminutive tail to almost unbelievable fluffiness and spit wrathfully And so that is Spunk choked Bertram Yes said Billy This is Spunk CHAPTER VIII THE ROOM AND BILLY For the first fifteen minutes after Billy s arrival conversation was a fitful thing made up mostly of a merry monologue on the part of Billy herself interspersed with somewhat dazed replies from one after another of her auditors as she talked to them in turn No one thought to ask if she cared to go up to her room and during the entire fifteen minutes Billy sat on the floor with Spunk in her lap She was still there when the funereal face of Pete appeared in the doorway Pete s jaw dropped It was plain that only the sternest self control enabled him to announce dinner with anything like dignity But he managed to stammer out the words and then turn loftily away Bertram who sat near the door however saw him raise his hands in horror as he plunged through the hall and down the stairway With a motion to Bertram to lead the way with Billy William frenziedly gripped his sister s arm and hissed in her ear for all the world like a villain in melodrama Listen You ll sleep in Bert s room to night and Bert will come up stairs with me Get Billy to bed as soon as you can after dinner and then come back down to us We ve got to plan what s got to be done Sh h And he dragged his sister downstairs In the dining room there was a slight commotion Billy stood at her chair with Spunk in her arms Before her Pete was standing dumbly staring into her eyes At last he stammered Ma am A chair please I said for Spunk you know Spunk always sits at the table right next to me It was too much for Bertram He fled chokingly to the hall William dropped weakly into his own place Cyril stared as had Pete but missus Hartwell spoke You don t mean that that cat has a chair at the table she gasped Yes and isn t it cute of him beamed Billy entirely misconstruing the surprise in the lady s voice His mother always sat at table with us and behaved beautifully too Of course Spunk is little and makes mistakes sometimes But he ll learn Oh there s a chair right here she added as she spied Bertram s childhood s high chair which for long years had stood unused in the corner I ll just squeeze it right in here she finished gleefully making room for the chair at her side When Bertram a little red of face but very grave entered the dining room a moment later he found the family seated with Spunk snugly placed between Billy and a plainly disgusted and dismayed brother Cyril The kitten was alert and interested but he had settled back in his chair and was looking as absurdly dignified as the flaring pink bow would let him Isn t he a dear Billy was saying But Bertram noticed that there was no reply to this question It was a peculiar dinner party Only Billy did not feel the strain Even Spunk was not entirely happy his efforts to investigate the table and its contents were too frequently curbed by his mistress for his unalloyed satisfaction William it is true made a valiant attempt to cause the conversation to be general but he failed dismally Kate was sternly silent while Cyril was openly repellent Bertram talked indeed but Bertram always talked and very soon he and Billy had things pretty much to themselves that is with occasional interruptions caused by Spunk Spunk had an inquisitive nose or paw for each new dish placed before his mistress and Billy spent much time admonishing him Billy said she was training him that it was wonderful what training would do and of course Spunk WAS little now Dinner was half over when there was a slight diversion created by Spunk s conclusion to get acquainted with the silent man at his left Cyril however did not respond to Spunk s advances So very evident indeed was the man s aversion that Billy turned in amazement Why mister Cyril don t you see Spunk is trying to say How do you do Very likely but I m not fond of cats Miss Billy You re not fond of cats repeated the girl as if she could not have heard aright Why not Cyril changed his position Why just because I I m not he retorted lamely Isn t there anything that that you don t like Billy considered Why not that I know of she began after a moment only rainy days and tripe And Spunk isn t a bit like those Bertram chuckled and even Cyril smiled though unwillingly All the same he reiterated I don t like cats Oh I m so sorry lamented Billy and at the grieved hurt in her dark eyes Bertram came promptly to the rescue Never mind Miss Billy Cyril is only ONE of us and there is all the rest of the Strata besides The what The Strata You don t know of course but listen and I ll tell you And he launched gaily forth into his favorite story Billy was duly amused and interested She laughed and clapped her hands and when the story was done she clapped them again Oh what a funny house And how perfectly lovely that I m going to live in it she cried Then straight at missus Hartwell she hurled a bombshell But where is your stratum she demanded mister Bertram didn t mention a thing about you Cyril said a sharp word under his breath Bertram choked over a cough Kate threw into William s eyes a look that was at once angry accusing and despairing Then William spoke Er she it isn t anywhere my dear he stammered or rather it isn t here Kate lives up on the Avenue you see and is only here for for a day or two just now Oh murmured Billy And there was not one in the room at that moment who did not bless Spunk for Spunk suddenly leaped to the table before him and in the ensuing confusion his mistress quite forgot to question further concerning missus Hartwell s stratum Dinner over the three men with their sister and Billy trailed up stairs to the drawing rooms Billy told them then of her life at Hampden Falls She cried a little at the mention of Aunt Ella and she portrayed very vividly the lonely life from which she herself had so gladly escaped She soon had every one laughing even Cyril over her stories of the lawyer s home that might have been hers with its gloom and its hush and its socketed chairs As soon as possible however missus Hartwell with a murmured I know you must be tired Billy suggested that the girl go up stairs to her room Come she added I will show you the way There was some delay even then for Spunk had to be provided with sleeping quarters and it was not without some hesitation that Billy finally placed the kitten in the reluctant hands of Pete who had been hastily summoned Then she turned and followed missus Hartwell up stairs It seemed to the three men in the drawing room that almost immediately came the piercing shriek and the excited voice of their sister in expostulation Without waiting for more they leaped to the stairway and hurried up two steps at a time For heaven s sake Kate what is it panted William who had been outdistanced by his more agile brothers Kate was on her feet her face the picture of distressed amazement In the low chair by the window Billy sat where she had flung herself her hands over her face Her shoulders were shaking and from her throat came choking little cries I don t know quavered Kate I haven t the least idea She was all right till she got up stairs here and I turned on the lights Then she gave one shriek and you know all I know William advanced hurriedly Billy what is the matter What are you crying for he demanded Billy dropped her hands then and they saw her face She was not crying She was laughing She was laughing so she could scarcely speak Oh you did you did she gurgled I thought you did and now I know Did what What do you mean William s usually gentle voice was sharp Even William s nerves were beginning to feel the strain of the last few hours Thought I was a b boy choked Billy You called me he once in the station I thought you did but I wasn t sure not till I saw this room But now I know I know And off she went into another hysterical gale of laughter Billy s nerves too were beginning to respond to the excitement of the last few hours As to the three men and the woman they stood silent helpless looking into each other s faces with despairing eyes In a moment Billy was on her feet fluttering about the room touching this thing looking at that Nothing escaped her I m to fish and shoot and fence she crowed And oh look at those knives U ugh And my what are these she cried pouncing on the Indian clubs And look at the spiders Dear dear I AM glad they re dead anyhow she shuddered with a nervous laugh that was almost a sob Something in Billy s voice stirred missus Hartwell to sudden action Come come this will never do she protested authoritatively motioning her brothers to leave the room Billy is quite tired out and needs rest She mustn t talk another bit to night Of c course not stammered William And only too glad of an excuse to withdraw from a very embarrassing situation the three men called back a faltering good night and precipitately fled down stairs CHAPTER IX A FAMILY CONCLAVE Well William greeted Kate grimly when she came into the drawing room after putting her charge to bed have you had enough now Enough What do you mean Kate raised her eyebrows Why surely you re not thinking NOW that you can keep this girl here are you I don t know why not William Well where shall she go Will you take her I Certainly not declared Kate with decision I m sure I see no reason why I should No more do I see why William should either cut in Cyril Oh come what s the use interposed Bertram Let her stay She s a nice little thing I m sure Cyril and Kate turned sharply Bertram The cry was a duet of angry amazement Then Kate added It seems that you too have come under the sway of dark eyes pink cheeks and an unknown quantity of curly hair Bertram laughed Oh well she would be nice to er paint he murmured See here children demurred William a little sternly all this is wasting time There is no way out of it I wouldn t be seen turning that homeless child away now We must keep her that s settled The question is how shall it be done We must have some woman friend here to be her companion of course but whom shall we get Kate sighed and looked her dismay Bertram threw a glance into Cyril s eyes and made an expressive gesture You see it seemed to say I told you how it would be Now whom shall we get questioned William again We must think Unattached gentlewomen of suitable age and desirable temper did not prove to be so numerous among the Henshaws acquaintances however as to make the selection of a chaperon very easy Several were thought of and suggested but in each case the candidate was found to possess one or more characteristics that made the idea of her presence utterly abhorrent to some one of the brothers At last William expostulated See here boys we aren t any nearer a settlement than we were in the first place There isn t any woman of course who would exactly suit all of us and so we shall just have to be willing to take some one who doesn t The trouble is explained Bertram airily we want some one who will be invisible to every one except the world and Billy and who will be inaudible always I don t know but you are right sighed William But suppose we settle on Aunt Hannah She seems to be the least objectionable of the lot and I think she d come She s alone in the world and I believe the comfortable roominess of this house would be very grateful to her after the inconvenience of her stuffy little room over at the Back Bay You bet it would murmured Bertram feelingly but William did not appear to hear him She s amiable fairly sensible and always a lady he went on and to morrow morning I believe I ll run over and see if she can t come right away And may I ask which er stratum she they will occupy smiled Bertram You may ask but I m afraid you won t find out very soon retorted William dryly if we take as long to decide that matter as we have the rest of it Er Cyril has the most UNOCCUPIED space volunteered Bertram cheerfully Indeed retaliated Cyril Suppose you let me speak for myself Of course so far as truck is concerned I m not in it with you and Will But as for the USE I put my rooms to Besides I already have Pete there and would have Dong Ling probably if he slept here However if you want any of my rooms don t let my petty wants and wishes interfere No no interrupted William in quick conciliation We don t want your rooms Cyril Aunt Hannah abhors stairs Of course I might move I suppose My rooms are one flight less but if I only didn t have so many things Oh you men shrugged Kate wearily Why don t you ask my opinion sometimes It seems to me that in this case a woman s wit might be of some help All right go ahead nodded William Kate leaned forward eagerly Kate loved to manage Go easy now cautioned Bertram warily You know a strata even one as solid as ours won t stand too much of an earthquake It isn t an earthquake at all sniffed Kate It s a very sensible move all around Here are these two great drawing rooms the library and the little reception room across the hall and not one of them is ever used but this Of course the women wouldn t like to sleep down here but why don t you Bertram take the back drawing room the library and the little reception room for yours and leave the whole of the second floor for Billy and Aunt Hannah Good for you Kate cried Bertram appreciatively You ve hit it square on the head and we ll do it I ll move to morrow The light down here is just as good as it is up stairs if you let it in Thank you Bertram and you too Kate breathed William fervently Now if you don t mind I believe I ll go to bed I am tired CHAPTER X AUNT HANNAH As soon as possible after breakfast William went to see Aunt Hannah Hannah Stetson was not really William s aunt though she had been called Aunt Hannah for years She was the widow of a distant cousin and she lived in a snug little room in a Back Bay boarding house She was a slender white haired woman with kind blue eyes and a lovable smile Her cheeks were still faintly pink and her fine silver white hair broke into little kinks and curls about her ears According to Bertram she always made one think of lavender and old lace She welcomed William cordially this morning though with faint surprise in her eyes Yes I know I m an early caller and an unexpected one began William hurriedly And I shall have to plunge straight into the matter too for there isn t time to preamble I ve taken an eighteen year old girl to bring up Aunt Hannah and I want you to come down and live with us to chaperon her My grief and conscience WILLIAM gasped the little woman agitatedly Yes yes I know Aunt Hannah everything you would say if you could But please skip the hysterics We ve all had them and Kate has already used every possible adjective that you could think up Now it s just this And he hurriedly gave missus Stetson a full account of the case and told her plainly what he hoped and expected that she would do for him Why yes of course I ll come acquiesced the lady a little breathlessly if if you are sure you re going to keep her Good And remember I said now please that I wanted you to come right away to day Of course Kate can t stay Just get in half a dozen women to help you pack and come Half a dozen women in that little room William impossible Well I only meant to get enough so you could come right off this morning But I don t need them William There are only my clothes and books and such things You know it is a FURNISHED room All right all right Aunt Hannah I wanted to make sure you hurried that s all You see I don t want Billy to suspect just how much she s upsetting us I ve asked Kate to take her over to her house for the day while Bertram is moving down stairs and while we re getting you settled I I think you ll like it there Aunt Hannah added William anxiously Of course Billy s got Spunk but he hesitated and smiled a little Got what faltered the other Spunk Oh I don t mean THAT kind laughed William in answer to the dismayed expression on his aunt s face Spunk is a cat A cat but such a name William I I think we ll change that Eh Oh you do murmured William with a curious smile Very well be that as it may Anyhow you re coming and we shall want you all settled by dinner time he finished as he picked up his hat to go With Kate Billy spent the long day very contentedly in Kate s beautiful Commonwealth Avenue home The two boys Paul twelve years old and Egbert eight were a little shy it is true and not really of much use as companions but there was a little Kate four years old who proved to be wonderfully entertaining Billy was not much used to children and she found this four year old atom of humanity to be a great source of interest and amusement She even told missus Hartwell at parting that little Kate was almost as nice as Spunk which remark oddly enough did not appear to please missus Hartwell to the extent that Billy thought that it would At the Beacon Street house Billy was presented at once to missus Stetson And you are to call me Aunt Hannah my dear said the little woman graciously just as the boys do Thank you dimpled Billy and you don t know Aunt Hannah how good it seems to me to come into so many relatives all at once Upon going up stairs Billy found her room somewhat changed It was far less warlike and the case of spiders had been taken away And this will be your stratum you know announced Bertram from the stairway yours and Aunt Hannah s You re to have this whole floor Will and Cyril are above and I m down stairs You are Why I thought you were here Billy s face was puzzled Here Oh well I did have some things here he retorted airily but I took them all away to day You see my stratum is down stairs and it doesn t do to mix the layers By the way you haven t been up stairs yet have you Come on and I ll show you and you too Aunt Hannah Billy clapped her hands but Aunt Hannah shook her head I ll leave that for younger feet than mine she said adding whimsically It s best sometimes that one doesn t try to step too far off one s own level you know All right laughed the man Come on Miss Billy On the door at the head of the stairs he tapped twice lightly Well Pete called Cyril s voice none too cordially Pete indeed scoffed Bertram You ve got company young man Open the door Miss Billy is viewing the Strata The bare floor echoed to a quick tread then the door opened and Cyril faced them with a forced smile on his lips Come in though I fear there will be little to see he said Bertram assumed a pompous attitude Ladies and gentlemen you behold here the lion in his lair Be still Bertram ordered Cyril He is a lion really confided Bertram in a lower voice but as he prefers it we ll just call him the Musical Man I should think I was some sort of music box that turned with a crank bristled Cyril Bertram grinned A CRANK did you say Well even I wouldn t have quite dared to say that you know With an impatient gesture Cyril turned on his heel Bertram fell once more into his pompous attitude Before you is the Man s workshop he orated At your right you see his instruments of tor I mean his instruments a piano flute et cetera At your left is the desk with its pens paper erasers ink and postage stamps I mention these because there are er so few things to mention here Beyond through the open door one may catch glimpses of still other rooms but they hold even less than this one holds Tradition doth assert however that in one is a couch bed and in another two chairs Billy listened silently Her eyes were questioning She was not quite sure how to take Bertram s words and the bare rooms and their stern faced master filled her with a vague pity But the pause that followed Bertram s nonsense seemed to be waiting for her to fill it Oh I should like to hear you play mister Cyril she stammered Then gathering courage CAN you play The Maiden s Prayer Bertram gave a cough a spasmodic cough that sent him red faced out into the hall From there he called Can t stop for the animals to perform Miss Billy It s most dinner time and we ve got lots to see yet All right but sometime nodded Billy over her shoulder to Cyril as she turned away I just love that Maiden s Prayer Now this is William s stratum announced Bertram at the foot of the stairs You will perceive that there is no knocking here William s doors are always open By all means Come in come in called William s cheery voice Oh my what a lot of things exclaimed Billy My my what a lot of things How Spunk will like this room Bertram chuckled then he made a great display of drawing a long breath In the short time at our disposal he began loftily it will be impossible to point out each particular article and give its history from the beginning but somewhere you will find four round white stones which Er yes we know all about those white stones interrupted William and you ll please let me talk about my own things myself And he beamed benevolently on the wondering eyed girl at Bertram s side But there are so many breathed Billy All the more chance then smiled William that somewhere among them you ll find something to interest you Now these Chinese ceramics and these bronzes maybe you d like those he suggested And with a resigned sigh and an exaggerated air of submission Bertram stepped back and gave way to his brother And there are these miniatures and these Japanese porcelains Or perhaps you d like stamps or theatre programs better William finished anxiously Billy did not reply She was turning round and round her eyes wide and amazed Suddenly she pounced on a beautifully decorated teapot and held it up in admiring hands Oh what a pretty teapot And what a cute little plate it sets in she cried The collector fairly bubbled over with joy That s a Lowestoft a real Lowestoft he crowed Not that hard paste stuff from the Orient that s CALLED Lowestoft but the real thing English you know And that s the tray that goes with it too Wonderful how I got them both You know they most always get separated I paid a cool hundred for them anyhow A hundred dollars for a teapot gasped Billy Yes and here s a nice little piece of lustre ware Pretty isn t it And there s a fine bit of black basalt And Er Will interposed Bertram meekly Oh and here s a Castleford cried William paying no attention to the interruption Marked too see D D company Castleford You know there isn t much of that ware marked This is a beauty too I think You see this pitted surface they made that with tiny little points set into the inner side of the mold The design stands out fine on this It s one of the best I ever saw And oh Er William interposed Bertram again a little louder this time May I just say And did you notice this Old Blue hurried on William eagerly Lid sets down in you see that s older than the kind where it sets over the top Now here s one William almost shouted Bertram DINNER IS READY Pete has sounded the gong twice already Eh Oh sure enough sure enough acknowledged William with a regretful glance at his treasures Well we must go we must go But I haven t seen your stratum at all demurred Billy to her guide as they went down the stairway Then there s something left for to morrow promised Bertram but you must remember I haven t got any beautiful Old Blues and black basalts to say nothing of stamps and baggage tags But I ll make you some tea some real tea and that s more than William has done with all his hundred and one teapots CHAPTER XI BERTRAM HAS VISITORS Spunk did not change his name but that was perhaps the only thing that did not meet with some sort of change during the weeks that immediately followed Billy s arrival Given a house five men and an ironbound routine of life and it is scarcely necessary to say that the advent of a somewhat fussy elderly woman an impulsive young girl and a very much alive small cat will make some difference As to Spunk s name it was not missus Stetson s fault that even that was left undisturbed missus Stetson early became acquainted with Spunk She was introduced to him indeed on the night of her arrival though fortunately not at table William had seen to it that Spunk did not appear at dinner though to accomplish this the man had been obliged to face the amazed and grieved indignation of the kitten s mistress But I don t see how any one CAN object to a nice clean little cat at the table Billy had remonstrated tearfully I know but er they do sometimes William had stammered and this is one of the times Aunt Hannah would never stand for it never Oh but she doesn t know Spunk Billy had observed then hopefully You just wait until she knows him missus Stetson began to know Spunk the next day The immediate source of her knowledge was the discovery that Spunk had found her ball of black knitting yarn and had delightedly captured it Not that he was content to let it remain where it was indeed no He rolled it down the stairs batted it through the hall to the drawing room and then proceeded to chasse with it in and out among the legs of various chairs and tables ending in one grand whirl that wound the yarn round and round his small body and keeled him over half upon his back There he blissfully went to sleep Billy found him after a gleeful following of the slender woollen trail missus Stetson was with her but she was not gleeful Oh Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah gurgled Billy isn t he just too cute for anything Aunt Hannah shook her head I must confess I don t see it she declared My dear just look at that hopeless snarl Oh but it isn t hopeless at all laughed Billy It s like one of those strings they unwind at parties with a present at the end of it And Spunk is the present she added when she had extricated the small gray cat And you shall hold him she finished graciously entrusting the sleepy kitten to missus Stetson s unwilling arms But I it I can t Billy I don t like that name blurted out the indignant little lady with as much warmth as she ever allowed herself to show It must be changed to to Thomas Changed Spunk s name changed demanded Billy in a horrified voice Why Aunt Hannah it can t be changed it s HIS you know Then she laughed merrily Thomas indeed Why you old dear just suppose I should ask YOU to change your name Now I like Helen Clarabella lots better than Hannah but I m not going to ask you to change that and I m going to love you just as well even if you are Hannah see if I don t And you ll love Spunk too I m sure you will Now watch me find the end of this snarl And she danced over to the dumbfounded little lady in the big chair gave her an affectionate kiss and then attacked the tangled mass of black with skilful fingers But I you oh my grief and conscience finished the little woman whose name was not Helen Clarabella Oh my grief and conscience according to Bertram was Aunt Hannah s deadliest swear word In Aunt Hannah s black silk lap Spunk stretched luxuriously and blinked sleepy eyes then with a long purr of content he curled himself for another nap still Spunk It was some time after luncheon that day that Bertram heard a knock at his studio door Bertram was busy His particular pet Face of a Girl was to be submitted soon to the judges of a forthcoming Art Exhibition and it was not yet finished He was trying to make up now for the many hours lost during the last few days and even Bertram at times did not like interruptions His model had gone but he was still working rapidly when the knock came His tone was not quite cordial when he answered Well It s I Spunk and I May we come in called a confident voice Bertram said a sharp word behind his teeth but he opened the door Of course I was painting he announced How lovely And I ll watch you Oh my what a pretty room I m glad you like it Indeed I do I like it ever so much I shall stay here lots I know Oh you will For once even Bertram s ready tongue failed to find fitting response Yes Now paint I want to see you Aunt Hannah has gone out anyway and I m lonesome I think I ll stay But I can t that is I m not used to spectators Of course you aren t you poor old lonesomeness But it isn t going to be that way any more you know now that I ve come I sha n t let you be lonesome I could swear to that declared the man with sudden fervor and for Billy s peace of mind it was just as well perhaps that she did not know the exact source of that fervency Now paint commanded Billy again Because he did not know what else to do Bertram picked up a brush but he did not paint The first stroke of his brush against the canvas was to Spunk a challenge and Spunk never refused a challenge With a bound he was on Bertram s knee gleeful paw outstretched batting at the end of the brush Tut tut no no naughty Spunk Say but wasn t that cute chuckled Billy Do it again The artist gave an exasperated sigh My dear girl he protested cruel as it may seem to you this picture is not a kindergarten game for the edification of small cats I must politely ask Spunk to desist But he won t laughed Billy Never mind we will take it some day when he s asleep Let s not paint any more anyhow I ve come to see your rooms And she sprang blithely to her feet Dear dear what a lot of faces and all girls too How funny Why don t you paint other things Still they are rather nice Thank you accepted Bertram dryly Bertram did not paint any more that afternoon Billy found much to interest her and she asked numberless questions She was greatly excited when she understood the full significance of the omnipresent Face of a Girl and she graciously offered to pose herself for the artist She spent indeed quite half an hour turning her head from side to side and demanding Now how s that and that Tiring at last of this she suggested Spunk as a substitute remarking that after all cats pretty cats like Spunk were even nicer to paint than girls She rescued Spunk then from the paint box where he had been holding high carnival with Bertram s tubes of paint and demanded if Bertram ever saw a more delightful more entrancing more altogether to be desired model She was so artless so merry so frankly charmed with it all that Bertram could not find it in his heart to be angry notwithstanding his annoyance But when at four o clock she took herself and her cat cheerily up stairs he lifted his hands in despair Great Scott he groaned If this is a sample of what s coming I m GOING that s all CHAPTER XII CYRIL TAKES HIS TURN Billy had been a member of the Beacon Street household a week before she repeated her visit to Cyril at the top of the house This time Bertram was not with her She went alone Even Spunk was left behind Billy remembered her prospective host s aversion to cats Billy did not feel that she knew Cyril very well She had tried several times to chat with him but she had made so little headway that she finally came to the conclusion privately expressed to Bertram that mister Cyril was bashful Bertram had only laughed He had laughed the harder because at that moment he could hear Cyril pounding out his angry annoyance on the piano upstairs Cyril had just escaped from one of Billy s most determined attempts and Bertram knew it Bertram s laugh had puzzled Billy and it had not quite pleased her Hence to day she did not tell him of her plan to go up stairs and see what she could do herself alone to combat this foolish bashfulness on the part of mister Cyril Henshaw In spite of her bravery Billy waited quite one whole minute at the top of the stairs before she had the courage to knock at Cyril s door The door was opened at once Why Billy cried the man in surprise Yes it s Billy I I came up to to get acquainted she smiled winningly Why er you are very kind Will you come in Thank you yes You see I didn t bring Spunk I remembered Cyril bowed gravely You are very kind again he said Billy fidgeted in her chair To her mind she was not getting on at all She determined on a bold stroke You see I thought if if I should come up here where there wouldn t be so many around we might get acquainted she confided then I would get to like you just as well as I do the others At the odd look that came into the man s face the girl realized suddenly what she had said Her cheeks flushed a confused red Oh dear That is I mean I like you of course she floundered miserably then she broke off with a frank laugh There you see I never could get out of anything I might as well own right up I DON T like you as well as I do Uncle William and mister Bertram So there Cyril laughed For the first time since he had seen Billy something that was very like interest came into his eyes Oh you don t he retorted Now that is er very UNkind of you Billy shook her head You don t say that as if you meant it she accused him her eyes gravely studying his face Now I M in earnest I really want to like YOU Thank you Then perhaps you won t mind telling me why you don t like me he suggested Again Billy flushed Why I I just don t that s all she faltered Then she cried aggrievedly There now you ve made me be impolite and I didn t mean to be truly Of course not assented the man and it wasn t impolite because I asked you for the information you know I may conclude then he went on with an odd twinkle in his eyes that I am merely classed with tripe and rainy days With wha at Tripe and rainy days Those are the only things if I remember rightly that you don t like The girl stared then she chuckled There I knew I d like you better if you d only SAY something she beamed But let s not talk any more about that Play to me won t you You know you promised me The Maiden s Prayer Cyril stiffened Pardon me but you must be mistaken he replied coldly I do not play The Maiden s Prayer Oh what a shame And I do so love it But you play other things I ve heard you a little and mister Bertram says you do in concerts and things Does he murmured Cyril with a slight lifting of his eyebrows There Now off you go again all silent and horrid chaffed Billy What have I said now mister Cyril do you know what I think I believe you ve got NERVES Billy s voice was so tragic that the man could but laugh Perhaps I have Miss Billy Like Miss Letty s I m not acquainted with the lady Gee wouldn t you two make a pair chuckled Billy unexpectedly No but really I mean do you want people to walk on tiptoe and speak in whispers Sometimes perhaps The girl sprang to her feet but she sighed Then I m going This might be one of the times you know She hesitated then walked to the piano My wouldn t I like to play on that she breathed Cyril shuddered Cyril could imagine what Billy would play and Cyril did not like rag time nor The Storm Oh do you play he asked constrainedly Billy shook her head Not much Only little bits of things you know she said wistfully as she turned toward the door For some minutes after she had gone Cyril stood where she had left him his eyes moody and troubled I suppose I might have played something he muttered at last but The Maiden s Prayer good heavens Billy was a little shy with Cyril when he came down to dinner that night For the next few days indeed she held herself very obviously aloof from him Cyril caught himself wondering once if she were afraid of his nerves He did not try to find out however he was too emphatically content that of her own accord she seemed to be leaving him in peace It must have been a week after Billy s visit to the top of the house that Cyril stopped his playing very abruptly one day and opened his door to go down stairs At the first step he started back in amazement Why Billy he ejaculated The girl was sitting very near the top of the stairway At his appearance she got to her feet shamefacedly Why Billy what in the world are you doing there Listening Listening Yes Do you mind The man did not answer He was too surprised to find words at once and he was trying to recollect what he had been playing You see listening to music this way isn t like listening to to talking hurried on Billy feverishly It isn t sneaking like that is it Why no And you don t mind Why surely I ought not to mind that he admitted Then I can keep right on as I have done Thank you sighed Billy in relief Keep right on Have you been here before Why yes lots of days And say mister Cyril what is that that thing that s all chords with big bass notes that keep saying something so fine and splendid that it marches on and on getting bigger and grander just as if there couldn t anything stop it until it all ends in one great burst of triumph mister Cyril what is that Why Billy the interest this time in the man s face was not faint I wish I might make others catch my meaning as I have evidently made you do it That s something of my own that I m writing you understand and I ve tried to say just what you say you heard And I did hear it I did Oh won t you play it please with the door open I can t Billy I m sorry indeed I am But I ve an appointment and I m late now You shall hear it though I promise you and with the door wide open continued the man as with a murmured apology he passed the girl and hurried down the stairs Billy waited until she heard the outer hall door shut then very softly she crept through Cyril s open doorway and crossed the room to the piano CHAPTER XIII A SURPRISE ALL AROUND May came and with it warm sunny days There was a little balcony at the rear of the second floor and on this missus Stetson and Billy sat many a morning and sewed There were occupations that Billy liked better than sewing 
5720-48302-0000	train-other-500	but she was dutiful and she was really fond of Aunt Hannah so she accepted as gracefully as possible that good lady s dictum that a woman who could not sew and sew well
none	none	 was no lady at all One of the things that Billy liked to do so much better than to sew 
5720-48302-0001	train-other-500	was to play on Cyril s piano She was very careful however that mister Cyril himself did not find this out Cyril was frequently gone from the house and almost as frequently
5720-48302-0002	train-other-500	Aunt Hannah took naps At such times it was very easy to slip up stairs to Cyril s rooms and once at the piano Billy forgot everything else
5720-48302-0003	train-other-500	One day however the inevitable happened Cyril came home unexpectedly The man heard the piano from William s floor and with a surprised ejaculation
5720-48302-0004	train-other-500	he hurried upstairs two steps at a time At the door he stopped in amazement Billy was at the piano but she was not playing rag time The Storm
none	none	 nor yet The Maiden s Prayer 
5720-48302-0005	train-other-500	There was no music before her but under her fingers big bass notes very much like Cyril s own were marching on and on to victory
5720-48302-0006	train-other-500	Billy s face was rapturously intent and happy By Jove Billy gasped the man Billy leaped to her feet and whirled around guiltily Oh
5720-48302-0007	train-other-500	mister Cyril I m so sorry Sorry and you play like that No no I m not sorry I played It s because you found me
5720-48302-0008	train-other-500	Billy s cheeks were a shamed red but her eyes were defiantly brilliant and her chin was at a rebellious tilt
none	none	 I wasn t doing any harm 
5720-48302-0009	train-other-500	not if you weren t here with your NERVES The man laughed and came slowly into the room Billy who taught you to play No one I can t play
none	none	 I can only pick out little bits of things in C 
5720-48302-0010	train-other-500	But you do play I just heard you
none	none	 Billy shrugged her shoulders That was nothing It was only what I had heard I was trying to make it sound like yours And by George you succeeded muttered Cyril under his breath then aloud he asked 
5720-48302-0011	train-other-500	Didn t you ever study music Billy s eyes dimmed No That was the only thing Aunt Ella and I didn t think alike about She had an old square piano
5720-48302-0012	train-other-500	all tin panny and thin you know I played some on it and wanted to take lessons but I didn t want to practise on that I wanted a new one That s what she wouldn t do
5720-48302-0013	train-other-500	get me a new piano or let me do it She said SHE practised on that piano and that it was quite good enough for me especially to learn on
none	none	 I I m afraid I got stuffy 
5720-48302-0014	train-other-500	I hated that piano so
none	none	 But I was almost ready to give in 
5720-48302-0015	train-other-500	when when Aunt Ella died And all you play then is just by ear By ear
none	none	 I suppose so 
5720-48302-0016	train-other-500	if you mean what I hear Easy things I can play quick but but those chords ARE hard they skip around so Cyril smiled oddly
none	none	 I should say so he agreed But perhaps there is something else that I play that you like Is there Oh yes Now there s that little thing that swings and sways like this cried Billy 
5720-48302-0017	train-other-500	dropping herself on to the piano stool and whisking about Billy was not afraid now nor defiant She was only eager and happy again In a moment a dreamy waltz fell upon Cyril s ears
5720-48302-0018	train-other-500	a waltz that he often played himself It was not played correctly it is true There were notes and sometimes whole measures that were very different from the printed music But the tune the rhythm and the spirit were there
5720-48302-0019	train-other-500	And there s this said Billy and this she went on sliding into one little strain after another all of which were recognized by the amazed man at her side Billy he cried when she had finished
5720-48302-0020	train-other-500	and whirled upon him again Billy would you like to learn to play really play from notes
none	none	 Oh wouldn t I Then you shall 
5720-48302-0021	train-other-500	We ll have a piano tomorrow in your rooms for you to practise on And I ll teach you myself Oh thank you mister Cyril
5720-48302-0022	train-other-500	you don t know how I thank you exulted Billy as she danced from the room to tell Aunt Hannah of this great and good thing that had come into her life To Billy
5720-48302-0023	train-other-500	this promise of Cyril s to be her teacher was very kind very delightful but it was not in the least a thing at which to marvel To Bertram however it most certainly was
5720-48302-0024	train-other-500	Well guess what s happened he said to William that night after he had heard the news
none	none	 I ll believe anything now anything 
5720-48302-0025	train-other-500	that you ll raffle off your collection of teapots at the next church fair or that I shall go to Egypt as a Cooky guide
none	none	 Listen Cyril is going to give piano lessons to Billy CYRIL CHAPTER XIV AUNT HANNAH SPEAKS HER MIND Bertram said that the Strata was not a strata any longer He declared that between them Billy and Spunk had caused such an upheaval that there was no telling where one stratum left off and another began What Billy had not attended to Spunk had he said You see it s like this he explained to an amused friend one day Billy is taking piano lessons of Cyril and she is posing for one of my heads Naturally then such feminine belongings as fancy work thread thimbles and hairpins are due to show up at any time either in Cyril s apartments or mine to say nothing of William s and she s in William s lots to look for Spunk if for no other purpose You must know that Spunk likes William s floor the best of the bunch there are so many delightful things to play with Not that Spunk stays there dear me no He s a sociable little chap and his usual course is to pounce on a shelf knock off some object that tickles his fancy then lug it in his mouth to well anywhere that he happens to feel like going Cyril has found him up stairs with a small miniature battered and chewed almost beyond recognition And Aunt Hannah nearly had a fit one day when he appeared in her room with an enormous hard shelled black bug dead of course that he had fished from a case that Pete had left open As for me I can swear that the little round white stone he was playing with in my part of the house was one of William s Collection Number One And that isn t all Bertram continued Billy brings her music down to show to me and lugs my heads all over the rest of the house to show to other folks And there is always everywhere a knit shawl for Aunt Hannah is sure to feel a draught and Billy keeps shawls handy So there you are We certainly aren t a strata any longer he finished Billy was indeed very much at home in the Beacon Street house too much so Aunt Hannah thought Aunt Hannah was in fact seriously disturbed To William one evening late in May she spoke her mind William what are you going to do with Billy she asked abruptly Do with her What do you mean returned William with the contented smile that was so often on his lips these days This is Billy s home That s the worst of it sighed the woman with a shake of her head The worst of it Aunt Hannah what do you mean Don t you like Billy Yes yes William of course I like Billy I love her Who could help it That s not what I mean It s of Billy I m thinking and of the rest of you She can t stay here like this She must go away to school or or somewhere And she s going in September replied the man She ll go to preparatory school first and to college probably Yes but now right away She ought to go somewhere Why yes for the summer of course But those plans aren t completed yet Billy and I were talking of it last evening You know the boys are always away more or less but I seldom go until August and we let Pete and Dong Ling off then for a month and close the house I told Billy I d send you and her anywhere she liked for the whole summer but she says no She prefers to stay here with me But I don t quite fancy that idea through all the hot June and July so I don t know but I ll get a cottage somewhere near at one of the beaches where I can run back and forth night and morning Of course in that case we take Pete and Dong Ling with us and close the house right away I fear Cyril would not fancy it much but after all he and Bertram would be off more or less They always are in the summer But William you haven t yet got my idea at all demurred Aunt Hannah with a discouraged shake of her head It s away away from all this from you that I want to get Billy Away Away from me cried the man with an odd intonation of terror as he started forward in his chair Why Aunt Hannah what are you talking about About Billy This is no place in which to bring up a young girl a young girl who has not one shred of relationship to excuse it But she is my namesake and quite alone in the world Aunt Hannah quite alone poor child My dear William that is exactly it she is a child and yet she is not That s where the trouble lies What do you mean William Billy has been brought up in a little country town with a spinster aunt and a whole good natured tolerant village for company Well she has accepted you and your entire household even down to Dong Ling on the same basis Well I m sure I m glad asserted the man with genial warmth It s good for us to have her here It s good for the boys She s already livened Cyril up and toned Bertram down I may as well confess Aunt Hannah that I ve been more than a little disturbed about Bertram of late I don t like that Bob Seaver that he is so fond of and some other fellows too that have been coming here altogether too much during the last year Bertram says they re only a little Bohemian in their tastes And to me that s the worst of it for Bertram himself is quite too much inclined that way Exactly William And that only goes to prove what I said before Bertram is not a spinster aunt and neither are any of the rest of you But Billy takes you that way Takes us that way as spinster aunts Yes She makes herself as free in this house as she was in her Aunt Ella s at Hampden Falls She flies up to Cyril s rooms half a dozen times a day with some question about her lessons and I don t know how long she d sit at his feet and adoringly listen to his playing if he didn t sometimes get out of patience and tell her to go and practise herself She makes nothing of tripping into Bertram s studio at all hours of the day and he s sketched her head at every conceivable angle which certainly doesn t tend to make Billy modest or retiring As to you you know how much she s in your rooms spending evening after evening fussing over your collections I know but we re we re sorting them and making a catalogue defended the man anxiously Besides I I like to have her there She doesn t bother me a bit No I know she doesn t replied Aunt Hannah with a curious inflection But don t you see William that all this isn t going to quite do Billy s too young and too old Come come Aunt Hannah is that exactly logical It s true at least But after all where s the harm Don t you think that you are just a little bit too fastidious Billy s nothing but a care free child It s the free part that I object to William She has taken every one of you into intimate companionship even Pete and Dong Ling Pete and Dong Ling Yes missus Stetson s chin came up and her nostrils dilated a little Billy went to Pete the other day to have him button her shirt waist up in the back and yesterday I found her down stairs in the kitchen instructing Dong Ling how to make chocolate fudge William fell back in his chair Well well he muttered well well She is a child and no mistake He paused his brows drawn into a troubled frown But Aunt Hannah what CAN I do Of course you could talk to her but I don t seem to quite like that idea My grief and conscience no no That isn t what is needed at all It would only serve to make her self conscious and that s her one salvation now that she isn t self conscious You see it s only the fault of her environment and training after all It isn t her heart that s wrong Indeed it isn t It will be different when she is older when she has seen a little more of the world outside Hampden Falls She ll go to school of course and I think she ought to travel a little Meanwhile she mustn t live just like this though certainly not for a time at least No no I m afraid not agreed William perplexedly rising to his feet But we must think what can be done His step was even slower than usual as he left the room and his eyes were troubled CHAPTER XV WHAT BERTRAM CALLS THE LIMIT At half past ten o clock on the evening following missus Stetson s very plain talk with William the telephone bell at the Beacon Street house rang sharply Pete answered it Well Pete never said hello Hello Is that you Pete called Billy s voice agitatedly Is Uncle William there No Miss Billy Oh dear Well mister Cyril then He s out too Miss Billy And mister Bertram they re all out Yes yes I know HE S out almost sobbed Billy Dear dear what shall I do Pete you ll have to come There isn t any other way Yes Miss where Pete s voice was dubious but respectful To the Boylston Street subway on the Common you know North bound side I ll wait for you but HURRY You see I m all alone here Alone Miss Billy in the subway at this time of night But Miss Billy you shouldn t you can t you mustn t stuttered the old man in helpless horror Yes yes Pete but never mind I am here And I should think if twas such a dreadful thing you would hurry FAST to get here so I wouldn t be alone appealed Billy With an inarticulate cry Pete jerked the receiver on to the hook and stumbled away from the telephone Five minutes later he had left the house and was hurrying through the Common to the Boylston Street subway station Billy a long cloak thrown over her white dress was waiting for him Her white slippers tapped the platform nervously and her hair under the light scarf of lace fluffed into little broken curls as if it had been blown by the wind Miss Billy Miss Billy what can this mean gasped the man Where is missus Stetson At missus Hartwell s you know she is giving a reception to night But come we must hurry I m after mister Bertram After mister Bertram Yes yes Alone like this But I m not alone now I have you Don t you see At the blank stupefaction in the man s face the girl sighed impatiently Dear me I suppose I ll have to explain but we re losing time and we mustn t we mustn t she cried feverishly Listen then quick It was at missus Hartwell s tonight I d been watching mister Bertram He was with that horrid mister Seaver and I never liked him never I overheard something they said about some place they were going to and I didn t like what mister Seaver said I tried to speak to mister Bertram but I didn t get a chance and the next thing I knew he d gone with that Seaver man I saw them just in time to snatch my cloak and follow them FOLLOW them MISS BILLY I had to Pete don t you see There was no one else mister Cyril and Uncle William had gone home I supposed I sent back word by the maid to Aunt Hannah that I d gone ahead you know the carriage was ordered for eleven but I m afraid she won t have sense to tell Aunt Hannah she looked so dazed and frightened when I told her But I COULDN T wait to say more Well I hurried out and caught up with mister Bertram just as they were crossing Arlington Street to the Garden I d heard them say they were going to walk so I knew I could do it But Pete after I got there I didn t dare to speak I didn t DARE to So I just followed They went straight through the Garden and across the Common to Tremont Street and on and on until they stopped and went down some stairs all marble and lights and mirrors Twas a restaurant I think I saw just where it was then I flew back here to telephone for Uncle William I knew HE could do something But well you know the rest I had to take you Now come quick I ll show you But Miss Billy I can t You mustn t it s impossible chattered old Pete Come let me take ye home Miss Billy do Home and leave mister Bertram with that Seaver man No no What CAN ye do Do I can get him to come home with me of course The old man made a despairing gesture and looked about him as if for help He saw then the curious questioning eyes on all sides and with a quick change of manner he touched Miss Billy s arm Yes we ll go Come he apparently agreed But once outside on the broad expanse before the Subway entrance he stopped again Miss Billy please come home he implored Ye don t know ye can t know what yer a doin The girl tossed her head She was angry now Pete if you will not go with me I shall go alone I am not afraid But the hour the place you a young girl Miss Billy remonstrated the old man agitatedly It isn t so very late I ve been out lots of times later than this at home And as for the place it s all light and bright and lots of people were going in ladies and gentlemen Nothing could hurt me Pete and I shall go but I d rather you were with me Why Pete we mustn t leave him He isn t he isn t HIMSELF Pete He he s been DRINKING Billy s voice broke and her face flushed scarlet She was almost crying Come you won t refuse now she finished resolutely turning toward the street And because old Pete could not pick her up bodily and carry her home he followed close at her heels At the head of the marble stairs all lights and mirrors however he made one last plea Miss Billy once more I beg of ye won t ye come home Ye don t know what yer a doin Miss Billy ye don t ye don t I can t go home persisted Billy I must get mister Bertram away from that man Now come we ll just stand at the door and look in until we see him Then I ll go straight to him and speak to him And with that she turned and ran down the steps Billy blinked a little at the lights which reflected in the great plate glass mirrors were a million dazzling points that found themselves again repeated in the sparkling crystal and glittering silver on the flower decked tables All about her Billy saw flushed faced men and bright eyed women laughing chatting and clinking together their slender stemmed wine glasses But nowhere as she looked about her could Billy descry the man she sought The head waiter came forward with uplifted hand but Billy did not see him A girl at her left laughed disagreeably and several men stared with boldly admiring eyes but to them too Billy paid no heed Then halfway across the room she spied Bertram and Seaver sitting together at a small table alone Simultaneously her own and Bertram s eyes met With a sharp word under his breath Bertram sprang to his feet His befogged brain had cleared suddenly under the shock of Billy s presence Billy for Heaven s sake what are you doing here he demanded in a low voice as he reached her side I came for you I want you to go home with me please mister Bertram whispered Billy pleadingly The man had not waited for an answer to his question With a deft touch he had turned Billy toward the door and even as she finished her sentence she found herself in the marble hallway confronting Pete pallid faced and shaking And you too Pete Great Scott what does this mean he exploded angrily Pete could only shake his head and glance imploringly at Billy His dry lips and tongue refused to articulate even one word We came for you choked Billy You see I don t like that Seaver man Well by Jove this is the limit breathed Bertram CHAPTER XVI KATE TAKES A HAND Undeniably Billy was in disgrace and none knew it better than Billy herself The whole family had contributed to this knowledge Aunt Hannah was inexpressibly shocked she had not breath even to ejaculate My grief and conscience Kate was disgusted Cyril was coldly reserved Bertram was frankly angry even William was vexed and showed it Spunk too as if in league with the rest took this opportunity to display one of his occasional fits of independence and when Billy longing for some sort of comfort called him to her he settled back on his tiny haunches and imperturbably winked and blinked his indifference Nearly all the family had had something to say to Billy on the matter with not entirely satisfactory results when Kate determined to see what she could do She chose a time when she could have the girl quite to herself with small likelihood of interruption But Billy how could you do such an absurd thing she demanded The idea of leaving my house alone at half past ten at night to follow a couple of men through the streets of Boston and then with my brothers butler make a scene like that in a a public dining room Billy sighed in a discouraged way Aunt Kate can t I make you and the rest of them understand that I didn t start out to do all that I meant just to speak to mister Bertram and get him away from that man But my dear child even that was bad enough Billy lifted her chin You don t seem to think Aunt Kate mister Bertram was was not sober All the more reason then why you should NOT have done what you did Why Aunt Kate you wouldn t leave him alone in that condition with that man It was missus Hartwell s turn to sigh But Billy she contested wearily can t you understand that it wasn t YOUR place to interfere you a young girl I m sure I don t see what difference that makes I was the only one that could do it Besides afterward I did try to get some one else Uncle William and mister Cyril But when I found I couldn t get them I just had to do it alone that is with Pete Pete scoffed missus Hartwell Pete indeed Billy s head came up with a jerk Billy was very angry now Aunt Kate it seems I ve done a very terrible thing but I m sure I don t see it that way I wasn t afraid and I wasn t in the least bit of danger anywhere I knew my way perfectly and I did NOT make any scene in that restaurant I just asked mister Bertram to come home with me One would think you WANTED mister Bertram to go off with that man and and drink too much But Uncle William hasn t liked him before not one bit I ve heard him talk about him that mister Seaver missus Hartwell raised both her hands palms outward Billy it is useless to talk with you You are quite impossible It is even worse than I expected she cried with wrathful impatience Worse than you expected What do you mean please Worse than I thought it would be before you came The idea of those five men taking a girl to bring up Billy sat very still She was even holding her breath though missus Hartwell did not know that You mean that they did not want me she asked quietly so quietly that missus Hartwell did not realize the sudden tension behind the words For that matter missus Hartwell was too angry now to realize anything outside of herself Want you Billy it is high time that you understand just how things are and have been at the house then perhaps you will conduct yourself with an eye a little more to other people s comfort Can you imagine three young men like my brothers WANTING to take a strange young woman into their home to upset everything To upset everything echoed Billy faintly And have I done that Of course you have How could you help it To begin with they thought you were a boy and that was bad enough but William was so anxious to do right by his dead friend that he insisted upon taking you much against the will of all the rest of us Oh I know this isn t pleasant for you to hear admitted missus Hartwell in response to the dismayed expression in Billy s eyes but I think it s high time you realize something of what those men have sacrificed for you Now to resume When they found you were a girl what did they do Did they turn you over to some school or such place as they should have done Certainly not William would not hear of it He turned Bertram out of his rooms put you into them and established Aunt Hannah as chaperon and me as substitute until she arrived But because through it all he smiled blandly you have been blind to the whole thing And what is the result His entire household routine is shattered to atoms You have accepted the whole house as if it were your own You take Cyril s time to teach you music and Bertram s to teach you painting without a thought of what it means to them There I suppose I ought not to have said all this but I couldn t help it Billy And surely now NOW you appreciate a little more what your coming to this house has meant and what my brothers have done for you I do certainly said Billy still in that voice that was so oddly smooth and emotionless And you ll try to be more tractable less headstrong less assertive of your presence The girl sprang to her feet now More tractable Less assertive of my presence she cried missus Hartwell do you mean to say you think I d STAY after what you ve told me Stay Why of course you ll stay Don t be silly child I didn t tell you this to make you go I only wanted you to understand how things were and are And I do understand and I m going missus Hartwell frowned Her face changed color Come come Billy this is nonsense William wants you here He would never forgive me if anything I said should send you away You must not be angry with him Billy turned now like an enraged little tigress Angry with him Why I love him I love them all They are the dearest men ever and they ve been so good to me The girl s voice broke a little then went on with a more determined ring Do you think I d have them know why I m going that I d hurt them like that Never But Billy what are you going to do I don t know I ve got to plan it out I only know now that I m going sure And with a choking little cry Billy ran from the room In her own chamber a minute later the tears fell unrestrained It s home all the home there is anywhere she sobbed But it s got to go it s got to go CHAPTER XVII A PINK RIBBON TRAIL missus Stetson wore an air of unmistakable relief as she stepped into William s sitting room Even her knock at the half open door had sounded almost triumphant William it does seem as if Fate itself had intervened to help us out she began delightedly Billy of her own accord came to me this morning and said that she wanted to go away with me for a little trip So you see that will make it easier for us Good That is fortunate indeed cried William but his voice did not carry quite the joy that his words expressed I have been disturbed ever since your remarks the other day he continued wearily and of course her extraordinary escapade the next evening did not help matters any It is better I know that she shouldn t be here for a time Though I shall miss her terribly But tell me what is it what does she want to do She says she guesses she is homesick for Hampden Falls that she d like to go back there for a few weeks this summer if I ll go with her The the dear child seems suddenly to have taken a great fancy to me explained Aunt Hannah unsteadily I never saw her so affectionate She is a dear girl a very dear girl and she has a warm heart William cleared his throat sonorously but even that did not clear his voice It was her heart that led her wrong the other night he declared Hers was a brave and fearless act but a very unwise one Much as I deplore Bertram s intimacy with Seaver I should hesitate to take the course marked out by Billy Bertram is not a child But tell me more of this trip of yours How did Billy happen to suggest it I don t know I noticed yesterday that she seemed strangely silent unhappy in fact She sat alone in her room the greater part of the day and I could not get her out of it But this morning she came to my door as bright as the sun itself and made me the proposition I told you of She says her aunt s house is closed awaiting its sale but that she would like to open it for awhile this summer if I d like to go Naturally you can understand that I d very quickly fall in with a plan like that one which promised so easily to settle our difficulties Yes of course of course muttered William It is very fine very fine indeed he concluded And again his voice failed quite to match his words in enthusiasm Then I ll go and begin to see to my things murmured missus Stetson rising to her feet Billy seems anxious to get away Billy did indeed seem anxious to get away She announced her intended departure at once to the family She called it a visit to her old home and she seemed very glad in her preparations If there was anything forced in this gayety no one noticed it or at least no one spoke of it The family saw very little of Billy indeed these days She said that she was busy that she had packing to do She stopped taking lessons of Cyril and visited Bertram s studio only once during the whole three days before she went away and then merely to get some things that belonged to her On the fourth day almost before the family realized what was happening she was gone and with her had gone missus Stetson and Spunk The family said they liked it the quiet the freedom They said they liked to be alone all but William He said nothing And yet When Bertram went to his studio that morning he did not pick up his brushes until he had sat for long minutes before the sketch of a red cheeked curly headed young girl whose eyes held a peculiarly wistful appeal and Cyril at his piano up stairs sat with idle fingers until they finally drifted into a simple little melody the last thing Billy had been learning It was Pete who brought in the kitten and Billy had been gone a whole week then The poor little beast was cryin at the alleyway door sir he explained I I made so bold as to bring him in Of course said William Did you feed it Yes sir Ling did There was a pause then Pete spoke diffidently I thought sir if ye didn t mind I d keep it I ll try to see that it stays down stairs sir out of yer way That s all right Pete keep it by all means by all means approved William Thank ye sir Ye see it s a stray It hasn t got any home And did ye notice sir it looks like Spunk Yes I noticed said William stirring with sudden restlessness I noticed Yes sir said Pete And he turned and carried the small gray cat away The new kitten did not stay down stairs Pete tried it is true to keep his promise to watch it but after he had seen the little animal carried surreptitiously up stairs in mister William s arms he relaxed his vigilance Some days later the kitten appeared with a huge pink bow behind its ears somewhat awkwardly tied if it must be confessed Where it came from or who put it there was not known until one day the kitten was found in the hall delightedly chewing at the end of what had been a roll of pink ribbon Up the stairs led a trail of pink ribbon and curling white paper and the end of the trail was in William s room CHAPTER XVIII BILLY WRITES ANOTHER LETTER By the middle of June only William and the gray kitten were left with Pete and Dong Ling in the Beacon Street house Cyril had sailed for England and Bertram had gone on a sketching trip with a friend To William the house this summer was unusually lonely indeed he found the silent deserted rooms almost unbearable Even the presence of the little gray cat served only to accentuate the loneliness it reminded him of Billy William missed Billy He owned that now even to Pete He said that he would be glad when she came back To himself he said that he wished he had not fallen in quite so readily with Aunt Hannah s notion of getting the child away It was all nonsense he declared All she needed was a little curbing and directing both of which could just as well have been done there at home But she had gone and it could not be helped now The only thing left for him to do was to see that it did not occur again When Billy came back she should stay except for necessary absences for school of course All this William settled in his own mind quite to his own satisfaction entirely forgetting strange to say that it had been Billy s own suggestion that she go away Very promptly William wrote to Billy He told her how he missed her and said that he had stopped trying to sort and catalogue his collections until she should be there to help him He told her too after a time of the gray kitten Spunkie that looked so much like Spunk In reply he received plump white envelopes directed in the round schoolboy hand that he remembered so well In the envelopes were letters cheery and entertaining like Billy herself They thanked him for all his many kindnesses and they told him something of what Billy was doing They showed unbounded interest in the new kitten and in all else that William wrote about but they hinted very plainly that he had better not wait for her to help him out on the catalogue for it would soon be autumn and she would be in school William frowned at this and shook his head yet he knew that it was true In August William closed the Beacon street house and went to the Rangeley Lakes on a camping trip He told himself that he would not go had it not been for a promise given to an old college friend months before True he had been anticipating this trip all winter but it occurred to him now that it would be much more interesting to go to Hampden Falls and see Billy He had been to the Rangeley Lakes and he had not been to Hampden Falls besides there would be Ned Harding and those queer old maids with their shaded house and socketed chairs to see In short to William at the moment there seemed no place quite so absorbingly interesting as was Hampden Falls But he went to the Rangeley Lakes In September Cyril came back from Europe and Bertram from the Adirondacks where he had been spending the month of August William already had arrived and with Pete and Dong Ling had opened the house Where s Billy Isn t Billy here demanded Bertram No She isn t back yet replied William You don t mean to say she s stayed up there all summer exclaimed Cyril Why yes I I suppose so hesitated William You see I haven t heard but once for a month I ve been down in Maine you know William wrote to Billy that night My dear he said in part I hope you ll come home right away We want to see SOMETHING of you before you go away again and you know the schools will be opening soon By the way it has just occurred to me as I write that perhaps after all you won t have to go quite away There are plenty of good schools for young ladies right in and near Boston which I am sure you could attend and still live at home Suppose you come back then as soon as you can and we ll talk it up And that reminds me I wonder how Spunk will get along with Spunkie Spunkie has been boarding out all August at a cat home but he seems glad to get back to us I am anxious to see the two little chaps together just to find out how much alike they really do look Very promptly came Billy s answer but William s face after he had read the letter was almost as blank as it had been on that April day when Billy s first letter came though this time for a far different reason Why boys she isn t coming he announced in dismay Isn t coming ejaculated two astonished Voices No Not at ALL Why of course later retorted William with unwonted sharpness But not now This is what she says And he read aloud DEAR UNCLE WILLIAM You poor dear man Did you think I d really let you spend your time and your thought over hunting up a school for me after all the rest you have done for me Not a bit of it Why Aunt Hannah and I have been buried under school catalogues all summer and I have studied them all until I know just which has turkey dinners on Sundays and which ice cream at least twice a week And it s all settled too long ago I m going to a girls school up the Hudson a little way a lovely place I m sure from the pictures of it Oh and another thing I shall go right from here Two girls at Hampden Falls are going and I shall go with them Isn t that a fine chance for me You see it would never do anyway for me to go alone me a Billy unless I sent a special courier ahead to announce that Billy was a girl Aunt Hannah has decided to stay here this winter in the old house She likes it ever so much and I don t think I shall sell the place just yet anyway She will go back of course to Boston after I ve gone to get some things at the house that she ll want and also to do some shopping But she ll let you know when she ll be there I ll write more later but just now I m in a terrible rush I only write this note to set your poor heart at rest about having to hunt up a school for me With love to all BILLY As had happened once before after a letter from Billy had been read there was a long pause Well by Jove breathed Bertram It s very sensible I m sure declared Cyril Still I must confess I would have liked to pick out her piano teacher for her William said nothing perhaps because he was reading Billy s letter again At eight o clock that night Bertram tapped on Cyril s door What s the trouble demanded Cyril in answer to the look on the other s face Bertram lifted his eyebrows oddly I m not sure whether you ll call it trouble or not he replied but I think it s safe to say that Billy is gone for good For good What do you mean that she s not coming back ever Exactly that Nonsense What s put that notion into your head Billy s letter first after that Pete Pete Yes He came to me a few minutes ago looking as if he had seen a ghost It seems he swept Billy s rooms this morning and put them in order against her coming and tonight William told him that she wouldn t be here at present Pete came straight to me He said he didn t dare tell mister William but he d got to tell some one there wasn t one single thing of Miss Billy s left in her rooms nor anywhere else in the house not so much as a handkerchief or a hairpin Hm m that does look suspicious murmured Cyril What s up do you think Don t know but something sure Still of course we may be wrong We won t say anything to Will about it anyhow Poor old chap twould worry him specially if he thought Billy s feelings had been hurt Hurt nonsense Why we did everything for her everything Yes I know and she tried to do EVERYTHING for us too retorted Bertram quizzically as he turned away CHAPTER XIX SEEING BILLY OFF Early in October missus Stetson arrived at the Beacon Street house but she did not stay long I ve come for just a few things I want and to do some shopping she explained But Aunt Hannah remonstrated William what is the meaning of this Why are you staying up there at Hampden Falls I like it there William and why shouldn t I stay Surely there s no need for me to be here now with Billy away But Billy s coming back Of course she s coming back laughed Aunt Hannah but not this winter certainly Why William what s the matter I m sure I think it s a beautiful arrangement Why don t you remember It s just what we said we wanted to keep Billy away for awhile And the best part of it is it s her own idea from the start Yes I know I know frowned William but I m not sure after all that that idea of ours wasn t a mistake a mistake that she needed to get away Never We were just right about it declared Aunt Hannah with conviction And is Billy happy She seems to be Hm m well THAT S good said William as he turned to go up to his room But as he climbed the stairs he sighed and to hear him one would have thought it anything but good to him that Billy was happy One by one the weeks passed missus Stetson had long since gone back to Hampden Falls and Bertram said that the Strata was beginning to look natural again There remained now indeed only Spunkie the small gray cat to remind any one of the days that were gone though to be sure there were Billy s letters if they might be called a reminder Billy did not write often She said that she was too busy to breathe Such letters as did come from her were addressed to William though they soon came to be claimed by the entire family Bertram and Cyril frankly demanded that William read them aloud and even Pete always contrived to have some dusting or puttering within earshot a subterfuge quite well understood but never reproved by any of the brothers When the Christmas vacation drew near William wrote that he hoped Billy and Aunt Hannah would spend it with them but Billy answered that although she appreciated their kindness and thanked them for it yet she must decline their invitation as she had already invited several of the girls to go home with her to Hampden Falls for a country Christmas For the Easter vacation William was even more insistent but so was Billy she had already accepted an invitation to go home with one of the girls and she did not think it would be at all polite to change her plans now William fretted not a little Even Cyril and Bertram said that it was too bad that they themselves would like to see the girl so they would It was in the spring at the close of school however that the heaviest blow fell Billy was not coming to Boston even then She wrote that she and Aunt Hannah were going to run across the water for a little trip through the British Isles and that their passage was already engaged And so you see she explained I shall not have a minute to spare There ll be only time to skip home for Aunt Hannah and to pack the trunks before it ll be time to start Bertram looked at Cyril significantly when this letter was read aloud and afterward he muttered in Cyril s ear You see It s Hampden Falls she calls home now not the Strata Yes I see frowned Cyril It does look suspicious Two days before the date of Billy s expected sailing William announced at the breakfast table that he was going away on business might be gone until the end of the week You don t say commented Bertram I M going to morrow but I m coming back in a couple of days Hm m murmured William abstractedly Oh well I may be back before the end of the week Only one meal did Cyril eat alone after his brothers had gone then he told Pete that he had decided to take the night boat for New York There was a little matter that called him there he said and he believed the trip by water would be a pleasure the night was so fine and warm In New York Cyril had little trouble in finding Billy as he knew the steamship she was to take I thought as long as I was in New York to day I d just come and say good by to you and Aunt Hannah he informed her with an evident aim toward making his presence appear to be casual That was good of you exclaimed Billy And how are Uncle William and mister Bertram Very well I fancy though they weren t there when I left replied the man Oh gone away Yes A little matter of business they said but well by Jove he broke off his gaze on a familiar figure hurrying at that moment toward them There s William now William with no eyes but for Billy came rapidly forward Well well Billy I thought as long as I happened to be in New York to day I d just run down to the boat and see you and Aunt Hannah off and wish CYRIL Where did YOU come from Billy laughed He just happened to be in town too Uncle William like you she explained And I m sure I think it s lovely of you to be so kind Aunt Hannah ll be up right away She went down to the stateroom to This time it was Billy who stopped abruptly The two men facing her could not see what she saw and not until their brother Bertram s merry greeting fell on their ears did they understand her sudden silence And is this the way you meant to run away from us young lady cried Bertram Not so fast You see I happened to be in New York this morning and so I Something in Billy s face sent a pause to his words just as his eyes spied the two men at the girl s side For a moment he stared dumbly then he gave a merry gesture of defeat It s all up I might as well confess I VE been planning this thing for three weeks Billy ever since your letter came in fact As for my two fellow sinners here I ll wager they weren t two days behind me in their planning So now own up boys William and Cyril however did not have to own up missus Stetson appeared at the moment and created for them a very welcome diversion Long minutes later when the good byes had become nothing but a flutter of white handkerchiefs from deck to shore and shore to deck William drew a long sigh That s a nice little girl boys a nice little girl he exclaimed I declare I didn t suppose I d mind so much her going so far away CHAPTER XX BILLY THE MYTH To all appearances it came about very naturally that Billy did not return to America for some time During the summer she wrote occasionally to William and gave glowing accounts of their travels Then in September came the letter telling him that they had concluded to stay through the winter in Paris Billy wrote that she had decided not to go to college She would take up some studies there in Paris she said but she would devote herself more particularly to her music When the next summer came there was still something other than America to claim her attention the Calderwells had invited her to cruise with them for three months Their yacht was a little floating palace of delight Billy declared not to mention the charm of the unknown lands and waters that she and Aunt Hannah would see Of all this Billy wrote to William at occasional intervals but she did not come home Even when the next autumn came there was still Paris to detain her for another long winter of study In the Henshaw house on Beacon Street William mourned not a little as each recurring season brought no Billy The idea It s just as if one didn t have a namesake he fumed Well did you have one Bertram demanded one day Really Will I m beginning to think she s a myth Long years ago from the first of April till June we did have two frolicsome sprites here that announced themselves as Billy and Spunk I ll own And a year later by ways devious and secret we three managed to see the one called Billy off on a great steamship Since then what A word a message a scrap of paper Billy s a myth I say William sighed Sometimes I don t know but you are right he admitted Why it ll be three years next June since Billy was here She must be nearly twenty one and we know almost nothing about her That s so I wonder Bertram paused and laughed a little I wonder if NOW she d play guardian angel to me through the streets of Boston William threw a keen glance into his brother s face I don t believe it would be quite necessary NOW Bert he said quietly The other flushed a little but his eyes softened Maybe not Will still one can always find some use for a guardian angel you know he finished almost under his breath To Cyril Bertram had occasionally spoken during the last two years of their first suspicions concerning Billy s absence They speculated vaguely too as to why she had gone and if she would ever come back and they wondered if anything could have wounded her and sent her away To William they said nothing of all this however though they agreed that they would have asked Kate for her opinion had she been there But Kate was not there As it chanced a good business opportunity had called Kate s husband to a Western town very soon after Billy herself had gone to Hampden Falls and since the family s removal to the West missus Hartwell had not once returned to Boston It was in April three years since Billy s first appearance in the Beacon Street house that Bertram met his friend Hugh Calderwell on the street one afternoon and brought him home to dinner Hugh Calderwell was a youth who Bertram said had been born with a whole dozen silver spoons in his mouth And indeed it would seem so if present prosperity were any indication He was a good looking young fellow with a frank manliness that appealed to men and a deferential chivalry that appealed to women a combination that brought him many friends and some enemies With plenty of money to indulge a passion for traveling young Calderwell had spent the most of his time since graduation in daring trips into the heart of almost impenetrable forests or to the top of almost inaccessible mountains with an occasional more ordinary trip to give variety He had now come to the point however where he was determined to settle down to something that meant something he told the Henshaws as the four men smoked in Bertram s den after dinner Yes sir I have he iterated And by the way the little girl that has set me to thinking in such good earnest is a friend of yours too Miss Neilson I met her in Paris She was on our yacht all last summer Three men sat suddenly erect in their chairs Billy cried three voices Do you know Billy To be sure And you do too she says Oh no we don t disputed Bertram emphatically But we WISH we did His guest laughed Well I fancy you DO know her or you wouldn t have answered like that he retorted For you just begin to know Miss Billy when you find out that you DON T know her She is a charming girl a very charming girl She is my namesake announced William in what Bertram called his finest ever voice that he used only for the choicest bits in his collections Yes she told me smiled Calderwell Billy for William Odd idea too but clever It helps to distinguish her even more though she doesn t need it for that matter Doesn t need it echoed William in a puzzled voice No Perhaps you don t know mister Henshaw but Miss Billy is a very popular young woman You have reason to be proud of your namesake I have always been that declared William with just a touch of hauteur Tell us about her begged Bertram You remember I said that we wished we did know her Calderwell smiled I don t believe after all that you do know much about her he began musingly Billy is not one who talks much of herself I fancy in her letters William frowned This time there was more than a touch of hauteur in his voice MISS NEILSON is not one to show vanity anywhere he said with suggestive emphasis on the name Indeed she isn t agreed Calderwell heartily She is a fine girl quite one of the finest I know in fact There was an uncomfortable silence Over in the corner Cyril puffed at his cigar with an air almost of boredom He had not spoken since his first surprised questioning with the others Do you know Billy William was still frowning Even Bertram wore a look that was not quite satisfied Miss Neilson has spent two winters in Paris now you know resumed Calderwell after a moment and she is very popular both with the American colony and with the other students As for her Aunt Hannah they all make a pet of her but that is perhaps because Billy herself is so devoted Again William frowned at the familiar Billy but Calderwell talked on unheeding After all I m not sure but some of us regard Aunt Hannah with scant favor occasionally he laughed something as if she were the dragon that guarded the princess you know Miss Billy IS popular with the men and she has suitors enough to turn any girl s head but her own Suitors cried William plainly aghast Why Billy s nothing but a child Calderwell gave an odd smile How long is it since you ve seen Miss Neilson he asked Two years And then only for a few minutes just before she sailed amended Bertram We haven t really seen much of her since three years ago Hm m well you ll see for yourself soon You know she s coming home next month Not one of the brothers did know it but not one of them intended that Calderwell should find out that they did not Yes she s coming home said William lifting his chin a little Oh yes next month added Bertram nonchalantly Even Cyril across the room was not to be outdone Yes Miss Neilson comes home next month he said CHAPTER XXI BILLY THE REALITY Very early in May came the cheery letter from Billy herself announcing the news of her intended return And I shall be so glad to see you all she wrote in closing It seems so long since I left America Then she signed her name with kindest regards to all Billy did not send love to all any more William at once began to make plans for his namesake s comfort But Will she didn t say she was coming here Bertram reminded him She didn t need to smiled William confidently She just took it for granted of course This is her home But it hasn t been for years She s called Hampden Falls home I know but that was before demurred William his eyes a little anxious Besides they ve sold the house now you know There s nowhere for her to go but here Bertram All right acquiesced the younger man still doubtingly Maybe that s so maybe But he did not finish his sentence and his eyes were troubled as he watched his brother begin to rearrange Billy s rooms In time however so sure was William of Billy s return to the Beacon Street house that Bertram ceased to question and with almost as much confidence as William himself displayed he devoted his energies to the preparations for Billy s arrival And what preparations they were Even Cyril helped this time to the extent of placing on Billy s piano a copy of his latest book and a pile of new music Nor were the melodies that floated down from the upper floor akin to funeral marches they were perilously near to being allied to ragtime At last everything was ready There was not one more bit of dust to catch Pete s eye nor one more adornment that demanded William s careful hand to adjust In Billy s rooms new curtains graced the windows and new rugs the floors In missus Stetson s too similar changes had been made The latest and best Face of a Girl smiled at one from above Billy s piano and the very rarest of William s treasures adorned the mantelpiece No guns nor knives nor fishing rods met the eyes now Instead at every turn there was a hint of feminine tastes a mirror a workbasket a low sewing chair a stand with a tea tray And everywhere were roses up stairs and down stairs until the air was heavy with their perfume In the dining room Pete was again swinging back and forth like a pendulum it is true but it was a cheerful pendulum to day anxious only that no time should be lost In the kitchen alone was there unhappiness and there because Dong Ling had already spoiled a whole cake of chocolate in a vain attempt to make Billy s favorite fudge Even Spunkie grown now to be sleek lazy and majestically indifferent was in holiday attire for a brand new pink bow of huge dimensions adorned his fat neck for the first time in many months You see William had explained to Bertram I put on that ribbon again because I thought it would make Spunkie seem more homelike and more like Spunk You know there wasn t anything Billy missed so much as that kitten when she went abroad Aunt Hannah said so Yes I know Bertram had laughed but still Spunkie isn t Spunk you understand he had finished with a vision in his eyes of Billy as she had looked that first night when she had triumphantly lifted from the green basket the little gray kitten with its enormous pink bow This time there was no circuitous journeying no secrecy in the trip to New York Quite as a matter of course the three brother made their plans to meet Billy and quite as a matter of course they met her Perhaps the only cloud in the horizon of their happiness was the presence of Calderwell He too had come to meet Billy and all the Henshaw brothers were vaguely conscious of a growing feeling of dislike toward Calderwell Billy was unmistakably glad to see them and to see Calderwell It was while she was talking to Calderwell indeed that William and Cyril and Bertram had an opportunity really to see the girl and to note what time had done for her They knew then at once that time had been very kind It was a slim Billy that they saw with a head royally poised and a chin that was round and soft and yet knew well its own mind The eyes were still appealing in a way yet behind the appeal lay unsounded depths of not one of the brothers could quite make up his mind just what yet all the brothers determined to find out The hair still curled distractingly behind the pretty ears and fluffed into burnished bronze where the wind had loosened it The cheeks were paler now though the rose flush still glowed warmly through the clear smooth skin The mouth Billy s mouth had always been fascinating Bertram suddenly decided as he watched it now He wanted to paint it again It was not too large for beauty nor too small for strength It curved delightfully and the lower lip had just the fullness and the color that he liked to paint he said to himself William too was watching Billy s mouth in fact though he did not know it one never was long near Billy without noticing her mouth if she talked William thought it pretty merry and charmingly kissable but just now he wished that it would talk to him and not to Calderwell any longer Cyril indeed Cyril was paying little attention to Billy He had turned to Aunt Hannah To tell the truth it seemed to Cyril that after all Billy was very much like other merry thoughtless rather noisy young women of whom he knew and disliked scores It had occurred to him suddenly that perhaps it would not be unalloyed bliss to take this young namesake of William s home with them It was not until an hour later when Billy Aunt Hannah and the Henshaws had reached the hotel where they were to spend the night that the Henshaw brothers began really to get acquainted with Billy She seemed then more like their own Billy the Billy that they had known And I m so glad to be here she cried and to see you all America IS the best place after all And of America Boston is the Hub you know Bertram reminded her It is nodded Billy And it hasn t changed a mite except to grow better You ll see to morrow As if I hadn t been counting the days she exulted And now what have you been doing all of you Just wait till you see laughed Bertram They re all spread out for your inspection A new Face of a Girl Of course yards of them And heaps of Old Blues and black basalts she questioned turning to William Well a few hesitated William modestly And the music what of that Billy looked now at Cyril You ll see he shrugged There s very little after all of anything Billy gave a wise shake of her head I know better and I want to see it all so much We ve talked and talked of it haven t we Aunt Hannah of what we would do when we got to Boston Yes my dear YOU have The girl laughed I accept the amendment she retorted with mock submission I suppose it is always I who talk It was when I painted you teased Bertram By the way I ll LET you talk if you ll pose again for me he finished eagerly Billy uptilted her nose Do you think sir you deserve it after that speech she demanded But how about YOUR art your music entreated William You have said so little of that in your letters Billy hesitated For a brief moment she glanced at Cyril He did not appear to have heard his brother s question He was talking with Aunt Hannah Oh I play some murmured the girl almost evasively But tell me of yourself Uncle William and of what you are doing And William needed no second bidding It was some time later that Billy turned to him with an amazed exclamation in response to something he had said Home with you Why Uncle William what do you mean You didn t really think you d got to be troubled with ME any longer she cried merrily William s face paled then flushed I did not call it trouble Billy he said quietly His grieved eyes looked straight into hers and drove the merriment quite away Oh I m so sorry she said gently And I appreciate your kindness indeed I do but I couldn t really I couldn t think of such a thing And you don t have to think of it cut in Bertram who considered that the situation was becoming much too serious All you have to do is to come Billy shook her head You are so good all of you But you didn t you really didn t think I WAS coming she protested Indeed we did asserted Bertram promptly and we have done everything to get ready for you too even to rigging up Spunkie to masquerade as Spunk I ll warrant that Pete s nose is already flattened against the window pane lest we should HAPPEN to come to night and there s no telling how many cakes of chocolate Dong Ling has spoiled by this time We left him trying to make fudge you know Billy laughed but she cried too at least her eyes grew suddenly moist Bertram tried to decide afterward whether she laughed till she cried or cried till she laughed No no she demurred tremulously I couldn t I really have never intended that But why not What are you going to do questioned William in a voice that was dazed and hurt The first question Billy ignored The second she answered with a promptness and a gayety that was meant to turn the thoughts away from the first We are going to Boston Aunt Hannah and I We ve got rooms engaged for just now but later we re going to take a house and live together That s what we re going to do CHAPTER XXII HUGH CALDERWELL In the Beacon Street house William mournfully removed the huge pink bow from Spunkie s neck and Bertram threw away the roses Cyril marched up stairs with his pile of new music and his book and Pete in obedience to orders hid the workbasket the tea table and the low sewing chair With a great display of a getting back home air Bertram moved many of his belongings upstairs but inside of a week he had moved them down again saying that after all he believed he liked the first floor better Billy s rooms were closed then and remained as they had for years silent and deserted Billy with Aunt Hannah had gone directly to their Back Bay hotel This is for just while I m house hunting the girl had said But very soon she had decided to go to Hampden Falls for the summer and postpone her house buying until the autumn Billy was twenty one now and there were many matters of business to arrange with Lawyer Harding concerning her inheritance It was not until September therefore when Billy once more returned to Boston that the Henshaw brothers had the opportunity of renewing their acquaintance with William s namesake I want a home Billy said to Bertram and William on the night of her arrival As before missus Stetson and Billy had gone directly to a hotel I want a real home with a furnace to shake if I want to and some dirt to dig in Well I m sure that ought to be easy to find smiled Bertram Oh but that isn t all supplemented Billy It must be mostly closets and piazza At least those are the important things Well you might run across a snag there Why don t you build Billy gave a gesture of dissent Too slow I want it now Bertram laughed His eyes narrowed quizzically From what Calderwell says he bantered I should judge that there are plenty of sighing swains who are only too ready to give you a home and now The pink deepened in Billy s cheeks I said closets and a piazza dirt to dig and a furnace to shake she retorted merrily I didn t say I wanted a husband And you don t of course interposed William decidedly You are much too young for that Yes sir agreed Billy demurely but Bertram was sure he saw a twinkle under the downcast lashes And where is Cyril asked missus Stetson coming into the room at that moment William stirred restlessly Well Cyril couldn t couldn t come stammered William with an uneasy glance at his brother Billy laughed unexpectedly It s too bad about mister Cyril s not coming she murmured And again Bertram caught the twinkle in the downcast eyes To Bertram the twinkle looked interesting and worth pursuit but at the very beginning of the chase Calderwell s card came up and that ended everything so Bertram declared crossly to himself Billy found her dirt to dig in and her furnace to shake in Brookline There were closets too and a generous expanse of veranda They all belonged to a quaint little house perched on the side of Corey Hill From the veranda in the rear and from many of the windows one looked out upon a delightful view of many hued many shaped roofs nestling among towering trees with the wide sweep of the sky above and the haze of faraway hills at the horizon In fact it s as nearly perfect as it can be and not take angel wings and fly away declared Billy I have named it Hillside Very early in her career as house owner Billy decided that however delightful it might be to have a furnace to shake it would not be at all delightful to shake it besides there was the new motor car to run Billy therefore sought and found a good strong man who had not only the muscle and the willingness to shake the furnace but the skill to turn chauffeur at a moment s notice Best of all this man had also a wife who with a maid to assist her would take full charge of the house and thus leave Billy and missus Stetson free from care All these together with a canary and a kitten as near like Spunk as could be obtained made Billy s household And now I m ready to see my friends she announced And I think your friends will be ready to see you Bertram assured her And they were at least so it appeared For at once the little house perched on the hillside became the Mecca for many of the Henshaws friends who had known Billy as William s merry eighteen year old namesake There were others too whom Billy had met abroad and there were soft stepping sweet faced old women and an occasional white whiskered old man Aunt Hannah s friends who found that the young mistress of Hillside was a charming hostess There were also the Henshaw boys and there was always Calderwell at least so Bertram declared to himself sometimes Bertram came frequently to the little house on the hill even more frequently than William but Cyril was not seen there so often He came once at first it is true and followed Billy from room to room as she proudly displayed her new home He showed polite interest in her view and a perfunctory enjoyment of the tea she prepared for him But he did not come again for some time and when he did come he sat stiffly silent while his brothers did most of the talking As to Calderwell Calderwell seemed suddenly to have lost his interest in impenetrable forests and unclimbable mountains Nothing more intricate than the long Beacon Street boulevard or more inaccessible than Corey Hill seemed worth exploring apparently According to Calderwell s own version of it he had settled down he was going to be something that was something And he did spend sundry of his morning hours in a Boston law office with ponderous calf bound volumes spread in imposing array on the desk before him Other hours many hours he spent with Billy One day very soon in fact after she arrived in Boston Billy asked Calderwell about the Henshaws Tell me about them she said Tell me what they have been doing all these years Tell you about them Why don t you know She shook her head No Cyril says nothing William little more about themselves and you know what Bertram is One can hardly separate sense from nonsense with him You don t know then how splendidly Bertram has done with his art No only from the most casual hearsay Has he done well then Finely The public has been his for years and now the critics are tumbling over each other to do him honor They rave about his sensitive brilliant nervous touch whatever that may be his marvelous color sense his beauty of line and pose And they quarrel over whether it s realism or idealism that constitutes his charm I m so glad And is it still the Face of a Girl Yes only he s doing straight portraiture now as well It s got to be quite the thing to be done by Henshaw and there s many a fair lady that has graciously commissioned him to paint her portrait He s a fine fellow too a mighty fine fellow You may not know perhaps but three or four years ago he was well not wild but frolicsome he would probably have called it He got in with a lot of fellows that well that weren t good for a chap of Bertram s temperament Like mister Seaver Calderwell turned sharply Did YOU know Seaver he demanded in obvious surprise I used to SEE him with Bertram Oh Well he WAS one of them unfortunately But Bertram shipped him years ago Billy gave a sudden radiant smile but she changed the subject at once And mister William still collects I suppose she observed Jove I should say he did I ve forgotten the latest but he s a fine fellow too like Bertram And mister Cyril Calderwell frowned That chap s a poser for me Billy and no mistake I can t make him out What s the matter I don t know Probably I m not tuned to his pitch Bertram told me once that Cyril was very sensitively strung and never responded until a certain note was struck Well I haven t ever found that note I reckon Billy laughed I never heard Bertram say that but I think I know what he means and he s right too I begin to realize now what a jangling discord I must have created when I tried to harmonize with him three years ago But what is he doing in his music The other shrugged his shoulders Same thing Plays occasionally and plays well too but he s so erratic it s difficult to get him to do it Everything must be just so you know air light piano and audience He s got another book out I m told a profound treatise on somebody s something or other musical of course And he used to write music doesn t he do that any more I believe so I hear of it occasionally through musical friends of mine They even play it to me sometimes But I can t stand for much of it his stuff really Billy Stuff indeed And why not An odd hostility showed in Billy s eyes Again Calderwell shrugged his shoulders Don t ask me I don t know But they re always dead slow somber things with the wail of a lost spirit shrieking through them But I just love lost spirits that wail avowed Billy with more than a shade of reproach in her voice Calderwell stared then he shook his head Not in mine thank you he retorted whimsically I prefer my spirits of a more sane and cheerful sort The girl laughed but almost instantly she fell silent I ve been wondering she began musingly after a time why some one of those three men does not marry You wouldn t wonder if you knew them better declared Calderwell Now think Let s begin at the top of the Strata by the way Bertram s name for that establishment is mighty clever First Cyril according to Bertram Cyril hates all kinds of women and other confusion and I fancy Bertram hits it about right So that settles Cyril Then there s William you know William Any girl would say William was a dear but William isn t a MARRYING man Dad says Calderwell s voice softened a little dad says that William and his young wife were the most devoted couple that he ever saw and that when she died she seemed to take with her the whole of William s heart that is what hadn t gone with the baby a few years before There was a boy you know that died Yes I know nodded Billy quick tears in her eyes Aunt Hannah told me Well that counts out William then said Calderwell with an air of finality But how about Bertram You haven t settled Bertram laughed Billy archly Bertram Calderwell s eyes widened Billy can you imagine Bertram s making love in real earnest to a girl Why I don t know maybe Billy tipped her head from side to side as if she were viewing a picture set up for her inspection Well I can t In the first place no girl would think he was serious or if by any chance she did she d soon discover that it was the turn of her head or the tilt of her chin that he admired TO PAINT Now isn t that so Billy laughed but she did not answer It is and you know it declared Calderwell And that settles him Now you can see perhaps why none of these men will marry It was a long minute before Billy spoke Not a bit of it I don t see it at all she declared with roguish merriment Moreover I think that some day some one of them will marry Sir Doubtful Calderwell threw a quick glance into her eyes Evidently something he saw there sent a swift shadow to his own He waited a moment then asked abruptly Billy WON T you marry me Billy frowned though her eyes still laughed Hugh I told you not to ask me that again she demurred And I told you not to ask impossibilities of me he retorted imperturbably Billy won t you now seriously Seriously no Hugh Please don t let us go all over that again when we ve done it so many times No let s don t agreed the man cheerfully And we don t have to either if you ll only say yes now right away without any more fuss Billy sighed impatiently Hugh won t you understand that I m serious she cried then she turned suddenly with a peculiar flash in her eyes Hugh I don t believe Bertram himself could make love any more nonsensically than you can Calderwell laughed but he frowned too and again he threw into Billy s face that keenly questioning glance He said something a light something that brought the laugh to Billy s lips in spite of herself but he was still frowning when he left the house some minutes later and the shadow was not gone from his eyes CHAPTER XXIII BERTRAM DOES SOME QUESTIONING Billy s time was well occupied There were so many many things she wished to do and so few few hours in which to do them First there was her music She made arrangements at once to study with one of Boston s best piano teachers and she also made plans to continue her French and German She joined a musical club a literary club and a more strictly social club and to numerous church charities and philanthropic enterprises she lent more than her name giving freely of both time and money Friday afternoons of course were to be held sacred to the Symphony concerts and on certain Wednesday mornings there was to be a series of recitals in which she was greatly interested For Society with a capital S Billy cared little but for sociability with a small s she cared much and very wide she opened her doors to her friends lavishing upon them a wealth of hospitality Nor did they all come in carriages or automobiles these friends A certain pale faced little widow over at the South End knew just how good Miss Neilson s tea tasted on a crisp October afternoon and Marie Hawthorn a frail young woman who gave music lessons knew just how restful was Miss Neilson s couch after a weary day of long walks and fretful pupils But how in the world do you discover them all these forlorn specimens of humanity queried Bertram one evening when he had found Billy entertaining a freckled faced messenger boy with a plate of ice cream and a big square of cake Anywhere everywhere smiled Billy Well this last candidate for your favor who has just gone who s he I don t know beyond that his name is Tom and that he likes ice cream And you never saw him before Never Humph One wouldn t think it to see his charming air of nonchalant accustomedness Oh but it doesn t take much to make a little fellow like that feel at home laughed Billy And are you in the habit of feeding every one who comes to your house on ice cream and chocolate cake I thought that stone doorstep of yours was looking a little worn Not a bit of it retorted Billy This little chap came with a message just as I was finishing dinner The ice cream was particularly good to night and it occurred to me that he might like a taste so I gave it to him Bertram raised his eyebrows quizzically Very kind of course but why ice cream he questioned I thought it was roast beef and boiled potatoes that was supposed to be handed out to gaunt eyed hunger It is nodded Billy and that s why I think sometimes they d like ice cream and chocolate frosting Besides to give sugar plums one doesn t have to unwind yards of red tape or worry about pauperizing the poor To give red flannels and a ton of coal one must be properly circumspect and consult records and city missionaries of course and that s why it s such a relief sometimes just to hand over a simple little sugar plum and see them smile For a minute Bertram was silent then he asked abruptly Billy why did you leave the Strata Billy was taken quite by surprise A pink flush spread to her forehead and her tongue stumbled at first over her reply Why I it seemed you why I left to go to Hampden Falls to be sure Don t you remember she finished gaily Oh yes I remember THAT conceded Bertram with disdainful emphasis But why did you go to Hampden Falls Why it it was the only place to go that is I WANTED to go there she corrected hastily Didn t Aunt Hannah tell you that I I was homesick to get back there Oh yes Aunt Hannah SAID that observed the man but wasn t that homesickness a little sudden Billy blushed pink again Why maybe but well homesickness is always more or less sudden isn t it she parried Bertram laughed but his eyes grew suddenly almost tender See here Billy you can t bluff worth a cent he declared You are much too refreshingly frank for that Something was the trouble Now what was it Won t you tell me please Billy pouted She hesitated and gazed anywhere but into the challenging eyes before her Then very suddenly she looked straight into them Very well there WAS a reason for my leaving she confessed a little breathlessly I didn t want to bother you any more all of you Bother us No I found out You couldn t paint mister Cyril couldn t play or write and and everything was different because I was there But I didn t blame you no no she assured him hastily It was only that I found out And may I ask HOW you obtained this most extraordinary information demanded Bertram savagely Billy shook her head Her round little chin looked suddenly square and determined You may ask but I shall not tell she declared firmly If Bertram had known Billy just a little better he would have let the matter drop there but he did not know Billy so he asked Was it anything I did or said The girl did not answer Billy was it Bertram s voice showed terror now Billy laughed unexpectedly Do you think I m going to say no to a series of questions and then give the whole thing away by my silence when you come to the right one she demanded merrily No sir Well anyhow it wasn t I then sighed the man in relief for you just observed that you were not going to say no to a series of questions and that was the first one So I ve found out that much anyhow he concluded triumphantly The girl eyed him for a moment in silence then she shook her head I m not going to be caught that way either she smiled You know just what you did in the first place about it nothing The man stirred restlessly and pondered After a long pause he adopted new tactics With a searching study of her face to note the slightest change he enumerated Was it Cyril then Will Aunt Hannah Kate It couldn t have been Pete or Dong Ling Billy still smiled inscrutably At no name had Bertram detected so much as the flicker of an eyelid and with a glance half admiring half chagrined he fell back into his chair I ll give it up You ve won he acknowledged But Billy his manner changed suddenly I wonder if you know just what a hole you left in the Strata when you went away But I couldn t have in the whole Strata objected Billy I occupied only one stratum and a stratum doesn t go up and down you know only across and mine was the second floor Bertram gave a slow shake of his head I know but yours was a freak formation he maintained gravely It DID go up and down Honestly Billy we did care lots Will and I were inconsolable and even Cyril played dirges for a week Did he gurgled Billy with sudden joyousness I m so glad Thank you murmured Bertram disapprovingly We hadn t considered it a subject for exultation What Oh I didn t mean that That is she stopped helplessly Oh never mind about trying to explain interposed Bertram I fancy the remedy would be worse than the disease in this case Nonsense I only meant that I like to be missed sometimes retorted Billy a little nettled And you rejoice then to have me mope Cyril play dirges and Will wander mournfully about the house with Spunkie in his arms You should have seen William If his forlornness did not bring tears to your eyes the grace of the pink bow that lopped behind Spunkie s left ear would surely have brought a copious flow Billy laughed but her eyes grew tender Did Uncle William do that she asked He did and he did more Pete told me after a time that you had not left one thing in the house anywhere but one day over behind William s most treasured Lowestoft I found a small shell hairpin and a flat brown silk button that I recognized as coming from one of your dresses Oh said Billy softly Dear Uncle William and how good he was to me CHAPTER XXIV CYRIL THE ENIGMA Perhaps it was because Billy saw so little of Cyril that it was Cyril whom she wished particularly to see William Bertram Calderwell all her other friends came frequently to the little house on the hill Billy told herself only Cyril held aloof and it was Cyril that she wanted Billy said that it was his music that she wanted to hear him play and that she wanted him to hear her She felt grieved and chagrined Not once since she had come had he seemed interested really interested in her music He had asked her it is true in a perfunctory way what she had done and who her teachers had been But all the while she was answering she had felt that he was not listening that he did not care And she cared so much She knew now that all her practising through the long hard months of study had been for Cyril Every scale had been smoothed for his ears and every phrase had been interpreted with his approbation in view Across the wide waste of waters his face had shone like a star of promise beckoning her on and on to heights unknown And now she was here in Boston but she could not even play the scale nor interpret the phrase for the ear to which they had been so laboriously attuned and Cyril s face in the flesh was no beckoning star of promise but was a thing as cold and relentless as was the waste of waters across which it had shone in the past Billy did not understand it She knew it is true of Cyril s reputed aversion to women in general and to noise but she was neither women in general nor noise she told herself indignantly She was only the little maid grown three years older who had sat at his feet and adoringly listened to all that he had been pleased to say in the old days at the top of the Strata And he had been kind then very kind Billy declared stoutly He had been patient and interested too and he had seemed not only willing but glad to teach her while now Sometimes Billy thought she would ask him candidly what was the matter But it was always the old frank Billy that thought this the impulsive Billy that had gone up to Cyril s rooms years before and cheerfully announced that she had come to get acquainted It was never the sensible circumspect Billy that Aunt Hannah had for three years been shaping and coaxing into being But even this Billy frowned rebelliously and declared that sometime something should be said that would at least give him a chance to explain In all the weeks since Billy s purchase of Hillside Cyril had been there only twice and it was nearly Thanksgiving now Billy had seen him once or twice also at the Beacon Street house when she and Aunt Hannah had dined there but on all these occasions he had been either the coldly reserved guest or the painfully punctilious host Never had he been in the least approachable He treats me exactly as he treated poor little Spunk that first night Billy declared hotly to herself Only once since she came had Billy heard Cyril play and that was when she had shared the privilege with hundreds of others at a public concert She had sat then entranced with her eyes on the clean cut handsome profile of the man who played with so sure a skill and power yet without a note before him Afterward she had met him face to face and had tried to tell him how moved she was but in her agitation and because of a strange shyness that had suddenly come to her she had ended only in stammering out some flippant banality that had brought to his face merely a bored smile of acknowledgment Twice she had asked him to play for her but each time he had begged to be excused courteously but decidedly It s no use to tease Bertram had interposed once with an airy wave of his hands This lion always did refuse to roar to order If you really must hear him you ll have to slip up stairs and camp outside his door waiting patiently for such crumbs as may fall from his table Aren t your metaphors a little mixed questioned Cyril irritably Yes sir acknowledged Bertram with unruffled temper but I don t mind if Billy doesn t I only meant her to understand that she d have to do as she used to do listen outside your door Billy s cheeks reddened But that is what I sha n t do she retorted with spirit And moreover I still have hopes that some day he ll play to me Maybe conceded Bertram doubtfully if the stool and the piano and the pedals and the weather and his fingers and your ears and my watch are all just right then he ll play Nonsense scowled Cyril I ll play of course some day But I d rather not today And there the matter had ended Since then Billy had not asked him to play CHAPTER XXV THE OLD ROOM AND BILLY Thanksgiving was to be a great day in the Henshaw family The Henshaw brothers were to entertain Billy and Aunt Hannah had been invited to dinner and so joyously hospitable was William s invitation that it would have included the new kitten and the canary if Billy would have consented to bring them Once more Pete swept and garnished the house and once more Dong Ling spoiled uncounted squares of chocolate trying to make the baffling fudge Bertram said that the entire Strata was a quiver Not but that Billy and Aunt Hannah had visited there before but that this was different They were to come at noon this time This visit was not to be a tantalizing little piece of stiffness an hour and a half long It was to be a satisfying whole souled matter of half a day s comradeship almost like old times So once more the roses graced the rooms and a flaring pink bow adorned Spunkie s fat neck and once more Bertram placed his latest Face of a Girl in the best possible light There was still a difference however for this time Cyril did not bring any music down to the piano nor display anywhere a copy of his newest book The dinner was to be at three o clock but by special invitation the guests were to arrive at twelve and promptly at the appointed hour they came There this is something like exulted Bertram when the ladies divested of their wraps toasted their feet before the open fire in his den Indeed it is for now I ve time to see everything everything you ve done since I ve been gone cried Billy gazing eagerly about her Hm m well THAT wasn t what I meant shrugged Bertram Of course not but it s what I meant retorted Billy And there are other things too I expect there are half a dozen new Old Blues and black basalts that I want to see eh Uncle William she finished smiling into the eyes of the man who had been gazing at her with doting pride for the last five minutes Ho Will isn t on teapots now quoth Bertram before his brother had a chance to reply You might dangle the oldest Old Blue that ever was before him now and he d pay scant attention if he happened at the same time to get his eyes on some old pewter chain with a green stone in it Billy laughed but at the look of genuine distress that came into William s face she sobered at once Don t you let him tease you Uncle William she said quickly I m sure pewter chains with green stones in them sound just awfully interesting and I want to see them right away now Come she finished springing to her feet take me up stairs please and show them to me William shook his head and said No no protesting that what he had were scarcely worth her attention but even while he talked he rose to his feet and advanced half eagerly half reluctantly toward the door Nonsense said Billy fondly as she laid her hand on his arm I know they are very much worth seeing Come And she led the way from the room Oh oh she exclaimed a few moments later as she stood before a small cabinet in one of William s rooms Oh oh how pretty Do you like them I thought you would triumphed William quick joy driving away the anxious fear in his eyes You see I I thought of you when I got them every one of them I thought you d like them But I haven t very many yet of course This is the latest one And he tenderly lifted from its black velvet mat a curious silver necklace made of small flat chain linked disks heavily chased and set at regular intervals with a strange blue green stone Billy hung above it enraptured Oh what a beauty And this I suppose is Bertram s pewter chain Pewter indeed she scoffed Tell me Uncle William where did you get it And uncle William told happily thirstily drinking in Billy s evident interest with delight There were too a quaintly set ring and a cat s eye brooch and to each belonged a story which William was equally glad to tell There were other treasures also buckles rings brooches and necklaces some of dull gold some of equally dull silver but all of odd design and curious workmanship studded here and there with bits of red green yellow blue and flame colored stones Very learnedly then from William s lips fell the new vocabulary that had come to him with his latest treasures chrysoprase carnelian girasol onyx plasma sardonyx lapis lazuli tourmaline chrysolite hyacinth and carbuncle They are lovely perfectly lovely breathed Billy when the last chain had slipped through her fingers into William s hand I think they are the very nicest things you ever collected So do I agreed the man emphatically And they are different too They are said Billy very different But she was not looking at the jewelry her eyes were on a small shell hairpin and a brown silk button half hidden behind a Lowestoft teapot On the way down stairs William stopped a moment at Billy s old rooms I wish you were here now he said wistfully They re all ready for you these rooms Oh but why don t you use them such pretty rooms cried Billy quickly William gave a gesture of dissent We have no use for them besides they belong to you and Aunt Hannah You left your imprint long ago my dear we should not feel at home in them Oh but you should You mustn t feel like that objected Billy hurriedly crossing the room to the window to hide a sudden nervousness that had assailed her And here s my piano too and open she finished gaily dropping herself upon the piano stool and dashing into a brilliant mazourka Billy like Cyril had a way of working off her moods at her finger tips and to day the tripping notes and crashing chords told of a nervous excitement that was not all joy From the doorway William watched her flying fingers with fond pride and it was very reluctantly that he acceded to Pete s request to go down stairs for a moment to settle a vexed question concerning the table decorations Billy left alone still played but with a difference The tripping notes slowed into a weird melody that rose and fell and lost itself in the exquisite harmony that had been born of the crashing chords Billy was improvising now and into her music had crept something of her old time longing when she had come to that house a lonely orphan girl in search of a home On and on she played then with a discordant note she suddenly rose from the piano She was thinking of Kate and wondering if had Kate not managed the little room would still be home So swiftly did Billy cross to the door that the man on the stairs outside had not time to get quite out of sight Billy did not see his face however she saw only a pair of gray trousered legs disappearing around the curve of the landing above She thought nothing of it until later when dinner was announced and Cyril came down stairs then she saw that he and he only that afternoon wore trousers of that particular shade of gray The dinner was a great success Even the chocolate fudge in the little cut glass bonbon dishes was perfect and it was a question whether Pete or Dong Ling tried the harder to please After dinner the family gathered in the drawing room and chatted pleasantly Bertram displayed his prettiest and newest pictures and Billy played and sung bright tuneful little things that she knew Aunt Hannah and Uncle William liked If Cyril was pleased or displeased he did not show it but Billy had ceased to play for Cyril s ears She told herself that she did not care but she did wonder was that Cyril on the stairs and if so what was he doing there CHAPTER XXVI MUSIC HATH CHARMS Two days after Thanksgiving Cyril called at Hillside I ve come to hear you play he announced abruptly Billy s heart sung within her but her temper rose Did he think then that he had but to beckon and she would come and at this late day she asked herself Aloud she said Play But this is so sudden Besides you have heard me The man made a disdainful gesture Not that I mean play really play Billy why haven t you played to me before Billy s chin rose perceptibly Why haven t you asked me she parried To Billy s surprise the man answered this with calm directness Because Calderwell said that you were a dandy player and I don t care for dandy players Billy laughed now And how do you know I m not a dandy player Sir Impertinent she demanded Because I ve heard you when you weren t Thank you murmured Billy Cyril shrugged his shoulders Oh you know very well what I mean he defended I ve heard you that s all When That doesn t signify Billy was silent for a moment her eyes gravely studying his face Then she asked Were you long on that stairway Eh What Oh Cyril s forehead grew suddenly pink Well he finished a little aggressively Oh nothing smiled the girl Of course people who live in glass houses must not throw stones Very well then I did listen acknowledged the man testily I liked what you were playing I hoped down stairs later that you d play it again but you didn t I came to day to hear it Again Billy s heart sung within her but again her temper rose too I don t think I feel like it she said sweetly with a shake of her head Not to day For a brief moment Cyril stared frowningly then his face lighted with his rare smile I m fairly checkmated he said rising to his feet and going straight to the piano For long minutes he played modulating from one enchanting composition to another and finishing with the one all chords with big bass notes that marched on and on the one Billy had sat long ago on the stairs to hear There Now will you play for me he asked rising to his feet and turning reproachful eyes upon her Billy too rose to her feet Her face was flushed and her eyes were shining Her lips quivered with emotion As was always the case Cyril s music had carried her quite out of herself Oh thank you thank you she sighed You don t know you can t know how beautiful it all is to me Thank you Then surely now you ll play to me he returned A look of real distress came to Billy s face But I can t not what you heard the other day she cried remorsefully You see I was only improvising Cyril turned quickly Only improvising Billy did you ever write it down any of your improvising An embarrassed red flew to Billy s face Not not that amounted to well that is some a little she stammered Let me see it No no I couldn t not YOU Again the rare smile lighted Cyril s eyes Billy let me see that paper please Very slowly the girl turned toward the music cabinet She hesitated glanced once more appealingly into Cyril s face then with nervous haste opened the little mahogany door and took from one of the shelves a sheet of manuscript music But like a shy child with her first copy book she held it half behind her back as she came toward the piano Thank you said Cyril as he reached far out for the music The next moment he seated himself again at the piano Twice he played the little song through carefully slowly Now sing it he directed Falteringly in a very faint voice and with very many breaths taken where they should not have been taken Billy obeyed When we want to show off your song Billy we won t ask you to sing it observed the man dryly when she had finished Billy laughed and dimpled into a blush When I want to show off my song I sha n t be singing it to you for the first time she pouted Cyril did not answer He was playing over and over certain harmonies in the music before him Hm m I see you ve studied your counterpoint to some purpose he vouchsafed finally then Where did you get the words The girl hesitated The flush had deepened on her face Well I she stopped and gave an embarrassed laugh I m like the small boy who made the toys I got them all out of my own head and there s wood enough to make another Hm m indeed grunted the man Well have you made any others One or two maybe Let me see them please I think we ve had enough for today she faltered I haven t Besides if I could have a couple more to go with this it would make a very pretty little group of songs To go with this What do you mean To the publishers of course The PUBLISHERS Certainly Did you think you were going to keep these songs to yourself But they aren t worth it They can t be good enough Unbelieving joy was in Billy s voice No Well we ll let others decide that observed Cyril with a shrug All is if you ve got any more wood like this I advise you to make it up right away But I have already cried the girl excitedly There are lots of little things that I ve that is there are some she corrected hastily at the look that sprang into Cyril s eyes Oh there are laughed Cyril Well we ll see what But he did not see He did not even finish his sentence for Billy s maid Rosa appeared just then with a card Show mister Calderwell in here said Billy Cyril said nothing aloud which was well His thoughts just then were better left unspoken CHAPTER XXVII MARIE WHO LONGS TO MAKE PUDDINGS Wonderful days came then to Billy Four songs it seemed had been pronounced by competent critics decidedly worth it unmistakably good enough and they were to be brought out as soon as possible Of course you understand explained Cyril that there s no hit expected Thank heaven they aren t that sort And there s no great money in it either You d have to write a masterpiece like She s my Ju Ju Baby or some such gem to get the hit and the money But the songs are fine and they ll take with cultured hearers We ll get them introduced by good singers of course and they ll be favorites soon for the concert stage and for parlors Billy saw a good deal of Cyril now Already she was at work rewriting and polishing some of her half completed melodies and Cyril was helping her by his interest as well as by his criticism He was in fact at the house very frequently too frequently indeed to suit either Bertram or Calderwell Even William frowned sometimes when his cozy chats with Billy were interrupted by Cyril s appearing with a roll of new music for her to try though William told himself that he ought to be thankful if there was anything that could make Cyril more companionable less reserved and morose And Cyril WAS different there was no disputing that Calderwell said that he had come out of his shell and Bertram told Billy that she must have found his note and struck it good and hard Billy was very happy To the little music teacher Marie Hawthorn she talked more freely perhaps than she did to any one else It s so wonderful Marie so wonderfully wonderful she said one day to sit here in my own room and sing a little song that comes from somewhere anywhere out of the sky itself Then by and by that little song will fly away away over land and sea and some day it will touch somebody s heart just as it has touched mine Oh Marie is it not wonderful It is dear and it is not Your songs could not help reaching somebody s heart There s nothing wonderful in that Sweet flatterer But I mean it They are beautiful and so is mister Henshaw s music Yes it is murmured Billy abstractedly There was a long pause then Marie asked with shy hesitation Do you think Miss Billy that he would care I listened yesterday when he was playing to you I was up here in your room but when I heard the music I I went out on the stairs and sat down Was it very bad of me Billy laughed happily If it was he can t say anything she reassured her He s done the same thing himself and so have I HE has done it Yes It was at his home last Thanksgiving It was then that he found out about my improvising Oh h Marie s eyes were wistful And he cares so much now for your music Does he Do you think he does demanded Billy I know he does and for the one who makes it too Nonsense laughed Billy with pinker cheeks It s the music not the musician that pleases him mister Cyril doesn t like women He doesn t like women No But don t look so shocked my dear Every one who knows mister Cyril knows that But I don t think I believe it demurred Marie gazing straight into Billy s eyes I m sure I don t believe it Under the little music teacher s steady gaze Billy flushed again The laugh she gave was an embarrassed one but through it vibrated a pleased ring Nonsense she exclaimed springing to her feet and moving restlessly about the room With the next breath she had changed the subject to one far removed from mister Cyril and his likes and dislikes Some time later Billy played and it was then that Marie drew a long sigh How beautiful it must be to play like that she breathed As if you a music teacher could not play laughed Billy Not like that dear You know it is not like that Billy frowned But you are so accurate Marie and you can read at sight so rapidly Oh yes like a little machine I know scorned the usually gentle Marie bitterly Don t they have a thing of metal that adds figures like magic Well I m like that I see g and I play g I see d and I play d I see f and I play f and after I ve seen enough g s and d s and f s and played them all the thing is done I ve played Why Marie Marie my dear The second exclamation was very tender for Marie was crying There I knew I should some day have it out all out sobbed Marie I felt it coming Then perhaps you ll you ll feel better now stammered Billy She tried to say more other words that would have been a real comfort but her tongue refused to speak them She knew so well so woefully well how very wooden and mechanical the little music teacher s playing always had been But that Marie should realize it herself like this the tragedy of it made Billy s heart ache At Marie s next words however Billy caught her breath in surprise But you see it wasn t music it wasn t ever music that I wanted to do she confessed It wasn t music But what I don t understand murmured Billy No I suppose not sighed the other You play so beautifully yourself But I thought you loved music I do I love it dearly in others But I can t I don t want to make it myself But what do you want to do Marie laughed suddenly Do you know my dear I have half a mind to tell you what I do like to do just to make you stare Well Billy s eyes were wide with interest I like best of anything to darn stockings and make puddings Marie Rank heresy isn t it smiled Marie tearfully But I do truly I love to weave the threads evenly in and out and see a big hole close As for the puddings I don t mean the common bread and butter kind but the ones that have whites of eggs and fruit and pretty quivery jellies all ruby and amber lights you know You dear little piece of domesticity laughed Billy Then why in the world don t you do these things I can t in my own kitchen I can t afford a kitchen to do them in And I just couldn t do them right along in other people s kitchens But why do you play I was brought up to it You know we had money once lots of it sighed Marie as if she were deploring a misfortune And mother was determined to have me musical Even then as a little tot I liked pudding making and after my mud pie days I was always begging mother to let me go down into the kitchen to cook But she wouldn t allow it ever She engaged the most expensive masters and set me practising always practising I simply had to learn music and I learned it like the adding machine Then afterward when father died and then mother and the money flew away why of course I had to do something so naturally I turned to the music It was all I could do But well you know how it is dear I teach and teach well perhaps so far as the mechanical part goes but as for the rest I am always longing for a cozy corner with a basket of stockings to mend or a kitchen where there is a pudding waiting to be made You poor dear cried Billy I ve a pair of stockings now that needs attention and I ve been just longing for one of your quivery jellies all ruby and amber lights ever since you mentioned them But well is there anything I could do to help Nothing thank you sighed Marie rising wearily to her feet and covering her eyes with her hand for a moment My head aches shockingly but I ve got to go this minute and instruct little Jennie Knowls how to play the wonderful scale of G with a black key in it Besides you do help me you have helped me you are always helping me dear she added remorsefully and it s wicked of me to make that shadow come to your eyes Please don t think of it or of me any more And with a choking little sob she hurried from the room followed by the amazed questioning sorrowful eyes of Billy CHAPTER XXVIII I M GOING TO WIN Nearly all of Billy s friends knew that Bertram Henshaw was in love with Billy Neilson before Billy herself knew it Not that they regarded it as anything serious it s only Bertram was still said of him on almost all occasions But to Bertram himself it was very serious The world to Bertram indeed had come to assume a vastly different aspect from what it had displayed in times past Heretofore it had been a plaything which like a juggler s tinsel ball might be tossed from hand to hand at will Now it was no plaything no glittering bauble It was something big and serious and splendid because Billy lived in it something that demanded all his powers to do and be because Billy was watching something that might be a Hades of torment or an Elysium of bliss according to whether Billy said no or yes Since Thanksgiving Bertram had known that it was love this consuming fire within him and since Thanksgiving he had known too that it was jealousy this fierce hatred of Calderwell He was ashamed of the hatred He told himself that it was unmanly unkind and unreasonable and he vowed that he would overcome it At times he even fancied that he had overcome it but always the sight of Calderwell in Billy s little drawing room or of even the man s card on Billy s silver tray was enough to show him that he had not There were others too who annoyed Bertram not a little foremost of these being his own brothers Still he was not really worried about William and Cyril he told himself William he did not consider to be a marrying man and Cyril every one knew that Cyril was a woman hater He was doubtless attracted now only by Billy s music There was no real rivalry to be feared from William and Cyril But there was always Calderwell and Calderwell was serious Bertram decided therefore after some weeks of feverish unrest that the only road to peace lay through a frank avowal of his feelings and a direct appeal to Billy to give him the great boon of her love Just here however Bertram met with an unexpected difficulty He could not find words with which to make his avowal or to present his appeal He was surprised and annoyed Never before had he been at a loss for words mere words And it was not that he lacked opportunity He walked drove and talked with Billy and always she was companionable attentive to what he had to say Never was she cold or reserved Never did she fail to greet him with a cheery smile Bertram concluded indeed after a time that she was too companionable too cheery He wished she would hesitate stammer blush be a little shy He wished that she would display surprise annoyance even anything but that eternal air of comradeship And then one afternoon in the early twilight of a January day he freed his mind quite unexpectedly Billy I wish you WOULDN T be so so friendly he exclaimed in a voice that was almost sharp Billy laughed at first but the next moment a shamed distress drove the merriment quite out of her face You mean that I presume on on our friendship she stammered That you fear that I will again shadow your footsteps It was the first time since the memorable night itself that Billy had ever in Bertram s presence referred to her young guardianship of his welfare She realized now suddenly that she had just been giving the man before her some very sisterly advice and the thought sent a confused red to her cheeks Bertram turned quickly Billy that was the dearest and loveliest thing a girl ever did only I was too great a chump to appreciate it finished Bertram in a voice that was not quite steady Thank you smiled the girl with a slow shake of her head and a relieved look in her eyes but I m afraid I can t quite agree to that The next moment she had demanded mischievously Why then pray this unflattering objection to my friendliness now Because I don t want you for a friend or a sister or anything else that s related stormed Bertram with sudden vehemence I don t want you for anything but a wife Billy WON T you marry me Again Billy laughed laughed until she saw the pained anger leap to the gray eyes before her then she became grave at once Bertram forgive me I didn t think you could you can t be serious But I am Billy shook her head But you don t love me not ME Bertram It s only the turn of my head or or the tilt of my chin that you love to paint she protested unconsciously echoing the words Calderwell had said to her weeks before I m only another Face of a Girl You re the only Face of a girl to me now Billy declared the man with disarming tenderness No no not that demurred Billy in distress You don t mean it You only think you do It couldn t be that It can t be But it is dear I think I have loved you ever since that night long ago when I saw your dear startled face appealing to me from beyond Seaver s hateful smile And Billy I never went once with Seaver again anywhere Did you know that No but I m glad so glad And I m glad too So you see I must have loved you then though unconsciously perhaps and I love you now No no please don t say that It can t be it really can t be I I don t love you that way Bertram The man paled a little Billy forgive me for asking but it s so much to me is it that there is some one else His voice shook No no indeed There is no one It s not Calderwell Billy s forehead grew pink She laughed nervously No no never But there are others so many others Nonsense Bertram there s no one no one I assure you It s not William of course nor Cyril Cyril hates women A deeper flush came to Billy s face Her chin rose a little and an odd defiance flashed from her eyes But almost instantly it was gone and a slow smile had come to her lips Yes I know Every one says that Cyril hates women she observed demurely Then Billy I sha n t give up vowed Bertram softly Sometime you WILL love me No no I couldn t That is I m not going to to marry stammered Billy Not going to marry No There s my music you know how I love that and how much it is to me I don t think there ll ever be a man that I ll love better Bertram lifted his head Very slowly he rose till his splendid six feet of clean limbed strength and manly beauty towered away above the low chair in which Billy sat His mouth showed new lines about the corners and his eyes looked down very tenderly at the girl beside him but his voice when he spoke had a light whimsicality that deceived even Billy s ears And so it s music a cold senseless thing of spidery marks on clean white paper that is my only rival he cried Then I ll warn you Billy I ll warn you I m going to win And with that he was gone CHAPTER XXIX I M NOT GOING TO MARRY Billy did not know whether to be more amazed or amused at Bertram s proposal of marriage She was vexed she was very sure of that To marry Bertram Absurd Then she reflected that after all it was only Bertram so she calmed herself Still it was annoying She liked Bertram she had always liked him He was a nice boy and a most congenial companion He never bored her as did some others and he was always thoughtful of cushions and footstools and cups of tea when one was tired He was in fact an ideal friend just the sort she wanted and it was such a pity that he must spoil it all now with this silly sentimentality And of course he had spoiled it all There was no going back now to their old friendliness He would be morose or silly by turns according to whether she frowned or smiled or else he would take himself off in a tragic sort of way that was very disturbing He had said to be sure that he would win Win indeed As if she could marry Bertram When she married her choice would fall upon a man not a boy a big grave earnest man to whom the world meant something a man who loved music of course a man who would single her out from all the world and show to her and to her only the depth and tenderness of his love a man who but she was not going to marry anyway remembered Billy suddenly And with that she began to cry The whole thing was so tiresome she declared and so absurd Billy rather dreaded her next meeting with Bertram She feared she knew not what But as it turned out she need not have feared anything for he met her tranquilly cheerfully as usual and he did nothing and said nothing that he might not have done and said before that twilight chat took place Billy was relieved She concluded that after all Bertram was going to be sensible She decided that she too would be sensible She would accept him on this his chosen plane and she would think no more of his nonsense Billy threw herself then even more enthusiastically into her beloved work She told Marie that after all was said and done there could not be any man that would tip the scales one inch with music on the other side She was a little hurt it is true when Marie only laughed and answered But what if the man and the music both happen to be on the same side my dear what then Marie s voice was wistful in spite of the laugh so wistful that it reminded Billy of their conversation a few weeks before But it is you Marie who want the stockings to darn and the puddings to make she retorted playfully Not I And do you know I believe I shall turn matchmaker yet and find you a man and the chiefest of his qualifications shall be that he s wretchedly hard on his hose and that he adores puddings No no Miss Billy don t please begged the other in quick terror Forget all I said the other day please do Don t tell anybody She was so obviously distressed and frightened that Billy was puzzled There there twas only a jest of course she soothed her But really Marie it is the dear domestic little mouse like yourself that ought to be somebody s wife and that s the kind men are looking for too Marie gave a slow shake of her head Not the kind of man that is somebody that does something she objected and that s the only kind I could love HE wants a wife that is beautiful and clever that can do things like himself LIKE HIMSELF she iterated feverishly Billy opened wide her eyes Why Marie one would think you already knew such a man she cried The little music teacher changed her position and turned her eyes away I do of course she retorted in a merry voice lots of them Don t you Come we ve discussed my matrimonial prospects quite long enough she went on lightly You know we started with yours Suppose we go back to those But I haven t any demurred Billy as she turned with a smile to greet Aunt Hannah who had just entered the room I m not going to marry am I Aunt Hannah Er what Marry My grief and conscience what a question Billy Of course you re going to marry when the time comes exclaimed Aunt Hannah Billy laughed and shook her head vigorously But even as she opened her lips to reply Rosa appeared and announced that mister Calderwell was waiting down stairs Billy was angry then for after the maid was gone the merriment in Aunt Hannah s laugh only matched that in Marie s and the intonation was unmistakable Well I m not declared Billy with pink cheeks and much indignation as she left the room And as if to convince herself Marie Aunt Hannah and all the world that such was the case she refused Calderwell so decidedly that night when he for the half dozenth time laid his hand and heart at her feet that even Calderwell himself was convinced so far as his own case was concerned and left town the next day Bertram told Aunt Hannah afterward that he understood mister Calderwell had gone to parts unknown To himself Bertram shamelessly owned that the more unknown they were the better he himself would be pleased CHAPTER XXX MARIE FINDS A FRIEND It was on a very cold January afternoon and Cyril was hurrying up the hill toward Billy s house when he was startled to see a slender young woman sitting on a curbstone with her head against an electric light post He stopped abruptly I beg your pardon but why Miss Hawthorn It is Miss Hawthorn isn t it Under his questioning eyes the girl s pale face became so painfully scarlet that in sheer pity the man turned his eyes away He thought he had seen women blush before but he decided now that he had not I m sure haven t I met you at Miss Neilson s Are you ill Can t I do something for you he begged Yes no that is I AM Miss Hawthorn and I ve met you at Miss Neilson s stammered the girl faintly But there isn t anything thank you that you can do mister Henshaw I stopped to rest The man frowned But surely pardon me Miss Hawthorn but I can t think it your usual custom to choose an icy curbstone for a resting place with the thermometer down to zero You must be ill Let me take you to Miss Neilson s No no thank you cried the girl struggling to her feet the vivid red again flooding her face I have a lesson to give Nonsense You re not fit to give a lesson Besides they are all folderol anyway half of them A dozen lessons more or less won t make any difference they ll play just as well and just as atrociously Come I insist upon taking you to Miss Neilson s No no thank you I really mustn t I She could say no more A strong yet very gentle hand had taken firm hold of her arm in such a way as half to support her A force quite outside of herself was carrying her forward step by step and Miss Hawthorn was not used to strong gentle hands nor yet to a force quite outside of herself Neither was she accustomed to walk arm in arm with mister Cyril Henshaw to Miss Billy s door When she reached there her cheeks were like red roses for color and her eyes were like the stars for brightness Yet a minute later confronted by Miss Billy s astonished eyes the stars and the roses fled and a very white faced girl fell over in a deathlike faint in Cyril Henshaw s arms Marie was put to bed in the little room next to Billy s and was peremptorily hushed when faint remonstrance was made The next morning white faced and wide eyed she resolutely pulled herself half upright and announced that she was all well and must go home home to Marie was a six by nine hall bed room in a South End lodging house Very gently Billy pushed her back on the pillow and laid a detaining hand on her arm No dear Now please be sensible and listen to reason You are my guest You did not know it perhaps for I m afraid the invitation got a little delayed But you re to stay oh lots of weeks I stay here Why I can t indeed I can t protested Marie But that isn t a bit of a nice way to accept an invitation disapproved Billy You should say Thank you I d be delighted I m sure and I ll stay In spite of herself the little music teacher laughed and in the laugh her tense muscles relaxed Miss Billy Miss Billy what is one to do with you Surely you know you must know that I can t do what you ask I m sure I don t see why not argued Billy I m merely giving you an invitation and all you have to do is to accept it But the invitation is only the kind way your heart has of covering another of your many charities objected Marie besides I have to teach I have my living to earn But you can t demurred the other That s just the trouble Don t you see The doctor said last night that you must not teach again this winter Not teach again this winter No no he could not be so cruel as that It wasn t cruel dear it was kind You would be ill if you attempted it Now you ll get better He says all you need is rest and care and that s exactly what I mean my guest shall have Quick tears came to the sick girl s eyes There couldn t be a kinder heart than yours Miss Billy she murmured but I couldn t I really couldn t be a burden to you like this I shall go to some hospital But you aren t going to be a burden You are going to be my friend and companion A companion and in bed like this Well THAT wouldn t be impossible smiled Billy but as it happens you won t have to put that to the test for you ll soon be up and dressed The doctor says so Now surely you will stay There was a long pause The little music teacher s eyes had left Billy s face and were circling the room wistfully lingering on the hangings of filmy lace the dainty wall covering and the exquisite water colors in their white and gold frames At last she drew a deep sigh Yes I ll stay she breathed rapturously but you must let me help Help Help what Help you your letters your music copying your accounts anything everything And if you don t let me help the music teacher s voice was very stern now if you don t let me help I shall go home just as soon as I can walk Dear me dimpled Billy And is that all Well you shall help and to your heart s content too In fact I m not at all sure that I sha n t keep you darning stockings and making puddings all the time she added mischievously as she left the room Miss Hawthorn sat up the next day The day following in one of Billy s fluttery wrappers as she called them she walked all about the room Very soon she was able to go down stairs and in an astonishingly short time she fitted into the daily life as if she had always been there She was moreover of such assistance to Billy that even she herself could see the value of her work and so she stayed content The little music teacher saw a good deal of Billy s friends then particularly of the Henshaw brothers and very glad was Billy to see the comradeship growing between them She had known that William would be kind to the orphan girl but she had feared that Marie would not understand Bertram s nonsense or Cyril s reserve But very soon Bertram had begged and obtained permission to try to reproduce on canvas the sheen of the fine fair hair and the veiled bloom of the rose leaf skin that were Marie s greatest charms and already Cyril had unbent from his usual stiffness enough to play to her twice So Billy s fears on that score were at an end CHAPTER XXXI THE ENGAGEMENT OF ONE Many times during those winter days Billy thought of Marie s words But what if the man and the music both happen to be on the same side They worried her to some extent and curiously they pleased and displeased her at the same time She told herself that she knew very well of course what Marie meant it was Cyril he was the man and the music But was Cyril beginning to care for her and did she want him to Very seriously one day Billy asked herself these questions very calmly she argued the matter in her mind as was Billy s way She was proud certainly of what her influence had apparently done for Cyril She was gratified that to her he was showing the real depth and beauty of his nature It WAS flattering to feel that she and only she had thus won the regard of a professional woman hater Then besides all this there was his music his glorious music Think of the bliss of living ever with that Imagine life with a man whose soul would be so perfectly attuned to hers that existence would be one grand harmony Ah that truly would be the ideal marriage But she had planned not to marry Billy frowned now and tapped her foot nervously It was indeed most puzzling this question and she did not want to make a mistake Then too she did not wish to wound Cyril If the dear man HAD come out of his icy prison and were reaching out timid hands to her for her help her interest her love the tragedy of it if he met with no response This vision of Cyril with outstretched hands and of herself with cold averted eyes was the last straw in the balance with Billy She decided suddenly that she did care for Cyril a little and that she probably could care for him a great deal With this thought Billy blushed already in her own mind she was as good as pledged to Cyril It was a great change for Billy this sudden leap from girlhood and irresponsibility to womanhood and care but she took it fearlessly resolutely If she was to be Cyril s wife she must make herself fit for it and in pursuance of this high ideal she followed Marie into the kitchen the very next time the little music teacher went out to make one of her dainty desserts that the family liked so well I ll just watch if you don t mind announced Billy Why of course not smiled Marie but I thought you didn t like to make puddings I don t owned Billy cheerfully Then why this watchfulness Nothing only I thought it might be just as well if I knew how to make them You know how Cyril that is ALL the Henshaw boys like every kind you make The egg in Marie s hand slipped from her fingers and crashed untidily on the shelf With a gleeful laugh Billy welcomed the diversion She had not meant to speak so plainly It was one thing to try to fit herself to be Cyril s wife and quite another to display those efforts so openly before the world The pudding was made at last but Marie proved to be a nervous teacher Her hand shook and her memory almost failed her at one or two critical points Billy laughingly said that it must be stage fright owing to the presence of herself as spectator and with this Marie promptly and somewhat effusively agreed So very busy was Billy during the next few days acquiring her new domesticity that she did not notice how little she was seeing of Cyril Then she suddenly realized it and asked herself the reason for it Cyril was at the house certainly just as frequently as he had been but she saw that a new shyness in herself had developed which was causing her to be restless in his presence and was leading her to like better to have Marie or Aunt Hannah in the room when he called She discovered too that she welcomed William and even Bertram with peculiar enthusiasm if they happened to interrupt a tete a tete with Cyril Billy was disturbed at this She told herself that this shyness was not strange perhaps inasmuch as her ideas in regard to love and marriage had undergone so abrupt a change but it must be overcome If she was to be Cyril s wife she must like to be with him and of course she really did like to be with him for she had enjoyed his companionship very much during all these past weeks She set herself therefore now determinedly to cultivating Cyril It was then that Billy made a strange and fearsome discovery there were some things about Cyril that she did not like Billy was inexpressibly shocked Heretofore he had been so high so irreproachable so god like but heretofore he had been a friend Now he was appearing in a new role though unconsciously she knew Heretofore she had looked at him with eyes that saw only the delightful and marvelous unfolding of a coldly reserved nature under the warmth of her own encouraging smile Now she looked at him with eyes that saw only the possibilities of that same nature when it should have been unfolded in a lifelong companionship And what she saw frightened her There was still the music she acknowledged that but it had come to Billy with overwhelming force that music after all was not everything The man counted as well Very frankly then Billy stated the case to herself What passes for fascinating mystery in him now will be plain moroseness sometime He is taciturn now he ll be cross then It is erratic when he won t play the piano to day but a few years from now when he refuses some simple request of mine it will be stubbornness All this it will be if I don t love him and I don t I know I don t Besides we aren t really congenial I like people around he doesn t I like to go to plays he doesn t He likes rainy days I abhor them There is no doubt of it life with him would not be one grand harmony it would be one jangling discord I simply cannot marry him I shall have to break the engagement Billy spoke with regretful sorrow It was evident that she grieved to bring pain to Cyril Then suddenly the gloom left her face she had remembered that the engagement was just three weeks old and was a profound secret not only to the bridegroom elect but to all the world as well save herself Billy was very happy after that She sang about the house all day and she danced sometimes from room to room so light were her feet and her heart She made no more puddings with Marie s supervision but she was particularly careful to have the little music teacher or Aunt Hannah with her when Cyril called She made up her mind it is true that she had been mistaken and that Cyril did not love her still she wished to be on the safe side and she became more and more averse to being left alone with him for any length of time CHAPTER XXXII CYRIL HAS SOMETHING TO SAY Long before spring Billy was forced to own to herself that her fancied security from lovemaking on the part of Cyril no longer existed She began to suspect that there was reason for her fears Cyril certainly was different He was more approachable less reserved even with Marie and Aunt Hannah He was not nearly so taciturn either and he was much more gracious about his playing Even Marie dared to ask him frequently for music and he never refused her request Three times he had taken Billy to some play that she wanted to see and he had invited Marie too besides Aunt Hannah which had pleased Billy very much He had been at the same time so genial and so gallant that Billy had declared to Marie afterward that he did not seem like himself at all but like some one else Marie had disagreed with her it is true and had said stiffly I m sure I thought he seemed very much like himself But that had not changed Billy s opinion at all To Billy s mind nothing but love could so have softened the stern Cyril she had known She was therefore all the more careful these days to avoid a tete a tete with him though she was not always successful particularly owing to Marie s unaccountable perverseness in so often having letters to write or work to do just when Billy most wanted her to make a safe third with herself and Cyril It was upon such an occasion after Marie had abruptly left them alone together that Cyril had observed a little sharply Billy I wish you wouldn t say again what you said ten minutes ago when Miss Marie was here What was that A very silly reference to that old notion that you and every one else seem to have that I am a woman hater Billy s heart skipped a beat One thought pounded through her brain and dinned itself into her ears at all costs Cyril must not be allowed to say that which she so feared he must be saved from himself Woman hater Why of course you re a woman hater she cried merrily I m sure I I think it s lovely to be a woman hater The man opened wide his eyes then he frowned angrily Nonsense Billy I know better Besides I m in earnest and I m not a woman hater Oh but every one says you are chattered Billy And after all you know it IS distinguishing With a disdainful exclamation the man sprang to his feet For a time he paced the room in silence watched by Billy s fearful eyes then he came back and dropped into the low chair at Billy s side His whole manner had undergone a complete change He was almost shamefaced as he said Billy I suppose I might as well own up I don t think I did think much of women until I saw you Billy swallowed and wet her lips She tried to speak but before she could form the words the man went on with his remarks and Billy did not know whether to be the more relieved or frightened thereat But you see now it s different That s why I don t like to sail any longer under false colors There s been a change a great and wonderful change that I hardly understand myself That s it You don t understand it I m sure interposed Billy feverishly It may not be such a change after all You may be deceiving yourself she finished hopefully The man sighed I can t wonder you think so of course he almost groaned I was afraid it would be like that When one s been painted black all one s life it s not easy to change one s color of course Oh but I didn t say that black wasn t a very nice color stammered Billy a little wildly Thank you Cyril s heavy brows rose and fell the fraction of an inch Still I must confess that just now I should prefer another shade He paused and Billy cast distractedly about in her mind for a simple natural change of subject She had just decided to ask him what he thought of the condition of the Brittany peasants when he questioned abruptly and in a voice that was not quite steady Billy what should you say if I should tell you that the avowed woman hater had strayed so far from the prescribed path as to to like one woman well enough as to want to marry her The word was like a match to the gunpowder of Billy s fears Her self control was shattered instantly into bits Marry No no you wouldn t you couldn t really be thinking of that she babbled growing red and white by turns Only think how a wife would would b bother you Bother me When I loved her But just think remember She d want cushions and rugs and curtains and you don t like them and she d always be talking and laughing when you wanted quiet and she she d want to drag you out to plays and parties and and everywhere Indeed Cyril I m sure you d never like a wife long Billy stopped only because she had no breath with which to continue Cyril laughed a little grimly You don t draw a very attractive picture Billy Still I m not afraid I don t think this particular wife would do any of those things to trouble me Oh but you don t know you can t tell argued the girl Besides you have had so little experience with women that you d just be sure to make a mistake at first You want to look around very carefully very carefully before you decide I have looked around and very carefully Billy I know that in all the world there is just one woman for me Billy struggled to her feet Mingled pain and terror looked from her eyes She began to speak wildly incoherently She wondered afterward just what she would have said if Aunt Hannah had not come into the room at that moment and announced that Bertram was at the door to take her for a sleigh ride if she cared to go Of course she ll go declared Cyril promptly answering for her It is time I was off anyhow To Billy he said in a low voice You haven t been very encouraging little girl in fact you ve been mighty discouraging But some day some other day I ll try to make clear to you many things Billy greeted Bertram very cordially It was such a relief his cheery genial companionship The air too was bracing and all the world lay under a snow white blanket of sparkling purity Everything was so beautiful so restful It was not surprising perhaps that the very frankness of Billy s joy misled Bertram a little His blood tingled at her nearness and his eyes grew deep and tender as he looked down at her happy face But of all the eager words that were so near his lips not one reached the girl s ears until the good byes were said then wistfully Bertram hazarded Billy don t you think sometimes that I m gaining just a little on that rival of mine that music Billy s face clouded She shook her head gently Bertram please don t when we ve had such a beautiful hour together she begged It troubles me If you do I can t go again But you shall go again cried Bertram bravely smiling straight into her eyes And there sha n t ever anything in the world trouble you either that I can help CHAPTER XXXIII WILLIAM IS WORRIED Billy s sleigh ride had been due to the kindness of a belated winter storm that had surprised every one the last of March After that March as if ashamed of her untoward behavior donned her sweetest smiles and went out like the proverbial lamb With the coming of April and the stirring of life in the trees Billy too began to be restless and at the earliest possible moment she made her plans for her long anticipated digging in the dirt Just here much to her surprise she met with wonderful assistance from Bertram He seemed to know just when and where and how to dig and he displayed suddenly a remarkable knowledge of landscape gardening That this knowledge was as recent in its acquirement as it was sudden in its display Billy did not know Very learnedly he talked of perennials and annuals and without hesitation he made out a list of flowering shrubs and plants that would give her a succession of bloom throughout the season His words and phrases smacked loudly of the very newest florists catalogues but Billy did not notice that She only wondered at the seemingly exhaustless source of his wisdom I suspect twould have been better if we d begun things last fall he told her frowningly one day But there s plenty we can do now anyway and we ll put in some quick growing things just for this season until we can get the more permanent things established And so they worked together studying scheming ordering plants and seeds their two heads close together above the gaily colored catalogues Later there was the work itself to be done and though strong men did the heavier part there was yet plenty left for Billy s eager fingers and for Bertram s And if sometimes in the intimacy of seed sowing and plant setting the touch of the slenderer fingers sent a thrill through the browner ones Bertram made no sign He was careful always to be the cheerful helpful assistant and that was all Billy it is true was a little disturbed at being quite so much with Bertram She dreaded a repetition of some such words as had been uttered at the end of the sleigh ride She told herself that she had no right to grieve Bertram to make it hard for him by being with him but at the very next breath she could but question did she grieve him Was it hard for him to have her with him Then she would glance at his eager face and meet his buoyant smile and answer no After that for a time at least her fears would be less Systematically Billy avoided Cyril these days She could not forget his promise to make many things clear to her some day She thought she knew what he meant that he would try to convince her as she had tried to convince herself that she would make a good wife for him Billy was very sure that if Cyril could be prevented from speaking his mind just now his mind would change in time hence her determination to give his mind that opportunity Billy s avoidance of Cyril was the more easily accomplished because she was for a time taking a complete rest from her music The new songs had been finished and sent to the publishers There was no excuse therefore for Cyril s coming to the house on that score and indeed he seemed of his own accord to be making only infrequent visits now Billy was pleased particularly as Marie was not there to play third party Marie had taken up her teaching again much to Billy s distress But I can t stay here always like this Marie had protested But I should like to keep you Billy had responded with no less decision Marie had been firm however and had gone leaving the little house lonely without her Aside from her work in the garden Billy as resolutely avoided Bertram as she did Cyril It was natural therefore that at this crisis she should turn to William with a peculiar feeling of restfulness He at least would be safe she told herself So she frankly welcomed his every appearance sung to him played to him and took long walks with him to see some wonderful bracelet or necklace that he had discovered in a dingy little curio shop William was delighted He was very fond of his namesake and he had secretly chafed a little at the way his younger brothers had monopolized her attention He was rejoiced now that she seemed to be turning to him for companionship and very eagerly he accepted all the time she could give him William had in truth been growing more and more lonely ever since Billy s brief stay beneath his roof years before Those few short weeks of her merry presence had shown him how very forlorn the house was without it More and more sorrowfully during past years his thoughts had gone back to the little white flannel bundle and to the dear hopes it had carried so long ago If the boy had only lived thought William mournfully there would not now have been that dreary silence in his home and that sore ache in his heart Very soon after William had first seen Billy he began to lay wonderful plans and in every plan was Billy She was not his child by flesh and blood he acknowledged but she was his by right of love and needed care In fancy he looked straight down the years ahead and everywhere he saw Billy a loving much loved daughter the joy of his life the solace of his declining years To no one had William talked of this and to no one did he show the bitterness of his grief when he saw his vision fade into nothingness through Billy s unchanging refusal to live in his home Only he himself knew the heartache the loneliness the almost unbearable longing of the past winter months while Billy had lived at Hillside and only he himself knew now the almost overwhelming joy that was his because of what he thought he saw in Billy s changed attitude toward himself Great as was William s joy however his caution was greater He said nothing to Billy of his new hopes though he did try to pave the way by dropping an occasional word about the loneliness of the Beacon Street house since she went away There was something else too that caused William to be silent what he thought he saw between Billy and Bertram That Bertram was in love with Billy he guessed but that Billy was not in love with Bertram he very much feared He hesitated almost to speak or move lest something he should say or do should just at the critical moment turn matters the wrong way To William this marriage of Bertram and Billy was an ideal method of solving the problem as of course Billy would come there to the house to live and he would have his daughter after all But as the days passed and he could see no progress on Bertram s part no change in Billy he began to be seriously worried and to show it CHAPTER XXXIV CLASS DAY Early in June Billy announced her intention of not going away at all that summer I don t need it she declared I have this cool beautiful house this air this sunshine this adorable view Besides I ve got a scheme I mean to carry out There was some consternation among Billy s friends when they found out what this scheme was sundry of Billy s humbler acquaintances were to share the house the air the sunshine and the adorable view with her But my dear Billy Bertram cried aghast you don t mean to say that you are going to turn your beautiful little house into a fresh air place for Boston s slum children Not a bit of it smiled the girl though I d like to really if I could she added perversely But this is quite another thing It s no slum work no charity In the first place my guests aren t quite so poor as that and they re much too proud to be reached by the avowed charity worker But they need it just the same But you haven t much spare room have you questioned Bertram No unfortunately so I shall have to take only two or three at a time and keep them maybe a week or ten days It s just a sugar plum Bertram Truly it is she added whimsically but with a tender light in her eyes But who are these people Bertram s face had lost its look of shocked surprise and his voice expressed genuine interest Well to begin with there s Marie She ll stay all summer and help me entertain my guests at the same time her duties won t be arduous and she ll get a little playtime herself One week I m going to have a little old maid who keeps a lodging house in the West End For uncounted years she s been practically tied to a doorbell with never a whole day to breathe free I ve made arrangements there for a sister to keep house a whole week and I m going to show this little old maid things she hasn t seen for years the ocean the green fields and a summer play or two perhaps Then there s a little couple that live in a third story flat in South Boston They re young and like good times but the man is on a small salary and they have had lots of sickness He s been out so much he can t take any vacation and they wouldn t have any money to go anywhere if he could Well I m going to have them a week She ll be here all the time and he ll come out at night of course Another one is a widow with six children The children are already provided for by a fresh air society but the woman I m going to take and and give her a whole week of food that she didn t have to cook herself Another one is a woman who is not so very poor but who has lost her baby and is blue and discouraged There are some children too one crippled and a boy who says he s just lonesome And there are really Bertram there is no end to them I can well believe that declared Bertram with emphasis so far as your generous heart is concerned Billy colored and looked distressed But it isn t generosity or charity at all Bertram she protested You are mistaken when you think it is really Why I shall enjoy every bit of it just as well as they do and better perhaps But you stay here in the city all summer for their sakes What if I do Besides this isn t the real city argued Billy with all these trees and lawns about one And another thing she added leaning forward confidentially I might as well confess Bertram you couldn t hire me to leave the place this summer not while all these things I planted are coming up Bertram laughed but for some reason he looked wonderfully happy as he turned away On the fifteenth of June Kate and her husband arrived from the West A young brother of mister Hartwell s was to be graduated from Harvard and Kate said they had come on to represent the family as the elder mister and missus Hartwell were not strong enough to undertake the journey Kate was looking well and happy She greeted Billy with effusive cordiality and openly expressed her admiration of Hillside She looked very keenly into her brothers face and seemed well pleased with the appearance of Cyril and Bertram but not so much so with William s countenance William does NOT look well she declared one day when she and Billy were alone together Sick Uncle William sick Oh I hope not cried the girl I don t know whether it s sick or not returned missus Hartwell But it s something He s troubled I m going to speak to him He s worried over something and he s grown terribly thin But he s always thin reasoned Billy I know but not like this ever You don t notice it perhaps or realize it seeing him every day as you do But I know something troubles him Oh I hope not murmured Billy with anxious eyes We don t want Uncle William troubled we all love him too well missus Hartwell did not at once reply but for a long minute she thoughtfully studied Billy s face as it was bent above the sewing in Billy s hand When she did speak she had changed the subject Young Hartwell was to deliver the Ivy Oration in the Stadium on Class Day and all the Henshaws were looking eagerly forward to the occasion You have seen the Stadium of course said Bertram to Billy a few days before the anticipated Friday Only from across the river Is that so And you ve never been here Class Day either Good Then you ve got a treat in store Just wait and see And Billy waited and she saw Billy began to see in fact before Class Day Young Hartwell was a popular fellow and he was eager to have his friends meet Billy and the Henshaws He was a member of the Institute of seventeen seventy D K E Stylus Signet Round Table and Hasty Pudding Clubs and nearly every one of these had some sort of function planned for Class Day week By the time the day itself arrived Billy was almost as excited as was young Hartwell himself It rained Class Day morning but at nine o clock the sun came out and drove the clouds away much to every one s delight Billy s day began at noon with the spread given by the Hasty Pudding Club Billy wondered afterward how many times that day remarks like these were made to her You ve been here Class Day before of course You ve seen the confetti throwing No Well you just wait At ten minutes of four Billy and missus Hartwell with mister Hartwell and Bertram as escorts entered the cool echoing shadows under the Stadium and then out in the sunlight they began to climb the broad steps to their seats I wanted them high up you see explained Bertram because you can get the effect so much better There here we are For the first time Billy turned and looked about her She gave a low cry of delight Oh oh how beautiful how wonderfully beautiful You just wait crowed Bertram If you think this is beautiful you just wait Billy did not seem to hear him Her eyes were sweeping the wonderful scene before her and her face was aglow with delight First there was the great amphitheater itself Only the wide curve of the horseshoe was roped off for to day s audience Beyond lay the two sides with their tier above tier of empty seats almost dazzling in the sunshine Within the roped off curve the scene was of kaleidoscopic beauty Charmingly gowned young women and carefully groomed young men were everywhere stirring chatting laughing Gay colored parasols and flower garden hats made here and there brilliant splashes of rainbow tints Above was an almost cloudless canopy of blue and at the far horizon earth and sky met and made a picture that was like a wondrous painted curtain hung from heaven itself At the first sound of the distant band that told of the graduates coming Bertram said almost wistfully Class Day is the only time when I feel out of it You see I m the first male Henshaw for ages that hasn t been through Harvard and to day you know is the time when the old grads come back and do stunts like the kids if they can and some of them can all right They march in by classes ahead of the seniors and vie with each other in giving their yells You ll see Cyril and William if your eyes are sharp enough and you ll see them as you never saw them before Far down the green field Billy spied now the long black line of moving figures with a band in the lead Nearer and nearer it came until greeted by a mighty roar from thousands of throats the leaders swept into the great bowl of the horseshoe curve And how they yelled and cheered those men whose first Class Day lay five ten fifteen even twenty or more years behind them as told by the banners which they so proudly carried How they got their heads together and gave the Rah Rah Rah with unswerving eyes on their leader How they beat the air with their hats in time to their lusty shouts And how the throngs above cheered and clapped in answer until they almost split their throats and did split their gloves especially when the black gowned seniors swept into view And when the curving line of black had become one solid mass of humanity that filled the bowl from side to side the vast throng seated themselves and a great hush fell while the Glee Club sang Young Hartwell proved to be a good speaker and his ringing voice reached even the topmost tier of seats Billy was charmed and interested Everything she saw and heard was but a new source of enjoyment and she had quite forgotten the thing for which she was to wait when she saw the ushers passing through the aisles with their baskets of many hued packages of confetti and countless rolls of paper ribbon It began then the merry war between the students below and the throng above In a trice the air was filled with shimmering bits of red blue white green purple pink and yellow From all directions fluttering streamers that showed every color of the rainbow were flung to the breeze until upheld by the supporting wires they made a fairy lace work of marvelous beauty Oh oh oh cried Billy her eyes misty with emotion I think I never saw anything in my life so lovely I thought you d like it gloried Bertram You know I said to wait But even with this Class Day for Billy was not finished There was still Hartwell s own spread from six to eight and after that there were the President s reception and dancing in the Memorial Hall and in the Gymnasium There was the Fairyland of the yard too softly aglow with moving throngs of beautiful women and gallant men But what Billy remembered best of all was the exquisite harmony that came to her through the hushed night air when the Glee Club sang Fair Harvard on the steps of Holworthy Hall CHAPTER XXXV SISTER KATE AGAIN It was on the Sunday following Class Day that missus Hartwell carried out her determination to speak to William The West had not taken from Kate her love of managing and she thought she saw now a matter that sorely needed her guiding hand William s thin face anxious looks and nervous manner had troubled her ever since she came Then one day very suddenly had come enlightenment William was in love and with Billy missus Hartwell watched William very closely after that She saw his eyes follow Billy fondly yet anxiously She saw his open joy at being with her and at any little attention word or look that the girl gave him She remembered too something that Bertram had said about William s grief because Billy would not live at the Strata She thought she saw something else also that Billy was fond of William but that William did not know it hence his frequent troubled scrutiny of her face Why these two should play at cross purposes Sister Kate could not understand She smiled however confidently they should not play at cross purposes much longer she declared On Sunday afternoon Kate asked her eldest brother to take her driving Not a motor car I want a horse that will let me talk she said Certainly agreed William with a smile but Bertram who chanced to hear her put in the sly comment As if ANY horse could prevent that On the drive Kate began to talk at once but she did not plunge into the subject nearest her heart until she had adroitly led William into a glowing enumeration of Billy s many charming characteristics then she said William why don t you take Billy home with you William stirred uneasily as he always did when anything annoyed him My dear Kate there is nothing I should like better to do he replied Then why don t you do it I hope to sometime But why not now I m afraid Billy is not quite ready Nonsense A young girl like that does not know her own mind lots of times Just press the matter a little Love will work wonders sometimes William blushed like a girl To him her words had but one meaning Bertram s love for Billy William had never spoken of this suspected love affair to any one He had even thought that he was the only one that had discovered it To hear his sister refer thus lightly to it came therefore in the nature of a shock to him Then you have seen it too he stammered Seen it too laughed Kate with her confident eyes on William s flushed face I should say I had seen it Any one could see it William blushed again Love to him had always been something sacred something that called for hushed voices and twilight This merry discussion in the sunlight of even another s love was disconcerting Now come William resumed Kate after a moment speak to Billy and have the matter settled once for all It s worrying you I can see it is Again William stirred uneasily But Kate I can t do anything I told you before I don t believe Billy is ready Nonsense Ask her But Kate a girl won t marry against her will I don t believe it is against her will Kate Honestly Honestly I ve watched her Then I WILL speak cried the man his face alight if if you think anything I can say would help There is nothing nothing in all this world that I so desire Kate as to have that little girl back home And of course that would do it She d live there you know Why of course murmured Kate with a puzzled frown There was something in this last remark of William s that she did not quite understand Surely he could not suppose that she had any idea that after he had married Billy they would go to live anywhere else she thought For a moment she considered the matter vaguely then she turned her attention to something else She was the more ready to do this because she believed that she had said enough for the present it was well to sow seeds but it was also well to let them have a chance to grow she told herself missus Hartwell s next move was to speak to Billy and she was careful to do this at once so that she might pave the way for William She began her conversation with an ingratiating smile and the words Well Billy I ve been doing a little detective work on my own account Detective work Yes about William You know I told you the other day how troubled and anxious he looked to me Well I ve found out what s the matter What is it Yourself Myself Why missus Hartwell what can you mean The elder lady smiled significantly Oh it s merely another case my dear of faint heart never won fair lady I ve been helping on the faint heart that s all But I don t understand No I can t believe you quite mean that my dear Surely you must know how earnestly my brother William is longing for you to go back and live with him Like William Billy flushed scarlet missus Hartwell certainly no one could know better than YOURSELF why that is quite impossible she frowned The other colored confusedly I understand of course what you mean And Billy I ll confess that I ve been sorry lots of times since that I spoke as I did to you particularly when I saw how it grieved my brother William to have you go away If I blundered then I m sorry and perhaps I did blunder At all events that is only the more reason now why I am so anxious to do what I can to rectify that old mistake and plead William s suit To missus Hartwell s blank amazement Billy laughed outright William s suit she quoted merrily Why missus Hartwell there isn t any suit to it Uncle William doesn t want me to marry him Indeed he does Billy stopped laughing and sat suddenly erect missus HARTWELL Billy is it possible that you did not know this Indeed I don t know it and excuse me but I don t think you do either But I do I ve talked with him and he s very much in earnest urged missus Hartwell speaking very rapidly He says there s nothing in all the world that he so desires And Billy you do care for him I know you do Why of course I care for him but not that way But Billy think missus Hartwell was very earnest now and a little frightened She felt that she must bring Billy to terms in some way now that William had been encouraged to put his fate to the test Just remember how good William has always been to you and think what you have been and may BE if you only will in his lonely life Think of his great sorrow years ago Think of this dreary waste of years between Think how now his heart has turned to you for love and comfort and rest Billy you can t turn away you can t find it in your heart to turn away from that dear good man who loves you so missus Hartwell s voice shook effectively and even her eyes looked through tears Mentally she was congratulating herself she had not supposed she could make so touching an appeal In the chair opposite the girl sat very still She was pale and her eyes showed a frightened questioning in their depths For a long minute she said nothing then she rose dazedly to her feet missus Hartwell please do not speak of this to any one she begged in a low voice I I am taken quite by surprise I shall have to think it out alone Billy did not sleep well that night Always before her eyes was the vision of William s face and always in her ears was the echo of missus Hartwell s words Remember how good William has always been to you Think of his great sorrow years ago Think of this dreary waste of years between Think how now his heart has turned to you for love and comfort and rest For a time Billy tossed about on her bed trying to close her eyes to the vision and her ears to the echo Then finding that neither was possible she set herself earnestly to thinking the matter out William loved her Extraordinary as it seemed such was the fact missus Hartwell said so And now what must she do what could she do She loved no one of that she was very sure She was even beginning to think that she would never love any one There were Calderwell Cyril Bertram to say nothing of sundry others who had loved her apparently but whom she could not love Such being the case if she were indeed incapable of love herself why should she not make the sacrifice of giving up her career her independence and in that way bring this great joy to Uncle William s heart Even as she said the Uncle William to herself Billy bit her lip and realized that she must no longer say Uncle William if she married him If she married him The words startled her If she married him Well what of it She would go to live at the Strata of course and there would be Cyril and Bertram It might be awkward and yet she did not believe Cyril was in love with anything but his music and as to Bertram it was the same with Bertram and his painting and he would soon forget that he had ever fancied he loved her After that he would be simply a congenial friend and companion a good comrade As Billy thought of it indeed one of the pleasantest features of this marriage with William would be the delightful comradeship of her brother Bertram Billy dwelt then at some length on William s love for her his longing for her presence and his dreary years of loneliness And he was so good to her she recollected he had always been good to her He was older to be sure much older than she but after all it would not be so difficult so very difficult to learn to love him At all events whatever happened she would have the supreme satisfaction of knowing that at least she had brought into dear Uncle that is into William s life the great peace and joy that only she could give It was almost dawn when Billy arrived at this not uncheerful state of prospective martyrdom She turned over then with a sigh and settled herself to sleep She was relieved that she had decided the question She was glad that she knew just what to say when William should speak He was a dear dear man and she would not make it hard for him she promised herself She would be William s wife CHAPTER XXXVI WILLIAM MEETS WITH A SURPRISE In spite of his sister s confident assurance that the time was ripe for him to speak to Billy William delayed some days before broaching the matter to her His courage was not so good as it had been when he was talking with Kate It seemed now as it always had a fearsome thing to try to hasten on this love affair between Billy and Bertram He could not see in spite of Kate s words that Billy showed unmistakable evidence at all of being in love with his brother The more he thought of it in fact the more he dreaded the carrying out of his promise to speak to his namesake What should he say he asked himself How could he word it He could not very well accost her with Oh Billy I wish you d please hurry up and marry Bertram because then you d come and live with me Neither could he plead Bertram s cause directly Quite probably Bertram would prefer to plead his own Then too if Billy really was not in love with Bertram what then Might not his own untimely haste in the matter forever put an end to the chance of her caring for him It was indeed a delicate matter and as William pondered it he wished himself well out of it and that Kate had not spoken But even as he formed the wish William remembered with a thrill Kate s positive assertion that a word from him would do wonders and that now was the time to utter it He decided then that he would speak that he must speak but that at the same time he would proceed with a caution that would permit a hasty retreat if he saw that his words were not having the desired effect He would begin with a frank confession of his grief at her leaving him and of his longing for her return then very gradually if wisdom counseled it he would go on to speak of Bertram s love for her and of his own hope that she would make Bertram and all the Strata glad by loving him in return missus Hartwell had returned to her Western home before William found just the opportunity for his talk with Billy True to his belief that only hushed voices and twilight were fitting for such a subject he waited until he found the girl early one evening alone on her vine shaded veranda He noticed that as he seated himself at her side she flushed a little and half started to rise with a nervous fluttering of her hands and a murmured I ll call Aunt Hannah It was then that with sudden courage he resolved to speak Billy don t go he said gently with a touch of his hand on her arm There is something I want to say to you I I have wanted to say it for some time Why of of course stammered the girl falling back in her seat And again William noticed that odd fluttering of the slim little hands For a time no one spoke then William began softly his eyes on the distant sky line still faintly aglow with the sunset s reflection Billy I want to tell you a story Long years ago there was a man who had a happy home with a young wife and a tiny baby boy in it I could not begin to tell you all the plans that man made for that baby boy Such a great and good and wonderful being that tiny baby was one day to become But the baby went away after a time and carried with him all the plans and he never came back Behind him he left empty hearts that ached and great bare rooms that seemed always to be echoing sighs and sobs And then one day such a few years after the young wife went to find her baby and left the man all alone with the heart that ached and the great bare rooms that echoed sighs and sobs Perhaps it was this the bareness of the rooms that made the man turn to his boyish passion for collecting things He wanted to fill those rooms full full so that the sighs and sobs could not be heard and he wanted to fill his heart too with something that would still the ache And he tried Already he had his boyish treasures and these he lined up in brave array but his rooms still echoed and his heart still ached so he built more shelves and bought more cabinets and set himself to filling them hoping at the same time that he might fill all that dreary waste of hours outside of business hours which once had been all too short to devote to the young wife and the baby boy One by one the years passed and one by one the shelves and the cabinets were filled The man fancied sometimes that he had succeeded but in his heart of hearts he knew that the ache was merely dulled and that darkness had only to come to set the rooms once more to echoing the sighs and sobs And then but perhaps you are tired of the story Billy William turned with questioning eyes No oh no faltered Billy It is beautiful but so sad But the saddest part is done I hope said William softly Let me tell you A wonderful thing happened then Suddenly right out of a dull gray sky of hopelessness dropped a little brown eyed girl and a little gray cat All over the house they frolicked filling every nook and cranny with laughter and light and happiness And then like magic the man lost the ache in his heart and the rooms lost their echoing sighs and sobs The man knew then that never again could he hope to fill his heart and life with senseless things of clay and metal He knew that the one thing he wanted always near him was the little brown eyed girl and he hoped that he could keep her But just as he was beginning to bask in this new light it went out As suddenly as they had come the little brown eyed girl and the gray cat went away Why the man did not know He knew only that the ache had come back doubly intense and that the rooms were more gloomy than ever And now Billy William s voice shook a little it is for you to finish the story It is for you to say whether that man s heart shall ache on and on down to a lonely old age and whether those rooms shall always echo the sighs and sobs of the past And I will finish it choked Billy holding out both her hands It sha n t ache they sha n t echo The man leaned forward eagerly unbelievingly and caught the hands in his own Billy do you mean it Then you will come Yes yes I didn t know I didn t think I never supposed it was like that Of course I ll come And in a moment she was sobbing in his arms Billy breathed William rapturously as he touched his lips to her forehead My own little Billy It was a few minutes later when Billy was more calm that William started to speak of Bertram For a moment he had been tempted not to mention his brother now that his own point had been won so surprisingly quick but the new softness in Billy s face had encouraged him and he did not like to let the occasion pass when a word from him might do so much for Bertram His lips parted but no words came Billy herself had begun to speak I m sure I don t know why I m crying she stammered dabbing her eyes with her round moist ball of a handerchief I hope when I m your wife I ll learn to be more self controlled But you know I am young and you ll have to be patient As once before at something Billy said the world to William went suddenly mad His head swam dizzily and his throat tightened so that he could scarcely breathe By sheer force of will he kept his arm about Billy s shoulder and he prayed that she might not know how numb and cold it had grown Even then he thought he could not have heard aright Er you said he questioned faintly I say when I m your wife I hope I ll learn to be more self controlled laughed Billy nervously You see I just thought I ought to remind you that I am young and that you ll have to be patient William stammered something a hurried something he wondered afterward what it was That it must have been satisfactory to Billy was evident for she began laughingly to talk again What she said William scarcely knew though he was conscious of making an occasional vague reply He was still floundering in a hopeless sea of confusion and dismay His own desire was to get up and say good night at once He wanted to be alone to think He realized however with sickening force that men do not propose and run away if they are accepted And he was accepted he realized that too overwhelmingly Then he tried to think how it had happened what he had said how she could so have misunderstood his meaning This line of thought he abandoned quickly however it could do no good But what could do good he asked himself What could he do With blinding force came the answer he could do nothing Billy cared for him Billy had said yes Billy expected to be his wife As if he could say to her now I beg your pardon but twas all a mistake I did not ask you to marry me Very valiantly then William summoned his wits and tried to act his part He told himself too that it would not be a hard one that he loved Billy dearly and that he would try to make her happy He winced a little at this thought for he remembered suddenly how old he was as if he at his age were a fit match for a girl of twenty one And then he looked at Billy The girl was plainly nervous There was a deep flush on her cheeks and a brilliant sparkle in her eyes She was talking rapidly almost incoherently at times and her voice was tremulous Frequent little embarrassed laughs punctuated her sentences and her fingers toyed with everything that came within reach Some time before she had sprung to her feet and had turned on the electric lights and when she came back she had not taken her old position at William s side but had seated herself in a chair near by All of which according to William s eyes meant the maidenly shyness of a girl who has just said yes to the man she loves William went home that night in a daze To himself he said that he had gone out in search of a daughter and had come back with a wife CHAPTER XXXVII WILLIAM S BROTHER It was decided that for the present the engagement should not be known outside the family The wedding would not take place immediately William said and it was just as well to keep the matter to themselves until plans were a little more definite The members of the family were told at once Aunt Hannah said Oh my grief and conscience three times and made matters scarcely better by adding apologetically Oh of course it s all right it s all right only She did not finish her sentence and William who had told her the news did not know whether he would have been more or less pleased if she had finished it Cyril received the information moodily and lapsed at once into a fit of abstraction from which he roused himself hardly enough to offer perfunctory congratulations and best wishes Billy was a little puzzled at Cyril s behavior She had been sure for some time that Cyril had ceased to care specially for her even if he ever did fancy that he loved her She had hoped to keep him for a friend but of late she had been forced to question even his friendliness He had in fact gone back almost to his old reserve and taciturn aloofness From the West in response to William s news of the engagement came a cordially pleased note in Kate s scrawling handwriting Kate indeed seemed to be the only member of the family who was genuinely delighted with the coming marriage As to Bertram Bertram appeared to have aged years in a single night so drawn and white was his face the morning after William had told him his plans William had dreaded most of all to tell Bertram He was very sure that Bertram himself cared for Billy and it was doubly hard because in William s own mind was a strong conviction that the younger man was decidedly the one for her Realizing however that Bertram must be told William chose a time for the telling when Bertram was smoking in his den in the twilight with his face half hidden from sight Bertram said little very little that night but in the morning he went straight to Billy Billy was shocked She had never seen the smiling self reliant debonair Bertram like this Billy is this true he demanded The dull misery in his voice told Billy that he knew the answer before he asked the question Yes yes but Bertram please please don t take it like this she implored How would you have me take it Why just just sensibly You know I told you that that the other never could be never I know YOU said so but I believed otherwise But I told you I did not love you that way Bertram winced He rose to his feet abruptly I know you did Billy I m a fool of course to think that I could ever change it I shouldn t have come here either this morning But I had to Good by His face as he held out his hand was tragic with renunciation Why Bertram you aren t going now like this cried the girl You ve just come The man turned almost impatiently And do you think I can stay like this Billy won t you say good by he asked in a softer voice again with outstretched hand Billy shook her head She ignored the hand and resolutely backed away No not like that You are angry with me she grieved Besides you make it sound as if if you were going away I am going away Bertram There was terror as well as dismay in Billy s voice Again the man turned sharply Billy why are you making this thing so hard for me he asked in despair Can t you see that I must go Indeed I can t And you mustn t go either There isn t any reason why you should urged Billy talking very fast and working her fingers nervously Things are just the same as they were before for you I m just going to marry William but I wasn t ever going to marry you so that doesn t change things any for you Don t you see Why Bertram you mustn t go away There won t be anybody left Cyril s going next week you know and if you go there won t be anybody left but William and me Bertram you mustn t go don t you see I should feel lost without you Billy was almost crying now Bertram looked up quickly An odd change had come to his face For a moment he gazed silently into Billy s agitated countenance then he asked in a low voice Billy did you think that after you and William were married I should still continue to live at the Strata Why of course you will cried the girl indignantly Why Bertram you ll be my brother then my real brother and one of the very chiefest things I m anticipating when I go there to live is the good times you and I will have together when I m William s wife Bertram drew in his breath audibly and caught his lower lip between his teeth With an abrupt movement he turned his back and walked to the window For a full minute he stayed there watched by the amazed displeased eyes of the girl When he came back he sat down quietly in the chair facing Billy His countenance was grave and his eyes were a little troubled but the haggard look of misery was quite gone Billy he began gently you must forgive my saying this but are you quite sure you love William Billy flushed with anger You have no right to ask such a question Of course I love William Of course you do we all love William William is in fact a most lovable man But William s wife should perhaps love him a little differently from all of us And she will certainly retorted the girl with a quick lifting of her chin Bertram I don t think you have any right to to make such insinuations And I won t make them any more replied Bertram gravely I just wanted you to make sure that you knew I shall make sure and I shall know said Billy firmly so firmly that it sounded almost as if she were trying to convince herself as well as others There was a long pause then the man asked diffidently And so you are very sure that that you want me to stay Indeed I do Besides don t you remember there are all my people to be entertained They must be taken to places and given motor rides and picnics You told me last week that you d love to help me but of course if you don t want to But I do want to cried Bertram heartily a gleam of the old cheerfulness springing to his eyes I m dying to The girl looked up with quick distrust For a moment she eyed him with bent brows To her mind he had gone back to his old airy hopeful light heartedness He was once more only Bertram She hesitated then said with stern decision Bertram you know I want you and you must know that I m delighted to have you drop this silly notion of going away But if this quick change means that you are staying with any idea that that I shall change then then you must go But if you will stay as WILLIAM S BROTHER then I ll be more than glad to have you I ll stay as William s brother agreed Bertram and Billy did not notice the quick indrawing of his breath nor the close shutting of his lips after the words were spoken CHAPTER XXXVIII THE ENGAGEMENT OF TWO By the middle of July the routine of Billy s days was well established Marie had been for a week a welcome addition to the family and she was proving to be of invaluable aid in entertaining Billy s guests The overworked widow and the little lodging house keeper from the West End were enjoying Billy s hospitality now and just to look at their beaming countenances was an inspiration Billy said Cyril had gone abroad Aunt Hannah was spending a week at the North Shore with friends Bertram true to his promise was playing the gallant to Billy s guests and so assiduous was he in his attentions that Billy at last remonstrated with him But I didn t mean them to take ALL your time she protested Don t they like it Do they see too much of me he demanded No no They love it of course You must know that Nobody else could give such beautiful times as you ve given us But it s yourself I m thinking of You re giving up all your time Besides I didn t mean to keep you here all summer of course You always go away some you know for a vacation But I m having a vacation here doing this laughed Bertram I m sure I m getting sea air down to the beaches and mountain air out to the Blue Hills And as for excitement if you can find anything more wildly exciting than it was yesterday when Miss Marie and I took the widow and the spinster lady on the Roller coaster just show it to me that s all Billy laughed They told me about it Marie in particular She said you were lovely to them and let them do every single thing they wanted to and that half an hour after they got there they were like two children let out of school Dear me I wish I d gone I never stay at home that I don t miss something she finished regretfully Bertram shrugged his shoulders If it s Roller coasters and Chute the chutes that you want I fancy you ll get enough before the week is out he sighed laughingly They said they d like to go there to morrow please when I asked them what we should do next What surprises me is that they like such things such hair raising things When I first saw them black gowned and stiff backed sitting in your little room here I thought I should never dare offer them anything more wildly exciting than a church service or a lecture on psychology with perhaps a band concert hinted at provided the band could be properly instructed beforehand as to tempo and selections But now really Billy why do you suppose they have taken such a fancy to these kiddish stunts those two staid women Billy laughed but her eyes softened I don t know unless it s because all their lives they ve been tied to such dead monotony that just the exhilaration of motion is bliss to them But you won t always have to risk your neck and your temper in this fashion Bertram Next week my little couple from South Boston comes She adores pictures and stuffed animals You ll have to do the museums with her Then there s little crippled Tommy he ll be perfectly contented if you ll put him down where he can hear the band play And all you ll have to do when that one stops is to pilot him to the next one This IS good of you Bertram and I do thank you for it finished Billy fervently just as Marie the widow and the spinster lady entered the room Billy told herself these days that she was very happy very happy indeed Was she not engaged to a good man and did she not also have it in her power to make the long summer days a pleasure to many people The fact that she had to tell herself that she was happy in order to convince herself that she was so did not occur to Billy yet Not long after Marie arrived Billy told her of the engagement William was at the house very frequently and owing to the intimacy of Marie s relationship with the family Billy decided to tell her how matters stood Marie s reception of the news was somewhat surprising First she looked frightened To William you are engaged to William Why yes But I thought surely it was don t you mean mister Cyril No I don t laughed Billy And certainly I ought to know And you don t care for him I hope not if I m going to marry William So light was Billy s voice and manner that Marie dared one more question And he doesn t care for you I hope not if William is going to marry me laughed Billy again Oh h breathed Marie with an odd intonation of relief Then I m glad so glad And I hope you ll be very very happy dear Billy looked into Marie s glowing face and was pleased there seemed to be so few so very few faces into which she had looked and found entire approbation of her engagement to William Billy saw a great deal of William now He was always kind and considerate and he tried to help her entertain her guests but Billy grateful as she was to him for his efforts was relieved when he resigned his place to Bertram Bertram did indeed know so much better how to do it William tried to help her too about training her vines and rosebushes but of course even in this he could not be expected to show quite the interest that Bertram manifested in every green shoot and opening bud for he had not helped her plant them as Bertram had Billy was a little troubled sometimes that she did not feel more at ease with William She thought it natural that she should feel a little diffident with him in the face of his sudden change from an uncle to an accepted lover but she did not see why she should be afraid of him yet she was She owned that to herself unhappily And he was so good she owned that too He seemed not to have a thought in the world but for her comfort and happiness and there was no end to the tactful little things he was always doing for her pleasure He seemed also to have divined that she did not like to be kissed and caressed and only occasionally did he kiss her and then it was merely a sort of fatherly salute on her forehead for which consideration Billy was grateful Billy decided that she would not like to be kissed on the lips After some days of puzzling over the matter Billy concluded that it was self consciousness that caused all the trouble With William she was self conscious If she could only forget that she was some day to be William s wife the old delightful comradeship would return and she would be at ease again with him In time after she had become accustomed to the idea of marriage it would not so confuse her of course She loved him dearly and she wanted to make him happy but for the present just while she was getting used to things she would try to forget sometimes that she was going to be William s wife Billy was happier now She was always happier after she had thought things out to her own satisfaction She turned with new zest to the entertainment of her guests and with Bertram she planned many delightful trips for their pleasure Bertram was a great comfort to her these days Never in word or look could she see that he overstepped the role which he had promised to play William s brother Billy went back to her music too A new melody was running through her head and she longed to put it on paper Already her first little Group of Songs had found friends and Billy to a very modest extent was beginning to taste the sweets of fame Thus by all these interests did Billy try to get used to things CHAPTER XXXIX A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER Of all Billy s guests Marie was very plainly the happiest She was a permanent guest it is true while the others came for only a week or two at a time but it was not this Billy decided that had brought so brilliant a sparkle to Marie s eyes so joyous a laugh to her lips The joyousness was all the more noticeable because heretofore Marie while very sweet had been also sad Her big blue eyes had always carried a haunting shadow and her step had lacked the spring belonging to youth and happiness Certainly Billy had never seen her like this before Verily Marie she teased one day have you found an exhaustless supply of stockings to mend or a never done pudding to make which Why What do you mean Oh nothing I was only wondering just what had brought that new light to your eyes Is there a new light There certainly is It must be because I m so happy then sighed Marie because you re so good to me Is that all Isn t that enough Marie s tone was evasive No Billy shook her head mischievously Marie what is it It s nothing really it s nothing protested Marie hurrying out of the room with a nervous laugh Billy frowned She was suspicious before she was sure now In less than twelve hours time came her opportunity She was alone again with Marie Marie who is he she asked abruptly He Who The man who is to wear the stockings and eat the pudding The little music teacher flushed very red but she managed to display something that might pass for surprise BILLY Come dear coaxed Billy winningly Tell me about it I m so interested But there isn t anything to tell really there isn t Who is he He isn t anybody that is he doesn t know he s anybody amended Marie Billy laughed softly Oh doesn t he Hasn t he ever shown that he cared No that is perhaps he has only I thought then that it was another girl Another girl So there s another girl in the case Yes I mean no corrected Marie suddenly beginning to realize what she was saying Really it wasn t anything it isn t anything she protested Hm m murmured Billy archly Oh I m getting on some He did show once that he cared but you thought it was another girl and you coldly looked the other way Now there ISN T any other girl you find and Marie tell me the rest Marie shook her head emphatically and pulled herself gently away from Billy s grasp No no please she begged It really isn t anything I m sure I m imagining it all she cried as she ran away During the days that followed Billy speculated not a little on Marie s half told story and wondered interestedly who the man might be She questioned Marie once again but the girl would tell nothing more and indeed Billy was so occupied with her own perplexities that she had little time for those of other people To herself Billy was forced to own that she was not getting used to things She was still self conscious with William she could not forget that she was one day to be his wife She could not bring back the dear old freedom of comradeship with him Billy was alarmed now She had begun to ask herself searching questions What should she do if never never should she get used to the idea of marrying William How could she marry him if he was still Uncle William and never her dear lover in her eyes Why had she not been wise enough and brave enough to tell him in the first place that she was not at all sure that she loved him but that she would try to do so Then when she had tried as she had now and failed she could have told him honestly the truth and it would not have been so great a shock to him as it must be now if she should tell him Billy had remorsefully come to the conclusion that she could never love any man well enough to marry him when one day so small a thing as a piece of paper fluttered into her vision and showed her the fallacy of that idea It was a half sheet of note paper and it blew from Marie s balcony to the lawn below Billy found it there later and as she picked it up her eyes fell on a single name in Marie s handwriting inscribed half a dozen times as if the writer had musingly accompanied her thoughts with her pen and the name was Marie Henshaw For a moment Billy stared at the name perplexedly then in a flash came the remembrance of Marie s words and Billy breathed Henshaw the man BERTRAM Billy dropped the paper then and fled In her own room behind locked doors she sat down to think Bertram It was he for whom Marie cared HER Bertram And then it came to Billy with staggering force that he was not HER Bertram at all He never could be her Bertram now He was Marie s Billy was frightened then so fierce was this strange new something that rose within her this overpowering something that seemed to blot out all the world and leave only Bertram She knew then that it had always been Bertram to whom she had turned though she had been blind to the cause of that turning Always her plans had included him Always she had been the happiest in his presence never had she pictured him anywhere else but at her side Certainly never had she pictured him as the devoted lover of another woman And she had not known what it all meant poor blind child that she was Very resolutely now Billy set herself to looking matters squarely in the face She understood it quite well All summer Marie and Bertram had been thrown together No wonder Marie had fallen in love with Bertram and that he Billy thought she comprehended now why Bertram had found it so easy for the last few weeks to be William s brother She of course had been the other girl whom Marie had once feared that the man loved It was all so clear so woefully clear With an aching heart Billy asked herself what now was to be done For herself turn whichever way she could she could see nothing but unhappiness She determined therefore with Spartan fortitude that to no one else would she bring equal unhappiness She would be silent Bertram and Marie loved each other That matter was settled As to William Billy thought of the story William had told her of his lonely life of the plea he had made to her and her heart ached Whatever happened William must be made happy William must not be told Her promise to William must be kept CHAPTER XL WILLIAM PAYS A VISIT Before September passed all Billy s friends said that her summer s self appointed task had been too hard for her In no other way could they account for the sad change that had come to her Undeniably Billy looked really ill Always slender she was shadow like now Her eyes had found again the wistful appeal of her girlhood only now they carried something that was almost fear as well The rose flush had gone from her cheeks and pathetic little hollows had appeared making the round young chin below look almost pointed Certainly Billy did seem to be ill Late in September William went West on business Incidentally he called to see his sister Kate Well and how is everybody asked Kate cheerily after the greetings were over William sighed Well everybody to me Kate is pretty badly off We re worried about Billy Billy You don t mean she s sick Why she s always been the picture of health I know she has but she isn t now What s the trouble That s what we don t know You ve had the doctor Of course two or three of them though much against Billy s will But they didn t help us What did they say They could find nothing except perhaps a little temporary stomach trouble or something of that kind which they all agreed was no just cause for her present condition But what did they say it was Why they said it seemed like nervousness or as if something was troubling her They asked if she weren t under some sort of strain Well is she Does anything trouble her Not that I know of Anyhow if there is anything none of us can find out what it is Kate frowned She threw a quick look into her brother s face William she began hesitatingly forgive me but Billy is quite happy in her engagement I suppose The man flushed painfully and sighed I ve thought of that of course In fact it was the first thing I did think of I even began to watch her rather closely and once I questioned her a little What did she say She seemed so frightened and distressed that I didn t say much myself I couldn t I had but just begun when her eyes filled with tears and she asked me in a frightened little voice if she had done anything to displease me anything to make me unhappy and she seemed so anxious and grieved and dismayed that I should even question her that I had to stop What has she done this summer Where has she been She hasn t been anywhere Didn t I write you She s kept open house for a lot of her less fortunate friends a sort of vacation home you know and and I must say she s given them a world of happiness too But wasn t that hard for her It didn t seem to be She appeared to enjoy it immensely particularly at first Of course she had plenty of help and that wonderful little Miss Hawthorn has been a host in herself They re all gone now anyway except Miss Hawthorn But Billy must have had the care and the excitement Perhaps to a certain extent Though not much after all You see Bertram too has given up his summer to them and has been playing the devoted escort to the whole bunch Indeed for the last few weeks of it since Billy began to seem so ill he and Miss Hawthorn have schemed to take all the care from Billy and they have done the whole thing together But what HAS Billy done to make her like this I don t know She s done lots for me in all sorts of ways cataloguing my curios you know and going with me to hunt up things In fact she seems the happiest when she IS doing something for me It s come to be a sort of mania with her I m afraid to do something for me Kate I m really worried What do you suppose is the matter Kate shook her head The puzzled frown had come back to her face I can t imagine she began slowly Of course when I told her you loved her and When you told her wha at exploded the usually low voiced William with sudden sharpness When I told her that you loved her William You see I William sprang to his feet Told her that I loved her he cried aghast Good heavens Kate do you mean to say that YOU told her THAT Why y yes And may I ask where you got your information Why William Henshaw what a question I got it from yourself of course defended Kate From ME William s face expressed sheer amazement Certainly on that drive when I was East in June returned Kate with dignity YOU evidently have forgotten it but I have not You told me very frankly how much you thought of her and how you longed to have her back there with you but that she didn t seem to be ready to come I was sorry for you and I wanted to do something to help particularly as it might have been my fault partly that she went away in the first place William lifted his head What do you mean Why nothing only that I I told her a little of how how upsetting her arrival had been to everything and of how much you had done for her and put yourself out I said it so she d appreciate things of course but she took it quite differently from what I had intended she should take it and seemed quite cut up about it Then she went away in that wily impulsive fashion William bit his lip but he did not speak Kate was plunging on feverishly and in the face of the greater revelation he let the lesser one drop And so that s why I was particularly anxious to bring things around right again continued Kate And that s why I spoke I thought I d seen how things were and on the drive I said so Then is when I advised you to speak to Billy but you declared that Billy wasn t ready and that you couldn t make a girl marry against her will NOW don t you recollect it A great light of understanding broke over William s face He started to speak but something evidently stayed the words on his lips With controlled deliberation he turned and sat down Then he said Kate will you kindly tell me just what you DID do Why I didn t do so very much I just tried to help that s all After I talked with you and advised you to ask Billy right away to marry you I went to her I thought she cared for you already anyway but I just wanted to tell her how very much it was to you and so sort of pave the way And now comes the part that I started to tell you a little while ago when you caught me up so sharply I was going to say that when I told Billy this she appeared to be surprised and almost frightened You see she hadn t known you cared for her after all and so I had a chance to help and make it plain to her how you did love her so that when you spoke everything would be all right There that s all You see I didn t do so very much So very much groaned William starting to his feet Great Scott Why William what do you mean Where are you going I m going to Billy retorted William with slow distinctness And I m going to try to get there before you CAN And with this extraordinary shot for William he left the house William went to Billy as fast as steam could carry him He found her in her little drawing room listlessly watching with Aunt Hannah the game of chess that Bertram and Marie were playing Billy you poor dear child come here he said abruptly as soon as the excitement of his unexpected arrival had passed I want to talk to you And he led the way to the veranda which he knew would be silent and deserted To talk to me murmured Billy as she wonderingly came to his side a startled questioning in her wide dark eyes CHAPTER XLI THE CROOKED MADE STRAIGHT William did not re enter the house after his talk with Billy on the veranda I will go down the steps and around by the rose garden to the street dear he said I d rather not go in now Just make my adieus please and say that I couldn t stay any longer And now good by His eyes as they looked down at her were moist and very tender His lips trembled a little but they smiled and there was a look of new born peace and joy on his face Billy too was smiling though wistfully The frightened questioning had gone from her eyes leaving only infinite tenderness You are sure it it is all right now she stammered Very sure little girl and it s the first time it has been right for weeks Billy that was very dear of you and I love you for it but think how near how perilously near you came to lifelong misery But I thought you wanted me so much she smiled shyly And I did and I do for a daughter You don t doubt that NOW No oh no laughed Billy softly and to her face came a happy look of relief as she finished And I ll be so glad to be the daughter For some minutes after the man had gone Billy stood by the steps where he had left her She was still there when Bertram came to the veranda door and spoke to her Billy I saw William go by the window so I knew you were alone May I speak to you The girl turned with a start Why of course What is it but I thought you were playing Where is Marie The game is finished besides Billy why are you always asking me lately where Marie is as if I were her keeper or she mine he demanded with a touch of nervous irritation Why nothing Bertram smiled Billy a little wearily only that you were playing together a few minutes ago and I wondered where she had gone A few minutes ago echoed Bertram with sudden bitterness Evidently the time passed swiftly with you Billy William was out here MORE than an hour Why Bertram Yes I know I ve no business to say that of course sighed the man but Billy that s why I came out because I must speak to you this once Won t you come and sit down please he implored despairingly Why Bertram murmured Billy again faintly as she turned toward the vine shaded corner and sat down Her eyes were startled A swift color had come to her cheeks Billy began the man in a sternly controlled voice please let me speak this once and don t try to stop me You may think for a moment that it s disloyal to William if you listen but it isn t There s this much due to me that you let me speak now Billy I can t stand it I ve tried but it s no use I ve got to go away and it s right that I should I m not the only one that thinks so either Marie does too MARIE Yes I talked it all over with her She s known for a long time how it s been with me how I cared for you Marie You ve told Marie that gasped Billy Yes Surely you don t mind Marie s knowing went on Bertram dejectedly And she s been so good to me and tried to help me Bertram was not looking at Billy now If he had been he would have seen the incredulous joy come into her face His eyes were moodily fixed on the floor And so Billy I ve come to tell you I m going away he continued after a moment I ve got to go I thought once when I first talked with you of William that you didn t know your own heart that you didn t really care for him I was even fool enough to think that that it would be I to whom you d turn some day And so I stayed But I stayed honorably Billy YOU know that You know that I haven t once forgotten not once that I was only William s brother I promised you I d be that and I have been haven t I Billy nodded silently Her face was turned away But Billy I can t do it any longer I ve got to ask for my promise back and then of course I can t stay But you you don t have to go away murmured the girl faintly Bertram sprang to his feet His face was white Billy he cried standing tall and straight before her Billy I love every touch of your hand every glance of your eye every word that falls from your lips Do you think I can stay now I want my promise back When I m no longer William s brother then I ll go But you don t have to have it back that is you don t have to have it at all stammered Billy flushing adorably She too was on her feet now Billy what do you mean Don t you see I I HAVE turned she faltered breathlessly holding out both her hands Even then in spite of the great light that leaped to his eyes Bertram advanced only a single step But William he questioned unbelievingly It WAS a mistake just as you thought We know now both of us We don t either of us care for the other that way And Bertram I think it HAS been you all the time only I didn t know Billy Billy choked Bertram in a voice shaken with emotion He opened his arms then wide and Billy walked straight into them CHAPTER XLII THE END OF THE STORY It was two days after Billy s new happiness had come to her that Cyril came home He went very soon to see Billy The girl was surprised at the change in his appearance He had grown thin and haggard looking and his eyes were somber He moved restlessly about the room for a time finally seating himself at the piano and letting his fingers slip from one mournful little melody to another Then with a discordant crash he turned Billy do you think any girl would marry me he demanded Why Cyril There now please don t begin that he begged fretfully I realize of course that I m a very unlikely subject for matrimony You made me understand that clearly enough last winter Last winter Cyril raised his eyebrows Oh I came to you for a little encouragement and to make a confession he said I made the confession but I didn t get the encouragement Billy changed color She thought she knew what he meant but at the same time she couldn t understand why he should wish to refer to that conversation now A confession she repeated hesitatingly Yes I told you that I d begun to doubt my being such a woman hater after all I intimated that YOU D begun the softening process and that then I d found a certain other young woman who had well who had kept up the good work Oh cried Billy suddenly with a peculiar intonation Oh h Then she laughed softly Well that was the confession resumed Cyril Then I came out flat footed and said that I wanted to marry her but there is where I didn t get the encouragement Indeed I m afraid I wasn t very considerate stammered Billy No you weren t agreed Cyril moodily I didn t know but now his voice softened a little with this new happiness of yours and Bertram s that you might find a little encouragement for me And I will cried Billy promptly Tell me about her I did last winter reproached the man and you were sure I was deceiving myself You drew the gloomiest sort of picture of the misery I would take with a wife I did Billy was laughing very merrily now Yes You said she d always be talking and laughing when I wanted to be quiet and that she d want to drag me out to parties and plays when I wanted to stay at home and oh lots of things I tried to make it clear to you that that this little woman wasn t that sort But I couldn t finished Cyril gloomily But of course she isn t declared Billy with quick sympathy I I didn t know WHAT I was talking about she added with emphatic distinctness Then she smiled to think how little Cyril knew how very true those words were Tell me about her she begged again I know she must be very lovely and brilliant and of course a wonderful musician YOU couldn t choose any one else To her surprise Cyril turned abruptly and began to play again A nervous little staccato scherzo fell from his fingers but it dropped almost at once into a quieter melody and ended with something that sounded very much like the last strain of Home Sweet Home Then he wheeled about on the piano stool Billy that s exactly where you re wrong I DON T want that kind of wife I don t want a brilliant one and now Billy this sounds like horrible heresy I know but it s true I don t care whether she can play or not but I should prefer that she shouldn t play much Why Cyril Henshaw and you with your music As if you could be contented with a woman like that Oh I want her to like music of course modified Cyril but I don t care to have her MAKE it Billy do you know You ll laugh of course but my picture of a wife is always one thing a room with a table and a shaded lamp and a little woman beside it with the light on her hair and a great basket of sewing beside her You see I AM domestic he finished a little defiantly I should say you were laughed Billy And have you found her this little woman who is to do nothing but sit and sew in the circle of the shaded lamp Yes I ve found her but I m not at all sure she s found me That s where I want your help Oh I don t mean of course he added that she s got to sit under that lamp all the time It s only that that I hope she likes that sort of thing And does she Yes that is I think she does smiled Cyril Anyhow she told me once that that the things she liked best to do in all the world were to mend stockings and to make puddings Billy sprang to her feet with a little cry Now indeed had Cyril kept his promise and made many things clear to her Cyril come here she cried tremulously leading the way to the open veranda door The next moment Cyril was looking across the lawn to the little summerhouse in the midst of Billy s rose garden In full view within the summerhouse sat Marie sewing Go Cyril she s waiting for you smiled Billy mistily The light s only the sun to be sure and maybe there isn t a whole basket of sewing there But SHE S there You ve guessed then breathed Cyril I ve not guessed I know And it s all right You mean Only Cyril s pleading eyes finished the question Yes I m sure she does nodded Billy And then she added under her breath as the man passed swiftly down the steps Marie Henshaw indeed So twas Cyril all the time and never Bertram who was the inspiration of that bit of paper give away When she turned back into the room she came face to face with Bertram I spoke dear but you didn t hear he said as he hurried forward with outstretched hands Bertram greeted Billy with surprising irrelevance and they all lived happily ever after they DID Isn t that always the ending to the story a love story Of course said Bertram with emphasis OUR love story And theirs supplemented Billy softly but Bertram did not hear that End of the
