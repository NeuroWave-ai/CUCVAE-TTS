bonny boy you have made it all right for me Chapter LXXX VOLUME I CHAPTER I mister Vavasor and His Daughter Whether or no she whom you are to forgive if you can did or did not belong to the Upper Ten Thousand of this our English world I am not prepared to say with any strength of affirmation By blood she was connected with big people distantly connected with some very big people indeed people who belonged to the Upper Ten Hundred if there be any such division but of these very big relations she had known and seen little and they had cared as little for her Her grandfather Squire Vavasor of Vavasor Hall in Westmoreland was a country gentleman possessing some thousand a year at the outside and he therefore never came up to London and had no ambition to have himself numbered as one in any exclusive set A hot headed ignorant honest old gentleman he lived ever at Vavasor Hall declaring to any who would listen to him that the country was going to the mischief and congratulating himself that at any rate in his county parliamentary reform had been powerless to alter the old political arrangements Alice Vavasor whose offence against the world I am to tell you and if possible to excuse was the daughter of his younger son and as her father John Vavasor had done nothing to raise the family name to eminence Alice could not lay claim to any high position from her birth as a Vavasor John Vavasor had come up to London early in life as a barrister and had failed He had failed at least in attaining either much wealth or much repute though he had succeeded in earning or perhaps I might better say in obtaining a livelihood He had married a lady somewhat older than himself who was in possession of four hundred a year and who was related to those big people to whom I have alluded Who these were and the special nature of the relationship I shall be called upon to explain hereafter but at present it will suffice to say that Alice Macleod gave great offence to all her friends by her marriage She did not however give them much time for the indulgence of their anger Having given birth to a daughter within twelve months of her marriage she died leaving in abeyance that question as to whether the fault of her marriage should or should not be pardoned by her family When a man marries an heiress for her money if that money be within her own control as was the case with Miss Macleod s fortune it is generally well for the speculating lover that the lady s friends should quarrel with him and with her She is thereby driven to throw herself entirely into the gentleman s arms and he thus becomes possessed of the wife and the money without the abominable nuisance of stringent settlements But the Macleods though they quarrelled with Alice did not quarrel with her a l outrance They snubbed herself and her chosen husband but they did not so far separate themselves from her and her affairs as to give up the charge of her possessions Her four hundred a year was settled very closely on herself and on her children without even a life interest having been given to mister Vavasor and therefore when she died the mother s fortune became the property of the little baby But under these circumstances the big people did not refuse to interest themselves to some extent on behalf of the father I do not suppose that any actual agreement or compact was made between mister Vavasor and the Macleods but it came to be understood between them that if he made no demand upon them for his daughter s money and allowed them to have charge of her education they would do something for him He was a practising barrister though his practice had never amounted to much and a practising barrister is always supposed to be capable of filling any situation which may come his way Two years after his wife s death mister Vavasor was appointed assistant commissioner in some office which had to do with insolvents and which was abolished three years after his appointment It was at first thought that he would keep his eight hundred a year for life and be required to do nothing for it but a wretched cheeseparing Whig government as John Vavasor called it when describing the circumstances of the arrangement to his father down in Westmoreland would not permit this it gave him the option of taking four hundred a year for doing nothing or of keeping his whole income and attending three days a week for three hours a day during term time at a miserable dingy little office near Chancery Lane where his duty would consist in signing his name to accounts which he never read and at which he was never supposed even to look He had sulkily elected to keep the money and this signing had been now for nearly twenty years the business of his life Of course he considered himself to be a very hardly used man One Lord Chancellor after another he petitioned begging that he might be relieved from the cruelty of his position and allowed to take his salary without doing anything in return for it The amount of work which he did perform was certainly a minimum of labour Term time as terms were counted in mister Vavasor s office hardly comprised half the year and the hours of weekly attendance did not do more than make one day s work a week for a working man but mister Vavasor had been appointed an assistant commissioner and with every Lord Chancellor he argued that all Westminster Hall and Lincoln s Inn to boot had no right to call upon him to degrade himself by signing his name to accounts In answer to every memorial he was offered the alternative of freedom with half his income and so the thing went on There can however be no doubt that mister Vavasor was better off and happier with his almost nominal employment than he would have been without it He always argued that it kept him in London but he would undoubtedly have lived in London with or without his official occupation He had become so habituated to London life in a small way before the choice of leaving London was open to him that nothing would have kept him long away from it After his wife s death he dined at his club every day on which a dinner was not given to him by some friend elsewhere and was rarely happy except when so dining They who have seen him scanning the steward s list of dishes and giving the necessary orders for his own and his friend s dinner at about half past four in the afternoon have seen John Vavasor at the only moment of the day at which he is ever much in earnest All other things are light and easy to him to be taken easily and to be dismissed easily Even the eating of the dinner calls forth from him no special sign of energy Sometimes a frown will gather on his brow as he tastes the first half glass from his bottle of claret but as a rule that which he has prepared for himself with so much elaborate care is consumed with only pleasant enjoyment Now and again it will happen that the cook is treacherous even to him and then he can hit hard but in hitting he is quiet and strikes with a smile on his face Such had been mister Vavasor s pursuits and pleasures in life up to the time at which my story commences But I must not allow the reader to suppose that he was a man without good qualities Had he when young possessed the gift of industry I think that he might have shone in his profession and have been well spoken of and esteemed in the world As it was he was a discontented man but nevertheless he was popular and to some extent esteemed He was liberal as far as his means would permit he was a man of his word and he understood well that code of by laws which was presumed to constitute the character of a gentleman in his circle He knew how to carry himself well among men and understood thoroughly what might be said and what might not what might be done among those with whom he lived and what should be left undone By nature too he was kindly disposed loving many persons a little if he loved few or none passionately Moreover at the age of fifty he was a handsome man with a fine forehead round which the hair and beard was only beginning to show itself to be grey He stood well with a large person only now beginning to become corpulent His eyes were bright and grey and his mouth and chin were sharply cut and told of gentle birth Most men who knew John Vavasor well declared it to be a pity that he should spend his time in signing accounts in Chancery Lane I have said that Alice Vavasor s big relatives cared but little for her in her early years but I have also said that they were careful to undertake the charge of her education and I must explain away this little discrepancy The biggest of these big people had hardly heard of her but there was a certain Lady Macleod not very big herself but as it were hanging on to the skirts of those who were so who cared very much for Alice She was the widow of a Sir Archibald Macleod K C B who had been a soldier she herself having also been a Macleod by birth and for very many years past from a time previous to the birth of Alice Vavasor she had lived at Cheltenham making short sojourns in London during the spring when the contents of her limited purse would admit of her doing so Of old Lady Macleod I think I may say that she was a good woman that she was a good woman though subject to two of the most serious drawbacks to goodness which can afflict a lady She was a Calvinistic Sabbatarian in religion and in worldly matters she was a devout believer in the high rank of her noble relatives She could almost worship a youthful marquis though he lived a life that would disgrace a heathen among heathens and she could and did in her own mind condemn crowds of commonplace men and women to all eternal torments of which her imagination could conceive because they listened to profane music in a park on Sunday Yet she was a good woman Out of her small means she gave much away She owed no man anything She strove to love her neighbours She bore much pain with calm unspeaking endurance and she lived in trust of a better world Alice Vavasor who was after all only her cousin she loved with an exceeding love and yet Alice had done very much to extinguish such love Alice in the years of her childhood had been brought up by Lady Macleod at the age of twelve she had been sent to a school at Aix la Chapelle a comitatus of her relatives having agreed that such was to be her fate much in opposition to Lady Macleod s judgement at nineteen she had returned to Cheltenham and after remaining there for little more than a year had expressed her unwillingness to remain longer with her cousin She could sympathize neither with her relative s faults or virtues She made an arrangement therefore with her father that they two would keep house together in London and so they had lived for the last five years for Alice Vavasor when she will be introduced to the reader had already passed her twenty fourth birthday Their mode of life had been singular and certainly not in all respects satisfactory Alice when she was twenty one had the full command of her own fortune and when she induced her father who for the last fifteen years had lived in lodgings to take a small house in Queen Anne Street of course she offered to incur a portion of the expense He had warned her that his habits were not those of a domestic man but he had been content simply so to warn her He had not felt it to be his duty to decline the arrangement because he knew himself to be unable to give to his child all that attention which a widowed father under such circumstances should pay to an only daughter The house had been taken and Alice and he had lived together but their lives had been quite apart For a short time for a month or two he had striven to dine at home and even to remain at home through the evening but the work had been too hard for him and he had utterly broken down He had said to her and to himself that his health would fail him under the effects of so great a change made so late in life and I am not sure that he had not spoken truly At any rate the effort had been abandoned and mister Vavasor now never dined at home Nor did he and his daughter ever dine out together Their joint means did not admit of their giving dinners and therefore they could not make their joint way in the same circle It thus came to pass that they lived apart quite apart They saw each other probably daily but they did little more than see each other They did not even breakfast together and after three o clock in the day mister Vavasor was never to be found in his own house Miss Vavasor had made for herself a certain footing in society though I am disposed to doubt her right to be considered as holding a place among the Upper Ten Thousand Two classes of people she had chosen to avoid having been driven to such avoidings by her aunt s preferences marquises and such like whether wicked or otherwise she had eschewed and had eschewed likewise all Low Church tendencies The eschewing of marquises is not generally very difficult Young ladies living with their fathers on very moderate incomes in or about Queen Anne Street are not usually much troubled on that matter Nor can I say that Miss Vavasor was so troubled But with her there was a certain definite thing to be done towards such eschewal Lady Macleod by no means avoided her noble relatives nor did she at all avoid Alice Vavasor When in London she was persevering in her visits to Queen Anne Street though she considered herself nobody knew why not to be on speaking terms with mister Vavasor And she strove hard to produce an intimacy between Alice and her noble relatives such an intimacy as that which she herself enjoyed an intimacy which gave her a footing in their houses but no footing in their hearts or even in their habits But all this Alice declined with as much consistency as she did those other struggles which her old cousin made on her behalf strong never flagging but ever failing efforts to induce the girl to go to such places of worship as Lady Macleod herself frequented A few words must be said as to Alice Vavasor s person one fact also must be told and then I believe I may start upon my story As regards her character I will leave it to be read in the story itself The reader already knows that she appears upon the scene at no very early age and the mode of her life had perhaps given to her an appearance of more years than those which she really possessed It was not that her face was old but that there was nothing that was girlish in her manners Her demeanour was as staid and her voice as self possessed as though she had already been ten years married In person she was tall and well made rather large in her neck and shoulders as were all the Vavasors but by no means fat Her hair was brown but very dark and she wore it rather lower upon her forehead than is customary at the present day Her eyes too were dark though they were not black and her complexion though not quite that of a brunette was far away from being fair Her nose was somewhat broad and retrousse too but to my thinking it was a charming nose full of character and giving to her face at times a look of pleasant humour which it would otherwise have lacked Her mouth was large and full of character and her chin oval dimpled and finely chiselled like her father s I beg you in taking her for all in all to admit that she was a fine handsome high spirited young woman And now for my fact At the time of which I am writing she was already engaged to be married CHAPTER II Lady Macleod I cannot say that the house in Queen Anne Street was a pleasant house I am now speaking of the material house made up of the walls and furniture and not of any pleasantness or unpleasantness supplied by the inmates It was a small house on the south side of the street squeezed in between two large mansions which seemed to crush it and by which its fair proportion of doorstep and area was in truth curtailed The stairs were narrow the dining room was dark and possessed none of those appearances of plenteous hospitality which a dining room should have But all this would have been as nothing if the drawing room had been pretty as it is the bounden duty of all drawing rooms to be But Alice Vavasor s drawing room was not pretty Her father had had the care of furnishing the house and he had intrusted the duty to a tradesman who had chosen green paper a green carpet green curtains and green damask chairs There was a green damask sofa and two green arm chairs opposite to each other at the two sides of the fireplace The room was altogether green and was not enticing In shape it was nearly square the very small back room on the same floor not having been as is usual added to it This had been fitted up as a study for mister Vavasor and was very rarely used for any purpose Most of us know when we enter a drawing room whether it is a pretty room or no but how few of us know how to make a drawing room pretty There has come up in London in these latter days a form of room so monstrously ugly that I will venture to say that no other people on earth but Londoners would put up with it Londoners as a rule take their houses as they can get them looking only to situation size and price What Grecian what Roman what Turk what Italian would endure or would ever have endured to use a room with a monstrous cantle in the form of a parallelogram cut sheerly out of one corner of it This is the shape of room we have now adopted or rather which the builders have adopted for us in order to throw the whole first floor into one apartment which may be presumed to have noble dimensions with such drawback from it as the necessities of the staircase may require A sharp unadorned corner projects itself into these would be noble dimensions and as ugly a form of chamber is produced as any upon which the eye can look I would say more on the subject if I dared to do so here but I am bound now to confine myself to Miss Vavasor s room The monstrous deformity of which I have spoken was not known when that house in Queen Anne Street was built There is to be found no such abomination of shape in the buildings of our ancestors not even in the days of George the Second But yet the drawing room of which I speak was ugly and Alice knew that it was so She knew that it was ugly and she would greatly have liked to banish the green sofa to have re papered the wall and to have hung up curtains with a dash of pink through them With the green carpet she would have been contented But her father was an extravagant man and from the day on which she had come of age she had determined that it was her special duty to avoid extravagance It s the ugliest room I ever saw in my life her father once said to her It is not very pretty Alice replied I ll go halves with you in the expense of redoing it said mister Vavasor Wouldn t that be extravagant papa The things have not been here quite four years yet Then mister Vavasor had shrugged his shoulders and said nothing more about it It was little to him whether the drawing room in Queen Anne Street was ugly or pretty He was on the committee of his club and he took care that the furniture there should be in all respects comfortable It was now June and that month Lady Macleod was in the habit of spending among her noble relatives in London when she had succeeded in making both ends so far overlap each other at Cheltenham as to give her the fifty pounds necessary for this purpose For though she spent her month in London among her noble friends it must not be supposed that her noble friends gave her bed or board They sometimes gave her tea such as it was and once or twice in the month they gave the old lady a second rate dinner On these occasions she hired a little parlour and bedroom behind it in King Street Saint James s and lived a hot uncomfortable life going about at nights to gatherings of fashionable people of which she in her heart disapproved seeking for smiles which seldom came to her and which she excused herself for desiring because they were the smiles of her kith and her kin telling herself always that she made this vain journey to the modern Babylon for the good of Alice Vavasor and telling herself as often that she now made it for the last time On the occasion of her preceding visit she had reminded herself that she was then seventy five years old and had sworn to herself that she would come to London no more but here she was again in London having justified the journey to herself on the plea that there were circumstances in Alice s engagement which made it desirable that she should for a while be near her niece Her niece as she thought was hardly managing her own affairs discreetly Well aunt said Alice as the old lady walked into the drawing room one morning at eleven o clock Alice always called Lady Macleod her aunt though as has been before explained there was no such close connexion between them During Lady Macleod s sojourn in London these morning visits were made almost every day Alice never denied herself and even made a point of remaining at home to receive them unless she had previously explained that she would be out but I am not prepared to say that they were of their own nature agreeable to her Would you mind shutting the window my dear said Lady Macleod seating herself stiffly on one of the small ugly green chairs She had been educated at a time when easy chairs were considered vicious and among people who regarded all easy postures as being so and she could still boast at seventy six that she never leaned back Would you mind shutting the window I m so warm that I m afraid of the draught Illustration Would you mind shutting the window You don t mean to say that you ve walked from King Street said Alice doing as she was desired Indeed I do every step of the way Cabs are so ruinous It s a most unfortunate thing they always say it s just over the two miles here I don t believe a word of it because I m only a little more than the half hour walking it and those men will say anything But how can I prove it you know I really think it s too far for you to walk when it s so warm But what can I do my dear I must come when I ve specially come up to London to see you I shall have a cab back again because it ll be hotter then and dear Lady Midlothian has promised to send her carriage at three to take me to the concert I do so wish you d go Alice It s out of the question aunt The idea of my going in that way at the last moment without any invitation It wouldn t be without an invitation Alice The marchioness has said to me over and over again how glad she would be to see you if I would bring you Why doesn t she come and call if she is so anxious to know me My dear you ve no right to expect it you haven t indeed She never calls even on me I know I ve no right and I don t expect it and I don t want it But neither has she a right to suppose that under such circumstances I shall go to her house You might as well give it up aunt Cart ropes wouldn t drag me there I think you are very wrong particularly under your present circumstances A young woman that is going to be married as you are As I am perhaps That s nonsense Alice Of course you are and for his sake you are bound to cultivate any advantages that naturally belong to you As to Lady Midlothian or the marchioness coming to call on you here in your father s house after all that has passed you really have no right to look for it And I don t look for it That sort of people are not expected to call If you ll think of it how could they do it with all the demands they have on their time My dear aunt I wouldn t interfere with their time for worlds Nobody can say of me I m sure that I run after great people or rich people It does happen that some of the nearest relations I have indeed I may say the nearest relations are people of high rank and I do not see that I m bound to turn away from my own flesh and blood because of that particularly when they are always so anxious to keep up the connexion I was only speaking of myself aunt It is very different with you You have known them all your life And how are you to know them if you won t begin Lady Midlothian said to me only yesterday that she was glad to hear that you were going to be married so respectably and then Upon my word I m very much obliged to her ladyship I wonder whether she considered that she married respectably when she took Lord Midlothian Now Lady Midlothian had been unfortunate in her marriage having united herself to a man of bad character who had used her ill and from whom she had now been for some years separated Alice might have spared her allusion to this misfortune when speaking of the countess to the cousin who was so fond of her but she was angered by the application of that odious word respectable to her own prospects and perhaps the more angered as she was somewhat inclined to feel that the epithet did suit her own position Her engagement she had sometimes told herself was very respectable and had as often told herself that it lacked other attractions which it should have possessed She was not quite pleased with herself in having accepted John Grey or rather perhaps was not satisfied with herself in having loved him In her many thoughts on the subject she always admitted to herself that she had accepted him simply because she loved him that she had given her quick assent to his quick proposal simply because he had won her heart But she was sometimes almost angry with herself that she had permitted her heart to be thus easily taken from her and had rebuked herself for her girlish facility But the marriage would be at any rate respectable mister Grey was a man of high character of good though moderate means he was too well educated of good birth a gentleman and a man of talent No one could deny that the marriage would be highly respectable and her father had been more than satisfied Why Miss Vavasor herself was not quite satisfied will I hope in time make itself appear In the meanwhile it can be understood that Lady Midlothian s praise would gall her Alice don t be uncharitable said Lady Macleod severely Whatever may have been Lady Midlothian s misfortunes no one can say they have resulted from her own fault Yes they can aunt if she married a man whom she knew to be a scapegrace because he was very rich and an earl She was the daughter of a nobleman herself and only married in her own degree But I don t want to discuss that She meant to be good natured when she mentioned your marriage and you should take it as it was meant After all she was only your mother s second cousin Dear aunt I make no claim on her cousinship But she admits the claim and is quite anxious that you should know her She has been at the trouble to find out everything about mister Grey and told me that nothing could be more satisfactory Upon my word I am very much obliged to her Lady Macleod was a woman of much patience and possessed also of considerable perseverance For another half hour she went on expatiating on the advantages which would accrue to Alice as a married woman from an acquaintance with her noble relatives and endeavouring to persuade her that no better opportunity than the present would present itself There would be a place in Lady Midlothian s carriage as none other of the daughters were going but Lady Jane Lady Midlothian would take it quite as a compliment and a concert was not like a ball or any customary party An unmarried girl might very properly go to a concert under such circumstances as now existed without any special invitation Lady Macleod ought to have known her adopted niece better Alice was immoveable As a matter of course she was immoveable Lady Macleod had seldom been able to persuade her to anything and ought to have been well sure that of all things she could not have persuaded her to this Then at last they came to another subject as to which Lady Macleod declared that she had specially come on this special morning forgetting probably that she had already made the same assertion with reference to the concert But in truth the last assertion was the correct one and on that other subject she had been hurried on to say more than she meant by the eagerness of the moment All the morning she had been full of the matter on which she was now about to speak She had discussed it quite at length with Lady Midlothian though she was by no means prepared to tell Alice Vavasor that any such discussion had taken place From the concert and the effect which Lady Midlothian s countenance might have upon mister Grey s future welfare she got herself by degrees round to a projected Swiss tour which Alice was about to make Of this Swiss tour she had heard before but had not heard who were to be Miss Vavasor s companions until Lady Midlothian had told her How it had come to pass that Lady Midlothian had interested herself so much in the concerns of a person whom she did not know and on whom she in her greatness could not be expected to call I cannot say but from some quarter she had learned who were the proposed companions of Alice Vavasor s tour and she had told Lady Macleod that she did not at all approve of the arrangement And when do you go Alice said Lady Macleod Early in July I believe It will be very hot but Kate must be back by the middle of August Kate Vavasor was Alice s first cousin Oh Kate is to go with you Of course she is I could not go alone or with no one but George Indeed it was Kate who made up the party Of course you could not go alone with George said Lady Macleod very grimly Now George Vavasor was Kate s brother and was therefore also first cousin to Alice He was heir to the old squire down in Westmoreland with whom Kate lived their father being dead Nothing it would seem could be more rational than that Alice should go to Switzerland with her cousins but Lady Macleod was clearly not of this opinion she looked very grim as she made this allusion to cousin George and seemed to be preparing herself for a fight That is exactly what I say answered Alice But indeed he is simply going as an escort to me and Kate as we don t like the role of unprotected females It is very good natured of him seeing how much his time is taken up I thought he never did anything That s because you don t know him aunt No certainly I don t know him She did not add that she had no wish to know mister George Vavasor but she looked it And has your father been told that he is going Of course he has And does Lady Macleod hesitated a little before she went on and then finished her question with a little spasmodic assumption of courage And does mister Grey know that he is going Alice remained silent for a full minute before she answered this question during which Lady Macleod sat watching her grimly with her eyes very intent upon her niece s face If she supposed such silence to have been in any degree produced by shame in answering the question she was much mistaken But it may be doubted whether she understood the character of the girl whom she thought she knew so well and it is probable that she did make such mistake I might tell you simply that he does said Alice at last seeing that I wrote to him yesterday letting him know that such were our arrangements but I feel that I should not thus answer the question you mean to ask You want to know whether mister Grey will approve of it As I only wrote yesterday of course I have not heard and therefore cannot say But I can say this aunt that much as I might regret his disapproval it would make no change in my plans Would it not Then I must tell you you are very wrong It ought to make a change What the disapproval of the man you are going to marry make no change in your plans Not in that matter Come aunt if we must discuss this matter let us do it at any rate fairly In an ordinary way if mister Grey had asked me to give up for any reason my trip altogether I should have given it up certainly as I would give up any other indifferent project at the request of so dear a friend a friend with whom I am so so so closely connected But if he asked me not to travel with my cousin George I should refuse him absolutely without a word of parley on the subject simply because of the nature and closeness of my connection with him I suppose you understand what I mean aunt I suppose I do You mean that you would refuse to obey him on the very subject on which he has a right to claim your obedience He has no right to claim my obedience on any subject said Alice and as she spoke Aunt Macleod jumped up with a little start at the vehemence of the words and of the tone in which they were expressed She had heard that tone before and might have been used to it but nevertheless the little jump was involuntary At present he has no right to my obedience on any subject but least of all on that said Alice His advice he may give me but I am quite sure he will not ask for obedience And if he advises you you will slight his advice If he tells me that I had better not travel with my cousin George I shall certainly not take his advice Moreover I should be careful to let him know how much I was offended by any such counsel from him It would show a littleness on his part and a suspicion of which I cannot suppose him to be capable Alice as she said this got up from her seat and walked about the room When she had finished she stood at one of the windows with her back to her visitor There was silence between them for a minute or two during which Lady Macleod was deeply considering how best she might speak the terrible words which as Alice s nearest female relative she felt herself bound to utter At last she collected her thoughts and her courage and spoke out My

none	none	I need hardly say that if you had a mother living or any person with you filling the place of a mother I should not interfere in this matter Of course Aunt Macleod if you think I am wrong you have quite a right to say so I do think you are wrong very wrong indeed and if you persist in this I am afraid I must say that I shall think you wicked Of course mister Grey cannot like you to travel with George Vavasor And why not aunt Alice as she asked this question turned round and confronted Lady Macleod boldly She spoke with a steady voice and fixed her eyes upon the old lady s face as though determined to show that she had no fear of what might be said to her Why not Alice Surely you do not wish me to say why not But I do wish you to say why not How can I defend myself till the accusation is made You are now engaged to marry mister Grey with the consent and approbation of all your friends Two years ago you had had Had what aunt If you mean to say that two years ago I was engaged to my cousin George you are mistaken Three years ago I told him that under certain conditions I would become engaged to him But my conditions did not suit him nor his me and no engagement was ever made mister Grey knows the history of the whole thing As far as it was possible I have told him everything that took place The fact was Alice that George Vavasor s mode of life was such that an engagement with him would have been absolute madness Dear aunt you must excuse me if I say that I cannot discuss George Vavasor s mode of life If I were thinking of becoming his wife you would have a perfect right to discuss it because of your constant kindness to me But as matters are he is simply a cousin and as I like him and you do not we had better say nothing about him I must say this that after what has passed and at the present crisis of your life Dear aunt I m not in any crisis Yes you are Alice in the most special crisis of a girl s life You are still a girl but you are the promised wife of a very worthy man who will look to you for all his domestic happiness George Vavasor has the name at least of being very wild The worthy man and the wild man must fight it out between them If I were going away with George by himself there might be something in what you say That would be monstrous Monstrous or not it isn t what I m about to do Kate and I have put our purses together and are going to have an outing for our special fun and gratification As we should be poor travellers alone George has promised to go with his sister Papa knows all about it and never thought of making any objection Lady Macleod shook her head She did not like to say anything against mister Vavasor before his daughter but the shaking of her head was intended to signify that mister Vavasor s assent in such a matter was worth nothing I can only say again said Lady Macleod that I think mister Grey will be displeased and that he will have very great cause for displeasure And I think moreover that his approbation ought to be your chief study I believe my dear I ll ask you to let Jane get me a cab I shan t have a bit too much time to dress for the concert Alice simply rang the bell and said no further word on the subject which they had been discussing When Lady Macleod got up to go away Alice kissed her as was customary with them and the old lady as she went uttered her customary valediction God bless you my dear Good bye I ll come to morrow if I can There was therefore no quarrel between them But both of them felt that words had been spoken which must probably lead to some diminution of their past intimacy When Lady Macleod had gone Alice sat alone for an hour thinking of what had passed between them thinking rather of those two men the worthy man and the wild man whose names had been mentioned in close connection with herself John Grey was a worthy man a man worthy at all points as far as she knew him She told herself it was so And she told herself also that her cousin George was wild very wild And yet her thoughts were I fear on the whole more kindly towards her cousin than towards her lover She had declared to her aunt that John Grey would be incapable of such suspicion as would be shown by any objection on his part to the arrangements made for the tour She had said so and had so believed and yet she continued to brood over the position which her affairs would take if he did make the objection which Lady Macleod anticipated She told herself over and over again that under such circumstances she would not give way an inch He is free to go she said to herself If he does not trust me he is quite free to go It may almost be said that she came at last to anticipate from her lover that very answer to her own letter which she had declared him to be incapable of making CHAPTER III John Grey the Worthy Man mister Grey s answer to Alice Vavasor s letter which was duly sent by return of post and duly received on the morning after Lady Macleod s visit may perhaps be taken as giving a sample of his worthiness It was dated from Nethercoats a small country house in Cambridgeshire which belonged to him at which he already spent much of his time and at which he intended to live altogether after his marriage Nethercoats June one hundred eighty six DEAREST ALICE I am glad you have settled your affairs foreign affairs I mean so much to your mind As to your home affairs they are not to my thinking quite so satisfactorily arranged But as I am a party interested in the latter my opinion may perhaps have an undue bias Touching the tour I quite agree with you that you and Kate would have been uncomfortable alone It s a very fine theory that of women being able to get along without men as well as with them but like other fine theories it will be found very troublesome by those who first put it in practice Gloved hands petticoats feminine softness and the general homage paid to beauty all stand in the way of success These things may perhaps some day be got rid of and possibly with advantage but while young ladies are still encumbered with them a male companion will always be found to be a comfort I don t quite know whether your cousin George is the best possible knight you might have chosen I should consider myself to be infinitely preferable had my going been upon the cards Were you in danger of meeting Paynim foes he no doubt would kill them off much quicker than I could do and would be much more serviceable in liberating you from the dungeons of oppressors or even from stray tigers in the Swiss forests But I doubt his being punctual with the luggage He will want you or Kate to keep the accounts if any are kept He will be slow in getting you glasses of water at the railway stations and will always keep you waiting at breakfast I hold that a man with two ladies on a tour should be an absolute slave to them or they will not fully enjoy themselves He should simply be an upper servant with the privilege of sitting at the same table with his mistresses I have my doubts as to whether your cousin is fit for the place but as to myself it is just the thing that I was made for Luckily however neither you nor Kate are without wills of your own and perhaps you may be able to reduce mister Vavasor to obedience As to the home affairs I have very little to say here in this letter I shall of course run up and see you before you start and shall probably stay a week in town I know I ought not to do so as it will be a week of idleness and yet not a week of happiness I d sooner have an hour with you in the country than a whole day in London And I always feel in town that I ve too much to do to allow of my doing anything If it were sheer idleness I could enjoy it but it is a feverish idleness in which one is driven here and there expecting some gratification which not only never comes but which never even begins to come I will however undergo a week of it say the last seven days of this month and shall trust to you to recompense me by as much of yourself as your town doings will permit And now again as to those home affairs If I say nothing now I believe you will understand why I refrain You have cunningly just left me to imply from what you say that all my arguments have been of no avail but you do not answer them or even tell me that you have decided I shall therefore imply nothing and still trust to my personal eloquence for success Or rather not trust not trust but hope The garden is going on very well We are rather short of water and therefore not quite as bright as I had hoped but we are preparing with untiring industry for future brightness Your commands have been obeyed in all things and Morrison always says The mistress didn t mean this or The mistress did intend that God bless the mistress is what I now say and send her home to her own home to her flowers and her fruit and her house and her husband as soon as may be with no more of these delays which are to me so grievous and which seem to me to be so unnecessary That is my prayer Yours ever and always J G I didn t give commands Alice said to herself as she sat with the letter at her solitary breakfast table He asked me how I liked the things and of course I was obliged to say I was obliged to seem to care even if I didn t care Such were her first thoughts as she put the letter back into its envelope after reading it the second time When she opened it which she did quickly not pausing a moment lest she should suspect herself of fearing to see what might be its contents her mind was full of that rebuke which her aunt had anticipated and which she had almost taught herself to expect She had torn the letter open rapidly and had dashed at its contents with quick eyes In half a moment she had seen what was the nature of the reply respecting the proposed companion of her tour and then she had completed her reading slowly enough No I gave no commands she repeated to herself as though she might thereby absolve herself from blame in reference to some possible future accusations which might perhaps be brought against her under certain circumstances which she was contemplating Then she considered the letter bit by bit taking it backwards and sipping her tea every now and then amidst her thoughts No she had no home no house there She had no husband not as yet He spoke of their engagement as though it were a betrothal as betrothals used to be of yore as though they were already in some sort married Such betrothals were not made now a days There still remained both to him and to her a certain liberty of extricating themselves from this engagement Should he come to her and say that he found that their contemplated marriage would not make him happy would not she release him without a word of reproach Would not she regard him as much more honourable in doing so than in adhering to a marriage which was distasteful to him And if she would so judge him judge him and certainly acquit him was it not reasonable that she under similar circumstances should expect a similar acquittal Then she declared to herself that she carried on this argument within her own breast simply as an argument induced to do so by that assertion on his part that he was already her husband that his house was even now her home She had no intention of using that power which was still hers She had no wish to go back from her pledged word She thought that she had no such wish She loved him much and admired him even more than she loved him He was noble generous clever good so good as to be almost perfect nay for aught she knew he was perfect Would that he had some faults Would that he had Would that he had How could she full of faults as she knew herself to be how could she hope to make happy a man perfect as he was But then there would be no doubt as to her present duty She loved him and that was everything Having told him that she loved him and having on that score accepted his love nothing but a change in her heart towards him could justify her in seeking to break the bond which bound them together She did love him and she loved him only But she had once loved her cousin Yes truly it was so In her thoughts she did not now deny it She had loved him and was tormented by a feeling that she had had a more full delight in that love than in this other that had sprung up subsequently She had told herself that this had come of her youth that love at twenty was sweeter than it could be afterwards There had been a something of rapture in that earlier dream which could never be repeated which could never live indeed except in a dream Now now that she was older and perhaps wiser love meant a partnership in which each partner would be honest to the other in which each would wish and strive for the other s welfare so that thus their joint welfare might be insured Then in those early girlish days it had meant a total abnegation of self The one was of earth and therefore possible The other had been a ray from heaven and impossible except in a dream And she had been mistaken in her first love She admitted that frankly He whom she had worshipped had been an idol of clay and she knew that it was well for her to have abandoned that idolatry He had not only been untrue to her but worse than that had been false in excusing his untruth He had not only promised falsely but had made such promises with a deliberate premeditated falsehood And he had been selfish coldly selfish weighing the value of his own low lusts against that of her holy love She had known this and had parted from him with an oath to herself that no promised contrition on his part should ever bring them again together But she had pardoned him as a man though never as a lover and had bade him welcome again as a cousin and as her friend s brother She had again become very anxious as to his career not hiding her regard but professing that anxiety aloud She knew him to be clever ambitious bold and she believed even yet in spite of her own experience that he might not be bad at heart Now as she told herself that in truth she loved the man to whom her troth was plighted I fear that she almost thought more of that other man from whom she had torn herself asunder Why should he find himself unhappy in London she said as she went back to the letter Why should he pretend to condemn the very place which most men find the fittest for all their energies Were I a man no earthly consideration should induce me to live elsewhere It is odd how we differ in all things However brilliant might be his own light he would be contented to hide it under a bushel And at last she recurred to that matter as to which she had been so anxious when she first opened her lover s letter It will be remembered how assured she had expressed herself that mister Grey would not condescend to object to her travelling with her cousin He had not so condescended He had written on the matter with a pleasant joke like a gentleman as he was disdaining to allude to the past passages in the life of her whom he loved abstaining even from expressing anything that might be taken as a permission on his part There had been in Alice s words as she told him of their proposed plan a something that had betrayed a tremor in her thoughts She had studiously striven so to frame her phrases that her tale might be told as any other simple statement as though there had been no trembling in her mind as she wrote But she had failed and she knew that she had failed She had failed and he had read all her effort and all her failure She was quite conscious of this she felt it thoroughly and she knew that he was noble and a gentleman to the last drop of his blood And yet yet yet there was almost a feeling of disappointment in that he had not written such a letter as Lady Macleod had anticipated During the next week Lady Macleod still came almost daily to Queen Anne Street but nothing further was said between her and Miss Vavasor as to the Swiss tour nor were any questions asked about mister Grey s opinion on the subject The old lady of course discovered that there was no quarrel or as she believed any probability of a quarrel and with that she was obliged to be contented Nor did she again on this occasion attempt to take Alice to Lady Midlothian s Indeed their usual subjects of conversation were almost abandoned and Lady Macleod s visits though they were as constant as heretofore were not so long She did not dare to talk about mister Grey and because she did not so dare was determined to regard herself as in a degree ill used So she was silent reserved and fretful At length came the last day of her London season and her last visit to her niece I would come because it s my last day said Lady Macleod but really I m so hurried and have so many things to do that I hardly know how to manage it It s very kind said Alice giving her aunt an affectionate squeeze of the hand I m keeping the cab so I can just stay twenty five minutes I ve marked the time accurately but I know the man will swear it s over the half hour You ll have no more trouble about cabs aunt when you are back in Cheltenham The flies are worse my dear I really think they re worse I pay the bill every month but they ve always one down that I didn t have It s the regular practice for I ve had them from all the men in the place It s hard enough to find honest men anywhere I suppose Or honest women either What do you think of missus Green wanting to charge me for an extra week because she says I didn t give her notice till Tuesday morning I won t pay her and she may stop my things if she dares However it s the last time I shall never come up to London again my dear Oh aunt don t say that But I do say it my dear What should an old woman like me do trailing up to town every year merely because it s what people choose to call the season To see your friends of course Age doesn t matter when a person s health is so good as yours If you knew what I suffer from lumbago though I must say coming to London always does cure that for the time But as for friends Well I suppose one has no right to complain when one gets to be as old as I am but I declare I believe that those I love best would sooner be without me than with me Do you mean me aunt No my dear I don t mean you Of course my life would have been very different if you could have consented to remain with me till you were married But I didn t mean you I don t know that I meant any one You shouldn t mind what an old woman like me says You re a little melancholy because you re going away No indeed I don t know why I stayed the last week I did say to Lady Midlothian that I thought I should go on the twentieth and though I know that she knew that I really didn t go she has not once sent to me since To be sure they ve been out every night but I thought she might have asked me to come and lunch It s so very lonely dining by myself in lodgings in London And yet you never will come and dine with me No my dear no But we won t talk about that I ve just one word more to say Let me see I ve just six minutes to stay I ve made up my mind that I ll never come up to town again except for one thing And what s that aunt Alice as she asked the question well knew what that one thing was I ll come for your marriage my dear I do hope you will not keep me long waiting Ah I can t make any promise There s no knowing when that may be And why should there be no knowing I always think that when a girl is once engaged the sooner she s married the better There may be reasons for delay on the gentleman s part There very often are you know But Alice you don t mean to say that mister Grey is putting it off Alice was silent for a moment during which Lady Macleod s face assumed a look of almost tragic horror Was there something wrong on mister Grey s side of which she was altogether unaware Alice though for a second or two she had been guilty of a slight playful deceit was too honest to allow the impression to remain No aunt she said mister Grey is not putting it off It has been left to me to fix the time And why don t you fix it It is such a serious thing After all it is not more than four months yet since I I accepted him I don t know that there has been any delay But you might fix the time now if he wishes it Well perhaps I shall some day aunt I m going to think about it and you mustn t drive me But you should have some one to advise you Alice Ah that s just it People always do seem to think it so terrible that a girl should have her own way in anything She mustn t like any one at first and then when she does like some one she must marry him directly she s bidden I haven t much of my own way at present but you see when I m married I shan t have it at all You can t wonder that I shouldn t be in a hurry I am not advocating anything like hurry my dear But goodness gracious me I ve been here twenty eight minutes and that horrid man will impose upon me Good bye God bless you Mind you write And Lady Macleod hurried out of the room more intent at the present moment upon saving her sixpence than she was on any other matter whatsoever And then John Grey came up to town arriving a day or two after the time that he had fixed It is not perhaps improbable that Alice had used some diplomatic skill in preventing a meeting between Lady Macleod and her lover They both were very anxious to obtain the same object and Alice was to some extent opposed to their views Had Lady Macleod and John Grey put their forces together she might have found herself unable to resist their joint endeavours She was resolved that she would not at any rate name any day for her marriage before her return from Switzerland and she may therefore have thought it wise to keep mister Grey in the country till after Lady Macleod had gone even though she thereby cut down the time of his sojourn in London to four days On the occasion of that visit mister Vavasor did a very memorable thing He dined at home with the view of welcoming his future son in law He dined at home and asked or rather assented to Alice s asking George and Kate Vavasor to join the dinner party What an auspicious omen for the future nuptials said Kate with her little sarcastic smile Uncle John dines at home and mister Grey joins in the dissipation of a dinner party We shall all be changed soon I suppose and George and I will take to keeping a little cottage in the country Kate said Alice angrily I think you are about the most unjust person I ever met I would forgive your raillery however painful it might be if it were only fair And to whom is it unfair on the present occasion to your father It was not intended for him To yourself I care nothing as to myself you know that very well Then it must have been unfair to mister Grey Yes it was mister Grey whom you meant to attack If I can forgive him for not caring for society surely you might do so Exactly but that s just what you can t do my dear You don t forgive him If you did you might be quite sure that I should say nothing And if you choose to bid me hold my tongue I will say nothing But when you tell me all your own thoughts about this thing you can hardly expect but that I should let you know mine in return I m not particular and if you are ready for a little good wholesome useful hypocrisy I won t balk you I mayn t be quite so dishonest as you call me but I m not so wedded to truth but what I can look and act and speak a few falsehoods if you wish it Only let us understand each other You know I wish for no falsehood Kate I know it s very hard to understand what you do wish I know that for the last year or two I have been trying to find out your wishes and upon my word my success has been very indifferent I suppose you wish to marry mister Grey but I m by no means certain I suppose the last thing on earth you d wish would be to marry George The very last You re right there at any rate Alice sometimes you drive me too hard you do indeed You make me doubt whether I hate or love you most Knowing what my feelings are about George I cannot understand how you can bring yourself to speak of him to me with such contempt Kate Vavasor as she spoke these words left the room with a quick step and hurried up to her own chamber There Alice found her in tears and was driven by her friend s real grief into the expression of an apology which she knew was not properly due from her Kate was acquainted with all the circumstances of that old affair between her brother and Alice She had given in her adhesion to the propriety of what Alice had done She had allowed that her brother George s behaviour had been such as to make any engagement between them impossible The fault therefore had been hers in making any reference to the question of such a marriage Nor had it been by any means her first fault of the same kind Till Alice had become engaged to mister Grey she had spoken of George only as her brother or as her friend s cousin but now she was constantly making allusion to those past occurrences which all of them should have striven to forget Under these circumstances was not Lady Macleod right in saying that George Vavasor should not have been accepted as a companion for the Swiss tour Illustration Sometimes you drive me too hard The little dinner party went off very quietly and if no other ground existed for charging mister Grey with London dissipation than what that afforded he was accused most unjustly The two young men had never before met each other and Vavasor had gone to his uncle s house prepared not only to dislike but to despise his successor in Alice s favour But in this he was either disappointed or gratified as the case may be He has plenty to say for himself he said to Kate on his way home Oh yes he can talk And he doesn t talk like a prig either which was what I expected He s uncommonly handsome I thought men never saw that in each other I never see it in any man I see it in every animal in men women horses dogs and even pigs I like to look on handsome things I think people always do who are ugly themselves And so you re going into raptures in favour of John Grey No I m not I very seldom go into raptures about anything But he talks in the way I like a man to talk How he bowled my uncle over about those actors and yet if my uncle knows anything about anything it is about the stage twenty years ago There was nothing more said then about John Grey but Kate understood her brother well enough to be aware that this praise meant very little George Vavasor spoke sometimes from his heart and did so more frequently to his sister than to any one else but his words came generally from his head On the day after the little dinner in Queen Anne Street John Grey came to say good bye to his betrothed for his betrothed she certainly was in spite of those very poor arguments which she had used in trying to convince herself that she was still free if she wished to claim her freedom Though he had been constantly with Alice during the last three days he had not hitherto said anything as to the day of their marriage He had been constantly with her alone sitting for hours in that ugly green drawing room but he had never touched the subject He had told her much of Switzerland which she had never yet seen but which he knew well He had told her much of his garden and house whither she had once gone with her father whilst paying a visit nominally to the colleges at Cambridge And he had talked of various matters matters bearing in no immediate way upon his own or her affairs for mister Grey was a man who knew well how to make words pleasant but previous to this last moment he had said nothing on that subject on which he was so intent Well Alice he said when the last hour had come and about that question of home affairs Let us finish off the foreign affairs first We have finished them haven t we Finished them why we haven t started yet No you haven t started But we ve had the discussion Is there any reason why you d rather not have this thing settled No no special reason Then why not let it be fixed Do you fear coming to me as my wife No I cannot think that you repent your goodness to me No I don t repent it what you call my goodness I love you too entirely for that My darling And now he passed his arm round her waist as they stood near the empty fireplace And if you love me I do love you Then why should you not wish to come to me I do wish it I think I wish it But Alice you must have wished it altogether when you consented to be my wife A person may wish for a thing altogether and yet not wish for it instantly Instantly Come I have not been hard on you This is still June Will you say the middle of September and we shall still be in time for warm pleasant days among the lakes Is that asking for too much It is not asking for anything Nay but it is love Grant it and I will swear that you have granted me everything She was silent having things to say but not knowing in what words to put them Now that he was with her she could not say the things which she had told herself that she would utter to him She could not bring herself to hint to him that his views of life were so unlike her own that there could be no chance of happiness between them unless each could strive to lean somewhat towards the other No man could be more gracious in word and manner than John Grey no man more chivalrous in his carriage towards a woman but he always spoke and acted as though there could be no question that his manner of life was to be adopted without a word or thought of doubting by his wife When two came together why should not each yield something and each claim something This she had meant to say to him on this day but now that he was with her she could not say it John she said at last do not press me about this till I return But then you will say the time is short It would be short then I cannot answer you now indeed I cannot That is I cannot answer in the affirmative It is such a solemn thing Will it ever be less solemn dearest Never I hope never He did not press her further then but kissed her and bade her farewell CHAPTER IV George Vavasor the Wild Man It will no doubt be understood that George Vavasor did not roam about in the woods unshorn or wear leathern trappings and sandals like Robinson Crusoe instead of coats and trousers His wildness was of another kind Indeed I don t know that he was in truth at all wild though Lady Macleod had called him so and Alice had assented to her use of the word George Vavasor had lived in London since he was twenty and now at the time of the beginning of my story he was a year or two over thirty He was and ever had been the heir to his grandfather s estate but that estate was small and when George first came to London his father was a strong man of forty with as much promise of life in him as his son had A profession had therefore been absolutely necessary to him and he had at his uncle John s instance been placed in the office of a parliamentary land agent With this parliamentary land agent he had quarrelled to the knife but not before he had by his talents made himself so useful that he had before him the prospects of a lucrative partnership in the business George Vavasor had many faults but idleness absolute idleness was not one of them He would occasionally postpone his work to pleasure He would be at Newmarket when he should have been at Whitehall But it was not usual with him to be in bed when he should be at his desk and when he was at his desk he did not whittle his ruler or pick his teeth or clip his nails Upon the whole his friends were pleased with the first five years of his life in London in spite of his having been found to be in debt on more than one occasion But his debts had been paid and all was going on swimmingly when one day he knocked down the parliamentary agent with a blow between the eyes and then there was an end of that He himself was wont to say that he had known very well what he was about that it had behoved him to knock down the man who was to have been his partner and that he regretted nothing in the matter At any rate the deed was looked upon with approving eyes by many men of good standing or at any rate sufficient standing to help George to another position and within six weeks of the time of his leaving the office at Whitehall he had become a partner in an established firm of wine merchants A great aunt had just then left him a couple of thousand pounds which no doubt assisted him in his views with the wine merchants In this employment he remained for another period of five years and was supposed by all his friends to be doing very well And indeed he did not do badly only that he did not do well enough to satisfy himself He was ambitious of making the house to which he belonged the first house in the trade in London and scared his partners by the boldness and extent of his views He himself declared that if they would only have gone along with him he would have made them princes in the wine market But they were men either of more prudence or of less audacity than he and they declined to walk in his courses At the end of the five years Vavasor left the house not having knocked any one down on this occasion and taking with him a very nice sum of money The two last of these five years had certainly been the best period of his life for he had really worked very hard like a man giving up all pleasure that took time from him and giving up also most pleasures which were dangerous on account of their costliness He went to no races played no billiards and spoke of Cremorne as a childish thing which he had abandoned now that he was no longer a child It was during these two years that he had had his love passages with his cousin and it must be presumed that he had at any rate intended at one time to settle himself respectably as a married man He had however behaved very badly to Alice and the match had been broken off He had also during the last two years quarrelled with his grandfather He had wished to raise a sum of money on the Vavasor estate which as it was unentailed he could only do with his grandfather s concurrence The old gentleman would not hear of it would listen with no patience to the proposition It was in vain that George attempted to make the squire understand that the wine business was going on very well that he himself owed no man anything that everything with him was flourishing but that his trade might be extended indefinitely by the use of a few thousand pounds at moderate interest Old mister Vavasor was furious No documents and no assurances could make him lay aside a belief that the wine merchants and the business and his grandson were all ruined and ruinous together No one but a ruined man would attempt to raise money on the family estate So they had quarrelled and had never spoken or seen each other since He shall have the estate for his life the squire said to his son John I don t think I have a right to leave it away from him It never has been left away from the heir But I ll tie it up so that he shan t cut a tree on it John Vavasor perhaps thought that the old rule of primogeniture might under such circumstances have been judiciously abandoned in this one instance in his own favour But he did not say so Nor would he have said it had there been a chance of his doing so with success He was a man from whom no very noble deed could be expected but he was also one who would do no ignoble deed After that George Vavasor had become a stockbroker and a stockbroker he was now In the first twelve months after his leaving the wine business the same being the first year after his breach with Alice he had gone back greatly in the estimation of men He had lived in open defiance of decency He had spent much money and had apparently made none and had been as all his friends declared on the high road to ruin Aunt Macleod had taken her judgement from this period of his life when she had spoken of him as a man who never did anything But he had come forth again suddenly as a working man and now they who professed to know declared that he was by no means poor He was in the City every day and during the last two years had earned the character of a shrewd fellow who knew what he was about who might not perhaps be very mealy mouthed in affairs of business but who was fairly and decently honourable in his money transactions In fact he stood well on Change And during these two years he had stood a contest for a seat in Parliament having striven to represent the metropolitan borough of Chelsea on the extremely Radical interest It is true that he had failed and that he had spent a considerable sum of money in the contest Where on earth does your nephew get his money men said to John Vavasor at his club Upon my word I don t know said Vavasor He doesn t get it from me and I m sure he doesn t get it from my father But George Vavasor though he failed at Chelsea did not spend his money altogether fruitlessly He gained reputation by the struggle and men came to speak of him as though he were one who would do something He was a stockbroker a thorough going Radical and yet he was the heir to a fine estate which had come down from father to son for four hundred years There was something captivating about his history and adventures especially as just at the time of the election he became engaged to an heiress who died a month before the marriage should have taken place She died without a will and her money all went to some third cousins George Vavasor bore this last disappointment like a man and it was at this time that he again became fully reconciled to his cousin Previous to this they had met and Alice at her cousin Kate s instigation had induced her father to meet him But at first there had been no renewal of real friendship Alice had given her cordial assent to her cousin s marriage with the heiress Miss Grant telling Kate that such an engagement was the very thing to put him thoroughly on his feet And then she had been much pleased by his spirit at that Chelsea election It was grand of him wasn t it said Kate her eyes brimming full of tears It was very spirited said Alice If you knew all you would say so They could get no one else to stand but that mister Travers and he wouldn t come forward unless they would guarantee all his expenses I hope it didn t cost George much said Alice It did though nearly all he had got But what matters Money s nothing to him except for its uses My own little mite is my own now and he shall have every farthing of it for the next election even though I should go out as a housemaid the next day There must have been something great about George Vavasor or he would not have been so idolized by such a girl as his sister Kate Early in the present spring before the arrangements for the Swiss journey were made George Vavasor had spoken to Alice about that intended marriage which had been broken off by the lady s death He was sitting one evening with his cousin in the drawing room in Queen Anne Street waiting for Kate who was to join him there before going to some party I wonder whether Kate had had a hint from her brother to be late At any rate the two were together for an hour and the talk had been all about himself He had congratulated her on her engagement with mister Grey which had just become known to him and had then spoken of his own last intended marriage I grieved for her he said greatly I m sure you did George Yes I did for her herself Of course the world has given me credit for lamenting the loss of her money But the truth is that as regards both herself and her money it is much better for me that we were never married Do you mean even though she should have lived Yes even had she lived And why so If you liked her her money was surely no drawback No not if I had liked her And did you not like her No Oh George I did not love her as a man should love his wife if you mean that As for my liking her I did like her I liked her very much But you would have loved her I don t know I don t find that task of loving so very easy It might have been that I should have learned to hate her If so it is better for you and better for her that she has gone It is better I am sure of it And yet I grieve for her and in thinking of her I almost feel as though I were guilty of her death But she never suspected that you did not love her Oh no But she was not given to think much of such things She took all that for granted Poor girl she is at rest now and her money has gone where it should go among her own relatives Yes with such feelings as yours are about her her money would have been a burden to you I would not have taken it I hope at least that I would not have taken it Money is a sore temptation especially to a poor man like me It is well for me that the trial did not come in my way But you are not such a very poor man now are you George I thought your business was a good one It is and I have no right to be a poor man But a man will be poor who does such mad things as I do I had three or four thousand pounds clear and I spent every shilling of it on the Chelsea election Goodness knows whether I shall have a shilling at all when another chance comes round but if I have I shall certainly spend it and if I have not I shall go in debt wherever I can raise a hundred pounds I hope you will be successful at last I feel sure that I shall But in the mean time I cannot but know that my career is perfectly reckless No woman ought to join her lot to mine unless she has within her courage to be as reckless as I am You know what men do when they toss up for shillings Yes I suppose I do I am tossing up every day of my life for every shilling that I have Do you mean that you re gambling No I have given that up altogether I used to gamble but I never do that now and never shall again What I mean is this that I hold myself in readiness to risk everything at any moment in order to gain any object that may serve my turn I am always ready to lead a forlorn hope That s what I mean by tossing up every day for every shilling that I have Alice did not quite understand him and perhaps he did not intend that she should Perhaps his object was to mystify her imagination She did not understand him but I fear that she admired the kind of courage which he professed And he had not only professed it in that matter of the past election he had certainly practised it In talking of beauty to his sister he had spoken of himself as being ugly He would not generally have been called ugly by women had not one side of his face been dreadfully scarred by a cicatrice which in healing had left a dark indented line down from his left eye to his lower jaw That black ravine running through his cheek was certainly ugly On some occasions when he was angry or disappointed it was very hideous for he would so contort his face that the scar would as it were stretch itself out revealing all its horrors and his countenance would become all scar He looked at me like the devil himself making the hole in his face gape at me the old squire had said to John Vavasor in describing the interview in which the grandson had tried to bully his grandfather into assenting to his own views about the mortgage But in other respects George s face was not ugly and might have been thought handsome by many women His hair was black and was parted in the front His forehead though low was broad His eyes were dark and bright and his eyebrows were very full and perfectly black At those periods of his anger all his face which was not scar was eye and eyebrow He wore a thick black moustache which covered his mouth but no whiskers People said of him that he was so proud of his wound that he would not grow a hair to cover it The fact however was that no whisker could be made to come sufficiently forward to be of service and therefore he wore none The story of that wound should be told When he was yet hardly more than a boy before he had come up to London he was living in a house in the country which his father then occupied At the time his father was absent and he and his sister only were in the house with the maid servants His sister had a few jewels in her room and an exaggerated report of them having come to the ears of certain enterprising burglars a little plan was arranged for obtaining them A small boy was hidden in the house a window was opened and at the proper witching hour of night a stout individual crept up stairs in his stocking feet and was already at Kate Vavasor s door when in the dark dressed only in his nightshirt wholly unarmed George Vavasor flew at the fellow s throat Two hours elapsed before the horror stricken women of the house could bring men to the place George s face had then been ripped open from the eye downwards with some chisel or house breaking instrument But the man was dead George had wrenched from him his own tool and having first jabbed him all over with insufficient wounds had at last driven the steel through his windpipe The small boy escaped carrying with him two shillings and threepence which Kate had left upon the drawing room mantelpiece George Vavasor was rather low in stature but well made with small hands and feet but broad in the chest and strong in the loins He was a fine horseman and a hard rider and men who had known him well said that he could fence and shoot with a pistol as few men care to do in these peaceable days Since volunteering had come up he had become a captain of Volunteers and had won prizes with his rifle at Wimbledon Such had been the life of George Vavasor and such was his character and such his appearance He had always lived alone in London and did so at present but just now his sister was much with him as she was staying up in town with an aunt another Vavasor by birth with whom the reader will if he persevere become acquainted in course of time I hope he will persevere a little for of all the Vavasors missus Greenow was perhaps the best worth knowing But Kate Vavasor s home was understood to be in her grandfather s house in Westmoreland On the evening before they started for Switzerland George and Kate walked from Queen Anne Street where they had been dining with Alice to missus Greenow s house Everything had been settled about luggage hours of starting and routes as regarded their few first days and the common purse had been made over to George That portion of mister Grey s letter had been read which alluded to the Paynims and the glasses of water and everything had passed in the best of good humour I ll endeavour to get the cold water for you George had said but as to the breakfasts I can only hope you won t put me to severe trials by any very early hours When people go out for pleasure it should be pleasure The brother and sister walked through two or three streets in silence and then Kate asked a question George I wonder what your wishes really are about Alice That she shouldn t want her breakfast too early while we are away That means that I m to hold my tongue of course No it doesn t Then it means that you intend to hold yours No not that either Then what does it mean That I have no fixed wishes on the subject Of course she ll marry this man John Grey and then no one will hear another word about her She will no doubt if you don t interfere Probably she will whether you interfere or not But if you wish to interfere She s got four hundred a year and is not so good looking as she was Yes she has got four hundred a year and she is more handsome now than ever she was I know that you think so and that you love her and love no one else unless you have a sneaking fondness for me I ll leave you to judge of that last And as for me I only love two people in the world her and you If ever you mean to try you should try now CHAPTER V The Balcony at Basle I am not going to describe the Vavasors Swiss tour It would not be fair on my readers Six Weeks in the Bernese Oberland by party of three would have but very small chance of success in the literary world at present and I should consider myself to be dishonest if I attempt to palm off such matter on the public in the pages of a novel It is true that I have just returned from Switzerland and should find such a course of writing very convenient But I dismiss the temptation strong as it is Retro age Satanas No living man or woman any longer wants to be told anything of the Grimsell or of the Gemmi Ludgate Hill is now a days more interesting than the Jungfrau The Vavasors were not very energetic on their tour As George had said they had gone out for pleasure and not for work They went direct to Interlaken and then hung about between that place and Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen It delighted him to sit still on some outer bench looking at the mountains with a cigar in his mouth and it seemed to delight them to be with him Much that mister Grey prophesied had come true The two girls were ministers to him instead of having him as their slave What fine fellows those Alpine club men think themselves he said on one of these occasions and how thoroughly they despise the sort of enjoyment I get from mountains But they re mistaken I don t see why either need be mistaken said Alice But they are mistaken he continued They rob the mountains of their poetry which is or should be their greatest charm Mont Blanc can have no mystery for a man who has been up it half a dozen times It s like getting behind the scenes at a ballet or making a conjuror explain his tricks But is the exercise nothing said Kate Yes the exercise is very fine but that avoids the question And they all botanize said Alice I don t believe it I believe that the most of them simply walk up the mountain and down again But if they did that avoids the question also The poetry and mystery of the mountains are lost to those who make themselves familiar with their details not the less because such familiarity may have useful results In this world things are beautiful only because they are not quite seen or not perfectly understood Poetry is precious chiefly because it suggests more than it declares Look in there through that valley where you just see the distant little peak at the end Are you not dreaming of the unknown beautiful world that exists up there beautiful as heaven is beautiful because you know nothing of the reality If you make your way up there and back to morrow and find out all about it do you mean to say that it will be as beautiful to you when you come back Yes I think it would said Alice Then you ve no poetry in you Now I m made up of poetry After that they began to laugh at him and were very happy I think that mister Grey was right in answering Alice s letter as he did but I think that Lady Macleod was also right in saying that Alice should not have gone to Switzerland in company with George Vavasor A peculiar familiarity sprang up which had all its circumstances been known to mister Grey would not have entirely satisfied him even though no word was said which might in itself have displeased him During the first weeks of their travelling no word was said which would have displeased him but at last when the time for their return was drawing nigh when their happiness was nearly over and that feeling of melancholy was coming on them which always pervades the last hours of any period that has been pleasant then words became softer than they had been and references were made to old days allusions which never should have been permitted between them Alice had been very happy more happy perhaps in that she had been a joint minister with Kate to her cousin George s idle fantasies than she would have been hurrying about with him as her slave They had tacitly agreed to spoil him with comforts and girls are always happier in spoiling some man than in being spoiled by men And he had taken it all well doing his despotism pleasantly exacting much but exacting nothing that was disagreeable And he had been amusing always as Alice thought without any effort But men and women when they show themselves at their best seldom do so without an effort If the object be near the heart the effort will be pleasant to him who makes it and if it be made well it will be hidden but not the less will the effort be there George Vavasor had on the present occasion done his very best to please his cousin They were sitting at Basle one evening in the balcony of the big hotel which overlooks the Rhine The balcony runs the length of the house and is open to all the company but it is spacious and little parties can be formed there with perfect privacy The swift broad Rhine runs underneath rushing through from the bridge which here spans the river and every now and then on summer evenings loud shouts come up from strong swimmers in the water who are glorying in the swiftness of the current The three were sitting there by themselves at the end of the balcony Coffee was before them on a little table and George s cigar as usual was in his mouth It s nearly all over said he after they had remained silent for some minutes And I do think it has been a success said Kate Always excepting about the money I m ruined for ever I ll make your money all straight said George Indeed you ll do nothing of the kind said Kate I m ruined but you are ruineder But what signifies It is such a great thing ever to have had six weeks happiness that the ruin is in point of fact a good speculation What do you say Alice Won t you vote too that we ve done it well I think we ve done it very well I have enjoyed myself thoroughly And now you ve got to go home to John Grey and Cambridgeshire It s no wonder you should be melancholy That was the thought in Kate s mind but she did not speak it out on this occasion That s good of you Alice said Kate Is it not George I like a person who will give a hearty meed of approbation But I am giving the meed of approbation to myself I like a person even to do that heartily said Kate Not that George and I are thankful for the compliment We are prepared to admit that we owe almost everything to you are we not George I m not by any means said George Well I am and I expect to have something pretty said to me in return Have I been cross once Alice No I don t think you have You are never cross though you are often ferocious But I haven t been once ferocious nor has George He would have been the most ungrateful man alive if he had said Alice We ve done nothing since we ve started but realize from him that picture in Punch of the young gentleman at Jeddo who had a dozen ladies to wait upon him And now he has got to go home to his lodgings and wait upon himself again Poor fellow I do pity you George No you don t nor does Alice I believe girls always think that a bachelor in London has the happiest of all lives It s because they think so that they generally want to put an end to the man s condition It s envy that makes us want to get married not love said Kate It s the devil in some shape as often as not said he With a man marriage always seems to him to be an evil at the instant Not always said Alice Almost always but he does it as he takes physic because something worse will come if he don t A man never likes having his tooth pulled out but all men do have their teeth pulled out and they who delay it too long suffer the very mischief I do like George s philosophy said Kate getting up from her chair as she spoke it is so sharp and has such a pleasant acid taste about it and then we all know that it means nothing Alice I m going up stairs to begin the final packing I ll come with you dear No don t To tell the truth I m only going into that man s room because he won t put up a single thing of his own decently We ll do ours of course when we go up to bed Whatever you disarrange to night Master George you must rearrange for yourself to morrow morning for I promise I won t go into your room at five o clock How I do hate that early work said George I ll be down again very soon said Kate Then we ll take one turn on the bridge and go to bed Alice and George were left together sitting in the balcony They had been alone together before many times since their travels had commenced but they both of them felt that there was something to them in the present moment different from any other period of their journey There was something that each felt to be sweet undefinable and dangerous Alice had known that it would be better for her to go up stairs with Kate but Kate s answer had been of such a nature that had she gone she would have shown that she had some special reason for going Why should she show such a need Or why indeed should she entertain it Alice was seated quite at the end of the gallery and Kate s chair was at her feet in the corner When Alice and Kate had seated themselves the waiter had brought a small table for the coffee cups and George had placed his chair on the other side of that So that Alice was as it were a prisoner She could not slip away without some special preparation for going and Kate had so placed her chair in leaving that she must actually have asked George to move it before she could escape But why should she wish to escape Nothing could be more lovely and enticing than the scene before her The night had come on with quick but still unperceived approach as it does in those parts for the twilight there is not prolonged as it is with us more northern folk The night had come on but there was a rising moon which just sufficed to give a sheen to the water beneath her The air was deliciously soft of that softness which produces no sensation either of warmth or cold but which just seems to touch one with loving tenderness as though the unseen spirits of the air kissed one s forehead as they passed on their wings The Rhine was running at her feet so near that in the soft half light it seemed as though she might step into its ripple The Rhine was running by with that delicious sound of rapidly moving waters that fresh refreshing gurgle of the river which is so delicious to the ear at all times If you be talking it wraps up your speech keeping it for yourselves making it difficult neither to her who listens nor to him who speaks If you would sleep it is of all lullabies the sweetest If you are alone and would think it aids all your thoughts If you are alone and alas would not think if thinking be too painful it will dispel your sorrow and give the comfort which music alone can give Alice felt that the air kissed her that the river sang for her its sweetest song that the moon shone for her with its softest light that light which lends the poetry of half developed beauty to everything that it touches Why should she leave it Nothing was said for some minutes after Kate s departure and Alice was beginning to shake from her that half feeling of danger which had come over her Vavasor had sat back in his chair leaning against the house with his feet raised upon a stool his arms were folded across his breast and he seemed to have divided himself between his thoughts and his cigar Alice was looking full upon the river and her thoughts had strayed away to her future home among John Grey s flower beds and shrubs but the river though it sang to her pleasantly seemed to sing a song of other things than such a home as that a song full of mystery as are all river songs when one tries to understand their words When are you to be married Alice said George at last Oh George said she You ask me a question as though you were putting a pistol to my ear I m sorry the question was so unpleasant I didn t say that it was unpleasant but you asked it so suddenly The truth is I didn t expect you to speak at all just then I suppose I was thinking of something But if it be not unpleasant when are you to be married I do not know It is not fixed But about when I mean This summer Certainly not this summer for the summer will be over when we reach home This winter Next spring Next year or in ten years time Before the expiration of the ten years I suppose Anything more exact than that I can t say I suppose you like it he then said What being married You see I ve never tried yet The idea of it the anticipation You look forward with satisfaction to the kind of life you will lead at Nethercoats Don t suppose I am saying anything against it for I have no conception what sort of a place Nethercoats is On the whole I don t know that there is any kind of life better than that of an English country gentleman in his own place that is if he can keep it up and not live as the old squire does in a state of chronic poverty mister Grey s place doesn t entitle him to be called a country gentleman But you like the prospect of it Oh George how you do cross question one Of course I like it or I shouldn t have accepted it That does not follow But I quite acknowledge that I have no right to cross question you If I ever had such right on the score of cousinship I have lost it on the score of but we won t mind that will we Alice To this she at first made no answer but he repeated the question Will we Alice Will we what Recur to the old days Why should we recur to them They are passed and as we are again friends and dear cousins the sting of them is gone Ah yes The sting of them is gone It is for that reason because it is so that we may at last recur to them without danger If we regret nothing if neither of us has anything to regret why not recur to them and talk of them freely No George that would not do By heavens no It would drive me mad and if I know aught of you it would hardly leave you as calm as you are at present As I would wish to be left calm Would you Then I suppose I ought to hold my tongue But Alice I shall never have the power of speaking to you again as I speak now Since we have been out together we have been dear friends is it not so And shall we not always be dear friends No certainly not How will it be possible Think of it How can I really be your friend when you are the mistress of that man s house in Cambridgeshire George I mean nothing disrespectful I truly beg your pardon if it has seemed so Let me say that gentleman s house for he is a gentleman That he certainly is You could not have accepted him were he not so But how can I be your friend when you are his wife I may still call you cousin Alice and pat your children on the head if I chance to see them and shall stop in the streets and shake hands with him if I meet him that is if my untoward fate does not induce him to cut my acquaintance but as for friendship that will be over when you and I shall have parted next Thursday evening at London Bridge Oh George don t say so But I do And why on Thursday Do you mean that you won t come to Queen Anne Street any more Yes that is what I do mean This trip of ours has been very successful Kate says Perhaps Kate knows nothing about it It has been very pleasant at least to me And the pleasure has had no drawback None to me It has been very pleasant to me also but the pleasure has had its alloy Alice I have nothing to ask from you nothing Anything that you should ask I would do for you I have nothing to ask nothing But I have one word to say George do not say it Let me go up stairs Let me go to Kate Certainly if you wish it you shall go He still held his foot against the chair which barred her passage and did not attempt to rise as he must have done to make way for her passage out Certainly you shall go to Kate if you refuse to hear me But after all that has passed between us after these six weeks of intimate companionship I think you ought to listen to me I tell you that I have nothing to ask I am not going to make love to you Alice had commenced some attempt to rise but she had again settled herself in her chair And now when he paused for a moment she made no further sign that she wished to escape nor did she say a word to intimate her further wish that he should be silent I am not going to make love to you he said again As for making love as the word goes that must be over between you and me It has been made and marred and cannot be remade It may exist or it may have been expelled but where it does not exist it will never be brought back again It should not be spoken of between you and me So no doubt any proper going duenna would say and so too little children should be told but between you and me there can be no necessity for falsehood We have grown beyond our sugar toothed ages and are now men and women I perfectly understood your breaking away from me I understood you and in spite of my sorrow knew that you were right I am not going to accuse or to defend myself but I knew that you were right Then let there be no more about it Yes there must be more about it I did not understand you when you accepted mister Grey Against him I have not a whisper to make He may be perfect for aught I know But knowing you as I thought I did I could not understand your loving such a man as him It was as though one who had lived on brandy should take himself suddenly to a milk diet and enjoy the change A milk diet is no doubt the best But men who have lived on brandy can t make those changes very suddenly They perish in the attempt Not always George It may be done with months of agony but there was no such agony with you Who can tell But you will tell me the cure was made I thought so and therefore thought that I should find you changed I thought that you who had been all fire would now have turned yourself into soft flowing milk and honey and have become fit for the life in store for you With such a one I might have travelled from Moscow to Malta without danger The woman fit to be John Grey s wife would certainly do me no harm could not touch my happiness I might have loved her once might still love the memory of what she had been but her in her new form after her new birth such a one as that Alice could be nothing to me Don t mistake me I have enough of wisdom in me to know how much better ay and happier a woman she might be It was not that I thought you had descended in the scale but I gave you credit for virtues which you have not acquired Alice that wholesome diet of which I spoke is not your diet You would starve on it and perish He had spoken with great energy but still in a low voice having turned full round upon the table with both his arms upon it and his face stretched out far over towards her She was looking full at him and as I have said before that scar and his gloomy eyes and thick eyebrows seemed to make up the whole of his face But the scar had never been ugly to her She knew the story and when he was her lover she had taken pride in the mark of the wound She looked at him but though he paused she did not speak The music of the river was still in her ears and there came upon her a struggle as though she were striving to understand its song Were the waters also telling her of the mistake she had made in accepting mister Grey as her husband What her cousin was now telling her was it not a repetition of words which she had spoken to herself hundreds of times during the last two months Was she not telling herself daily hourly always in every thought of her life that in accepting mister Grey she had assumed herself to be mistress of virtues which she did not possess Had she not in truth rioted upon brandy till the innocence of milk was unfitted for her This man now came and rudely told her all this but did he not tell her the truth She sat silent and convicted only gazing into his face when his speech was done I have learned this since we have been again together Alice and finding you not the angel I had supposed finding you to be the same woman I had once loved the safety that I anticipated has not fallen to my lot That s all Here s Kate and now we ll go for our walk CHAPTER VI The Bridge over the Rhine George said Kate speaking before she quite got up to them will you tell me whether you have been preparing all your things for an open sale by auction Then she stole a look at Alice and having learned from that glance that something had occurred which prevented Alice from joining her in her raillery she went on with it herself rapidly as though to cover Alice s confusion and give her time to rally before they should all move Would you believe it he had three razors laid out on his table A man must shave even at Basle But not with three razors at once and three hair brushes and half a dozen toothbrushes and a small collection of combs and four or five little glass bottles looking as though they contained poison all with silver tops I can only suppose you desired to startle the weak mind of the chambermaid I have put them all up but remember this if they are taken out again you are responsible And I will not put up your boots George What can you have wanted with three pairs of boots at Basle When you have completed the list of my wardrobe we ll go out upon the bridge That is if Alice likes it Oh yes I shall like it Come along then said Kate And so they moved away When they got upon the bridge Alice and Kate were together while George strolled behind them close to them but not taking any part in their conversation as though he had merely gone with them as an escort Kate seemed to be perfectly content with this arrangement chattering to Alice so that she might show that there was nothing serious on the minds of any of them It need hardly be said that Alice at this time made no appeal to George to join them He followed them at their heels with his hands behind his back looking down upon the pavement and simply waiting upon their pleasure Do you know said Kate I have a very great mind to run away Where do you want to run to Well that wouldn t much signify Perhaps I d go to the little inn at Handek It s a lonely place where nobody would hear of me and I should have the waterfall I m afraid they d want to have their bill paid That would be the worst of it But why run away just now I won t because you wouldn t like going home with George alone and I suppose he d be bound to look after me as he s doing now I wonder what he thinks of having to walk over the bridge after us girls I suppose he d be in that place down there drinking beer if we weren t here If he wanted to go I dare say he would in spite of us That s ungrateful of you for I m sure we ve never been kept in a moment by his failing us But as I was saying I do dread going home You are going to John Grey which may be pleasant enough but I m going to Aunt Greenow It s your own choice No it s not I haven t any choice in the matter Of course I might refuse to speak to Aunt Greenow and nobody could make me but practically I haven t any choice in the matter Fancy a month at Yarmouth with no companion but such a woman as that I shouldn t mind it Aunt Greenow always seems to me to be a very good sort of woman She may be a good woman but I must say I think she s of a bad sort You ve never heard her talk about her husband No never I think she did cry a little the first day she came to Queen Anne Street but that wasn t unnatural He was thirty years older than herself But still he was her husband And even if her tears are assumed what of that What s a woman to do Of course she was wrong to marry him She was thirty five and had nothing while he was sixty five and was very rich According to all accounts she made him a very good wife and now that she s got all his money you wouldn t have her go about laughing within three months of his death No I wouldn t have her laugh but neither would I have her cry And she s quite right to wear weeds but she needn t be so very outrageous in the depth of her hems or so very careful that her caps are becoming Her eyes will be worn out by their double service They are always red with weeping and yet she is ready every minute with a full battery of execution for any man that she sees Then why have you consented to go to Yarmouth with her Just because she s got forty thousand pounds If mister Greenow had left her with a bare maintenance I don t suppose I should ever have held out my hand to her Then you re as bad as she is Quite as bad and that s what makes me want to run away But it isn t my own fault altogether It s the fault of the world at large Does anybody ever drop their rich relatives When she proposed to take me to Yarmouth wasn t it natural that the squire should ask me to go When I told George wasn t it natural that he should say Oh go by all means She s got forty thousand pounds One can t pretend to be wiser or better than one s relatives And after all what can I expect from her money Nothing I should say Not a halfpenny I m nearly thirty and she s only forty and of course she ll marry again I will say of myself too that no person living cares less for money I should think no one Yet one sticks to one s rich relatives It s the way of the world Then she paused a moment But shall I tell you Alice why I do stick to her Perhaps you ll think the object as mean as though I wanted her money myself Why is it Because it is on the cards that she may help George in his career I do not want money but he may And for such purposes as his I think it fair that all the family should contribute I feel sure that he would make a name for himself in Parliament and if I had my way I would spend every shilling of Vavasor money in putting him there When I told the squire so I thought he would have eaten me I really did think he would have turned me out of the house And serve you right too after what had happened I didn t care Let him turn me out I was determined he should know what I thought He swore at me and then he was so unhappy at what he had done that he came and kissed me that night in my bedroom and gave me a ten pound note What do you think I did with it I sent it as a contribution to the next election and George has it now locked up in a box Don t you tell him that I told you Then they stopped and leaned for a while over the parapet of the bridge Come here George said Kate and she made room for him between herself and Alice Wouldn t you like to be swimming down there as those boys were doing when we went out into the balcony The water looks so enticing I can t say I should unless it might be a pleasant way of swimming into the next world I should so like to feel myself going with the stream said Kate particularly by this light I can t fancy in the least that I should be drowned I can t fancy anything else said Alice It would be so pleasant to feel the water gliding along one s limbs and to be carried away headlong knowing that you were on the direct road to Rotterdam And so arrive there without your clothes said George They would be brought after in a boat Didn t you see that those boys had a boat with them But if I lived here I d never do it except by moonlight The water looks so clear and bright now and the rushing sound of it is so soft The sea at Yarmouth won t be anything like that I suppose Neither of them any longer answered her and yet she went on talking about the river and their aunt and her prospects at Yarmouth Neither of them answered her and yet it seemed that they had not a word to say to each other But still they stood there looking down upon the river and every now and then Kate s voice was to be heard preventing the feeling which might otherwise have arisen that their hearts were too full for speech At last Alice seemed to shiver There was a slight trembling in her arms which George felt rather than saw You are cold he said No indeed If you are let us go in I thought you shivered with the night air It wasn t that I was thinking of something Don t you ever think of things that make you shiver Indeed I do very often so often that I have to do my shiverings inwardly Otherwise people would think I had the palsy I don t mean things of moment said Alice Little bits of things make me do it perhaps a word that I said and ought not to have said ten years ago the most ordinary little mistakes even my own past thoughts to myself about the merest trifles They are always making me shiver It s not because you have committed any murder then No but it s my conscience all the same I suppose Ah I m not so good as you I doubt it s not my conscience at all When I think of a chance I ve let go by as I have thousands then it is that I shiver But as I tell you I shiver inwardly I ve been in one long shiver ever since we came out because of one chance that I let go by Come we ll go in We ve to be up at five o clock and now it s eleven I ll do the rest of my shivering in bed Are you tired of being out said Kate when the other two began to move Not tired of being out but George reminds me that we have to be up at five I wish George would hold his tongue We can t come to the bridge at Basle every night in our lives If one found oneself at the top of Sinai I m afraid the first feeling would be one of fear lest one wouldn t be down in time to dress for dinner Are you aware George that the king of rivers is running beneath your feet and that the moon is shining with a brilliance you never see at home I ll stay here all night if you ll put off going to morrow said George Our money wouldn t hold out said Kate Don t talk about Sinai any more after that said he but let s go in to bed They walked across the bridge back to the hotel in the same manner as before the two girls going together with the young man after them and so they went up the front steps of the hotel through the hall and on to the stairs Here George handed Alice her candle and as he did so he whispered a few words to her My shivering fit has to come yet said he and will last me the whole night She would have given much to be able to answer him lightly as though what he had said had meant nothing but she couldn t do it the light speech would not come to her She was conscious of all this and went away to her own room without answering him at all Here she sat down at the window looking out upon the river till Kate should join her Their rooms opened through from one to the other and she would not begin her packing till her cousin should come But Kate had gone with her brother promising as she did so that she would be back in half a minute That half minute was protracted beyond half an hour If you ll take my advice said Kate at last standing up with her candle in her hand you ll ask her in plain words to give you another chance Do it to morrow at Strasbourg you ll never have a better opportunity And bid her throw John Grey over Don t say anything about John Grey leave her to settle that matter with herself Believe me that she has quite courage enough to dispose of John Grey if she has courage enough to accept your offer Kate you women never understand each other If I were to do that all her most powerful feelings would be arrayed in arms against me I must leave her to find out first that she wishes to be rid of her engagement She has found that out long ago Do you think I don t know what she wishes But if you can t bring yourself to speak to her she ll marry him in spite of her wishes Bring myself I ve never been very slow in bringing myself to speak to any one when there was need It isn t very pleasant sometimes but I do it if I find occasion But surely it must be pleasant with her You must be glad to find that she still loves you You still love her I suppose Upon my word I don t know Don t provoke me George I m moving heaven and earth to bring you two together but if I didn t think you loved her I d go to her at once and bid her never see you again Upon my word Kate I sometimes think it would be better if you d leave heaven and earth alone Then I will But of all human beings surely you re the most ungrateful Why shouldn t she marry John Grey if she likes him But she doesn t like him And I hate him I hate the sound of his voice and the turn of his eye and that slow steady movement of his as though he was always bethinking himself that he wouldn t wear out his clothes I don t see that your hating him ought to have anything to do with it If you re going to preach morals I ll leave you It s the darling wish of my heart that she should be your wife If you ever loved anybody and I sometimes doubt whether you ever did but if you did you loved her Did and do are different things Very well George then I have done It has been the same in every twist and turn of my life In everything that I have striven to do for you you have thrown yourself over in order that I might be thrown over too But I believe you say this merely to vex me Upon my word Kate I think you d better go to bed But not till I ve told her everything I won t leave her to be deceived and ill used again Who is ill using her now Is it not the worst of ill usage trying to separate her from that man No if I thought so I would have no hand in doing it She would be miserable with him and make him miserable as well She does not really love him He loves her but I ve nothing to do with that It s nothing to me if he breaks his heart I shall break mine if you don t let me go to bed With that she went away and hurried along the corridor till she came to her cousin s room She found Alice still seated at the window or rather kneeling on the chair with her head out through the lattice Why you lazy creature said Kate I declare you haven t touched a thing You said we d do it together But he has kept me Oh what a man he is If he ever does get married what will his wife do with him I don t think he ever will said Alice Don t you I dare say you understand him better than I do Sometimes I think that the only thing wanting to make him thoroughly good is a wife But it isn t every woman that would do for him And the woman who marries him should have high courage There are moments with him when he is very wild but he never is cruel and never hard Is mister Grey ever hard Never nor yet wild Oh certainly not that I m quite sure he s never wild When you say that Kate I know that you mean to abuse him No upon my word What s the good of abusing him to you I like a man to be wild wild in my sense You knew that before I wonder whether you d like a wild man for yourself Ah that s a question I ve never asked myself I ve been often curious to consider what sort of husband would suit you but I ve had very few thoughts about a husband for myself The truth is I m married to George Ever since Ever since what Since you and he were parted I ve had nothing to do in life but to stick to him And I shall do so to the end unless one thing should happen And what s that Unless you should become his wife after all He will never marry anybody else Kate you shouldn t allude to such a thing now You know that it s impossible Well perhaps so As far as I m concerned it is all the better for me If George ever married I should have nothing to do in the world literally nothing nothing nothing nothing Kate don t talk in that way and Alice came up to her and embraced her Go away said she Go Alice you and I must part I cannot bear it any longer You must know it all When you are married to John Grey our friendship must be over If you became George s wife I should become nobody I ve nothing else in the world You and he would be so all sufficient for each other that I should drop away from you like an old garment But I d give up all everything every hope I have to see you become George s wife I know myself not to be good I know myself to be very bad and yet I care nothing for myself Don t Alice don t I don t want your caresses Caress him and I ll kneel at your feet and cover them with kisses She had now thrown herself upon a sofa and had turned her face away to the wall Kate you shouldn t speak in that way Of course I shouldn t but I do You who know everything must know that I cannot marry your brother even if he wished it He does wish it Not though I were under no other engagement And why not said Kate again starting up What is there to separate you from George now but that unfortunate affair that will end in the misery of you all Do you think I can t see Don t I know which of the two men you like best You are making me sorry Kate that I have ventured to come here in your brother s company It is not only unkind of you to talk to me in this way but worse than that it is indelicate Oh indelicate How I do hate that word If any word in the language reminds me of a whited sepulchre it is that all clean and polished outside with filth and rottenness within Are your thoughts delicate that s the thing You are engaged to marry John Grey That may be delicate enough if you love him truly and feel yourself fitted to be his wife but it s about the most indelicate thing you can do if you love any one better than him Delicacy with many women is like their cleanliness Nothing can be nicer than the whole outside get up but you wouldn t wish to answer for anything beneath If you think ill of me like that No I don t think ill of you How can I think ill of you when I know that all your difficulties have come from him It hasn t been your fault it has been his throughout It is he who has driven you to sacrifice yourself on this altar If we can both of us manage to lay aside all delicacy and pretence and dare to speak the truth we shall acknowledge that it is so Had mister Grey come to you while things were smooth between you and George would you have thought it possible that he could be George s rival in your estimation It is Hyperion to Satyr And which is the Satyr I ll leave your heart to tell you You know what is the darling wish of my heart But Alice if I thought that mister Grey was to you Hyperion if I thought that you could marry him with that sort of worshipping idolatrous love which makes a girl proud as well as happy in her marriage I wouldn t raise a little finger to prevent it To this Alice made no answer and then Kate allowed the matter to drop Alice made no answer though she felt that she was allowing judgement to go against her by default in not doing so She had intended to fight bravely and to have maintained the excellence of her present position as the affianced bride of mister Grey but she felt that she had failed She felt that she had in some sort acknowledged that the match was one to be deplored that her words in her own defence would by no means have satisfied mister Grey if mister Grey could have heard them that they would have induced him to offer her back her troth rather than have made him happy as a lover But she had nothing further to say She could do something She would hurry home and bid him name the earliest day he pleased After that her cousin would cease to disturb her in her career It was nearly one o clock before the two girls began to prepare for their morning start and Alice when they had finished their packing seemed to be worn out with fatigue If you are tired dear we ll put it off said Kate Not for worlds said Alice For half a word we ll do it continued Kate I ll slip out to George and tell him and there s nothing he d like so much But Alice would not consent About two they got into bed and punctually at six they were at the railway station Don t speak to me said George when he met them at their door in the passage I shall only yawn in your face However they were in time which means abroad that they were at the station half an hour before their train started and they went on upon their journey to Strasbourg There is nothing further to be told of their tour They were but two days and nights on the road from Basle to London and during those two days and nights neither George nor Kate spoke a word to Alice of her marriage nor was any allusion made to the balcony at the inn or to the bridge over the river CHAPTER VII Aunt Greenow Kate Vavasor remained only three days in London before she started for Yarmouth and during those three days she was not much with her cousin I m my aunt s body and soul for the next six weeks she said to Alice when she did come to Queen Anne Street on the morning after her arrival And she is exigeant in a manner I can t at all explain to you You mustn t be surprised if I don t even write a line I ve escaped by stealth now She went up stairs to try on some new weeds for the seaside and then I bolted She did not say a word about George nor during those three days nor for some days afterwards did George show himself As it turned out afterwards he had gone off to Scotland and had remained a week among the grouse Thus at least he had accounted for himself and his movements but all George Vavasor s friends knew that his goings out and comings in were seldom accounted for openly like those of other men It will perhaps be as well to say a few words about missus Greenow before we go with her to Yarmouth missus Greenow was the only daughter and the youngest child of the old squire at Vavasor Hall She was just ten years younger than her brother John and I am inclined to think that she was almost justified in her repeated assertion that the difference was much greater than ten years by the freshness of her colour and by the general juvenility of her appearance She certainly did not look forty and who can expect a woman to proclaim herself to be older than her looks In early life she had been taken from her father s house and had lived with relatives in one of the large towns in the north of England It is certain she had not been quite successful as a girl Though she had enjoyed the name of being a beauty she had not the usual success which comes from such repute At thirty four she was still unmarried She had moreover acquired the character of being a flirt and I fear that the stories which were told of her though doubtless more than half false had in them sufficient of truth to justify the character Now this was very sad seeing that Arabella Vavasor had no fortune and that she had offended her father and brothers by declining to comply with their advice at certain periods of her career There was indeed considerable trouble in the minds of the various male Vavasors with reference to Arabella when tidings suddenly reached the Hall that she was going to be married to an old man She was married to the old man and the marriage fortunately turned out satisfactorily at any rate for the old man and for her family The Vavasors were relieved from all further trouble and were as much surprised as gratified when they heard that she did her duty well in her new position Arabella had long been a thorn in their side never having really done anything which they could pronounce to be absolutely wrong but always giving them cause for fear Now they feared no longer Her husband was a retired merchant very rich not very strong in health and devoted to his bride Rumours soon made their way to Vavasor Hall and to Queen Anne Street that missus Greenow was quite a pattern wife and that mister Greenow considered himself to be the happiest old man in Lancashire And now in her prosperity she quite forgave the former slights which had been put upon her by her relatives She wrote to her dear niece Alice and to her dearest niece Kate and sent little presents to her father On one occasion she took her husband to Vavasor Hall and there was a regular renewal of all the old family feelings Arabella s husband was an old man and was very old for his age but the whole thing was quite respectable and there was at any rate no doubt about the money Then mister Greenow died and the widow having proved the will came up to London and claimed the commiseration of her nieces Why not go to Yarmouth with her for a month George had said to Kate Of course it will be a bore But an aunt with forty thousand pounds has a right to claim attention Kate acknowledged the truth of the argument and agreed to go to Yarmouth for a month Your aunt Arabella has shown herself to be a very sensible woman the old squire had written much more sensible than anybody thought her before her marriage Of course you should go with her if she asks you What aunt uncle or cousin in the uncontrolled possession of forty thousand pounds was ever unpopular in the family Yarmouth is not a very prepossessing place to the eye To my eye at any rate it is not so There is an old town with which summer visitors have little or nothing to do and there are the new houses down by the sea side to which at any rate belongs the full advantage of sea air A kind of esplanade runs for nearly a mile along the sands and there are built or in the course of building rows of houses appropriated to summer visitors all looking out upon the sea There is no beauty unless the yellow sandy sea can be called beautiful The coast is low and straight and the east wind blows full upon it But the place is healthy and missus Greenow was probably right in thinking that she might there revive some portion of the health which she had lost in watching beside the couch of her departing lord Omnibus no indeed Jeannette get me a fly These were the first words missus Greenow spoke as she put her foot upon the platform at the Yarmouth station Her maid s name was Jenny but Kate had already found somewhat to her dismay that orders had been issued before they left London that the girl was henceforth to be called Jeannette Kate had also already found that her aunt could be imperious but this taste for masterdom had not shown itself so plainly in London as it did from the moment that the train had left the station at Shoreditch In London missus Greenow had been among Londoners and her career had hitherto been provincial Her spirit no doubt had been somewhat cowed by the novelty of her position But when she felt herself to be once beyond the stones as the saying used to be she was herself again and at Ipswich she had ordered Jeannette to get her a glass of sherry with an air which had created a good deal of attention among the guards and porters The fly was procured and with considerable exertion all missus Greenow s boxes together with the more moderate belongings of her niece and maid were stowed on the top of it round upon the driver s body on the coach box on the maid s lap and I fear in Kate s also and upon the vacant seat The large house in Montpelier Parade said missus Greenow They is all large ma am said the driver The largest said missus Greenow They re much of a muchness said the driver Then missus Jones s said missus Greenow But I was particularly told it was the largest in the row I know missus Jones s well said the driver and away they went missus Jones s house was handsome and comfortable but I fear missus Greenow s satisfaction in this respect was impaired by her disappointment in finding that it was not perceptibly bigger than those to the right and left of her Her ambition in this and in other similar matters would have amused Kate greatly had she been a bystander and not one of her aunt s party missus Greenow was good natured liberal and not by nature selfish but she was determined not to waste the good things which fortune had given and desired that all the world should see that she had forty thousand pounds of her own And in doing this she was repressed by no feeling of false shame She never hesitated in her demands through bashfulness She called aloud for such comfort and grandeur as Yarmouth could afford her and was well pleased that all around should hear her calling Joined to all this was her uncontrolled grief for her husband s death Dear Greenow sweet lamb Oh Kate if you d only known that man When she said this she was sitting in the best of missus Jones s sitting rooms waiting to have dinner announced She had taken a drawing room and dining room because as she had said she didn t see why people should be stuffy when they went to the seaside not if they had means to make themselves comfortable Oh Kate I do wish you d known him I wish I had said Kate very untruly I was unfortunately away when he went to Vavasor Hall Ah yes but it was at home in the domestic circle that Greenow should have been seen to be appreciated I was a happy woman Kate while that lasted And Kate was surprised to see that real tears one or two on each side were making their way down her aunt s cheeks But they were soon checked with a handkerchief of the broadest hem and of the finest cambric Dinner ma am said Jeannette opening the door Jeannette I told you always to say that dinner was served Dinner s served then said Jeannette in a tone of anger Come Kate said her aunt I ve but little appetite myself but there s no reason you shouldn t eat your dinner I specially wrote to missus Jones to have some sweetbread I do hope she s got a decent cook It s very little I eat myself but I do like to see things nice The next day was Sunday and it was beautiful to see how missus Greenow went to church in all the glory of widowhood There had been a great unpacking after that banquet on the sweetbread and all her funereal millinery had been displayed before Kate s wondering eyes The charm of the woman was in this that she was not in the least ashamed of anything that she did She turned over all her wardrobe of mourning showing the richness of each article the stiffness of the crape the fineness of the cambric the breadth of the frills telling the price of each to a shilling while she explained how the whole had been amassed without any consideration of expense This she did with all the pride of a young bride when she shows the glories of her trousseau to the friend of her bosom Jeannette stood by the while removing one thing and exhibiting another Now and again through the performance missus Greenow would rest a while from her employment and address the shade of the departed one in terms of most endearing affection In the midst of this missus Jones came in but the widow was not a whit abashed by the presence of the stranger Peace be to his manes she said at last as she carefully folded up a huge black crape mantilla She made however but one syllable of the classical word and missus Jones thought that her lodger had addressed herself to the mortal remains of her deceased lord Illustration Peace be to his manes He is left her uncommon well off I suppose said missus Jones to Jeannette You may say that ma am It s more nor a hundred thousand of pounds No Pounds of sterling ma am Indeed it is to my knowledge Why don t she have a carriage So she do but a lady can t bring her carriage down to the sea when she s only just buried her husband as one may say What d folks say if they saw her in her own carriage But it ain t because she can t afford it missus Jones And now we re talking of it you must order a fly for church to morrow that ll look private you know She said I was to get a man that had a livery coat and gloves The man with the coat and gloves was procured and missus Greenow s entry into church made quite a sensation There was a thoughtfulness about her which alone showed that she was a woman of no ordinary power She foresaw all necessities and made provision for all emergencies Another would not have secured an eligible sitting and been at home in Yarmouth church till half the period of her sojourn there was over But missus Greenow had done it all She walked up the middle aisle with as much self possession as though the chancel had belonged to her family for years and the respectable pew opener absolutely deserted two or three old ladies whom she was attending to show missus Greenow into her seat When seated she was the cynosure of all eyes Kate Vavasor became immediately aware that a great sensation had been occasioned by their entrance and equally aware that none of it was due to her I regret to say that this feeling continued to show itself throughout the whole service How many ladies of forty go to church without attracting the least attention But it is hardly too much to say that every person in that church had looked at missus Greenow I doubt if there was present there a single married lady who on leaving the building did not speak to her husband of the widow There had prevailed during the whole two hours a general though unexpressed conviction that something worthy of remark had happened that morning It had an effect even upon the curate s reading and the incumbent while preaching his sermon could not keep his eyes off that wonderful bonnet and veil On the next morning before eleven missus Greenow s name was put down at the Assembly Room I need hardly say that in my present condition I care nothing for these things Of course I would sooner be alone But my dear Kate I know what I owe to you Kate with less intelligence than might have been expected from one so clever began to assure her aunt that she required no society and that coming thus with her to the seaside in the early days of her widowhood she had been well aware that they would live retired But missus Greenow soon put her down and did so without the slightest feeling of shame or annoyance on her own part My dear she said in this matter you must let me do what I know to be right I should consider myself to be very selfish if I allowed my grief to interfere with your amusements But aunt I don t care for such amusements That s nonsense my dear You ought to care for them How are you to settle yourself in life if you don t care for them My dear aunt I am settled Settled said missus Greenow astounded as though there must have been some hidden marriage of which she had not heard But that s nonsense Of course you re not settled and how are you to be if I allow you to shut yourself up in such a place as this just where a girl has a chance It was in vain that Kate tried to stop her It was not easy to stop missus Greenow when she was supported by the full assurance of being mistress of the place and of the occasion No my dear I know very well what I owe to you and I shall do my duty As I said before society can have no charms now for such a one as I am All that social intercourse could ever do for me lies buried in my darling s grave My heart is desolate and must remain so But I m not going to immolate you on the altars of my grief I shall force myself to go out for your sake Kate But dear aunt the world will think it so odd just at present I don t care twopence for the world What can the world do to me I m not dependent on the world thanks to the care of that sainted lamb I can hold my own and as long as I can do that the world won t hurt me No Kate if I think a thing s right I shall do it I mean to make the place pleasant for you if I can and the world may object if it likes missus Greenow was probably right in her appreciation of the value of her independence Remarks may perhaps have been made by the world of Yarmouth as to her early return to society People no doubt did remind each other that old Greenow was hardly yet four months buried missus Jones and Jeannette probably had their little jokes down stairs But this did not hurt missus Greenow What was said was not said in her hearing missus Jones s bills were paid every Saturday with admirable punctuality and as long as this was done everybody about the house treated the lady with that deference which was due to the respectability of her possessions When a recently bereaved widow attempts to enjoy her freedom without money then it behoves the world to speak aloud and the world does its duty Numerous people came to call at Montpelier Parade and Kate was astonished to find that her aunt had so many friends She was indeed so bewildered by these strangers that she could hardly ascertain whom her aunt had really known before and whom she now saw for the first time Somebody had known somebody who had known somebody else and that was allowed to be a sufficient introduction always presuming that the existing somebody was backed by some known advantages of money or position missus Greenow could smile from beneath her widow s cap in a most bewitching way Upon my word then she is really handsome Kate wrote one day to Alice But she could also frown and knew well how to put aside or if need be to reprobate any attempt at familiarity from those whose worldly circumstances were supposed to be disadvantageous My dear aunt said Kate one morning after their walk upon the pier how you did snub that Captain Bellfield Captain Bellfield indeed I don t believe he s a captain at all At any rate he has sold out and the tradesmen have had a scramble for the money He was only a lieutenant when the ninety seventh were in Manchester and I m sure he s never had a shilling to purchase since that But everybody here seems to know him Perhaps they do not know so much of him as I do The idea of his having the impudence to tell me I was looking very well Nothing can be so mean as men who go about in that way when they haven t money enough in their pockets to pay their washerwomen But how do you know aunt that Captain Bellfield hasn t paid his washerwoman I know more than you think my dear It s my business How could I tell whose attentions you should receive and whose you shouldn t if I didn t inquire into these things It was in vain that Kate rebelled or attempted to rebel against this more than maternal care She told her aunt that she was now nearly thirty and that she had managed her own affairs at any rate with safety for the last ten years but it was to no purpose Kate would get angry but missus Greenow never became angry Kate would be quite in earnest but missus Greenow would push aside all that her niece said as though it were worth nothing Kate was an unmarried woman with a very small fortune and therefore of course was desirous of being married with as little delay as possible It was natural that she should deny that it was so especially at this early date in their mutual acquaintance When the niece came to know her aunt more intimately there might be confidence between them and then they would do better But missus Greenow would spare neither herself nor her purse on Kate s behalf and she would be a dragon of watchfulness in protecting her from the evil desires of such useless men as Captain Bellfield I declare Kate I don t understand you she said one morning to her niece as they sat together over a late breakfast They had fallen into luxurious habits and I am afraid it was past eleven o clock although the breakfast things were still on the table Kate would usually bathe before breakfast but missus Greenow was never out of her room till half past ten I like the morning for contemplation she once said When a woman has gone through all that I have suffered she has a great deal to think of And it is so much more comfortable to be a thinking when one s in bed said Jeannette who was present at the time Child hold your tongue said the widow Yes ma am said Jeannette But we ll return to the scene at the breakfast table What don t you understand aunt You only danced twice last night and once you stood up with Captain Bellfield On purpose to ask after that poor woman who washes his clothes without getting paid for it Nonsense Kate you didn t ask him anything of the kind I m sure It s very provoking It is indeed But what harm can Captain Bellfield do me What good can he do you That s the question You see my dear years will go by I don t mean to say you ain t quite as young as ever you were and nothing can be nicer and fresher than you are especially since you took to bathing Oh aunt don t My dear the truth must be spoken I declare I don t think I ever saw a young woman so improvident as you are When are you to begin to think about getting married if you don t do it now I shall never begin to think about it till I buy my wedding clothes That s nonsense sheer nonsense How are you to get wedding clothes if you have never thought about getting a husband Didn t I see mister Cheesacre ask you for a dance last night Yes he did while you were talking to Captain Bellfield yourself aunt Captain Bellfield can t hurt me my dear And why didn t you dance with mister Cheesacre He s a fat Norfolk farmer with not an idea beyond the virtues of stall feeding My dear every acre of it is his own land every acre And he bought another farm for thirteen thousand pounds only last autumn They re better than the squires some of those gentlemen farmers they are indeed And of all men in the world they re the easiest managed That s a recommendation no doubt Of course it is a great recommendation missus Greenow had no idea of joking when her mind was intent on serious things He s to take us to the picnic to morrow and I do hope you ll manage to let him sit beside you It ll be the place of honour because he gives all the wine He s picked up with that man Bellfield and he s to be there but if you allow your name to be once mixed up with his it will be all over with you as far as Yarmouth is concerned I don t at all want to be mixed up with Captain Bellfield as you call it said Kate Then she subsided into her novel while missus Greenow busied herself about the good things for the picnic In truth the aunt did not understand the niece Whatsoever might be the faults of Kate Vavasor an unmaidenly desire of catching a husband for herself was certainly not one of them CHAPTER VIII mister Cheesacre Yarmouth is not a happy place for a picnic A picnic should be held among green things Green turf is absolutely an essential There should be trees broken ground small paths thickets and hidden recesses There should if possible be rocks old timber moss and brambles There should certainly be hills and dales on a small scale and above all there should be running water There should be no expanse Jones should not be able to see all Greene s movements nor should Augusta always have her eye upon her sister Jane But the spot chosen for mister Cheesacre s picnic at Yarmouth had none of the virtues above described It was on the seashore Nothing was visible from the site but sand and sea There were no trees there and nothing green neither was there any running water But there was a long dry flat strand there was an old boat half turned over under which it was proposed to dine and in addition to this benches boards and some amount of canvas for shelter were provided by the liberality of mister Cheesacre Therefore it was called mister Cheesacre s picnic But it was to be a marine picnic and therefore the essential attributes of other picnics were not required The idea had come from some boating expeditions in which mackerel had been caught and during which food had been eaten not altogether comfortably in the boats Then a thought had suggested itself to Captain Bellfield that they might land and eat their food and his friend mister Cheesacre had promised his substantial aid A lady had surmised that Ormesby sands would be the very place for dancing in the cool of the evening They might Dance on the sand she said and yet no footing seen And so the thing had progressed and the picnic been inaugurated It was mister Cheesacre s picnic undoubtedly mister Cheesacre was to supply the boats the wine the cigars the music and the carpenter s work necessary for the turning of the old boat into a banqueting saloon But missus Greenow had promised to provide the eatables and enjoyed as much of the eclat as the master of the festival She had known mister Cheesacre now for ten days and was quite intimate with him He was a stout florid man of about forty five a bachelor apparently much attached to ladies society bearing no sign of age except that he was rather bald and that grey hairs had mixed themselves with his whiskers very fond of his farming and yet somewhat ashamed of it when he found himself in what he considered to be polite circles And he was moreover a little inclined to seek the honour which comes from a well filled and liberally opened purse He liked to give a man a dinner and then to boast of the dinner he had given He was very proud when he could talk of having mounted for a day s hunting any man who might be supposed to be of higher rank than himself I had Grimsby with me the other day the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwick you know Blessed if he didn t stake my bay mare But what matters I mounted him again the next day just the same Some people thought he was soft for it was very well known throughout Norfolk that young Grimsby would take a mount wherever he could get it In these days missus Greenow had become intimate with mister Cheesacre and had already learned that he was the undoubted owner of his own acres It wouldn t do for me she had said to him to be putting myself forward as if I were giving a party myself or anything of that sort would it now Well perhaps not But you might come with us So I will mister Cheesacre for that dear girl s sake I should never forgive myself if I debarred her from all the pleasures of youth because of my sorrows I need hardly say that at such a time as this nothing of that sort can give me any pleasure I suppose not said mister Cheesacre with solemn look Quite out of the question And missus Greenow wiped away her tears For though as regards age I might dance on the sands as merrily as the best of them That I m sure you could missus Greenow How s a woman to enjoy herself if her heart lies buried But it won t be so always missus Greenow missus Greenow shook her head to show that she hardly knew how to answer such a question Probably it would be so always but she did not wish to put a damper on the present occasion by making so sad a declaration But as I was saying continued she if you and I do it between us won t that be the surest way of having it come off nicely mister Cheesacre thought that it would be the best way Exactly so I ll do the meat and pastry and fruit and you shall do the boats and the wine And the music said Cheesacre and the expenses at the place He did not choose that any part of his outlay should go unnoticed I ll go halves in all that if you like said missus Greenow But mister Cheesacre had declined this He did not begrudge the expense but only wished that it should be recognised And mister Cheesacre continued missus Greenow I did mean to send the music I did indeed I couldn t hear of it missus Greenow But I mention it now because I was thinking of getting Blowehard to come That other man Flutey wouldn t do at all out in the open air It shall be Blowehard said mister Cheesacre and it was Blowehard missus Greenow liked to have her own way in these little things though her heart did lie buried On the morning of the picnic mister Cheesacre came down to Montpelier Parade with Captain Bellfield whose linen on that occasion certainly gave no outward sign of any quarrel between him and his washerwoman He was got up wonderfully and was prepared at all points for the day s work He had on a pseudo sailor s jacket very liberally ornamented with brass buttons which displayed with great judgement the exquisite shapes of his pseudo sailor s duck trousers Beneath them there was a pair of very shiny patent leather shoes well adapted for dancing on the sand presuming him to be anxious of doing so as Venus offered to do without leaving any footmarks His waistcoat was of a delicate white fabric ornamented with very many gilt buttons He had bejewelled studs in his shirt and yellow kid gloves on his hands having of course another pair in his pocket for the necessities of the evening His array was quite perfect and had stricken dismay into the heart of his friend Cheesacre when he joined that gentleman He was a well made man nearly six feet high with dark hair dark whiskers and dark moustache nearly black but of that suspicious hue which to the observant beholder seems always to tell a tale of the hairdresser s shop He was handsome too with well arranged features but carrying perhaps in his nose some first symptoms of the effects of midnight amusements Upon the whole however he was a nice man to look at for those who like to look on nice men of that kind Cheesacre too had adopted something of a sailor s garb He had on a jacket of a rougher sort coming down much lower than that of the captain being much looser and perhaps somewhat more like a garment which a possible seaman might possibly wear But he was disgusted with himself the moment that he saw Bellfield His heart had been faint and he had not dared to ornament himself boldly as his friend had done I say Guss you are a swell he exclaimed It may be explained that Captain Bellfield had been christened Gustavus I don t know much about that said the captain my fellow sent me this toggery and said that it was the sort of thing I ll change with you if you like it But Cheesacre could not have worn that jacket and he walked on hating himself It will be remembered that missus Greenow had spoken with considerable severity of Captain Bellfield s pretensions when discussing his character with her niece but nevertheless on the present occasion she received him with most gracious smiles It may be that her estimate of his character had been altered or that she was making sacrifice of her own feelings in consideration of mister Cheesacre who was known to be the captain s intimate friend But she had smiles for both of them She had a wondrous power of smiling and could upon occasion give signs of peculiar favour to half a dozen different gentlemen in as many minutes They found her in the midst of hampers which were not yet wholly packed while missus Jones Jeannette and the cook of the household moved around her on the outside of the circle ministering to her wants She had in her hand an outspread clean napkin and she wore fastened round her dress a huge coarse apron that she might thus be protected from some possible ebullition of gravy or escape of salad mixture or cream but in other respects she was clothed in the fullest honours of widowhood She had not mitigated her weeds by half an inch She had scorned to make any compromise between the world of pleasure and the world of woe There she was a widow declared by herself to be of four months standing with a buried heart making ready a dainty banquet with skill and liberality She was ready on the instant to sit down upon the baskets in which the grouse pie had been just carefully inhumed and talked about her sainted lamb with a deluge of tears If anybody didn t like it that person might do the other thing mister Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield thought that they did like it Oh mister Cheesacre if you haven t caught me before I ve half done Captain Bellfield I hope you think my apron becoming Everything that you wear missus Greenow is always becoming Don t talk in that way when you know but never mind we will think of nothing sad to day if we can help it Will we mister Cheesacre Oh dear no I should think not unless it should come on to rain It won t rain we won t think of such a thing But by the by Captain Bellfield I and my niece do mean to send out a few things just in a bag you know so that we may tidy ourselves up a little after the sea I don t want it mentioned because if it gets about among the other ladies they d think we wanted to make a dressing of it and there wouldn t be room for them all would there No there wouldn t said mister Cheesacre who had been out on the previous evening inspecting and perhaps limiting the carpenters in their work That s just it said missus Greenow But there won t be any harm will there mister Cheesacre in Jeanette s going out with our things She ll ride in the cart you know with the eatables I know Jeannette s a friend of yours We shall be delighted to have Jeanette said mister Cheesacre Thank ye sir said Jeannette with a curtsey Jeannette don t you let mister Cheesacre turn your head and mind you behave yourself and be useful Well let me see what else is there missus Jones you might as well give me that ham now Captain Bellfield hand it over Don t you put it into the basket because you d turn it the wrong side down There now if you haven t nearly made me upset the apricot pie Then in the transfer of the dishes between the captain and the widow there occurred some little innocent by play which seemed to give offence to mister Cheesacre so that that gentleman turned his back upon the hampers and took a step away towards the door missus Greenow saw the thing at a glance and immediately applied herself to cure the wound What do you think mister Cheesacre said she Kate wouldn t come down because she didn t choose that you should see her with an apron on over her frock I m sure I don t know why Miss Vavasor should care about my seeing her Nor I either That s just what I said Do step up into the drawing room you ll find her there and you can make her answer for herself She wouldn t come down for me said mister Cheesacre But he didn t stir Perhaps he wasn t willing to leave his friend with the widow At length the last of the dishes was packed and missus Greenow went up stairs with the two gentlemen There they found Kate and two or three other ladies who had promised to embark under the protection of missus Greenow s wings There were the two Miss Fairstairs whom missus Greenow had especially patronized and who repaid that lady for her kindness by an amount of outspoken eulogy which startled Kate by its audacity Your dear aunt Fanny Fairstairs had said on coming into the room I don t think I ever came across a woman with such genuine milk of human kindness Nor with so much true wit said her sister Charlotte who had been called Charlie on the sands of Yarmouth for the last twelve years When the widow came into the room they flew at her and devoured her with kisses and swore that they had never seen her looking so well But as the bright new gloves which both the girls wore had been presents from missus Greenow they certainly did owe her some affection There are not many ladies who would venture to bestow such gifts upon their friends after so very short an acquaintance but missus Greenow had a power that was quite her own in such matters She was already on a very confidential footing with the Miss Fairstairs and had given them much useful advice as to their future prospects And then was there a missus Green whose husband was first lieutenant on board a man of war on the West Indian Station missus Green was a quiet ladylike little woman rather pretty very silent and as one would have thought hardly adapted for the special intimacy of missus Greenow But missus Greenow had found out that she was alone not very rich and in want of the solace of society Therefore she had from sheer good nature forced herself upon missus Green and missus Green with much trepidation had consented to be taken to the picnic I know your husband would like it missus Greenow had said and I hope I may live to tell him that I made you go There came in also a brother of the Fairstairs girls Joe Fairstairs a lanky useless idle young man younger than them who was supposed to earn his bread in an attorney s office at Norwich or rather to be preparing to earn it at some future time and who was a heavy burden upon all his friends We told Joe to come to the house said Fanny to the widow apologetically because we thought he might be useful in carrying down the cloaks missus Greenow smiled graciously upon Joe and assured him that she was charmed to see him without any reference to such services as those mentioned And then they started When they got to the door both Cheesacre and the captain made an attempt to get possession of the widow s arm But she had it all arranged Captain Bellfield found himself constrained to attend to missus Green while mister Cheesacre walked down to the beach beside Kate Vavasor I ll take your arm mister Joe said the widow and the girls shall come with us But when they got to the boats round which the other comers to the picnic were already assembled mister Cheesacre although both the boats were for the day his own found himself separated from the widow He got into that which contained Kate Vavasor and was shoved off from the beach while he saw Captain Bellfield arranging missus Greenow s drapery He had declared to himself that it should be otherwise and that as he had to pay the piper the piper should play as he liked it But missus Greenow with a word or two had settled it all and mister Cheesacre had found himself to be powerless How absurd Bellfield looks in that jacket doesn t he he said to Kate as he took his seat in the boat Do you think so I thought it was so very pretty and becoming for the occasion mister Cheesacre hated Captain Bellfield and regretted more than ever that he had not done something for his own personal adornment He could not endure to think that his friend who paid for nothing should carry away the honours of the morning and defraud him of the delights which should justly belong to him It may be becoming said Cheesacre but don t you think it s awfully extravagant As to that I can t tell You see I don t at all know what is the price of a jacket covered all over with little brass buttons And the waistcoat Miss Vavasor said Cheesacre almost solemnly The waistcoat I should think must have been expensive Oh dreadful and he s got nothing Miss Vavasor literally nothing Do you know and he reduced his voice to a whisper as he made this communication I lent him twenty pounds the day before yesterday I did indeed You won t mention it again of course I tell you because as you are seeing a good deal of him just now I think it right that you should know on what sort of a footing he stands It s all fair they say in love and war and this small breach of confidence was we must presume a love stratagem on the part of mister Cheesacre He was at this time smitten with the charms both of the widow and of the niece and he constantly found that the captain was interfering with him on whichever side he turned himself On the present occasion he had desired to take the widow for his share and was upon the whole inclined to think that the widow was the more worthy of his attentions He had made certain little inquiries within the last day or two the answers to which had been satisfactory These he had by no means communicated to his friend to whom indeed he had expressed an opinion that missus Greenow was after all only a flash in the pan She does very well pour passer le temps the captain had answered mister Cheesacre had not quite understood the exact gist of the captain s meaning but had felt certain that his friend was playing him false I don t want it to be mentioned again Miss Vavasor he continued Such things should not be mentioned at all Kate replied having been angered at the insinuation that the nature of Captain Bellfield s footing could be a matter of any moment to her No they shouldn t and therefore I know that I m quite safe with you Miss Vavasor He s a very pleasant fellow very and has seen the world uncommon but he s better for eating and drinking with than he is for buying and selling with as we say in Norfolk Do you like Norfolk Miss Vavasor I never was in it before and now I ve only seen Yarmouth A nice place Yarmouth very but you should come up and see our lands I suppose you don t know that we feed one third of England during the winter months Dear me We do though nobody knows what a county Norfolk is Taking it altogether including the game you know and Lord Nelson and its watering places and the rest of it I don t think there s a county in England to beat it Fancy feeding one third of all England and Wales With bread and cheese do you mean and those sort of things Beef said mister Cheesacre and in his patriotic energy he repeated the word aloud Beef
2053_138901_000055_000004	train-clean-360	 Yes indeed 
none	none	but if you were to tell them that in London they wouldn t believe you Ah you should certainly come down and see our lands The seven point forty five A M train would take you through Norwich to my door as one may say and you would be back by the six point twenty two P M In this way he brought himself back again into good humour feeling that in the absence of the widow he could not do better than make progress with the niece In the mean time missus Greenow and the captain were getting on very comfortably in the other boat Take an oar Captain one of the men had said to him as soon as he had placed the ladies Not to day Jack he had answered I ll content myself with being bo san this morning The best thing as the bo san does is to pipe all hands to grog said the man I won t be behind in that either said the captain and so they all went on swimmingly What a fine generous fellow your friend mister Cheesacre is said the widow Yes he is he s a capital fellow in his way Some of these Norfolk farmers are no end of good fellows And I suppose he s something more than a common farmer He s visited by the people about where he lives isn t he Oh yes in a sort of a way The county people you know keep themselves very much to themselves That s of course But his house he has a good sort of place hasn t he Yes yes a very good house a little too near to the horse pond for my taste But when a man gets his money out of the till he mustn t be ashamed of the counter must he missus Greenow But he could live like a gentleman if he let his own land couldn t he That depends upon how a gentleman wishes to live Here the privacy of their conversation was interrupted by an exclamation from a young lady to the effect that Charlie Fairstairs was becoming sick This Charlie stoutly denied and proved the truth of her assertion by her behaviour Soon after this they completed their marine adventures and prepared to land close to the spot at which the banquet was prepared CHAPTER IX The Rivals There had been a pretence of fishing but no fish had been caught It was soon found that such an amusement would interfere with the ladies dresses and the affairs had become too serious to allow of any trivial interruption I really think mister Cheesacre an anxious mother had said that you d better give it up The water off the nasty cord has got all over Maria s dress already Maria made a faint protest that it did not signify in the least but the fishing was given up not without an inward feeling on the part of mister Cheesacre that if Maria chose to come out with him in his boat having been invited especially to fish she ought to have put up with the natural results There are people who like to take everything and never like to give anything he said to Kate afterwards as he was walking up with her to the picnic dinner But he was unreasonable and unjust The girls had graced his party with their best hats and freshest muslins not that they might see him catch a mackerel but that they might flirt and dance to the best advantage You can t suppose that any girl will like to be drenched with sea water when she has taken so much trouble with her starch said Kate Then she shouldn t come fishing said mister Cheesacre I hate such airs But when they arrived at the old boat missus Greenow shone forth pre eminently as the mistress of the occasion altogether overshadowing mister Cheesacre by the extent of her authority There was a little contest for supremacy between them invisible to the eyes of the multitude but mister Cheesacre in such a matter had not a chance against missus Greenow I am disposed to think that she would have reigned even though she had not contributed to the eatables but with that point in her favour she was able to make herself supreme Jeannette too was her servant which was a great thing mister Cheesacre soon gave way and though he bustled about and was conspicuous he bustled about in obedience to orders received and became a head servant Captain Bellfield also made himself useful but he drove mister Cheesacre into paroxysms of suppressed anger by giving directions and by having those directions obeyed A man to whom he had lent twenty pounds the day before yesterday and who had not contributed so much as a bottle of champagne We re to dine at four and now it s half past three said missus Greenow addressing herself to the multitude And to begin to dance at six said an eager young lady Maria hold your tongue said the young lady s mother Yes we ll dine at four said mister Cheesacre And as for the music I ve ordered it to be here punctual at half past five We re to have three horns cymbals triangle and a drum How very nice isn t it missus Greenow said Charlie Fairstairs And now suppose we begin to unpack said Captain Bellfield Half the fun is in arranging the things Oh dear yes more than half said Fanny Fairstairs Bellfield don t mind about the hampers said Cheesacre Wine is a ticklish thing to handle and there s my man there to manage it It s odd if I don t know more about wine than the boots from the hotel said Bellfield This allusion to the boots almost cowed mister Cheesacre and made him turn away leaving Bellfield with the widow There was a great unpacking during which Captain Bellfield and missus Greenow constantly had their heads in the same hamper I by no means intend to insinuate that there was anything wrong in this People engaged together in unpacking pies and cold chickens must have their heads in the same hamper But a great intimacy was thereby produced and the widow seemed to have laid aside altogether that prejudice of hers with reference to the washerwoman There was a long table placed on the sand sheltered by the upturned boat from the land side but open towards the sea and over this supported on poles there was an awning Upon the whole the arrangement was not an uncomfortable one for people who had selected so very uncomfortable a dining room as the sand of the sea shore Much was certainly due to mister Cheesacre for the expenditure he had incurred and something perhaps to Captain Bellfield for his ingenuity in having suggested it Now came the placing of the guests for dinner and mister Cheesacre made another great effort I ll tell you what he said aloud Bellfield and I will take the two ends of the table and missus Greenow shall sit at my right hand This was not only boldly done but there was a propriety in it which at first sight seemed to be irresistible Much as he had hated and did hate the captain he had skilfully made the proposition in such a way as to flatter him and it seemed for a few moments as though he were going to have it all his own way But Captain Bellfield was not a man to submit to defeat in such a matter as this without an effort I don t think that will do said he missus Greenow gives the dinner and Cheesacre gives the wine We must have them at the two ends of the table I am sure missus Greenow won t refuse to allow me to hand her to the place which belongs to her I will sit at her right hand and be her minister missus Greenow did not refuse and so the matter was adjusted mister Cheesacre took his seat in despair It was nothing to him that he had Kate Vavasor at his left hand He liked talking to Kate very well but he could not enjoy that pleasure while Captain Bellfield was in the very act of making progress with the widow One would think that he had given it himself wouldn t you he said to Maria s mother who sat at his right hand The lady did not in the least understand him Given what said she Why the music and the wine and all the rest of it There are some people full of that kind of impudence How they manage to carry it on without ever paying a shilling I never could tell I know I have to pay my way and something over and beyond generally Maria s mother said Yes indeed She had other daughters there besides Maria and was looking down the table to see whether they were judiciously placed Her beauty her youngest one Ophelia was sitting next to that ne er do well Joe Fairstairs and this made her unhappy Ophelia my dear you are dreadfully in the draught there s a seat up here just opposite where you ll be more comfortable There s no draught here mamma said Ophelia without the slightest sign of moving Perhaps Ophelia liked the society of that lanky idle useless young man The mirth of the table certainly came from missus Greenow s end The widow had hardly taken her place before she got up again and changed with the captain It was found that the captain could better carve the great grouse pie from the end than from the side Cheesacre when he saw this absolutely threw down his knife and fork violently upon the table Is anything the matter said Maria s mother Matter said he Then he shook his head in grief of heart and vexation of spirit and resumed his knife and fork Kate watched it all and was greatly amused I never saw a man so nearly broken hearted she said in her letter to Alice the next day Eleven thirteen eighteen twenty one said Cheesacre to himself reckoning up in his misery the number of pounds sterling which he would have to pay for being ill treated in this way Ladies and gentlemen said Captain Bellfield as soon as the eating was over if I may be permitted to get upon my legs for two minutes I am going to propose a toast to you The real patron of the feast had actually not yet swallowed his last bit of cheese The thing was indecent in the violence of its injustice Illustration Captain Bellfield proposes a toast If you please Captain Bellfield said the patron indifferent to the cheese in his throat I ll propose the toast Nothing on earth could be better my dear fellow said the captain and I m sure I should be the last man in the world to take the job out of the hands of one who would do it so much better than I can but as it s your health that we re going to drink I really don t see how you are to do it Cheesacre grunted and sat down He certainly could not propose his own health nor did he complain of the honour that was to be done him It was very proper that his health should be drunk and he had now to think of the words in which he would return thanks But the extent of his horror may be imagined when Bellfield got up and made a most brilliant speech in praise of missus Greenow For full five minutes he went on without mentioning the name of Cheesacre Yarmouth he said had never in his days been so blessed as it had been this year by the presence of the lady who was now with them She had come among them he declared forgetful of herself and of her great sorrows with the sole desire of adding something to the happiness of others Then missus Greenow had taken out her pocket handkerchief sweeping back the broad ribbons of her cap over her shoulders Altogether the scene was very affecting and Cheesacre was driven to madness They were the very words that he had intended to speak himself I hate all this kind of thing he said to Kate It s so fulsome After dinner speeches never mean anything said Kate At last when Bellfield had come to an end of praising missus Greenow he told the guests that he wished to join his friend mister Cheesacre in the toast the more so as it could hardly be hoped that missus Greenow would herself rise to return thanks There was no better fellow than his friend Cheesacre whom he had known for he would not say how many years He was quite sure they would all have the most sincere pleasure in joining the health of mister Cheesacre with that of missus Greenow Then there was a clattering of glasses and a murmuring of healths and mister Cheesacre slowly got upon his legs I m very much obliged to this company said he and to my friend Bellfield who really is but perhaps that doesn t signify now I ve had the greatest pleasure in getting up this little thing and I d made up my mind to propose missus Greenow s health but h m ha no doubt it has been in better hands Perhaps considering all things Bellfield might have waited With such a subject on my hands I couldn t wait a moment I didn t interrupt you Captain Bellfield and perhaps you ll let me go on without interrupting me We ve all drunk missus Greenow s health and I m sure she s very much obliged So am I for the honour you ve done me I have taken some trouble in getting up this little thing and I hope you like it I think somebody said something about liberality I beg to assure you that I don t think of that for a moment Somebody must pay for these sort of things and I m always very glad to take my turn I dare say Bellfield will give us the next picnic and if he ll appoint a day before the end of the month I shall be happy to be one of the party Then he sat down with some inward satisfaction fully convinced that he had given his enemy a fatal blow Nothing on earth would give me so much pleasure said Bellfield After that he turned again to missus Greenow and went on with his private conversation There was no more speaking nor was there much time for other after dinner ceremonies The three horns the cymbals the triangle and the drum were soon heard tuning up behind the banqueting hall and the ladies went to the further end of the old boat to make their preparations for the dance Then it was that the thoughtful care of missus Greenow in having sent Jeannette with brushes combs clean handkerchiefs and other little knick knackeries became so apparent It was said that the widow herself actually changed her cap which was considered by some to be very unfair as there had been an understanding that there should be no dressing On such occasions ladies are generally willing to forego the advantage of dressing on the condition that other ladies shall forego the same advantage but when this compact is broken by any special lady the treason is thought to be very treacherous It is as though a fencer should remove the button from the end of his foil But missus Greenow was so good natured in tendering the services of Jeannette to all the young ladies and was so willing to share with others those good things of the toilet which her care had provided that her cap was forgiven her by the most of those present When ladies have made up their minds to dance they will dance let the circumstances of the moment be ever so antagonistic to that exercise A ploughed field in February would not be too wet nor the side of a house too uneven In honest truth the sands of the seashore are not adapted for the exercise It was all very well for Venus to make the promise but when making it she knew that Adonis would not keep her to her word Let any lightest limbed nymph try it and she will find that she leaves most palpable footing The sands in question were doubtless compact firm and sufficiently moist to make walking on them comfortable but they ruffled themselves most uncomfortably under the unwonted pressure to which they were subjected Nevertheless our friends did dance on the sands finding however that quadrilles and Sir Roger de Coverley suited them better than polkas and waltzes No my friend no missus Greenow said to mister Cheesacre when that gentleman endeavoured to persuade her to stand up Kate will be delighted I am sure to join you but as for me you must excuse me But mister Cheesacre was not inclined at that moment to ask Kate Vavasor to dance with him He was possessed by an undefined idea that Kate had snubbed him and as Kate s fortune was as he said literally nothing he was not at all disposed to court her favour at the expense of such suffering to himself I m not quite sure that I ll dance myself said he seating himself in a corner of the tent by missus Greenow s side Captain Bellfield at that moment was seen leading Miss Vavasor away to a new place on the sands whither he was followed by a score of dancers and mister Cheesacre saw that now at last he might reap the reward for which he had laboured He was alone with the widow and having been made bold by wine had an opportunity of fighting his battle than which none better could ever be found He was himself by no means a poor man and he despised poverty in others It was well that there should be poor gentry in order that they might act as satellites to those who like himself had money As to missus Greenow s money there was no doubt He knew it all to a fraction She had spread for herself or some one else had spread for her a report that her wealth was almost unlimited but the forty thousand pounds was a fact and any such innocent fault as that little fiction might well be forgiven to a woman endorsed with such substantial virtues And she was handsome too mister Cheesacre as he regarded her matured charms sometimes felt that he should have been smitten even without the forty thousand pounds By George there s flesh and blood he had once said to his friend Bellfield before he had begun to suspect that man s treachery His admiration must then have been sincere for at that time the forty thousand pounds was not an ascertained fact Looking at the matter in all its bearings mister Cheesacre thought that he couldn t do better His wooing should be fair honest and above board He was a thriving man and what might not they two do in Norfolk if they put their wealth together Oh mister Cheesacre you should join them said missus Greenow they ll not half enjoy themselves without you Kate will think that you mean to neglect her I shan t dance missus Greenow unless you like to stand up for a set No my friend no I shall not do that I fear you forget how recent has been my bereavement Your asking me is the bitterest reproach to me for having ventured to join your festive board Upon my honour I didn t mean it missus Greenow I didn t mean it indeed I do not suspect you It would have been unmanly And nobody can say that of me There isn t a man or woman in Norfolk that wouldn t say I was manly I m quite sure of that I have my faults I m aware And what are your faults mister Cheesacre Well perhaps I m extravagant But it s only in these kind of things you know when I spend a little money for the sake of making my friends happy When I m about on the lands at home I ain t extravagant I can tell you Extravagance is a great vice Oh I ain t extravagant in that sense not a bit in the world But when a man s enamoured and perhaps looking out for a wife he does like to be a little free you know And are you looking out for a wife mister Cheesacre If I told you I suppose you d only laugh at me No indeed I would not I am not given to joking when any one that I regard speaks to me seriously Ain t you though I m so glad of that When one has really got a serious thing to say one doesn t like to have fun poked at one And besides how could I laugh at marriages seeing how happy I have been in that condition so very happy and missus Greenow put up her handkerchief to her eyes So happy that you ll try it again some day won t you Never mister Cheesacre never Is that the way you talk of serious things without joking Anything like love love of that sort is over for me It lies buried under the sod with my poor dear departed saint But missus Greenow and Cheesacre as he prepared to argue the question with her got nearer to her in the corner behind the table But missus Greenow care killed a cat you know And sometimes I think that care will kill me No by George not if I can prevent it You re very kind mister Cheesacre but there s no preventing such care as mine Isn t there though I ll tell you what missus Greenow I m in earnest I am indeed If you ll inquire you ll find there isn t a fellow in Norfolk pays his way better than I do or is better able to do it I don t pay a sixpence of rent and I sit upon seven hundred acres of as good land as there is in the county There s not an acre that won t do me a bullock and a half Just put that and that together and see what it comes to And mind you some of these fellows that farm their own land are worse off than if they d rent to pay They ve borrowed so much to carry on with that the interest is more than rent I don t owe a sixpence to ere a man or ere a company in the world I can walk into every bank in Norwich without seeing my master There ain t any of my paper flying about missus Greenow I m Samuel Cheesacre of Oileymead and it s all my own mister Cheesacre as he thus spoke of his good fortunes and firm standing in the world became impetuous in the energy of the moment and brought down his fist powerfully on the slight table before them The whole fabric rattled and the boat resounded but the noise he had made seemed to assist him It s all my own missus Greenow and the half of it shall be yours if you ll please to take it then he stretched out his hand to her not as though he intended to grasp hers in a grasp of love but as if he expected some hand pledge from her as a token that she accepted the bargain If you d known Greenow mister Cheesacre I ve no doubt he was a very good sort of man If you d known him you would not have addressed me in this way What difference would that make My idea is that care killed a cat as I said before I never knew what was the good of being unhappy If I find early mangels don t do on a bit of land then I sow late turnips and never cry after spilt milk Greenow was the early mangels I ll be the late turnips Come then say the word There ain t a bedroom in my house not one of the front ones that isn t mahogany furnished What s furniture to me said missus Greenow with her handkerchief to her eyes Just at this moment Maria s mother stepped in under the canvas It was most inopportune mister Cheesacre felt that he was progressing well and was conscious that he had got safely over those fences in the race which his bashfulness would naturally make difficult to him He knew that he had done this under the influence of the champagne and was aware that it might not be easy to procure again a combination of circumstances that would be so beneficial to him But now he was interrupted just as he was expecting success He was interrupted and felt himself to be looking like a guilty creature under the eye of the strange lady He had not a word to say but drawing himself suddenly a foot and half away from the widow s side sat there confessing his guilt in his face missus Greenow felt no guilt and was afraid of no strange eyes mister Cheesacre and I are talking about farming she said Oh farming answered Maria s mother mister Cheesacre thinks that turnips are better than early mangels said missus Greenow Yes I do said Cheesacre I prefer the early mangels said missus Greenow I don t think nature ever intended those late crops What do you say missus Walker I daresay mister Cheesacre understands what he s about when he s at home said the lady I know what a bit of land can do as well as any man in Norfolk said the gentleman It may be very well in Norfolk said missus Greenow rising from her seat but the practice isn t thought much of in the other counties with which I am better acquainted I d just come in to say that I thought we might be getting to the boats said missus Walker My Ophelia is so delicate At this moment the delicate Ophelia was to be seen under the influence of the music taking a distant range upon the sands with Joe Fairstairs arm round her waist The attitude was justified by the tune that was in progress and there is no reason why a galop on the sands should have any special termination in distance as it must have in a room But under such circumstances missus Walker s solicitude was not unreasonable The erratic steps of the distant dancers were recalled and preparations were made for the return journey Others had strayed besides the delicate Ophelia and the idle Joe and some little time was taken up in collecting the party The boats had to be drawn down and the boatmen fetched from their cans and tobacco pipes I hope they re sober said missus Walker with a look of great dismay Sober as judges said Bellfield who had himself been looking after the remains of mister Cheesacre s hampers while that gentleman had been so much better engaged in the tent Because continued missus Walker I know that they play all manner of tricks when they re in liquor They d think nothing of taking us out to sea missus Greenow Oh I do wish they would said Ophelia Ophelia mind you come in the boat with me said her mother and she looked very savage when she gave the order It was missus Walker s intention that that boat should not carry Joe Fairstairs But Joe and her daughter together were too clever for her When the boats went off she found herself to be in that one over which mister Cheesacre presided while the sinning Ophelia with her good for nothing admirer were under the more mirthful protection of Captain Bellfield Mamma will be so angry said Ophelia and it was all your fault I did mean to go into the other boat Don t mister Fairstairs Then they got settled down in their seats to the satisfaction let us hope of them both mister Cheesacre had vainly endeavoured to arrange that missus Greenow should return with him But not only was Captain Bellfield opposed to such a change in their positions but so also was missus Greenow I think we d better go back as we came she said giving her hand to the Captain Oh certainly said Captain Bellfield Why should there be any change Cheesacre old fellow mind you look after missus Walker Come along my hearty It really almost appeared that Captain Bellfield was addressing missus Greenow as his hearty but it must be presumed that the term of genial endearment was intended for the whole boat s load missus Greenow took her place on the comfortable broad bench in the stern and Bellfield seated himself beside her with the tiller in his hand If you re going to steer Captain Bellfield I beg that you ll be careful Careful and with you on board said the Captain Don t you know that I would sooner perish beneath the waves than that a drop of water should touch you roughly But you see we might perish beneath the waves together Together What a sweet word that is perish together If it were not that there might be something better even than that I would wish to perish in such company But I should not wish anything of the kind Captain Bellfield and therefore pray be careful There was no perishing by water on that occasion mister Cheesacre s boat reached the pier at Yarmouth first and gave up its load without accident Very shortly afterwards Captain Bellfield s crew reached the same place in the same state of preservation There said he as he handed out missus Greenow I have brought you to no harm at any rate as yet And as I hope will not do so hereafter May the heavens forbid it missus Greenow Whatever may be our lots hereafter yours I mean and mine I trust that yours may be free from all disaster Oh that I might venture to hope that at some future day the privilege might be mine of protecting you from all danger I can protect myself very well I can assure you Good night Captain Bellfield We won t take you and mister Cheesacre out of your way will we Kate We have had a most pleasant day They were now upon the esplanade and missus Greenow s house was to the right whereas the lodgings of both the gentlemen were to the left Each of them fought hard for the privilege of accompanying the widow to her door but missus Greenow was self willed and upon this occasion would have neither of them mister Joe Fairstairs must pass the house said she and he will see us home mister Cheesacre good night Indeed you shall not not a step There was that in her voice which induced mister Cheesacre to obey her and which made Captain Bellfield aware that he would only injure his cause if he endeavoured to make further progress in it on the present occasion Well Kate what do you think of the day the aunt said when she was alone with her niece I never think much about such days aunt It was all very well but I fear I have not the temperament fitted for enjoying the fun I envied Ophelia Walker because she made herself thoroughly happy I do like to see girls enjoy themselves said missus Greenow I do indeed and young men too It seems so natural why shouldn t young people flirt Or old people either for the matter of that Or old people either if they don t do any harm to anybody I ll tell you what it is Kate people have become so very virtuous that they re driven into all manner of abominable resources for amusement and occupation If I had sons and daughters I should think a little flirting the very best thing for them as a safety valve When people get to be old there s a difficulty They want to flirt with the young people and the young people don t want them If the old people would be content to flirt together I don t see why they should ever give it up till they re obliged to give up every thing and go away That was missus Greenow s doctrine on the subject of flirtation CHAPTER X Nethercoats We will leave missus Greenow with her niece and two sisters at Yarmouth and returning by stages to London will call upon mister Grey at his place in Cambridgeshire as we pass by I believe it is conceded by all the other counties that Cambridgeshire possesses fewer rural beauties than any other county in England It is very flat it is not well timbered the rivers are merely dikes and in a very large portion of the county the farms and fields are divided simply by ditches not by hedgerows Such arrangements are no doubt well adapted for agricultural purposes but are not conducive to rural beauty mister Grey s residence was situated in a part of Cambridgeshire in which the above named characteristics are very much marked It was in the Isle of Ely some few miles distant from the Cathedral town on the side of a long straight road which ran through the fields for miles without even a bush to cheer it The name of his place was Nethercoats and here he lived generally throughout the year and here he intended to live throughout his life His father had held a prebendal stall at Ely in times when prebendal stalls were worth more than they are at present and having also been possessed of a living in the neighbourhood had amassed a considerable sum of money With this he had during his life purchased the property of Nethercoats and had built on it the house in which his son now lived He had married late in life and had lost his wife soon after the birth of an only child The house had been built in his own parish and his wife had lived there for a few months and had died there But after that event the old clergyman had gone back to his residence in the Close at Ely and there John Grey had had the home of his youth He had been brought up under his father s eye having been sent to no public school But he had gone to Cambridge had taken college honours and had then his father dying exactly at this time declined to accept a fellowship His father had left to him an income of some fifteen hundred a year and with this he sat himself down near to his college friends near also to the old cathedral which he loved in the house which his father had built But though Nethercoats possessed no beauty of scenery though the country around it was in truth as uninteresting as any country could be it had many delights of its own The house itself was as excellent a residence for a country gentleman of small means as taste and skill together could construct I doubt whether prettier rooms were ever seen than the drawing room the library and the dining room at Nethercoats They were all on the ground floor and all opened out on to the garden and lawn The library which was the largest of the three was a handsome chamber and so filled as to make it well known in the University as one of the best private collections in that part of England But perhaps the gardens of Nethercoats constituted its greatest glory They were spacious and excellently kept up and had been originally laid out with that knowledge of gardening without which no garden merely as a garden can be effective And such of necessity was the garden of Nethercoats Fine single forest trees there were none there nor was it possible that there should have been any such Nor could there be a clear rippling stream with steep green banks and broken rocks lying about its bed Such beauties are beauties of landscape and do not of their nature belong to a garden But the shrubs of Nethercoats were of the rarest kind and had been long enough in their present places to have reached the period of their beauty Nothing had been spared that a garden could want The fruit trees were perfect in their kind and the glass houses were so good and so extensive that John Grey in his prudence was some times tempted to think that he had too much of them It must be understood that there were no grounds according to the meaning usually given to that word belonging to the house at Nethercoats Between the garden and the public road there was a paddock belonging to the house along the side of which but divided from it by a hedge and shrubbery ran the private carriageway up to the house This swept through the small front flower garden dividing it equally but the lawns and indeed the whole of that which made the beauty of the place lay on the back of the house on which side opened the windows from the three sitting rooms Down on the public road there stood a lodge at which lived one of the gardeners There was another field of some six or seven acres to which there was a gate from the corner of the front paddock and which went round two sides of the garden This was Nethercoats and the whole estate covered about twelve acres It was not a place for much bachelor enjoyment of that sort generally popular with bachelors nevertheless mister Grey had been constant in his residence there for the seven years which had now elapsed since he had left his college His easy access to Cambridge had probably done much to mitigate what might otherwise have been the too great tedium of his life and he had prompted thereto by early associations found most of his society in the Close of Ely Cathedral But with all the delight he could derive from these two sources there had still been many solitary hours in his life and he had gradually learned to feel that he of all men wanted a companion in his home His visits to London had generally been short and far between occasioned probably by some need in the library or by the necessity of some slight literary transaction with the editor or publisher of a periodical In one of these visits he had met Alice Vavasor and had remained in Town I will not say till Alice had promised to share his home in Cambridgeshire but so long that he had resolved before he went that he would ask her to do so He had asked her and we know that he had been successful He had obtained her promise and from that moment all his life had been changed for him Hitherto at Nethercoats his little smoking room his books and his plants had been everything to him Now he began to surround himself with an infinity of feminine belongings and to promise himself an infinity of feminine blessings wondering much that he should have been content to pass so long a portion of his life in the dull seclusion which he had endured He was not by nature an impatient man but now he became impatient longing for the fruition of his new idea of happiness longing to have that as his own which he certainly loved beyond all else in the world and which perhaps was all he had ever loved with the perfect love of equality But though impatient and fully aware of his own impatience he acknowledged to himself that Alice could not be expected to share it He could plan nothing now could have no pleasure in life that she was not expected to share But as yet it could not be so with her She had her house in London her town society and her father And inasmuch as the change for her would be much greater than it would be for him it was natural that she should require some small delay He had not pressed her At least he had not pressed her with that eager pressure which a girl must resist with something of the opposition of a contest if she resist it at all But in truth his impatience was now waxing strong and during the absence in Switzerland of which we have spoken he resolved that a marriage very late in the autumn that a marriage even in winter would be better than a marriage postponed till the following year It was not yet late in August when the party returned from their tour Would not a further delay of two months suffice for his bride Alice had written to him occasionally from Switzerland and her first two letters had been very charming They had referred almost exclusively to the tour and had been made pleasant with some slightly coloured account of George Vavasor s idleness and of Kate s obedience to her brother s behests Alice had never written much of love in her love letters and Grey was well enough contented with her style though it was not impassioned As for doubting her love it was not in the heart of the man to do so after it had been once assured to him by her word He could not so slightly respect himself or her as to leave room for such a doubt in his bosom He was a man who could never have suggested to himself that a woman loved him till the fact was there before him but who having ascertained as he might think the fact could never suggest to himself that her love would fail him Her first two letters from Switzerland had been very pleasant but after that there had seemed to have crept over her a melancholy which she unconsciously transferred to her words and which he could not but taste in them at first unconsciously also but soon with so plain a flavour that he recognised it and made it a matter of mental inquiry During the three or four last days of the journey while they were at Basle and on their way home she had not written But she did write on the day after her arrival having then received from mister Grey a letter in which he told her how very much she would add to his happiness if she would now agree that their marriage should not be postponed beyond the end of October This letter she found in her room on her return and this she answered at once And she answered it in such words that mister Grey resolved that he would at once go to her in London I will give her letter at length as I shall then be best able to proceed with my story quickly Queen Anne Street August one hundred eighty six DEAREST JOHN We reached home yesterday tired enough as we came through from Paris without stopping I may indeed say that we came through from Strasbourg as we only slept in Paris I don t like Strasbourg A steeple after all is not everything and putting the steeple aside I don t think the style is good But the hotel was uncomfortable which goes for so much and then we were saturated with beauty of a better kind I got your letter directly I came in last night and I suppose I had better dash at it at once I would so willingly delay doing so saying nice little things the while did I not know that this would be mere cowardice Whatever happens I won t be a coward and therefore I will tell you at once that I cannot let you hope that we should be married this year Of course you will ask me why as you have a right to do and of course I am bound to answer I do not know that I can give any answer with which you will not have a right to complain If it be so I can only ask your pardon for the injury I am doing you Marriage is a great change in life much greater to me than to you who will remain in your old house will keep your old pursuits will still be your own master and will change in nothing except in this that you will have a companion who probably may not be all that you expect But I must change everything It will be to me as though I were passing through a grave to a new world I shall see nothing that I have been accustomed to see and must abandon all the ways of life that I have hitherto adopted Of course I should have thought of this before I accepted you and I did think of it I made up my mind that as I truly loved you I would risk the change that I would risk it for your sake and for mine hoping that I might add something to your happiness and that I might secure my own Dear John do not suppose that I despair that it may be so but indeed you must not hurry me I must tune myself to the change that I have to make What if I should wake some morning after six months living with you and tell you that the quiet of your home was making me mad You must not ask me again till the winter shall have passed away If in the meantime I shall find that I have been wrong I will humbly confess that I have wronged you and ask you to forgive me And I will freely admit this If the delay which I now purpose is so contrary to your own plans as to make your marriage under such circumstances not that which you had expected I know that you are free to tell me so and to say that our engagement shall be over I am well aware that I can have no right to bind you to a marriage at one period which you had only contemplated as to take place at another period I think I may promise that I will obey any wish you may express in anything except in that one thing which you urged in your last letter Kate is going down to Yarmouth with missus Greenow and I shall see no more of her probably till next year as she will be due in Westmoreland after that George left me at the door when he brought me home and declared that he intended to vanish out of London Whether in town or out he is never to be seen at this period of the year Papa offers to go to Ramsgate for a fortnight but he looks so wretched when he makes the offer that I shall not have the heart to hold him to it Lady Macleod very much wants me to go to Cheltenham I very much want not to go simply because I can never agree with her about anything but it will probably end in my going there for a week or two Over and beyond that I have no prospects before Christmas which are not purely domestic There is a project that we shall all eat our Christmas dinner at Vavasor Hall of course not including George but this project is quite in the clouds and as far as I am concerned will remain there Dear John let me hear that this letter does not make you unhappy Most affectionately yours ALICE VAVASOR At Nethercoats the post was brought in at breakfast time and mister Grey was sitting with his tea and eggs before him when he read Alice s letter He read it twice before he began to think what he would do in regard to it and then referred to one or two others which he had received from Switzerland reading them also very carefully After that he took up the slouch hat which he had been wearing in the garden before he was called to his breakfast and with the letters in his hand sauntered down among the shrubs and lawns He knew he thought he knew that there was more in Alice s mind than a mere wish for delay There was more in it than that hesitation to take at once a step which she really desired to take if not now then after some short interval He felt that she was unhappy and unhappy because she distrusted the results of her marriage but it never for a moment occurred to him that therefore the engagement between them should be broken In the first place he loved her too well to allow of his admitting such an idea without terrible sorrow to himself He was a constant firm man somewhat reserved and unwilling to make new acquaintances and therefore specially unwilling to break away from those which he had made Undoubtedly had he satisfied himself that Alice s happiness demanded such a sacrifice of himself he would have made it and made it without a word of complaint The blow would not have prostrated him but the bruise would have remained on his heart indelible not to be healed but by death He would have submitted and no man would have seen that he had been injured But it did not once occur to him that such a proceeding on his part would be beneficial to Alice Without being aware of it he reckoned himself to be the nobler creature of the two and now thought of her as of one wounded and wanting a cure Some weakness had fallen on her and strength must be given to her from another He did not in the least doubt her love but he knew that she had been associated for a few weeks past with two persons whose daily conversation would be prone to weaken the tone of her mind He no more thought of giving her up than a man thinks of having his leg cut off because he has sprained his sinews He would go up to town and see her and would not even yet abandon all hope that she might be found sitting at his board when Christmas should come By that day s post he wrote a short note to her Dearest Alice he said I have resolved to go to London at once I will be with you in the evening at eight the day after to morrow Yours J G There was no more in the letter than that And now she said when she received it I must dare to tell him the whole truth CHAPTER XI John Grey Goes to London And what was the whole truth Alice Vavasor when she declared to herself that she must tell her lover the whole truth was expressing to herself her intention of putting an end to her engagement with mister Grey She was acknowledging that that which had to be told was not compatible with the love and perfect faith which she owed to the man who was her affianced husband And yet why should it be so She did not intend to tell him that she had been false in her love to him It was not that her heart had again veered itself round and given itself to that wild cousin of hers Though she might feel herself constrained to part from John Grey George Vavasor could never be her husband Of that she assured herself fifty times during the two days grace which had been allowed her Nay she went farther than that with herself and pronounced a verdict against any marriage as possible to her if she now decided against this marriage which had for some months past been regarded as fixed by herself and all her friends People often say that marriage is an important thing and should be much thought of in advance and marrying people are cautioned that there are many who marry in haste and repent at leisure I am not sure however that marriage may not be pondered over too much nor do I feel certain that the leisurely repentance does not as often follow the leisurely marriages as it does the rapid ones That some repent no one can doubt but I am inclined to believe that most men and women take their lots as they find them marrying as the birds do by force of nature and going on with their mates with a general though not perhaps an undisturbed satisfaction feeling inwardly assured that Providence if it have not done the very best for them has done for them as well as they could do for themselves with all the thought in the world I do not know that a woman can assure to herself by her own prudence and taste a good husband any more than she can add two cubits to her stature but husbands have been made to be decently good and wives too for the most part in our country so that the thing does not require quite so much thinking as some people say That Alice Vavasor had thought too much about it I feel quite sure She had gone on thinking of it till she had filled herself with a cloud of doubts which even the sunshine of love was unable to drive from her heavens That a girl should really love the man she intends to marry that at any rate may be admitted But love generally comes easily enough With all her doubts Alice never doubted her love for mister Grey Nor did she doubt his character nor his temper nor his means But she had gone on thinking of the matter till her mind had become filled with some undefined idea of the importance to her of her own life What should a woman do with her life There had arisen round her a flock of learned ladies asking that question to whom it seems that the proper answer has never yet occurred Fall in love marry the man have two children and live happy ever afterwards I maintain that answer has as much wisdom in it as any other that can be given or perhaps more The advice contained in it cannot perhaps always be followed to the letter but neither can the advice of the other kind which is given by the flock of learned ladies who ask the question A woman s life is important to her as is that of a man to him not chiefly in regard to that which she shall do with it The chief thing for her to look to is the manner in which that something shall be done It is of moment to a young man when entering life to decide whether he shall make hats or shoes but not of half the moment that will be that other decision whether he shall make good shoes or bad And so with a woman if she shall have recognised the necessity of truth and honesty for the purposes of her life I do not know that she need ask herself many questions as to what she will do with it Alice Vavasor was ever asking herself that question and had by degrees filled herself with a vague idea that there was a something to be done a something over and beyond or perhaps altogether beside that marrying and having two children if she only knew what it was She had filled herself or had been filled by her cousins with an undefined ambition that made her restless without giving her any real food for her mind When she told herself that she would have no scope for action in that life in Cambridgeshire which mister Grey was preparing for her she did not herself know what she meant by action Had any one accused her of being afraid to separate herself from London society she would have declared that she went very little into society and disliked that little Had it been whispered to her that she loved the neighbourhood of the shops she would have scorned the whisperer Had it been suggested that the continued rattle of the big city was necessary to her happiness she would have declared that she and her father had picked out for their residence the quietest street in London because she could not bear noise and yet she told herself that she feared to be taken into the desolate calmness of Cambridgeshire When she did contrive to find any answer to that question as to what she should do with her life or rather what she would wish to do with it if she were a free agent it was generally of a political nature She was not so far advanced as to think that women should be lawyers and doctors or to wish that she might have the privilege of the franchise for herself but she had undoubtedly a hankering after some second hand political manoeuvering She would have liked I think to have been the wife of the leader of a Radical opposition in the time when such men were put into prison and to have kept up for him his seditious correspondence while he lay in the Tower She would have carried the answers to him inside her stays and have made long journeys down into northern parts without any money if the cause required it She would have liked to have around her ardent spirits male or female who would have talked of the cause and have kept alive in her some flame of political fire As it was she had no cause Her father s political views were very mild Lady Macleod s were deadly conservative Kate Vavasor was an aspiring Radical just now because her brother was in the same line but during the year of the love passages between George and Alice George Vavasor s politics had been as conservative as you please He did not become a Radical till he had quarrelled with his grandfather Now indeed he was possessed of very advanced views views with which Alice felt that she could sympathize But what would be the use of sympathizing down in Cambridgeshire John Grey had so to speak no politics He had decided views as to the treatment which the Roman Senate received from Augustus and had even discussed with Alice the conduct of the Girondists at the time of Robespierre s triumph but for Manchester and its cares he had no apparent solicitude and had declared to Alice that he would not accept a seat in the British House of Commons if it were offered to him free of expense What political enthusiasm could she indulge with such a companion down in Cambridgeshire She thought too much of all this and was if I may say over prudent in calculating the chances of her happiness and of his For to give her credit for what was her due she was quite as anxious on the latter head as on the former I don t care for the Roman Senate she would say to herself I don t care much for the Girondists How am I to talk to him day after day night after night when we shall be alone together No doubt her tour in Switzerland with her cousin had had some effect in making such thoughts stronger now than they had ever been She had not again learned to love her cousin She was as firmly sure as ever that she could never love him more He had insulted her love and though she had forgiven him and again enrolled him among her dearest friends she could never again feel for him that passion which a woman means when she acknowledges that she is in love That as regarded her and George Vavasor was over But nevertheless there had been a something of romance during those days in Switzerland which she feared she would regret when she found herself settled at Nethercoats She envied Kate Kate could as his sister attach herself on to George s political career and obtain from it all that excitement of life which Alice desired for herself Alice could not love her cousin and marry him but she felt that if she could do so without impropriety she would like to stick close to him like another sister to spend her money in aiding his career in Parliament as Kate would do and trust herself and her career into the boat which he was to command She did not love her cousin but she still believed in him with a faith which he certainly did not deserve As the two days passed over her her mind grew more and more fixed as to its purpose She would tell mister Grey that she was not fit to be his wife and she would beg him to pardon her and to leave her It never occurred to her that perhaps he might refuse to let her go She felt quite sure that she would be free as soon as she had spoken the word which she intended to speak If she could speak it with decision she would be free and to attain that decision she would school herself with her utmost strength At one moment she thought of telling all to her father and of begging him to break the matter to mister Grey but she knew that her father would not understand her and that he would be very hostile to her saying hard uncomfortable words which would probably be spared if the thing were done before he was informed Nor would she write to Kate whose letters to her at this time were full of wit at the expense of missus Greenow She would tell Kate as soon as the thing was done but not before That Kate would sympathize with her she was quite certain So the two days passed by and the time came at which John Grey was to be there As the minute hand on the drawing room clock came round to the full hour she felt that her heart was beating with a violence which she could not repress The thing seemed to her to assume bigger dimensions than it had hitherto done She began to be aware that she was about to be guilty of a great iniquity when it was too late for her to change her mind She could not bring herself to resolve that she would on the moment change her mind She believed that she could never pardon herself such weakness But yet she felt herself to be aware that her purpose was wicked When the knock at the door was at last heard she trembled and feared that she would almost be unable to speak to him Might it be possible that there should yet be a reprieve for her No it was his step on the stairs and there he was in the room with her My dearest he said coming to her His smile was sweet and loving as it ever was and his voice had its usual manly genial loving tone As he walked across the room Alice felt that he was a man of whom a wife might be very proud He was tall and very handsome with brown hair with bright blue eyes and a mouth like a god It was the beauty of his mouth beauty which comprised firmness within itself that made Alice afraid of him He was still dressed in his morning clothes but he was a man who always seemed to be well dressed My dearest he said advancing across the room and before she knew how to stop herself or him he had taken her in his arms and kissed her He did not immediately begin about the letter but placed her upon the sofa seating himself by her side and looked into her face with loving eyes not as though to scrutinize what might be amiss there but as though determined to enjoy to the full his privilege as a lover There was no reproach at any rate in his countenance none as yet nor did it seem that he thought that he had any cause for fear They sat in this way for a moment or two in silence and during those moments Alice was summoning up her courage to speak The palpitation at her heart was already gone and she was determined that she would speak Though I am very glad to see you she said at last I am sorry that my letter should have given you the trouble of this journey Trouble he said Nay you ought to know that it is no trouble I have not enough to do down at Nethercoats to make the running up to you at any time an unpleasant excitement So your Swiss journey went off pleasantly Yes it went off very pleasantly This she said in that tone of voice which clearly implies that the speaker is not thinking of the words spoken And Kate has now left you Yes she is with her aunt at the seaside So I understand and your cousin George I never know much of George s movements He may be in Town but I have not seen him since I came back Ah that is the way with friends living in London Unless circumstances bring them together they are in fact further apart than if they lived fifty miles asunder in the country And he managed to get through all the trouble without losing your luggage for you very often If you were to say that we did not lose his that would be nearer the mark But John you have come up to London in this sudden way to speak to me about my letter to you Is it not so Certainly it is so Certainly I have I have thought much since of what I then wrote very much very much indeed and I have learned to feel sure that we had better Stop Alice stop a moment love Do not speak hurriedly Shall I tell you what I learned from your letter Yes tell me if you think it better that you should do so Perhaps it may be better I learned love that something had been said or done during your journey or perhaps only something thought that had made you melancholy and filled your mind for a while with those unsubstantial and indefinable regrets for the past which we are all apt to feel at certain moments of our life There are few of us who do not encounter now and again some of that irrational spirit of sadness which when over indulged drives men to madness and self destruction I used to know well what it was before I knew you but since I have had the hope of having you in my house I have banished it utterly In that I think I have been stronger than you Do not speak under the influence of that spirit till you have thought whether you too cannot banish it I have tried and it will not be banished Try again Alice It is a damned spirit and belongs neither to heaven nor to earth Do not say to me the words that you were about to say till you have wrestled with it manfully I think I know what those words were to be If you love me those words should not be spoken If you do not If I do not love you I love no one upon earth I believe it I believe it as I believe in my own love for you I trust your love implicitly Alice I know that you love me I think I can read your mind Tell me that I may return to Cambridgeshire and again plead my cause for an early marriage from thence I will not take such speech from you to mean more than it says She sat quiet looking at him looking full into his face She had in nowise changed her mind but after such words from him she did not know how to declare to him her resolution There was something in his manner that awed her and something also that softened her Tell me said he that I may see you again to morrow morning in our usual quiet loving way and that I may return home to morrow evening Pronounce a yea to that speech from me and I will ask for nothing further No I cannot do so she said And the tone of her voice as she spoke was different to any tone that he had heard before from her mouth Is that melancholy fiend too strong for you He smiled as he said this and as he smiled he took her hand She did not attempt to withdraw it but sat by him in a strange calmness looking straight before her into the middle of the room You have not struggled with it You know as I do that it is a bad fiend and a wicked one a fiend that is prompting you to the worst cruelty in the world Alice Alice Alice Try to think of all this as though some other person were concerned If it were your friend what advice would you give her Illustration If it were your friend what advice would you give her I would bid her tell the man who had loved her that is if he were noble good and great that she found herself to be unfit to be his wife and then I would bid her ask his pardon humbly on her knees As she said this she sank before him on to the floor and looked up into his face with an expression of sad contrition which almost drew him from his purposed firmness He had purposed to be firm to yield to her in nothing resolving to treat all that she might say as the hallucination of a sickened imagination as the effect of absolute want of health for which some change in her mode of life would be the best cure She might bid him begone in what language she would He knew well that such was her intention But he would not allow a word coming from her in such a way to disturb arrangements made for the happiness of their joint lives As a loving husband would treat a wife who in some exceptionable moment of a melancholy malady should declare herself unable to remain longer in her home so would he treat her As for accepting what she might say as his dismissal he would as soon think of taking the fruit trees from the southern wall because the sun sometimes shines from the north He could not treat either his interests or hers so lightly as that But what if he granted no such pardon Alice I will grant none such You are my wife my own my dearest my chosen one You are all that I value in the world my treasure and my comfort my earthly happiness and my gleam of something better that is to come hereafter Do you think that I shall let you go from me in that way No love If you are ill I will wait till your illness is gone by and if you will let me I will be your nurse I am not ill Not ill with any defined sickness You do not shake with ague nor does your head rack you with aching but yet you may be ill Think of what has passed between us Must you not be ill when you seek to put an end to all that without any cause assigned You will not hear my reasons she was still kneeling before him and looking up into his face I will hear them if you will tell me that they refer to any supposed faults of my own No no no Then I will not hear them It is for me to find out your faults and when I have found out any that require complaint I will come and make it Dear Alice I wish you knew how I long for you Then he put his hand upon her hair as though he would caress her But this she would not suffer so she rose slowly and stood with her hand upon the table in the middle of the room mister Grey she said If you will call me so I shall think it only a part of your malady mister Grey she continued I can only hope that you will take me at my word Oh but I will not certainly I will not if that would be adverse to my own interests I am thinking of your interests I am indeed at any rate as much as of my own I feel quite sure that I should not make you happy as your wife quite sure and feeling that I think that I am right even after all that has passed to ask your forgiveness and to beg that our engagement may be over No Alice no never with my consent I cannot tell you with what contentment I would marry you to morrow to morrow or next month or the month after But if it cannot be so then I will wait Nothing but your marriage with some one else would convince me I cannot convince you in that way she said smiling You will convince me in no other You have not spoken to your father of this as yet Not as yet Do not do so at any rate for the present You will own that it might be possible that you would have to unsay what you had said No it is not possible Give yourself and me the chance It can do no harm And Alice I ask you now for no reasons I will not ask your reasons or even listen to them because I do not believe that they will long have effect even on yourself Do you still think of going to Cheltenham I have decided nothing as yet If I were you I would go I think a change of air would be good for you Yes you treat me as though I were partly silly and partly insane but it is not so The change you speak of should be in my nature and in yours He shook his head and still smiled There was something in the imperturbed security of his manner which almost made her angry with him It seemed as though he assumed so great a superiority that he felt himself able to treat any resolve of hers as the petulance of a child And though he spoke in strong language of his love and of his longing that she should come to him yet he was so well able to command his feelings that he showed no sign of grief at the communication she had made to him She did not doubt his love but she believed him to be so much the master of his love as he was the master of everything else that her separation from him would cause him no uncontrollable grief In that she utterly failed to understand his character Had she known him better she might have been sure that such a separation now would with him have carried its mark to the grave Should he submit to her decision he would go home and settle himself to his books the next day but on no following day would he be again capable of walking forth among his flowers with an easy heart He was a strong constant man perhaps over conscious of his own strength but then his strength was great He is perfect Alice had said to herself often Oh that he were less perfect He did not stay with her long after the last word that has been recorded Perhaps he said as for a moment he held her hand at parting I had better not come to morrow No no it is better not I advise you not to tell your father of this and doubtless you will think of it before you do so But if you do tell him let me know that you have done so Why that Because in such case I also must see him God bless you Alice God bless you dearest dearest Alice Then he went and she sat there on the sofa without moving till she heard her father s feet as he came up the stairs What Alice are you not in bed yet Not yet papa And so John Grey has been here He has left his stick in the hall I should know it among a thousand Yes he has been here Is anything the matter Alice No papa nothing is the matter He has not made himself disagreeable has he Not in the least He never does anything wrong He may defy man or woman to find fault with him So that is it is it He is just a shade too good Well I have always thought that myself But it s a fault on the right side It s no fault Papa If there be any fault it is not with him But I am yawning and tired and I will go to bed Is he to be here to morrow No he returns to Nethercoats early Good night papa mister Vavasor as he went up to his bedroom felt sure that there had been something wrong between his daughter and her lover I don t know how she ll ever put up with him he said to himself

none	none	terribly conceited I shall never forget how he went on about Charles Kemble and what a fool he made of himself Alice before she went to bed sat down and wrote a letter to her cousin Kate CHAPTER XII mister George Vavasor at Home It cannot perhaps fairly be said that George Vavasor was an unhospitable man seeing that it was his custom to entertain his friends occasionally at Greenwich Richmond or such places and he would now and again have a friend to dine with him at his club But he never gave breakfasts dinners or suppers under his own roof During a short period of his wine selling career at which time he had occupied handsome rooms over his place of business in New Burlington Street he had presided at certain feasts given to customers or expectant customers by the firm but he had not found this employment to his taste and had soon relinquished it to one of the other partners Since that he had lived in lodgings in Cecil Street down at the bottom of that retired nook near to the river and away from the Strand Here he had simply two rooms on the first floor and hither his friends came to him very rarely They came very rarely on any account A stray man might now and then pass an hour with him here but on such occasions the chances were that the visit had some reference near or distant to affairs of business Eating or drinking there was never any to be found here by the most intimate of his allies His lodgings were his private retreat and they were so private that but few of his friends knew where he lived And had it been possible he would have wished that no one should have known his whereabouts I am not aware that he had any special reason for this peculiarity or that there was anything about his mode of life that required hiding but he was a man who had always lived as though secrecy in certain matters might at any time become useful to him He had a mode of dressing himself when he went out at night that made it almost impossible that any one should recognise him The people at his lodgings did not even know that he had relatives and his nearest relatives hardly knew that he had lodgings Even Kate had never been at the rooms in Cecil Street and addressed all her letters to his place of business or his club He was a man who would bear no inquiry into himself If he had been out of view for a month and his friends asked him where he had been he always answered the question falsely or left it unanswered There are many men of whom everybody knows all about all their belongings as to whom everybody knows where they live whither they go what is their means and how they spend it But there are others of whom no man knows anything and George Vavasor was such a one For myself I like the open babbler the best Babbling may be a weakness but to my thinking mystery is a vice Vavasor also maintained another little establishment down in Oxfordshire but the two establishments did not even know of each other s existence There was a third too very closely hidden from the world s eye which shall be nameless but of the establishment in Oxfordshire he did sometimes speak in very humble words among his friends When he found himself among hunting men he would speak of his two nags at Roebury saying that he had never yet been able to mount a regular hunting stable and that he supposed he never would but that there were at Roebury two indifferent beasts of his if any one chose to buy them And men very often did buy Vavasor s horses When he was on them they always went well and sold themselves readily And though he thus spoke of two and perhaps did not keep more during the summer he always seemed to have horses enough when he was down in the country No one even knew George Vavasor not to hunt because he was short of stuff And here at Roebury he kept a trusty servant an ancient groom with two little bushy grey eyes which looked as though they could see through a stable door Many were the long whisperings which George and Bat Smithers carried on at the stable door in the very back depth of the yard attached to the hunting inn at Roebury Bat regarded his master as a man wholly devoted to horses but often wondered why he was not more regular in his sojournings in Oxfordshire Of any other portion of his master s life Bat knew nothing Bat could give the address of his master s club in London but he could give no other address But though Vavasor s private lodgings were so very private he had nevertheless taken some trouble in adorning them The furniture in the sitting room was very neat and the book shelves were filled with volumes that shone with gilding on their backs The inkstand the paper weight the envelope case on his writing table were all handsome He had a single good portrait of a woman s head hanging on one of his walls He had a special place adapted for his pistols others for his foils and again another for his whips The room was as pretty a bachelor s room as you would wish to enter but you might see by the position of the single easy chair that was brought forward that it was seldom appropriated to the comfort of more than one person Here he sat lounging over his breakfast late on a Sunday morning in September when all the world was out of town He was reading a letter which had just been brought down to him from his club Though the writer of it was his sister Kate she had not been privileged to address it to his private lodgings He read it very quickly running rapidly over its contents and then threw it aside from him as though it were of no moment keeping however an enclosure in his hand And yet the letter was of much moment and made him think deeply If I did it at all said he it would be more with the object of cutting him out than with any other The reader will hardly require to be told that the him in question was John Grey and that Kate s letter was one instigating her brother to renew his love affair with Alice And Vavasor was in truth well inclined to renew it and would have begun the renewing it at once had he not doubted his power with his cousin Indeed it has been seen that he had already attempted some commencement of such renewal at Basle He had told Kate more than once that Alice s fortune was not much and that her beauty was past its prime and he would no doubt repeat the same objections to his sister with some pretence of disinclination It was not his custom to show his hand to the players at any game that he played But he was in truth very anxious to obtain from Alice a second promise of her hand How soon after that he might marry her would be another question Perhaps it was not Alice s beauty that he coveted nor yet her money exclusively Nevertheless he thought her very beautiful and was fully aware that her money would be of great service to him But I believe that he was true in that word that he spoke to himself and that his chief attraction was the delight which he would have in robbing mister Grey of his wife Alice had once been his love had clung to his side had whispered love to him and he had enough of the weakness of humanity in him to feel the soreness arising from her affection for another When she broke away from him he had acknowledged that he had been wrong and when since her engagement with mister Grey he had congratulated her he had told her in his quiet half whispered impressive words how right she was but not the less therefore did he feel himself hurt that John Grey should be her lover And when he had met this man he had spoken well of him to his sister saying that he was a gentleman a scholar and a man of parts but not the less had he hated him from the first moment of his seeing him Such hatred under such circumstances was almost pardonable But George Vavasor when he hated was apt to follow up his hatred with injury He could not violently dislike a man and yet not wish to do him any harm At present as he sat lounging in his chair he thought that he would like to marry his cousin Alice but he was quite sure that he would like to be the means of putting a stop to the proposed marriage between Alice and John Grey Kate had been very false to her friend and had sent up to her brother the very letter which Alice had written to her after that meeting in Queen Anne Street which was described in the last chapter or rather a portion of it for with the reserve common to women she had kept back the other half Alice had declared to herself that she would be sure of her cousin s sympathy and had written out all her heart on the matter as was her wont when writing to Kate But you must understand she wrote that all that I said to him went with him for nothing I had determined to make him know that everything between us must be over but I failed I found that I had no words at command but that he was able to talk to me as though I were a child He told me that I was sick and full of phantasies and bade me change the air As he spoke in this way I could not help feeling how right he was to use me so but I felt also that he in his mighty superiority could never be a fitting husband for a creature so inferior to him as I am Though I altogether failed to make him understand that it was so every moment that we were together made me more fixed in my resolution This letter from Alice to Kate Vavasor read over and over again though Kate s letter to himself which was the longer one he had thrown aside after the first glance There was nothing that he could learn from that He was as good a judge of the manner in which he would play his own game as Kate could be but in this matter he was to learn how he would play his game from a knowledge of the other girl s mind She ll never marry him at any rate he said to himself and she is right He d make an upper servant of her very respectable no doubt but still only an upper servant Now with me well I hardly know what I should make of her I cannot think of myself as a man married Then he threw her letter after Kate s and betook himself to his newspaper and his cigar It was two hours after this and he still wore his dressing gown and he was still lounging in his easy chair when the waiting maid at the lodgings brought him up word that a gentleman wished to see him Vavasor kept no servant of his own except that confidential groom down at Bicester It was a rule with him that people could be better served and cheaper served by other people s servants than by their own Even in the stables at Bicester the innkeeper had to find what assistance was wanted and charge for it in the bill And George Vavasor was no Sybarite He did not deem it impracticable to put on his own trousers without having a man standing at his foot to hold up the leg of the garment A valet about a man knows a great deal of a man s ways and therefore George had no valet A gentleman said he to the girl Does the gentleman look like a public house keeper Well I think he do said the girl Then show him up said George And the gentleman was a public house keeper Vavasor was pretty sure of his visitor before he desired the servant to give him entrance It was mister Grimes from the Handsome Man public house and tavern in the Brompton Road and he had come by appointment to have a little conversation with mister Vavasor on matters political mister Grimes was a man who knew that business was business and as such had some considerable weight in his own neighbourhood With him politics was business as well as beer and omnibus horses and foreign wines in the fabrication of which latter article mister Grimes was supposed to have an extended experience To such as him when intent on business mister Vavasor was not averse to make known the secrets of his lodging house and now when the idle of London world was either at morning church or still in bed mister Grimes had come out by appointment to do a little political business with the lately rejected member for the Chelsea Districts Vavasor had been as I have said lately rejected and the new member who had beaten him at the hustings had sat now for one session in parliament Under his present reign he was destined to the honour of one other session and then the period of his existing glory for which he was said to have paid nearly six thousand pounds would be over But he might be elected again perhaps for a full period of six sessions and it might be hoped that this second election would be conducted on more economical principles To this the economical view of the matter mister Grimes was very much opposed and was now waiting upon George Vavasor in Cecil Street chiefly with the object of opposing the new member s wishes on this head No doubt mister Grimes was personally an advocate for the return of mister Vavasor and would do all in his power to prevent the re election of the young Lord Kilfenora whose father the Marquis of Bunratty had scattered that six thousand pounds among the electors and non electors of Chelsea but his main object was that money should be spent Tain t altogether for myself he said to a confidential friend in the same way of business I don t get so much on it Perhaps sometimes not none May be I ve a bill agin some of those gents not paid this werry moment But it s the game I looks to If the game dies away it ll never be got up again never Who ll care about elections then Anybody d go and get hisself elected if we was to let the game go by And so that the game might not go by mister Grimes was now present in mister George Vavasor s rooms Well mister Grimes said George how are you this morning Sit down mister Grimes If every man were as punctual as you are the world would go like clock work wouldn t it Business is business mister Vavasor said the publican after having made his salute and having taken his chair with some little show of mock modesty That s my maxim If I didn t stick to that nothing wouldn t ever stick to me and nothing doesn t much as it is Times is very bad mister Vavasor Of course they are They re always bad What was the Devil made for except that they should be bad But I should have thought you publicans were the last men who ought to complain Lord love you mister Vavasor why I suppose of all the men as is put upon we re put upon the worst What s the good of drawing of beer if the more you draw the more you don t make Yesterday as ever was was Saturday and we drawed three pound ten and nine What ll that come to mister Vavasor when you reckons it up with the brewer Why it s a next to nothing You knows that well enough Upon my word I don t But I know you don t sell a pint of beer without getting a profit out of it Lord love you mister Vavasor If I hadn t nothink to look to but beer I couldn t keep a house over my head no I couldn t That house of mine belongs to Meux s people and very good people they are too have made a sight of money haven t they mister Vavasor I has to get my beer from them in course Why not when it s their house But if I sells their stuff as I gets it there ain t a halfpenny coming to me out of a gallon Look at that now But then you don t sell it as you get it You stretch it That s in course I m not going to tell you a lie mister Vavasor You know what s what as well as I do and a sight better I expect There s a dozen different ways of handling beer mister Vavasor But what s the use of that when they can take four or five pounds a day over the counter for their rot gut stuff at the Cadogan Arms and I can t do no better nor yet perhaps so well for a real honest glass of beer Stretch it It s my belief the more you poison their liquor the more the people likes it mister Grimes was a stout man not very tall with a mottled red face and large protruding eyes As regards his own person mister Grimes might have been taken as a fair sample of the English innkeeper as described for many years past But in his outer garments he was very unlike that description He wore a black swallow tailed coat made however to set very loose upon his back a black waistcoat and black pantaloons He carried moreover in his hands a black chimney pot hat Not only have the top boots and breeches vanished from the costume of innkeepers but also the long particoloured waistcoat and the birds eye fogle round their necks They get themselves up to look like Dissenting ministers or undertakers except that there is still a something about their rosy gills which tells a tale of the spigot and corkscrew mister Grimes had only just finished the tale of his own hard ways as a publican when the door bell was again rung There s Scruby said George Vavasor and now we can go to business CHAPTER XIII mister Grimes Gets His Odd Money The handmaiden at George Vavasor s lodgings announced another gent and then mister Scruby entered the room in which were seated George and mister Grimes the publican from the Handsome Man on the Brompton Road mister Scruby was an attorney from Great Marlborough Street supposed to be very knowing in the ways of metropolitan elections and he had now stepped round as he called it with the object of saying a few words to mister Grimes partly on the subject of the forthcoming contest at Chelsea and partly on that of the contest last past These words were to be said in the presence of mister Vavasor the person interested That some other words had been spoken between mister Scruby and mister Grimes on the same subjects behind mister Vavasor s back I think very probable But even though this might have been so I am not prepared to say that mister Vavasor had been deceived by their combinations The two men were very civil to each other in their salutations the attorney assuming an air of patronizing condescension always calling the other Grimes whereas mister Scruby was treated with considerable deference by the publican and was always called mister Scruby Business is business said the publican as soon as these salutations were over isn t it now mister Scruby And I suppose Grimes thinks Sunday morning a particularly good time for business said the attorney laughing It s quiet you know said Grimes But it warn t me as named Sunday morning It was mister Vavasor here But it is quiet ain t it mister Scruby mister Scruby acknowledged that it was quiet especially looking out over the river and then they proceeded to business We must pull the governor through better next time than we did last said the attorney Of course we must mister Scruby but Lord love you mister Vavasor whose fault was it What notice did I get just tell me that Why Travers s name was up on the liberal interest ever so long before the governor had ever thought about it Nobody is blaming you mister Grimes said George And nobody can t mister Vavasor I done my work true as steel and there ain t another man about the place as could have done half as much You ask mister Scruby else mister Scruby knows if ere a man in London does I tell you what it is mister Vavasor them Chelsea fellows who lives mostly down by the river ain t like your Maryboners or Finsburyites It wants something of a man to manage them Don t it mister Scruby It wants something of a man to manage any of them as far as my experience goes said mister Scruby Of course it do and there ain t one in London knows so much about it as you do mister Scruby I will say that for you But the long and the short of it is this business is business and money is money Money is money certainly said mister Scruby There s no doubt in the world about that Grimes and a deal of it you had out of the last election No I hadn t begging your pardon mister Scruby for making so free What I had to my own cheek wasn t nothing to speak of I wasn t paid for my time that s what I wasn t You look how a publican s business gets cut up at them elections and then the state of the house afterwards What would the governor say to me if I was to put down painting inside and out in my little bill It doesn t seem to make much difference how you put it down said Vavasor The total is what I look at Just so mister Vavasor just so The total is what I looks at too And I has to look at it a deuced long time before I gets it I ain t a got it yet have I mister Vavasor Well if you ask me I should say you had said George I know I paid mister Scruby three hundred pounds on your account And I got every shilling of it mister Vavasor I m not a going to deny the money mister Vavasor You ll never find me doing that I m as round as your hat and as square as your elbow I am mister Scruby knows me don t you mister Scruby Perhaps I know you too well Grimes No you don t mister Scruby not a bit too well Nor I don t know you too well either I respect you mister Scruby because you re a man as understands your business But as I was saying what s three hundred pounds when a man s bill is three hundred and ninety two thirteen and fourpence I thought that was all settled mister Scruby said Vavasor Why you see mister Vavasor it s very hard to settle these things If you ask me whether mister Grimes here can sue you for the balance I tell you very plainly that he can t We were a little short of money when we came to a settlement as is generally the case at such times and so we took mister Grimes receipt for three hundred pounds Of course you did mister Scruby Not on account but in full of all demands Now mister Scruby and the publican as he made this appeal looked at the attorney with an expression of countenance which was absolutely eloquent Are you going to put me off with such an excuse as that so the look spoke plainly enough Are you going to bring up my own signature against me when you know very well that I shouldn t have got a shilling at all for the next twelve months if I hadn t given it Oh mister Scruby That s what mister Grimes look said and both mister Scruby and mister Vavasor understood it perfectly In full of all demands said mister Scruby with a slight tone of triumph in his voice as though to show that Grimes appeal had no effect at all upon his conscience If you were to go into a court of law Grimes you wouldn t have a leg to stand upon A court of law Who s a going to law with the governor I should like to know not I not if he didn t pay me them ninety two pounds thirteen and fourpence for the next five years Five years or fifteen would make no difference said Scruby You couldn t do it And I ain t a going to try That s not the ticket I ve come here about mister Vavasor this blessed Sunday morning Going to law indeed But mister Scruby I ve got a family Not in the vale of Taunton I hope said George They is at the Handsome Man in the Brompton Road mister Vavasor and I always feels that I owes my first duty to them If a man don t work for his family what do he work for Come come Grimes said mister Scruby What is it you re at Out with it and don t keep us here all day What is it I m at mister Scruby As if you didn t know very well what I m at There s my house in all them Chelsea districts it s the most convenientest of any public as is open for all manner of election purposes That s given up to it And what next said Scruby The next is I myself There isn t one of the lot of em can work them Chelsea fellows down along the river unless it is me mister Scruby knows that Why I ve been a getting of them up with a view to this very job ever since why ever since they was a talking of the Chelsea districts When Lord Robert was a coming in for the county on the religious dodge he couldn t have worked them fellows anyhow only for me mister Scruby knows that Let s take it all for granted mister Grimes said Vavasor What comes next Well them Bunratty people it is they as has come next They know which side their bread is likely to be buttered they do They re a bidding for the Handsome Man already they are And you d let your house to the Tory party Grimes said mister Scruby in a tone in which disgust and anger were blended Who said anything of my letting my house to the Tory party mister Scruby I m as round as your hat mister Scruby and as square as your elbow I am But suppose as all the liberal gents as employs you mister Scruby was to turn again you and not pay you your little bills wouldn t you have your eyes open for customers of another kind Come now mister Scruby Illustration I m as round as your hat and as square as your elbow I am You won t make much of that game Grimes Perhaps not perhaps not There s a risk in all these things isn t there mister Vavasor I should like to see you a Parliament gent I should indeed You d be a credit to the districts I really think you would I m much obliged by your good opinion mister Grimes said George When I sees a gent coming forward I knows whether he s fit for Parliament or whether he ain t I says you are fit But Lord love you mister Vavasor it s a thing a gentleman always has to pay for That s true enough a deal more than it s worth generally A thing s worth what it fetches I m worth what I ll fetch that s the long and the short of it I want to have my balance that s the truth It s the odd money in a man s bill as always carries the profit You ask mister Scruby else only with a lawyer it s all profit I believe That s what you know about it said Scruby If you cut off a man s odd money continued the publican you break his heart He d almost sooner have that and leave the other standing He d call the hundreds capital and if he lost them at last why he d put it down as being in the way of trade But the odd money he looks at that mister Vavasor as in a manner the very sweat of his brow the work of his own hand that s what goes to his family and keeps the pot a boiling down stairs Never stop a man s odd money mister Vavasor that is unless he comes it very strong indeed And what is it you want now said Scruby I wants ninety two pounds thirteen and fourpence mister Scruby and then we ll go to work for the new fight with contented hearts If we re to begin at all it s quite time it is indeed mister Vavasor And what you mean us to understand is that you won t begin at all without your money said the lawyer That s about it mister Scruby Take a fifty pound note Grimes said the lawyer Fifty pound notes are not so ready said George Oh he ll be only too happy to have your acceptance won t you Grimes Not for fifty pounds mister Scruby It s the odd money that I wants I don t mind the thirteen and four because that s neither here nor there among friends but if I didn t get all them ninety two pounds I should be a broken hearted man I should indeed mister Vavasor I couldn t go about your work for next year so as to do you justice among the electors I couldn t indeed You d better give him a bill for ninety pounds at three months mister Vavasor I have no doubt he has got a stamp in his pocket That I have mister Scruby there ain t no mistake about that A bill stamp is a thing that often turns up convenient with gents as mean business like mister Vavasor and you But you must make it ninety two you must indeed mister Vavasor And do make it two months if you can mister Vavasor they do charge so unconscionable on ninety days at them branch banks they do indeed George Vavasor and mister Scruby between them yielded at last so far as to allow the bill to be drawn for ninety two pounds but they were stanch as to the time If it must be it must said the publican with a deep sigh as he folded up the paper and put it into the pocket of a huge case which he carried And now gents I ll tell you what it is We ll make safe work of this here next election We know what s to be our little game in time and if we don t go in and win my name ain t Jacob Grimes and I ain t the landlord of the Handsome Man As you gents has perhaps got something to say among yourselves I ll make so bold as to wish you good morning So with that mister Grimes lifted his hat from the floor and bowed himself out of the room You couldn t have done it cheaper you couldn t indeed said the lawyer as soon as the sound of the closing front door had been heard Perhaps not but what a thief the man is I remember your telling me that the bill was about the most preposterous you had ever seen So it was and if we hadn t wanted him again of course we shouldn t have paid him But we ll have it all off his next account mister Vavasor every shilling of it It s only lent that s all it s only lent But one doesn t want to lend such a man money if one could help it That s true If you look at it in that light it s quite true But you see we cannot do without him If he hadn t got your bill he d have gone over to the other fellows before the week was over and the worst of it would have been that he knows our hand Looking at it all round you ve got him cheap mister Vavasor you have indeed Looking at it all round is just what I don t like mister Scruby But if a man will have a whistle he must pay for it You can t do it cheap for any of these metropolitan seats you can t indeed mister Vavasor That is a new man can t When you ve been in four or five times like old Duncombe why then of course you may snap your fingers at such men as Grimes But the Chelsea districts ain t dear I don t call them by any means dear Now Marylebone is dear and so is Southwark It s dear and nasty that s what the borough is Only that I never tell tales I could tell you a tale mister Vavasor that d make your hair stand on end I could indeed Ah the game is hardly worth the candle I believe That depends on what way you choose to look at it A seat in Parliament is a great thing to a man who wants to make his way a very great thing specially when a man s young like you mister Vavasor Young said George Sometimes it seems to me as though I ve been living for a hundred years But I won t trouble you with that mister Scruby and I believe I needn t keep you any longer With that he got up and bowed the attorney out of the room with just a little more ceremony than he had shown to the publican Young said Vavasor to himself when he was left alone There s my uncle or the old squire they re both younger men than I am One cares for his dinner and the other for his bullocks and his trees But what is there that I care for unless it is not getting among the sheriff s officers for debt Then he took out a little memorandum book from his breast pocket and having made in it an entry as to the amount and date of that bill which he had just accepted on the publican s behalf he conned over the particulars of its pages Very blue very blue indeed he said to himself when he had completed the study But nobody shall say I hadn t the courage to play the game out and that old fellow must die some day one supposes If I were not a fool I should make it up with him before he went but I am a fool and shall remain so to the last Soon after that he dressed himself slowly reading a little every now and then as he did so When his toilet was completed and his Sunday newspapers sufficiently perused he took up his hat and umbrella and sauntered out CHAPTER XIV Alice Vavasor Becomes Troubled Kate Vavasor had sent to her brother only the first half of her cousin s letter that half in which Alice had attempted to describe what had taken place between her and mister Grey In doing this Kate had been a wicked traitor a traitor to that feminine faith against which treason on the part of one woman is always unpardonable in the eyes of other women But her treason would have been of a deeper die had she sent the latter portion for in that Alice had spoken of George Vavasor himself But even of this treason Kate would I think have been guilty had the words which Alice wrote been of a nature to serve her own purpose if read by her brother But they had not been of this nature They had spoken of George as a man with whom any closer connection than that which existed at present was impossible and had been written with the view of begging Kate to desist from making futile attempts in that direction I feel myself driven Alice had said to write all this as otherwise if I were simply to tell you that I have resolved to part from mister Grey you would think that the other thing might follow The other thing cannot follow I should think myself untrue in my friendship to you if I did not tell you about mister Grey and you will be untrue in your friendship to me if you take advantage of my confidence by saying more about your brother This part of Alice s letter Kate had not sent to George Vavasor But the other thing shall follow Kate had said as she read the words for the second time and then put the papers into her desk It shall follow To give Kate Vavasor her due she was at any rate unselfish in her intrigues She was obstinately persistent and she was moreover unscrupulous but she was not selfish Many years ago she had made up her mind that George and Alice should be man and wife feeling that such a marriage would be good at any rate for her brother It had been almost brought about and had then been hindered altogether through a fault on her brother s part But she had forgiven him this sin as she had forgiven many others and she was now at work in his behalf again determined that they two should be married even though neither of them might be now anxious that it should be so The intrigue itself was dear to her and success in it was necessary to her self respect She answered Alice s letter with a pleasant gossiping epistle which shall be recorded as it will tell us something of missus Greenow s proceedings at Yarmouth Kate had promised to stay at Yarmouth for a month but she had already been there six weeks and was still under her aunt s wing Yarmouth October one hundred eighty six DEAREST ALICE Of course I am delighted It is no good saying that I am not I know how difficult it is to deal with you and therefore I sit down to answer your letter with fear and trembling lest I should say a word too much and thereby drive you back or not say quite enough and thereby fail to encourage you on Of course I am glad I have long thought that mister Grey could not make you happy and as I have thought so how can I not be glad It is no use saying that he is good and noble and all that sort of thing I have never denied it But he was not suited to you and his life would have made you wretched Ergo I rejoice And as you are the dearest friend I have of course I rejoice mightily I can understand accurately the sort of way in which the interview went Of course he had the best of it I can see him so plainly as he stood up in unruffled self possession ignoring all that you said suggesting that you were feverish or perhaps bilious waving his hand over you a little as though that might possibly do you some small good and then taking his leave with an assurance that it would be all right as soon as the wind changed I suppose it s very noble in him not taking you at your word and giving you as it were another chance but there is a kind of nobility which is almost too great for this world I think very well of you my dear as women go but I do not think well enough of you to believe that you are fit to be mister John Grey s wife Of course I m very glad You have known my mind from the first to the last and therefore what would be the good of my mincing matters No woman wishes her dearest friend to marry a man to whom she herself is antipathetic You would have been as much lost to me had you become missus Grey of Nethercoats Cambridgeshire as though you had gone to heaven I don t say but what Nethercoats may be a kind of heaven but then one doesn t wish one s friend that distant sort of happiness A flat Eden I can fancy it hemmed in by broad dykes in which cream and eggs are very plentiful where an Adam and an Eve might drink the choicest tea out of the finest china with toast buttered to perfection from year s end to year s end into which no money troubles would ever find their way nor yet any naughty novels But such an Eden is not tempting to me nor as I think to you I can fancy you stretching your poor neck over the dyke longing to fly away that you might cease to be at rest but knowing that the matrimonial dragon was too strong for any such flight If ever bird banged his wings to pieces against gilded bars you would have banged yours to pieces in that cage You say that you have failed to make him understand that the matter is settled I need not say that of course it is settled and that he must be made to understand it You owe it to him now to put him out of all doubt He is I suppose accessible to the words of a mortal god though he be But I do not fear about this for after all you have as much firmness about you as most people perhaps as much as he has at bottom though you may not have so many occasions to show it As to that other matter I can only say that you shall be obliged as far as it is in my power to obey you For what may come out from me by word of mouth when we are together I will not answer with certainty But my pen is under better control and it shall not write the offending name And now I must tell you a little about myself or rather I am inclined to spin a yarn and tell you a great deal I have got such a lover But I did describe him before Of course it s mister Cheesacre If I were to say he hasn t declared himself I should hardly give you a fair idea of my success And yet he has not declared himself and which is worse is very anxious to marry a rival But it s a strong point in my favour that my rival wants him to take me and that he will assuredly be driven to make me an offer sooner or later in obedience to her orders My aunt is my rival and I do not feel the least doubt as to his having offered to her half a dozen times But then she has another lover Captain Bellfield and I see that she prefers him He is a penniless scamp and looks as though he drank He paints his whiskers too which I don t like and being forty tries to look like twenty five Otherwise he is agreeable enough and I rather approve of my aunt s taste in preferring him But my lover has solid attractions and allures me on by a description of the fat cattle which he sends to market He is a man of substance and should I ever become missus Cheesacre I have reason to think that I shall not be left in want We went up to his place on a visit the other day Oileymead is the name of my future home not so pretty as Nethercoats is it And we had such a time there We reached the place at ten and left it at four and he managed to give us three meals I m sure we had before our eyes at different times every bit of china delf glass and plate in the establishment He made us go into the cellar and told us how much wine he had got there and how much beer It s all paid for missus Greenow every bottle of it he said turning round to my aunt with a pathetic earnestness for which I had hardly given him credit Everything in this house is my own it s all paid for I don t call anything a man s own till it s paid for Now that jacket that Bellfield swells about with on the sands at Yarmouth that s not his own and it s not like to be either And then he winked his eye as though bidding my aunt to think of that before she encouraged such a lover as Bellfield He took us into every bedroom and disclosed to us all the glories of his upper chambers It would have done you good to see him lifting the counterpanes and bidding my aunt feel the texture of the blankets And then to see her turn round to me and say Kate it s simply the best furnished house I ever went over in my life It does seem very comfortable said I Comfortable said he Yes I don t think there s anybody can say that Oileymead isn t comfortable I did so think of you and Nethercoats The attractions are the same only in the one place you would have a god for your keeper and in the other a brute For myself if ever I m to have a keeper at all I shall prefer a man But when we got to the farmyard his eloquence reached the highest pitch missus Greenow said he look at that and he pointed to heaps of manure raised like the streets of a little city Look at that There s a great deal said my aunt I believe you said he I ve more muck upon this place here than any farmer in Norfolk gentle or simple I don t care who the other is Only fancy Alice it may all be mine the blankets the wine the muck and the rest of it So my aunt assured me when we got home that evening When I remarked that the wealth had been exhibited to her and not to me she did not affect to deny it but treated that as a matter of no moment He wants a wife my dear she said and you may pick him up to morrow by putting out your hand When I remarked that his mind seemed to be intent on low things and specially named the muck she only laughed at me Money s never dirty she said nor yet what makes money She talks of taking lodgings in Norwich for the winter saying that in her widowed state she will be as well there as anywhere else and she wants me to stay with her up to Christmas Indeed she first proposed the Norwich plan on the ground that it might be useful to me with a view to mister Cheesacre of course but I fancy that she is unwilling to tear herself away from Captain Bellfield At any rate to Norwich she will go and I have promised not to leave her before the second week in November With all her absurdities I like her Her faults are terrible faults but she has not the fault of hiding them by falsehood She is never stupid and she is very good natured She would have allowed me to equip myself from head to foot at her expense if I would have accepted her liberality and absolutely offered to give me my trousseau if I would marry mister Cheesacre I live in the hope that you will come down to the old place at Christmas I won t offend you more than I can help At any rate he won t be there And if I don t see you there where am I to see you If I were you I would certainly not go to Cheltenham You are never happy there Do you ever dream of the river at Basle I do so often Most affectionately yours KATE VAVASOR Illustration missus Greenow look at that Alice had almost lost the sensation created by the former portion of Kate s letter by the fun of the latter before she had quite made that sensation her own The picture of the Cambridgeshire Eden would have displeased her had she dwelt upon it and the allusion to the cream and toast would have had the very opposite effect to that which Kate had intended Perhaps Kate had felt this and had therefore merged it all in her stories about mister Cheesacre I will go to Cheltenham she said to herself He has recommended it I shall never be his wife but till we have parted altogether I will show him that I think well of his advice That same afternoon she told her father that she would go to Lady Macleod s at Cheltenham before the end of the month She was in truth prompted to this by a resolution of which she was herself hardly conscious that she would not at this period of her life be in any way guided by her cousin Having made up her mind about mister Grey it was right that she should let her cousin know her purpose but she would never be driven to confess to herself that Kate had influenced her in the matter She would go to Cheltenham Lady Macleod would no doubt vex her by hourly solicitations that the match might be renewed but if she knew herself she had strength to withstand Lady Macleod She received one letter from mister Grey before the time came for her departure and she answered it telling him of her intention telling him also that she now felt herself bound to explain to her father her present position I tell you this she said in consequence of what you said to me on the matter My father will know it to morrow and on the following morning I shall start for Cheltenham I have heard from Lady Macleod and she expects me On the following morning she did tell her father standing by him as he sat at his breakfast What said he putting down his tea cup and looking up into her face What not marry John Grey No papa I know how strange you must think it And you say that there has been no quarrel No there has been no quarrel By degrees I have learned to feel that I should not make him happy as his wife It s d d nonsense said mister Vavasor Now such an expression as this from him addressed to his daughter showed that he was very deeply moved Oh papa don t talk to me in that way But it is I never heard such trash in my life If he comes to me I shall tell him so Not make him happy Why can t you make him happy We are not suited to each other But what s the matter with him He s a gentleman Yes he s a gentleman And a man of honour and with good means and with all that knowledge and reading which you profess to like Look here Alice I am not going to interfere nor shall I attempt to make you marry anyone You are your own mistress as far as that is concerned But I do hope for your sake and for mine I do hope that there is nothing again between you and your cousin There is nothing papa I did not like your going abroad with him though I didn t choose to interrupt your plan by saying so But if there were anything of that kind going on I should be bound to tell you that your cousin s position at present is not a good one Men do not speak well of him There is nothing between us papa but if there were men speaking ill of him would not deter me And men speaking well of mister Grey will not do the other thing I know very well that women can be obstinate I haven t come to this resolution without thinking much about it papa I suppose not Well I can t say anything more You are your own mistress and your fortune is in your own keeping I can t make you marry John Grey I think you very foolish and if he comes to me I shall tell him so You are going down to Cheltenham are you Yes papa I have promised Lady Macleod Very well I d sooner it should be you than me that s all I can say Then he took up his newspaper thereby showing that he had nothing further to say on the matter and Alice left him alone The whole thing was so vexatious that even mister Vavasor was disturbed by it As it was not term time he had no signing to do in Chancery Lane and could not therefore bury his unhappiness in his daily labour or rather in his labour that was by no means daily So he sat at home till four o clock expressing to himself in various phrases his wonder that any man alive should ever rear a daughter And when he got to his club the waiters found him quite unmanageable about his dinner which he ate alone rejecting all proposition of companionship But later in the evening he regained his composure over a glass of whiskey toddy and a cigar She s got her own money he said to himself and what does it matter I don t suppose she ll marry her cousin I don t think she s fool enough for that And after all she ll probably make it up again with John Grey And in this way he determined that he might let this annoyance run off him and that he need not as a father take the trouble of any interference But while he was at his club there came a visitor to Queen Anne Street and that visitor was the dangerous cousin of whom according to his uncle s testimony men at present did not speak well Alice had not seen him since they had parted on the day of their arrival in London nor indeed had heard of his whereabouts In the consternation of her mind at this step which she was taking a step which she had taught herself to regard as essentially her duty before it was taken but which seemed to herself to be false and treacherous the moment she had taken it she had become aware that she had been wrong to travel with her cousin She felt sure she thought that she was sure that her doing so had in nowise affected her dealings with mister Grey She was very certain she thought that she was certain that she would have rejected him just the same had she never gone to Switzerland But every one would say of her that her journey to Switzerland with such companions had produced that result It had been unlucky and she was sorry for it and she now wished to avoid all communication with her cousin till this affair should be altogether over She was especially unwilling to see him but she had not felt it necessary to give any special injunctions as to his admittance and now before she had time to think of it on the eve of her departure for Cheltenham he was in the room with her just as the dusk of the October evening was coming on She was sitting away from the fire almost behind the window curtains thinking of John Grey and very unhappy in her thoughts when George Vavasor was announced It will of course be understood that Vavasor had at this time received his sister s letter He had received it and had had time to consider the matter since the Sunday morning on which we saw him in his own rooms in Cecil Street She can turn it all into capital to morrow if she pleases he had said to himself when thinking of her income But he had also reminded himself that her grandfather would probably enable him to settle an income out of the property upon Alice in the event of their being married And then he had also felt that he could have no greater triumph than walking atop of John Grey as he called it His return for the Chelsea Districts would hardly be sweeter to him than that You must have thought I had vanished out of the world said George coming up to her with his extended hand Alice was confused and hardly knew how to address him Somebody told me that you were shooting she said after a pause So I was but my shooting is not like the shooting of your great Nimrods men who are hunters upon the earth Two days among the grouse and two more among the partridges are about the extent of it Capel Court is the preserve in which I am usually to be found Alice knew nothing of Capel Court and said Oh indeed Have you heard from Kate George asked Yes once or twice she is still at Yarmouth with Aunt Greenow And is going to Norwich as she says Kate seems to have made a league with Aunt Greenow I who don t pretend to be very disinterested in money matters think that she is quite right No doubt Aunt Greenow may marry again but friends with forty thousand pounds are always agreeable I don t believe that Kate thinks much of that said Alice Not so much as she ought I dare say Poor Kate is not a rich woman or I fear likely to become one She doesn t seem to dream of getting married and her own fortune is less than a hundred a year Girls who never dream of getting married are just those who make the best marriages at last said Alice Perhaps so but I wish I was easier about Kate She is the best sister a man ever had Indeed she is And I have done nothing for her as yet I did think while I was in that wine business that I could have done anything I pleased for her But my grandfather s obstinacy put me out of that and now I m beginning the world again that is comparatively I wonder whether you think I m wrong in trying to get into Parliament No quite right I admire you for it It is just what I would do in your place You are unmarried and have a right to run the risk I am so glad to hear you speak like that said he He had now managed to take up that friendly confidential almost affectionate tone of talking which he had so often used when abroad with her and which he had failed to assume when first entering the room I have always thought so But you have never said it Haven t I I thought I had Not heartily like that I know that people abuse me my own people my grandfather and probably your father saying that I am reckless and the rest of it I do risk everything for my object but I do not know that any one can blame me unless it be Kate To whom else do I owe anything Kate does not blame you No she sympathizes with me she and she only unless it be you Then he paused for an answer but she made him none She is brave enough to give me her hearty sympathy But perhaps for that very reason I ought to be the more chary in endangering the only support that she is like to have What is ninety pounds a year for the maintenance of a single lady I hope that Kate will always live with me said Alice that is as soon as she has lost her home at Vavasor Hall He had been very crafty and had laid a trap for her He had laid a trap for her and she had fallen into it She had determined not to be induced to talk of herself but he had brought the thing round so cunningly that the words were out of her mouth before she remembered whither they would lead her She did remember this as she was speaking them but then it was too late What at Nethercoats said he Neither she nor I doubt your love but few men would like such an intruder as that into their household and of all men mister Grey whose nature is retiring would like it the least I was not thinking of Nethercoats said Alice Ah no that is it you see Kate says so often to me that when you are married she will be alone in the world I don t think she will ever find that I shall separate myself from her No not by any will of your own Poor Kate You cannot be surprised that she should think of your marriage with dread How much of her life has been made up of her companionship with you and all the best of it too You ought not to be angry with her for regarding your withdrawal into Cambridgeshire with dismay Alice could not act the lie which now seemed to be incumbent on her She could not let him talk of Nethercoats as though it were to be her future home She made the struggle and she found that she could not do it She was unable to find the words which should tell no lie to the ear and which should yet deceive him Kate may still live with me she said slowly Everything is over between me and mister Grey Alice is that true Yes George it is true If you will allow me to say so I would rather not talk about it not just at present And does Kate know it Yes Kate knows it And my uncle Yes papa knows it also Alice how can I help speaking of it How can I not tell you that I am rejoiced that you are saved from a thraldom which I have long felt sure would break your heart Pray do not talk of it further Well if I am forbidden I shall of course obey But I own it is hard to me How can I not congratulate you To this she answered nothing but beat with her foot upon the floor as though she were impatient of his words Yes Alice I understand You are angry with me he continued And yet you have no right to be surprised that when you tell me this I should think of all that passed between us in Switzerland Surely the cousin who was with you then has a right to say what he thinks of this change in your life at any rate he may do so if as in this case he approves altogether of what you are doing I am glad of your approval George but pray let that be an end to it After that the two sat silent for a minute or two She was waiting for him to go but she could not bid him leave the house She was angry with herself in that she had allowed herself to tell him of her altered plans and she was angry with him because he would not understand that she ought to be spared all conversation on the subject So she sat looking through the window at the row of gaslights as they were being lit and he remained in his chair with his elbow on the table and his head resting on his hand Do you remember asking me whether I ever shivered he said at last whether I ever thought of things that made me shiver Don t you remember on the bridge at Basle Yes I remember Well Alice one cause for my shivering is over I won t say more than that now Shall you remain long at Cheltenham Just a month And then you come back here I suppose so Papa and I will probably go down to Vavasor Hall before Christmas How much before I cannot say I shall see you at any rate after your return from Cheltenham Of course Kate will know and she will tell me Yes Kate will know I suppose she will stay here when she comes up from Norfolk Good bye Good bye Alice I shall have fewer fits of that inward shivering that you spoke of many less on account of what I have now heard God bless you Alice good bye Good bye George As he went he took her hand and pressed it closely between his own In those days when they were lovers engaged lovers a close long continued pressure of her hand had been his most eloquent speech of love He had not been given to many kisses not even to many words of love But he would take her hand and hold it even as he looked away from her and she remembered well the touch of his palm It was ever cool cool and with a surface smooth as a woman s a small hand that had a firm grip There had been days when she had loved to feel that her own was within it when she trusted in it and intended that it should be her staff through life Now she distrusted it and as the thoughts of the old days came upon her and the remembrance of that touch was recalled she drew her hand away rapidly Not for that had she driven from her as honest a man as had ever wished to mate with a woman He George Vavasor had never so held her hand since the day when they had parted and now on this first occasion of her freedom she felt it again What did he think of her Did he suppose that she could transfer her love in that way as a flower may be taken from one buttonhole and placed in another He read it all and knew that he was hurrying on too quickly I can understand well he said in a whisper what your present feelings are but I do not think you will be really angry with me because I have been unable to repress my joy at what I cannot but regard as your release from a great misfortune Then he went My release she said seating herself on the chair from which he had risen My release from a misfortune No but my fall from heaven Oh what a man he is That he should have loved me and that I should have driven him away from me Her thoughts travelled off to the sweetness of that home at Nethercoats to the excellence of that master who might have been hers and then in an agony of despair she told herself that she had been an idiot and a fool as well as a traitor What had she wanted in life that she should have thus quarrelled with as happy a lot as ever had been offered to a woman Had she not been mad when she sent from her side the only man that she loved the only man that she had ever truly respected For hours she sat there all alone putting out the candles which the servant had lighted for her and leaving untasted the tea that was brought to her Poor Alice I hope that she may be forgiven It was her special fault that when at Rome she longed for Tibur and when at Tibur she regretted Rome Not that her cousin George is to be taken as representing the joys of the great capital though mister Grey may be presumed to form no inconsiderable part of the promised delights of the country Now that she had sacrificed her Tibur because it had seemed to her that the sunny quiet of its pastures lacked the excitement necessary for the happiness of life she was again prepared to quarrel with the heartlessness of Rome and already was again sighing for the tranquillity of the country Sitting there full of these regrets she declared to herself that she would wait for her father s return and then throwing herself upon his love and upon his mercy would beg him to go to mister Grey and ask for pardon for her I should be very humble to him she said but he is so good that I may dare to be humble before him So she waited for her father She waited till twelve till one till two but still he did not come Later than that she did not dare to wait for him She feared to trust him on such business returning so late as that after so many cigars after perhaps some superfluous beakers of club nectar His temper at such a moment would not be fit for such work as hers But if he was late in coming home who had sent him away from his home in unhappiness Between two and three she went to bed and on the following morning she left Queen Anne Street for the Great Western Station before her father was up CHAPTER XV Paramount Crescent Lady Macleod lived at No three Paramount Crescent in Cheltenham where she occupied a very handsome first floor drawing room with a bedroom behind it looking over a stable yard and a small room which would have been the dressing room had the late Sir Archibald been alive but which was at present called the dining room and in it Lady Macleod did dine whenever her larger room was to be used for any purposes of evening company The vicinity of the stable yard was not regarded by the tenant as among the attractions of the house but it had the effect of lowering the rent and Lady Macleod was a woman who regarded such matters Her income though small would have sufficed to enable her to live removed from such discomforts but she was one of those women who regard it as a duty to leave something behind them even though it be left to those who do not at all want it and Lady Macleod was a woman who wilfully neglected no duty So she pinched herself and inhaled the effluvia of the stables and squabbled with the cabmen in order that she might bequeath a thousand pounds or two to some Lady Midlothian who cared perhaps little for her and would hardly thank her memory for the money Had Alice consented to live with her she would have merged that duty of leaving money behind her in that other duty of finding a home for her adopted niece But Alice had gone away and therefore the money was due to Lady Midlothian rather than to her The saving however was postponed whenever Alice would consent to visit Cheltenham and a bedroom was secured for her which did not look out over the stables Accommodation was also found for her maid much better than that provided for Lady Macleod s own maid She was a hospitable good old woman painfully struggling to do the best she could in the world It was a pity that she was such a bore a pity that she was so hard to cabmen and others a pity that she suspected all tradesmen servants and people generally of a rank of life inferior to her own a pity that she was disposed to condemn for ever and ever so many of her own rank because they played cards on week days and did not go to church on Sundays and a pity as I think above all that while she was so suspicious of the poor she was so lenient to the vices of earls earl s sons and such like Alice having fully considered the matter had thought it most prudent to tell Lady Macleod by letter what she had done in regard to mister Grey There had been many objections to the writing of such a letter but there appeared to be stronger objection to that telling it face to face which would have been forced upon her had she not written There would in such case have arisen on Lady Macleod s countenance a sternness of rebuke which Alice did not choose to encounter The same sternness of rebuke would come upon the countenance on receipt of the written information but it would come in its most aggravated form on the immediate receipt of the letter and some of its bitterness would have passed away before Alice s arrival I think that Alice was right It is better for both parties that any great offence should be confessed by letter But Alice trembled as the cab drew up at No three Paramount Crescent She met her aunt as was usual just inside the drawing room door and she saw at once that if any bitterness had passed away from that face the original bitterness must indeed have been bitter She had so timed her letter that Lady Macleod should have no opportunity of answering it The answer was written there in the mingled anger and sorrow of those austere features Alice she said as she took her niece in her arms and kissed her oh Alice what is this Yes aunt it is very bad I know and poor Alice tried to make a jest of it Young ladies are very wicked when they don t know their own minds But if they haven t known them and have been wicked what can they do but repent Repent said Lady Macleod Yes I hope you will repent Poor mister Grey what must he think of it I can only hope aunt that he won t think of it at all for very long That s nonsense my dear Of course he ll think of it and of course you ll marry him Shall I aunt Of course you will Why Alice hasn t it been all settled among families Lady Midlothian knew all the particulars of it just as well as I did And is not your word pledged to him I really don t understand what you mean I don t see how it is possible you should go back Gentlemen when they do that kind of thing are put out of society but I really think it is worse in a woman Then they may if they please put me out of society only that I don t know that I m particularly in it And the wickedness of the thing Alice I m obliged to say so When you talk to me about society aunt and about Lady Midlothian I give up to you willingly the more willingly perhaps because I don t care much for one or the other Here Lady Macleod tried to say a word but she failed and Alice went on boldly looking up into her aunt s face which became a shade more bitter than ever But when you tell me about wickedness and my conscience then I must be my own judge It is my conscience and the fear of committing wickedness that has made me do this You should submit to be guided by your elders Alice No my elders in such a matter as this cannot teach me It cannot be right that I should go to a man s house and be his wife if I do not think that I can make him happy Then why did you accept him Because I was mistaken I am not going to defend that If you choose to scold me for that you may do so aunt and I will not answer you But as to marrying him or not marrying him now as to that I must judge for myself It was a pity you did not know your own mind earlier It was a pity a great pity I have done myself an injury that is quite irretrievable I know that and am prepared to bear it I have done him too an injustice which I regret with my whole heart I can only excuse myself by saying that I might have done him a worse injustice All this was said at the very moment of her arrival and the greeting did not seem to promise much for the happiness of the next month but perhaps it was better for them both that the attack and the defence should thus be made suddenly at their first meeting It is better to pull the string at once when you are in the shower bath and not to stand shivering thinking of the inevitable shock which you can only postpone for a few minutes Lady Macleod in this case had pulled the string and thus reaped the advantage of her alacrity Well my dear said her ladyship I suppose you will like to go up stairs and take off your bonnet Mary shall bring you some tea when you come down So Alice escaped and when she returned to the comfort of her cup of tea in the drawing room the fury of the storm had passed away She sat talking of other things till dinner and though Lady Macleod did during the evening make one allusion to poor mister Grey the subject was allowed to drop Alice was very tender as to her aunt s ailments was more than ordinarily attentive to the long list of Cheltenham iniquities which was displayed to her and refrained from combating any of her aunt s religious views After a while they got upon the subject of Aunt Greenow for whose name Lady Macleod had a special aversion as indeed she had for all the Vavasor side of Alice s family and then Alice offered to read and did read to her aunt many pages out of one of those terrible books of wrath which from time to time come forth and tell us that there is no hope for us Lady Macleod liked to be so told and as she now poor woman could not read at nights herself she enjoyed her evening Lady Macleod no doubt did enjoy her niece s sojourn at Cheltenham but I do not think it could have been pleasant to Alice On the second day nothing was said about mister Grey and Alice hoped that by her continual readings in the book of wrath her aunt s heart might be softened towards her But it seemed that Lady Macleod measured the periods of respite for on the third day and on the fifth she returned to the attack Did John Grey still wish that the match should go on she asked categorically It was in vain that Alice tried to put aside the question and begged that the matter might not be discussed Lady Macleod insisted on her right to carry on the examination and Alice was driven to acknowledge that she believed he did wish it She could hardly say otherwise seeing that she had at that moment a letter from him in her pocket in which he still spoke of his engagement as being absolutely binding on him and expressed a hope that this change from London to Cheltenham would bring her round and set everything to rights He certainly did in a fashion wave his hand over her as Kate had said of him This letter Alice had resolved that she would not answer He would probably write again and she would beg him to desist Instead of Cheltenham bringing her round Cheltenham had made her firmer than ever in her resolution I am inclined to think that the best mode of bringing her round at this moment would have been a course of visits from her cousin George and a series of letters from her cousin Kate Lady Macleod s injunctions would certainly not bring her round After ten days ten terrible days devoted to discussions on matrimony in the morning and to the book of wrath in the evening relieved by two tea parties in which the sins of Cheltenham were discussed at length Lady Macleod herself got a letter from mister Grey mister Grey s kindest compliments to Lady Macleod He believed that Lady Macleod was aware of the circumstances of his engagement with Miss Vavasor Might he call on Miss Vavasor at Lady Macleod s house in Cheltenham and might he also hope to have the pleasure of making Lady Macleod s acquaintance Alice had been in the room when her aunt received this letter but her aunt had said nothing and Alice had not known from whom the letter had come When her aunt crept away with it after breakfast she had suspected nothing and had never imagined that Lady Macleod in the privacy of her own room looking out upon the stables had addressed a letter to Nethercoats But such a letter had been addressed to Nethercoats and mister Grey had been informed that he would be received in Paramount Crescent with great pleasure mister Grey had even indicated the day on which he would come and on the morning of that day Lady Macleod had presided over the two teacups in a state of nervous excitement which was quite visible to Alice More than once Alice asked little questions not supposing that she was specially concerned in the matter which had caused her aunt s fidgety restlessness but observing it so plainly that it was almost impossible not to allude to it There s nothing the matter my dear at all at last Lady Macleod said but as she said so she was making up her mind that the moment had not come in which she must apprise Alice of mister Grey s intended visit As Alice had questioned her at the breakfast table she would say nothing about it then but waited till the teacups were withdrawn and till the maid had given her last officious poke to the fire Then she began She had mister Grey s letter in her pocket and as she prepared herself to speak she pulled it out and held it on the little table before her Alice she said I expect a visitor here to day Alice knew instantly who was the expected visitor Probably any girl under such circumstances would have known equally well A visitor aunt she said and managed to hide her knowledge admirably Yes Alice a visitor I should have told you before only I thought I thought I had better not It is mister mister Grey Indeed aunt Is he coming to see you Well he is desirous no doubt of seeing you more especially but he has expressed a wish to make my acquaintance which I cannot under the circumstances think is unnatural Of course Alice he must want to talk over this affair with your friends I wish I could have spared them said Alice I wish I could I have brought his letter here and you can see it if you please It is very nicely written and as far as I am concerned I should not think of refusing to see him And now comes the question What are we to do with him Am I to ask him to dinner I take it for granted that he will not expect me to offer him a bed as he knows that I live in lodgings Oh no aunt he certainly will not expect that But ought I to ask him to dinner I should be most happy to entertain him though you know how very scanty my means of doing so are but I really do not know how it might be between you and him I mean We should not fight aunt No I suppose not but if you cannot be affectionate in your manner to him I will not answer for my manners aunt but you may be sure of this that I should be affectionate in my heart I shall always regard him as a dearly loved friend though for many years no doubt I shall be unable to express my friendship That may be all very well Alice but it will not be what he will want I think upon the whole that I had better not ask him to dinner Perhaps not aunt It is a period of the day in which any special constraint among people is more disagreeable than at any other time and then at dinner the servants must see it I think there might be some awkwardness if he were to dine here I really think there would said Alice anxious to have the subject dropped I hope he won t think that I am inhospitable I should be so happy to do the best I could for him for I regard him Alice quite as though he were to be your husband And when anybody at all connected with me has come to Cheltenham I always have asked them to dine and then I have Gubbins s man to come and wait at table as you know Of all men in the world mister Grey is the last to think about it That should only make me the more careful But I think it would perhaps be more comfortable if he were to come in the evening Much more comfortable aunt I suppose he will be here in the afternoon before dinner and we had better wait at home for him I dare say he ll want to see you alone and therefore I ll retire to my own rooms looking over the stables Dear old lady But if you wish it I will receive him first and then Martha Martha was Alice s maid can fetch you down This discussion as to the propriety or impropriety of giving her lover a dinner had not been pleasant to Alice but nevertheless when it was over she felt grateful to Lady Macleod There was an attempt in the arrangement to make mister Grey s visit as little painful as possible and though such a discussion at such a time might as well have been avoided the decision to which her ladyship had at last come with reference both to the dinner and the management of the visit was no doubt the right one Lady Macleod had been quite correct in all her anticipations At three o clock mister Grey was announced and Lady Macleod alone received him in her drawing room She had intended to give him a great deal of good advice to bid him still keep up his heart and as it were hold up his head to confess to him how very badly Alice was behaving and to express her entire concurrence with that theory of bodily ailment as the cause and origin of her conduct But she found that mister Grey was a man to whom she could not give much advice It was he who did the speaking at this conference and not she She was overawed by him after the first three minutes Indeed her first glance at him had awed her He was so handsome and then in his beauty he had so quiet and almost saddened an air Strange to say that after she had seen him Lady Macleod entertained for him an infinitely higher admiration than before and yet she was less surprised than she had been at Alice s refusal of him The conference was very short and mister Grey had not been a quarter of an hour in the house before Martha attended upon her mistress with her summons Alice was ready and came down instantly She found mister Grey standing in the middle of the room waiting to receive her and the look of majesty which had cowed Lady Macleod had gone from his countenance He could not have received her with a kinder smile had she come to him with a promise that she would at this meeting name the day for their marriage At any rate it does not make him unhappy she said to herself You are not angry he said that I should have followed you all the way here to see you No certainly not angry mister Grey All anger that there may be between us must be on your side I feel that thoroughly Then there shall be none on either side Whatever may be done I will not be angry with you Your father advised me to come down here to you You have seen him then Yes I have seen him I was in London the day you left It is so terrible to think that I should have brought upon you all this trouble You will bring upon me much worse trouble than that unless But I have not now come down here to tell you that I believe that according to rule in such matters I should not have come to you at all but I don t know that I care much about such rules It is I that have broken all rules When a lady tells a gentleman that she does not wish to see more of him Oh mister Grey I have not told you that Have you not I am glad at any rate to hear you deny it But you will understand what I mean When a gentleman gets his dismissal from a lady he should accept it that is his dismissal under such circumstances as I have received mine But I cannot lay down my love in that way nor maintaining my love can I give up the battle It seems to me that I have a right at any rate to know something of your comings and goings as long as unless Alice you should take another name than mine My intention is to keep my own This she said in the lowest possible tone almost in a whisper with her eyes fixed upon the ground And you will not deny me that right I cannot hinder you Whatever you may do I myself have sinned so against you that I can have no right to blame you There shall be no question between us of injury from one to the other In any conversation that we may have or in any correspondence Oh mister Grey do not ask me to write Listen to me Should there be any on either side there shall be no idea of any wrong done But I have done you wrong great wrong No Alice I will not have it so When I asked you to accept my hand begging the greatest boon which it could ever come to my lot to ask from a fellow mortal I knew well how great was your goodness to me when you told me that it should be mine Now that you refuse it I know also that you are good thinking that in doing so you are acting for my welfare thinking more of my welfare than of your own Oh yes yes it is so mister Grey indeed it is so Believing that how can I talk of wrong That you are wrong in your thinking on this subject that your mind has become twisted by false impressions that I believe But I cannot therefore love you less nor so believing can I consider myself to be injured Nor am I even so little selfish as you are I think if you were my wife that I could make you happy but I feel sure that my happiness depends on your being my wife She looked up into his face but it was still serene in all its manly beauty Her cousin George if he were moved to strong feeling showed it at once in his eyes in his mouth in the whole visage of his countenance He glared in his anger and was impassioned in his love But mister Grey when speaking of the happiness of his entire life when confessing that it was now at stake with a decision against him that would be ruinous to it spoke without a quiver in his voice and had no more sign of passion in his face than if he were telling his gardener to move a rose tree I hope and believe that you will find your happiness elsewhere mister Grey Well we can but differ Alice In that we do differ And now I will say one word to explain why I have come here If I were to write to you against your will it would seem that I were persecuting you I cannot bring myself to do that even though I had the right But if I were to let you go from me taking what you have said to me and doing nothing it would seem that I had accepted your decision as final I do not do so I will not do so I come simply to tell you that I am still your suitor If you will let me I will see you again early in January as soon as you have returned to town You will hardly refuse to see me No she said I cannot refuse to see you Then it shall be so he said and I will not trouble you with letters nor will I trouble you longer now with words Tell your aunt that I have said what I came to say and that I give her my kindest thanks Then he took her hand and pressed it not as George Vavasor had pressed it and was gone When Lady Macleod returned she found that the question of the evening s tea arrangements had settled itself CHAPTER XVI The Roebury Club It has been said that George Vavasor had a little establishment at Roebury down in Oxfordshire and thither he betook himself about the middle of November He had been long known in this county and whether or no men spoke well of him as a man of business in London men spoke well of him down there as one who knew how to ride to hounds Not that Vavasor was popular among fellow sportsmen It was quite otherwise He was not a man that made himself really popular in any social meetings of men He did not himself care for the loose little talkings half flat and half sharp of men when they meet together in idleness He was not open enough in his nature for such popularity Some men were afraid of him and some suspected him There were others who made up to him seeking his intimacy but these he usually snubbed and always kept at a distance Though he had indulged in all the ordinary pleasures of young men he had never been a jovial man In his conversations with men he always seemed to think that he should use his time towards serving some purpose of business With women he was quite the reverse With women he could be happy With women he could really associate A woman he could really love but I doubt whether for all that he could treat a woman well But he was known in the Oxfordshire country as a man who knew what he was about and such men are always welcome It is the man who does not know how to ride that is made uncomfortable in the hunting field by cold looks or expressed censure And yet it is very rarely that such men do any real harm Such a one may now and then get among the hounds or override the hunt but it is not often so Many such complaints are made but in truth the too forward man who presses the dogs is generally one who can ride but is too eager or too selfish to keep in his proper place The bad rider like the bad whist player pays highly for what he does not enjoy and should be thanked But at both games he gets cruelly snubbed At both games George Vavasor was great and he never got snubbed There were men who lived together at Roebury in a kind of club four or five of them who came thither from London running backwards and forwards as hunting arrangements enabled them to do so a brewer or two and a banker with a would be fast attorney a sporting literary gentleman and a young unmarried Member of Parliament who had no particular home of his own in the country These men formed the Roebury Club and a jolly life they had of it They had their own wine closet at the King s Head or Roebury Inn as the house had come to be popularly called and supplied their own game The landlord found everything else and as they were not very particular about their bills they were allowed to do pretty much as they liked in the house They were rather imperious very late in their hours sometimes though not often noisy and once there had been a hasty quarrel which had made the landlord in his anger say that the club should be turned out of his house But they paid well chaffed the servants much oftener than they bullied them and on the whole were very popular To this club Vavasor did not belong alleging that he could not afford to live at their pace and alleging also that his stays at Roebury were not long enough to make him a desirable member The invitation to him was not repeated and he lodged elsewhere in the little town But he occasionally went in of an evening and would make up with the members a table at whist He had come down to Roebury by mail train ready for hunting the next morning and walked into the club room just at midnight There he found Maxwell the banker Grindley the would be fast attorney and Calder Jones the Member of Parliament playing dummy Neither of the brewers were there nor was the sporting literary gentleman Here s Vavasor said Maxwell and now we won t play this blackguard game any longer Somebody told me Vavasor that you were gone away Gone away what like a fox I don t know what it was that something had happened to you since last season that you were married or dead or gone abroad By George I ve lost the trick after all I hate dummy like the devil I never hold a card in dummy s hand Yes I know that s seven points on each side Vavasor come and cut Upon my word if any one had asked me I should have said you were dead But you see nobody ever does think of asking you anything What you probably mean said Grindley is that Vavasor was not returned for Chelsea last February but you ve seen him since that Are you going to try it again Vavasor If you ll lend me the money I will I don t see what on earth a man gains by going into the house said Calder Jones I couldn t help myself as it happened but upon my word it s a deuce of a bore A fellow thinks he can do as he likes about going but he can t It wouldn t do for me to give it up because Oh no of course not where should we all be said Vavasor It s you and me Grindems said Maxwell D parliament and now let s have a rubber They played till three and mister Calder Jones lost a good deal of money a good deal of money in a little way for they never played above ten shilling points and no bet was made for more than a pound or two But Vavasor was the winner and when he left the room he became the subject of some ill natured remarks I wonder he likes coming in here said Grindley who had himself been the man to invite him to belong to the club and who had at one time indulged the ambition of an intimacy with George Vavasor I can t understand it said Calder Jones who was a little bitter about his money Last year he seemed to walk in just when he liked as though he were one of us He s a bad sort of fellow said Grindley he s so uncommonly dark I don t know where on earth he gets his money from He was heir to some small property in the north but he lost every shilling of that when he was in the wine trade You re wrong there Grindems said Maxwell making use of a playful nickname which he had invented for his friend He made a pot of money at the wine business and had he stuck to it he would have been a rich man He s lost it all since then and that place in the north into the bargain Wrong again Grindems my boy If old Vavasor were to die to morrow Vavasor Hall would go just as he might choose to leave it George may be a ruined man for aught I know There s no doubt about that I believe said Grindley Perhaps not Grindems but he can t have lost Vavasor Hall because he has never as yet had an interest in it He s the natural heir and will probably get it some day All the same said Calder Jones isn t it rather odd he should come in here We ve asked him often enough said Maxwell not because we like him but because we want him so often to make up a rubber I don t like George Vavasor and I don t know who does but I like him better than dummy And I d sooner play whist with men I don t like Grindems than I d not play at all A bystander might have thought from the tone of mister Maxwell s voice that he was alluding to mister Grindley himself but mister Grindley didn t seem to take it in that light That s true of course said he We can t pick men just as we please But I certainly didn t think that he d make it out for another season The club breakfasted the next morning at nine o clock in order that they might start at half past for the meet at Edgehill Edgehill is twelve miles from Roebury and the hacks would do it in an hour and a half or perhaps a little less Does anybody know anything about that brown horse of Vavasor s said Maxwell I saw him coming into the yard yesterday with that old groom of his He had a brown horse last season said Grindley a little thing that went very fast but wasn t quite sound on the road That was a mare said Maxwell and he sold her to Cinquebars Ah my friend from whom I have borrowed this scion of the nobility Had he been left with us he would have forgiven me my little theft and now that he has gone I will not change the name For a hundred and fifty said Calder Jones and she wasn t worth the odd fifty He won seventy with her at Leamington said Maxwell and I doubt whether he d take his money now Is Cinquebars coming down here this year I don t know said Maxwell I hope not He s the best fellow in the world but he can t ride and he don t care for hunting and he makes more row than any fellow I ever met I wish some fellow could tell me something about that fellow s brown horse I d never buy a horse of Vavasor s if I were you said Grindley He never has anything that s all right all round And who has said Maxwell as he took into his plate a second mutton chop which had just been brought up hot into the room especially for him That s the mistake men make about horses and that s why there s so much cheating I never ask for a warranty with a horse and don t very often have a horse examined Yet I do as well as others You can t have perfect horses any more than you can perfect men or perfect women You put up with red hair or bad teeth or big feet or sometimes with the devil of a voice But a man when he wants a horse won t put up with anything Therefore those who ve got horses to sell must lie When I go into the market with three hundred pounds I expect a perfect animal As I never do that now I never expect a perfect animal I like em to see I like em to have four legs and I like em to have a little wind I don t much mind anything else By Jove you re about right said Calder Jones The reader will therefore readily see that mister Maxwell the banker reigned as king in that club Vavasor had sent two horses on in charge of Bat Smithers and followed on a pony about fourteen hands high which he had ridden as a cover hack for the last four years He did not start till near ten but he was able to catch Bat with his two horses about a mile and a half on that side of Edgehill Have you managed to come along pretty clean the master asked as he came up with his servant They be the most beastly roads in all England said Bat who always found fault with any county in which he happened to be located But I ll warrant I m cleaner than most on em What for any county should make such roads as them I never could tell The roads about there are bad certainly very bad But I suppose they would have been better had Providence sent better materials And what do you think of the brown horse Bat Well sir He said no more and that he said with a drawl He s as fine an animal to look at as ever I put my eye on said George He s all that said Bat He s got lots of pace too I m sure he has sir And they tell me you can t beat him at jumping They can mostly do that sir if they re well handled You see he s a deal over my weight Yes he is mister Vavasor He is a fourteen stoner Or fifteen said Vavasor Perhaps he may sir There s no knowing what a orse can carry till he s tried George asked his groom no more questions but felt sure that he had better sell his brown horse if he could Now I here protest that there was nothing specially amiss with the brown horse Towards the end of the preceding season he had overreached himself and had been lame and had been sold by some owner with more money than brains who had not cared to wait for a cure Then there had gone with him a bad character and a vague suspicion had attached itself to him as there does to hundreds of horses which are very good animals in their way He had come thus to Tattersall s and Vavasor had bought him cheap thinking that he might make money of him from his form and action He had found nothing amiss with him nor indeed had Bat Smithers But his character went with him and therefore Bat Smithers thought it well to be knowing George Vavasor knew as much of horses as most men can as perhaps as any man can who is not a dealer or a veterinary surgeon but he like all men doubted his own knowledge though on that subject he would never admit that he doubted it Therefore he took Bat s word and felt sure that the horse was wrong We shall have a run from the big wood said George If they make un break you will sir said Bat At any rate I ll ride the brown horse said George Then as soon as that was settled between them the Roebury Club overtook them There was now a rush of horses on the road altogether and they were within a quarter of a mile of Edgehill church close to which was the meet Bat with his two hunters fell a little behind and the others trotted on together The other grooms with their animals were on in advance and were by this time employed in combing out forelocks and rubbing stirrup leathers and horses legs free from the dirt of the roads but Bat Smithers was like his master and did not congregate much with other men and Vavasor was sure to give orders to his servant different from the orders given by others Are you well mounted this year Maxwell asked of George Vavasor No indeed I never was what I call well mounted yet I generally have one horse and three or four cripples That brown horse behind there is pretty good I believe I see your man has got the old chestnut mare with him She s one of the cripples not but what she s as sound as a bell and as good a hunter as ever I wish to ride but she makes a little noise when she s going So that you can hear her three fields off said Grindley Five if the fields are small enough and your ears are sharp enough said Vavasor All the same I wouldn t change her for the best horse I ever saw under you Had you there Grindems said Maxwell No he didn t said Grindley He didn t have me at all Your horses Grindley are always up to all the work they have to do said George and I don t know what any man wants more than that Had you again Grindems said Maxwell I can ride against him any day said Grindley Yes or against a brick wall either if your horse didn t know any better said George Had you again Grindems said Maxwell Whereupon mister Grindley trotted on round the corner by the church and into the field in which the hounds were assembled The fire had become too hot for him and he thought it best to escape Had it been Vavasor alone he would have turned upon him and snarled but he could not afford to exhibit any ill temper to the king of the club mister Grindley was not popular and were Maxwell to turn openly against him his sporting life down at Roebury would decidedly be a failure The lives of such men as mister Grindley men who are tolerated in the daily society of others who are accounted their superiors do not seem to have many attractions And yet how many such men does one see in almost every set Why mister Grindley should have been inferior to mister Maxwell the banker or to Stone or to Prettyman who were brewers or even to mister Pollock the heavy weight literary gentleman I can hardly say An attorney by his trade is at any rate as good as a brewer and there are many attorneys who hold their heads high anywhere Grindley was a rich man or at any rate rich enough for the life he led I don t know much about his birth but I believe it was as good as Maxwell s He was not ignorant or a fool whereas I rather think Maxwell was a fool Grindley had made his own way in the world but Maxwell would certainly not have made himself a banker if his father had not been a banker before him nor could the bank have gone on and prospered had there not been partners there who were better men of business than our friend Grindley knew that he had a better intellect than Maxwell and yet he allowed Maxwell to snub him and he toadied Maxwell in return It was not on the score of riding that Maxwell claimed and held his superiority for Grindley did not want pluck and every one knew that Maxwell had lived freely and that his nerves were not what they had been I think it had come from the outward look of the men from the form of each from the gait and visage which in one was good and in the other insignificant The nature of such dominion of man over man is very singular but this is certain that when once obtained in manhood it may be easily held Among boys at school the same thing is even more conspicuous because boys have less of conscience than men are more addicted to tyranny and when weak are less prone to feel the misery and disgrace of succumbing Who has been through a large school and does not remember the Maxwells and Grindleys the tyrants and the slaves those who domineered and those who submitted Nor was it even then personal strength nor always superior courage that gave the power of command Nor was it intellect or thoughtfulness nor by any means such qualities as make men and boys lovable It is said by many who have had to deal with boys that certain among them claim and obtain ascendancy by the spirit within them but I doubt whether the ascendancy is not rather thrust on them than claimed by them Here again I think the outward gait of the boy goes far towards obtaining for him the submission of his fellows But the tyrant boy does not become the tyrant man or the slave boy the slave man because the outward visage that has been noble or mean in the one changes and becomes so often mean or noble in the other By George there s Pollock said Maxwell as he rode into the field by the church I ll bet half a crown that he s come down from London this morning that he was up all night last night and that he tells us so three times before the hounds go out of the paddock mister Pollock was the heavy weight sporting literary gentleman CHAPTER XVII Edgehill Of all sights in the world there is I think none more beautiful than that of a pack of fox hounds seated on a winter morning round the huntsman if the place of meeting has been chosen with anything of artistic skill It should be in a grassy field and the field should be small It should not be absolutely away from all buildings and the hedgerows should not have been clipped and pared and made straight with reference to modern agricultural economy There should be trees near and the ground should be a little uneven so as to mark some certain small space as the exact spot where the dogs and servants of the hunt should congregate There are well known grand meets in England in the parks of noblemen before their houses or even on what are called their lawns but these magnificent affairs have but little of the beauty of which I speak Such assemblies are too grand and too ornate and moreover much too far removed from true sporting proprieties At them equipages are shining and ladies dresses are gorgeous and crowds of tradesmen from the neighbouring town have come there to look at the grand folk To my eye there is nothing beautiful in that The meet I speak of is arranged with a view to sport but the accident of the locality may make it the prettiest thing in the world Such in a special degree was the case at Edgehill At Edgehill the whole village consisted of three or four cottages but there was a small old church with an old grey tower and a narrow green almost dark churchyard surrounded by elm trees The road from Roebury to the meet passed by the church stile and turning just beyond it came upon the gate which led into the little field in which the hounds felt themselves as much at home as in their kennels There might be six or seven acres in the field which was long and narrow so that the huntsman had space to walk leisurely up and down with the pack clustering round him when he considered that longer sitting might chill them The church tower was close at hand visible through the trees and the field itself was green and soft though never splashing with mud or heavy with holes Edgehill was a favourite meet in that country partly because foxes were very abundant in the great wood adjacent partly because the whole country around is grass land and partly no doubt from the sporting propensities of the neighbouring population As regards my own taste I do not know that I do like beginning a day with a great wood and if not beginning it certainly not ending it It is hard to come upon the cream of hunting as it is upon the cream of any other delight Who can always drink Lafitte of the finest can always talk to a woman who is both beautiful and witty or can always find the right spirit in the poetry he reads A man has usually to work through much mud before he gets his nugget It is so certainly in hunting and a big wood too frequently afflicts the sportsman as the mud does the miner The small gorse cover is the happy much envied bit of ground in which the gold is sure to show itself readily But without the woods the gorse would not hold the foxes and without the mud the gold would not have found its resting place But as I have said Edgehill was a popular meet and as regarded the meet itself was eminently picturesque On the present occasion the little field was full of horsemen moving about slowly chatting together smoking cigars getting off from their hacks and mounting their hunters giving orders to their servants and preparing for the day There were old country gentlemen there greeting each other from far sides of the county sporting farmers who love to find themselves alongside their landlords and to feel that the pleasures of the country are common to both men down from town like our friends of the Roebury club who made hunting their chosen pleasure and who formed in number perhaps the largest portion of the field officers from garrisons round about a cloud of servants and a few nondescript stragglers who had picked up horses hither and thither round the country Outside the gate on the road were drawn up a variety of vehicles open carriages dog carts gigs and waggonettes in some few of which were seated ladies who had come over to see the meet But Edgehill was essentially not a ladies meet The distances to it were long and the rides in Cranby Wood the big wood were not adapted for wheels There were one or two ladies on horseback as is always the case but Edgehill was not a place popular even with hunting ladies One carriage that of the old master of the hounds had entered the sacred precincts of the field and from this the old baronet was just descending as Maxwell Calder Jones and Vavasor rode into the field Illustration Edgehill I hope I see you well Sir William said Maxwell greeting the master Calder Jones also made his little speech and so did Vavasor Humph
2053_138888_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 well yes 
none	none	I m pretty well thank ee Just move on will you My mare can t stir here Then some one else spoke to him and he only grunted in answer Having slowly been assisted up on to his horse for he was over seventy years of age he trotted off to the hounds while all the farmers round him touched their hats to him But his mind was laden with affairs of import and he noticed no one In a whispered voice he gave his instructions to his huntsman who said Yes Sir William No Sir William No doubt Sir William One long eared long legged fellow in a hunting cap and scarlet coat hung listening by anxious to catch something of the orders for the morning Who the devil s that fellow that s all breeches and boots said Sir William aloud to some one near him as the huntsman moved off with the hounds Sir William knew the man well enough but was minded to punish him for his discourtesy Where shall we find first Sir William said Calder Jones in a voice that was really very humble How the mischief am I to know where the foxes are said Sir William with an oath and Calder Jones retired unhappy and for the moment altogether silenced And yet Sir William was the most popular man in the county and no more courteous gentleman ever sat at the bottom of his own table A mild man he was too when out of his saddle and one by no means disposed to assume special supremacy But a master of hounds if he have long held the country and Sir William had held his for more than thirty years obtains a power which that of no other potentate can equal He may say and do what he pleases and his tyranny is always respected No conspiracy against him has a chance of success no sedition will meet with sympathy that is if he be successful in showing sport If a man be sworn at abused and put down without cause let him bear it and think that he has been a victim for the public good And let him never be angry with the master That rough tongue is the necessity of the master s position They used to say that no captain could manage a ship without swearing at his men But what are the captain s troubles in comparison with those of the master of hounds The captain s men are under discipline and can be locked up flogged or have their grog stopped The master of hounds cannot stop the grog of any offender and he can only stop the tongue or horse of such an one by very sharp words Well Pollock when did you come said Maxwell By George said the literary gentleman just down from London by the eight point thirty from Euston Square and got over here from Winslow in a trap with two fellows I never saw in my life before We came tandem in a fly and did the nineteen miles in an hour Come Athenian draw it mild said Maxwell We did indeed I wonder whether they ll pay me their share of the fly I had to leave Onslow Crescent at a quarter before eight and I did three hours work before I started Then you did it by candle light said Grindley Of course I did and why shouldn t I Do you suppose no one can work by candle light except a lawyer I suppose you fellows were playing whist and drinking hard I m uncommon glad I wasn t with you for I shall be able to ride I bet you a pound said Jones if there s a run I see more of it than you I ll take that bet with Jones said Grindley and Vavasor shall be the judge Gentlemen the hounds can t get out if you will stop up the gate said Sir William Then the pack passed through and they all trotted on for four miles to Cranby Wood Vavasor as he rode on to the wood was alone or speaking from time to time a few words to his servant I ll ride the chestnut mare in the wood he said and do you keep near me I bean t to be galloping up and down them rides I suppose said Bat almost contemptuously I shan t gallop up and down the rides myself but do you mark me to know where I am so that I can change if a fox should go away You ll be here all day sir That s my belief If so I won t ride the brown horse at all But do you take care to let me have him if there s a chance Do you understand Oh yes I understand sir There ain t no difficulty in my understanding only I don t think sir you ll ever get a fox out of that wood to day Why it stands to reason The wind s from the north east Cranby Wood is very large there being in truth two or three woods together It was nearly twelve before they found and then for an hour there was great excitement among the men who rode up and down the rides as the hounds drove the fox from one end to another of the enclosure Once or twice the poor animal did try to go away and then there was great hallooing galloping and jumping over unnecessary fences but he was headed back again or changed his mind not liking the north east wind of which Bat Smithers had predicted such bad things After one the crowd of men became rather more indifferent and clustered together in broad spots eating their lunch smoking cigars and chaffing each other It was singular to observe the amazing quantity of ham sandwiches and of sherry that had been carried into Cranby Wood on that day Grooms appeared to have been laden with cases and men were as well armed with flasks at their saddle bows as they used to be with pistols Maxwell and Pollock formed the centre of one of these crowds and chaffed each other with the utmost industry till tired of having inflicted no wounds they turned upon Grindley and drove him out of the circle You ll make that man cut his throat if you go on at that said Pollock Shall I said Maxwell Then I ll certainly stick to him for the sake of humanity in general During all this time Vavasor sat apart quite alone and Bat Smithers grimly kept his place about three hundred yards from him We shan t do any good to day said Grindley coming up to Vavasor I m sure I don t know said Vavasor That old fellow has got to be so stupid he doesn t know what he s about said Grindley meaning Sir William How can he make the fox break said Vavasor and as his voice was by no means encouraging Grindley rode away Lunch and cigars lasted till two during which hour the hounds the huntsmen the whips and old Sir William were hard at work as also were some few others who persistently followed every chance of the game From that till three there were two or three flashes in the pan and false reports as to foxes which had gone away which first set men galloping and then made them very angry After three men began to say naughty things to abuse Cranby Wood to wish violently that they had remained at home or gone elsewhere and to speak irreverently of their ancient master It s the cussidest place in all creation said Maxwell I often said I d not come here any more and now I say it again And yet you ll be here the next meet said Grindley who had sneaked back to his old companions in weariness of spirit Grindems you know a sight too much said Maxwell you do indeed An ordinary fellow has no chance with you Grindley was again going to catch it but was on this time saved by the appearance of the huntsman who came galloping up one of the rides with a lot of the hounds at his heels He isn t away Tom surely said Maxwell He s out of the wood somewheres said Tom and off they all went Vavasor changed his horse getting on to the brown one and giving up his chestnut mare to Bat Smithers who suggested that he might as well go home to Roebury now Vavasor gave him no answer but trotting on to the point where the rides met stopped a moment and listened carefully Then he took a path diverging away from that by which the huntsmen and the crowd of horsemen had gone and made the best of his way through the wood At the end of this he came upon Sir William who with no one near him but his servant was standing in the pathway of a little hunting gate Hold hard said Sir William The hounds are not out of the wood yet Is the fox away sir What s the good of that if we can t get the hounds out Yes he s away He passed out where I m standing And then he began to blow his horn lustily and by degrees other men and a few hounds came down the ride Then Tom with his horse almost blown made his appearance outside the wood and soon there came a rush of men nearly on the top of one another pushing on not knowing whither but keenly alive to the fact that the fox had at last consented to move his quarters Tom touched his hat and looked at his master inquiringly He s gone for Claydon s said the master Try them up that hedgerow Tom did try them up the hedgerow and in half a minute the hounds came upon the scent Then you might see men settling their hats on their heads and feeling their feet in the stirrups The moment for which they had so long waited had come and yet there were many who would now have preferred that the fox should be headed back into cover Some had but little confidence in their half blown horses with many the waiting though so abused and anathematized was in truth more to their taste than the run itself with others the excitement had gone by and a gallop over a field or two was necessary before it would be restored With most men at such a moment there is a little nervousness some fear of making a bad start a dread lest others should have more of the success of the hunt than falls to them But there was a great rush and a mighty bustle as the hounds made out their game and Sir William felt himself called upon to use the rough side of his tongue to more than one delinquent And then certain sly old stagers might be seen turning off to the left instead of following the course of the game as indicated by the hounds They were men who had felt the air as they came out and knew that the fox must soon run down wind whatever he might do for the first half mile or so men who knew also which was the shortest way to Claydon s by the road Ah the satisfaction that there is when these men are thrown out and their dead knowledge proved to be of no avail If a fox will only run straight heading from the cover on his real line these very sagacious gentlemen seldom come to much honour and glory In the present instance the beast seemed determined to go straight enough for the hounds ran the scent along three or four hedgerows in a line He had managed to get for himself full ten minutes start and had been able to leave the cover and all his enemies well behind him before he bethought himself as to his best way to his purposed destination And here from field to field there were little hunting gates at which men crowded lustily poking and shoving each other s horses and hating each other with a bitterness of hatred which is I think known nowhere else No hunting man ever wants to jump if he can help it and the hedges near the gate were not alluring A few there were who made lines for themselves taking the next field to the right or scrambling through the corners of the fences while the rush was going on at the gates and among these was George Vavasor He never rode in a crowd always keeping himself somewhat away from men as well as hounds He would often be thrown out and then men would hear no more of him for that day On such occasions he did not show himself as other men do twenty minutes after the fox had been killed or run to ground but betook himself home by himself going through the byeways and lanes thus leaving no report of his failure to be spoken of by his compeers As long as the line of gates lasted the crowd continued as thick as ever and the best man was he whose horse could shove the hardest After passing some four or five fields in this way they came out upon a road and the scent holding strong the dogs crossed it without any demurring Then came doubt into the minds of men many of whom before they would venture away from their position on the lane narrowly watched the leading hounds to see whether there was indication of a turn to the one side or the other Sir William whose seventy odd years excused him turned sharp to the left knowing that he could make Claydon s that way and very many were the submissive horsemen who followed him a few took the road to the right having in their minds some little game of their own The hardest riders there had already crossed from the road into the country and were going well to the hounds ignorant some of them of the brook before them and others unheeding Foremost among these was Burgo Fitzgerald Burgo Fitzgerald whom no man had ever known to crane at a fence or to hug a road or to spare his own neck or his horse s And yet poor Burgo seldom finished well coming to repeated grief in this matter of his hunting as he did so constantly in other matters of his life But almost neck and neck with Burgo was Pollock the sporting literary gentleman Pollock had but two horses to his stud and was never known to give much money for them and he weighed without his boots fifteen stones No one ever knew how Pollock did it more especially as all the world declared that he was as ignorant of hunting as any tailor He could ride or when he couldn t ride he could tumble men said that of him and he would ride as long as the beast under him could go But few knew the sad misfortunes which poor Pollock sometimes encountered the muddy ditches in which he was left the despair with which he would stand by his unfortunate horse when the poor brute could no longer move across some deep ploughed field the miles that he would walk at night beside a tired animal as he made his way slowly back to Roebury Then came Tom the huntsman with Calder Jones close to him and Grindley intent on winning his sovereign Vavasor had also crossed the road somewhat to the left carrying with him one or two who knew that he was a safe man to follow Maxwell had been ignominiously turned by the hedge which together with its ditch formed a fence such as all men do not love at the beginning of a run He had turned from it acknowledging the cause By George said he that s too big for me yet awhile and there s no end of a river at the bottom So he had followed the master down the road All those whom we have named managed to get over the brook Pollock s horse barely contriving to get up his hind legs from the broken edge of the bank Some nags refused it and their riders thus lost all their chance of sport for that day Such is the lot of men who hunt A man pays five or six pounds for his day s amusement and it is ten to one that the occurrences of the day disgust rather than gratify him One or two got in and scrambled out on the other side but Tufto Pearlings the Manchester man from Friday Street stuck in the mud at the bottom and could not get his mare out till seven men had come with ropes to help him Where the devil is my fellow Pearlings asked of the countrymen but the countrymen could not tell him that his fellow with his second horse was riding the hunt with great satisfaction to himself George Vavasor found that his horse went with him uncommonly well taking his fences almost in the stride of his gallop and giving unmistakeable signs of good condition I wonder what it is that s amiss with him said George to himself resolving however that he would sell him that day if he got an opportunity Straight went the line of the fox up from the brook and Tom began to say that his master had been wrong about Claydon s Where are we now said Burgo as four or five of them dashed through the open gate of a farmyard This is Bulby s farm said Tom and we re going right away for Elmham Wood Elmham Wood be d said a stout farmer who had come as far as that with them You won t see Elmham Wood to day I suppose you know best said Tom and then they were through the yard across another road and down a steep ravine by the side of a little copse He s been through them firs any way said Tom To him Gaylass Then up they went the other side of the ravine and saw the body of the hounds almost a field before them at the top I say that took some of the wind out of a fellow said Pollock You mustn t mind about wind now said Burgo dashing on Wasn t the pace awful coming up to that farmhouse said Calder Jones looking round to see if Grindley was shaken off But Grindley with some six or seven others was still there And there also always in the next field to the left was George Vavasor He had spoken no word to any one since the hunt commenced nor had he wished to speak to any one He desired to sell his horse and he desired also to succeed in the run for other reasons than that though I think he would have found it difficult to define them Now they had open grass land for about a mile but with very heavy fences so that the hounds gained upon them a little and Pollock s weight began to tell The huntsman and Burgo were leading with some fortunate county gentleman whose good stars had brought him in upon them at the farmyard gate It is the injustice of such accidents as this that breaks the heart of a man who has honestly gone through all the heat and work of the struggle And the hounds had veered a little round to the left making after all for Claydon s Darned if the Squire warn t right said Tom Sir William though a baronet was familiarly called the Squire throughout the hunt We ain t going for Claydon s now asked Burgo Them s Claydon s beeches we sees over there said Tom Tain t often the Squire s wrong Here they came to a little double rail and a little quick set hedge A double rail is a nasty fence always if it has been made any way strong and one which a man with a wife and a family is justified in avoiding They mostly can be avoided having gates and this could have been avoided But Burgo never avoided anything and went over it beautifully The difficulty is to be discreet when the man before one has been indiscreet Tom went for the gate as did Pollock who knew that he could have no chance at the double rails But Calder Jones came to infinite grief striking the top bar of the second rail and going head foremost out of his saddle as though thrown by a catapult There we must leave him Grindley rejoicing greatly at this discomfiture made for the gate but the country gentleman with the fresh horse accomplished the rails and was soon alongside of Burgo I didn t see you at the start said Burgo And I didn t see you said the country gentleman so it s even Burgo did not see the thing in the same light but he said no more Grindley and Tom were soon after them Tom doing his utmost to shake off the attorney Pollock was coming on also but the pace had been too much for him and though the ground rode light his poor beast laboured and grunted sorely The hounds were still veering somewhat to the left and Burgo jumping over a small fence into the same field with them saw that there was a horseman ahead of him This was George Vavasor who was going well without any symptom of distress And now they were at Claydon s having run over some seven miles of ground in about thirty five minutes To those who do not know what hunting is this pace does not seem very extraordinary but it had been quite quick enough as was testified by the horses which had gone the distance Our party entered Claydon s Park at back through a gate in the park palings that was open on hunting days but a much more numerous lot was there almost as soon as them who had come in by the main entrance This lot was headed by Sir William and our friend Maxwell was with him A jolly thing so far said Burgo to Maxwell about the best we ve had this year I didn t see a yard of it said Maxwell I hadn t nerve to get off the first road and I haven t been off it ever since Maxwell was a man who never lied about his hunting or had the slightest shame in riding roads Who s been with you said he There ve been Tom and I and Calder Jones was there for a while I think he killed himself somewhere And there was Pollock and your friend Grindley and a chap whose name I don t know who dropped out of heaven about half way in the run and there was another man whose back I saw just now there he is by heavens it s Vavasor I didn t know he was here They hung about the Claydon covers for ten minutes and then their fox went off again their fox or another as to which there was a great discussion afterwards but he who would have suggested the idea of a new fox to Sir William would have been a bold man A fox however went off turning still to the left from Claydon s towards Roebury Those ten minutes had brought up some fifty men but it did not bring up Calder Jones nor Tufto Pearlings nor some half dozen others who had already come to serious misfortune but Grindley was there very triumphant in his own success and already talking of Jones s sovereign And Pollock was there also thankful for the ten minutes law and trusting that wind might be given to his horse to finish the run triumphantly But the pace on leaving Claydon s was better than ever This may have come from the fact that the scent was keener as they got out so close upon their game But I think they must have changed their fox Maxwell who saw him go swore that he was fresh and clean Burgo said that he knew it to be the same fox but gave no reason Same fox in course it was why shouldn t it be the same said Tom The country gentleman who had dropped from heaven was quite sure that they had changed and so were most of those who had ridden the road Pollock confined himself to hoping that he might soon be killed and that thus his triumph for the day might be assured On they went and the pace soon became too good for the poor author His horse at last refused a little hedge and there was not another trot to be got out of him That night Pollock turned up at Roebury about nine o clock very hungry and it was known that his animal was alive but the poor horse ate not a grain of oats that night nor on the next morning Vavasor had again taken a line to himself on this occasion a little to the right of the meet but Maxwell followed him and rode close with him to the end Burgo for a while still led the body of the field incurring at first much condemnation from Sir William nominally for hurrying on among the hounds but in truth because he got before Sir William himself During this latter part of the run Sir William stuck to the hounds in spite of his seventy odd years Going down into Marham Bottom some four or five were left behind for they feared the soft ground near the river and did not know the pass through it But Sir William knew it and those who remained close to him got over that trouble Burgo who would still lead nearly foundered in the bog but he was light and his horse pulled him through leaving a fore shoe in the mud After that Burgo was contented to give Sir William the lead Then they came up by Marham Pits to Cleshey Small Wood which they passed without hanging there a minute and over the grass lands of Cleshey Farm Here Vavasor and Maxwell joined the others having gained some three hundred yards in distance by their course but having been forced to jump the Marham Stream which Sir William had forded The pace now was as good as the horses could make it and perhaps something better as regarded some of them Sir William s servant had been with him and he had got his second horse at Claydon s Maxwell had been equally fortunate Tom s second horse had not come up and his beast was in great distress Grindley had remained behind at Marham Bottom being contented perhaps with having beaten Calder Jones from whom by the by I may here declare that he never got his sovereign Burgo Vavasor and the country gentleman still held on but it was devoutly desired by all of them that the fox might soon come to the end of his tether Ah that intense longing that the fox may fail when the failings of the horse begin to make themselves known and the consciousness comes on that all that one has done will go for nothing unless the thing can be brought to a close in a field or two So far you have triumphed leaving scores of men behind but of what good is all that if you also are to be left behind at the last It was manifest now to all who knew the country that the fox was making for Thornden Deer Park but Thornden Deer Park was still two miles ahead of them and the hounds were so near to their game that the poor beast could hardly hope to live till he got there He had tried a well known drain near Cleshey Farm House but it had been inhospitably nay cruelly closed against him Soon after that he threw himself down in a ditch and the eager hounds overran him giving him a moment s law and giving also a moment s law to horses that wanted it as badly I m about done for said Burgo to Maxwell Luckily for you said Maxwell the fox is much in the same way But the fox had still more power left in him than poor Burgo Fitzgerald s horse He gained a minute s check and then he started again being viewed away by Sir William himself The country gentleman of whom mention has been made also viewed him and holloa d as he did so Yoicks tally gone away The unfortunate man What the d are you roaring at said Sir William Do you suppose I don t know where the fox is Whereupon the country gentleman retreated and became less conspicuous than he had been Away they went again off Cleshey and into Thornden parish on the land of Sorrel Farm a spot well to be remembered by one or two ever afterwards Here Sir William made for a gate which took him a little out of the line but Maxwell and Burgo Fitzgerald followed by Vavasor went straight ahead There was a huge ditch and boundary bank there which Sir William had known and had avoided Maxwell whose pluck had returned to him at last took it well His horse was comparatively fresh and made nothing of it Then came poor Burgo Oh Burgo hadst thou not have been a very child thou shouldst have known that now at this time of the day after all that thy gallant horse had done for thee it was impossible to thee or him But when did Burgo Fitzgerald know anything He rode at the bank as though it had been the first fence of the day striking his poor beast with his spurs as though muscle strength and new power could be imparted by their rowels The animal rose at the bank and in some way got upon it scrambling as he struck it with his chest and then fell headlong into the ditch at the other side a confused mass of head limbs and body His career was at an end and he had broken his heart Poor noble beast noble in vain To his very last gasp he had done his best and had deserved that he should have been in better hands His master s ignorance had killed him There are men who never know how little a horse can do or how much There was to some extent a gap in the fence when Maxwell had first ridden it and Burgo had followed him a gap or break in the hedge at the top indicating plainly the place at which a horse could best get over To this spot Vavasor followed and was on the bank at Burgo s heels before he knew what had happened But the man had got away and only the horse lay there in the ditch Are you hurt said Vavasor can I do anything But he did not stop If you can find a chap just send him to me said Burgo in a melancholy tone Then he sat down with his feet in the ditch and looked at the carcase of his horse There was no more need of jumping that day The way was open into the next field a turnip field and there amidst the crisp breaking turnip tops with the breath of his enemies hot upon him with their sharp teeth at his entrails biting at them impotently in the agonies of his death struggle poor Reynard finished his career Maxwell was certainly the first there but Sir William and George Vavasor were close upon him That taking of brushes of which we used to hear is a little out of fashion but if such honour were due to any one it was due to Vavasor for he and he only had ridden the hunt throughout But he claimed no honour and none was specially given to him He and Maxwell rode homewards together having sent assistance to poor Burgo Fitzgerald and as they went along the road saying but little to each other Maxwell in a very indifferent voice asked him a question What do you want for that horse Vavasor A hundred and fifty said Vavasor He s mine said Maxwell So the brown horse was sold for about half his value because he had brought with him a bad character CHAPTER XVIII Alice Vavasor s Great Relations Burgo Fitzgerald of whose hunting experiences something has been told in the last chapter was a young man born in the purple of the English aristocracy He was related to half the dukes in the kingdom and had three countesses for his aunts When he came of age he was master of a sufficient fortune to make it quite out of the question that he should be asked to earn his bread and though that and other windfalls that had come to him had long since been spent no one had ever made to him so ridiculous a proposition as that He was now thirty and for some years past had been known to be much worse than penniless but still he lived on in the same circles still slept softly and drank of the best and went about with his valet and his groom and his horses and fared sumptuously every day Some people said the countesses did it for him and some said that it was the dukes while others again declared that the Jews were his most generous friends At any rate he still seemed to live as he had always lived setting tradesmen at defiance and laughing to scorn all the rules which regulate the lives of other men About eighteen months before the time of which I am now speaking a great chance had come in this young man s way and he had almost succeeded in making himself one of the richest men in England There had been then a great heiress in the land on whom the properties of half a dozen ancient families had concentrated and Burgo who in spite of his iniquities still kept his position in the drawing rooms of the great had almost succeeded in obtaining the hand and the wealth as people still said that he had obtained the heart of the Lady Glencora M Cluskie But sundry mighty magnates driven almost to despair at the prospect of such a sacrifice had sagaciously put their heads together and the result had been that the Lady Glencora had heard reason She had listened with many haughty tossings indeed of her proud little head with many throbbings of her passionate young heart but in the end she listened and heard reason She saw Burgo for the last time and told him that she was the promised bride of Plantagenet Palliser nephew and heir of the Duke of Omnium He had borne it like a man never having groaned openly or quivered once before any comrade at the name of the Lady Glencora She had married mister Palliser at saint George s Square and on the morning of the marriage he had hung about his club door in Pall Mall listening to the bells and saying a word or two about the wedding with admirable courage It had been for him a great chance and he had lost it Who can say too that his only regret was for the money He had spoken once of it to a married sister of his in whose house he had first met Lady Glencora I shall never marry now that is all he said and then he went about living his old reckless life with the same recklessness as ever He was one of those young men with dark hair and blue eyes who wear no beard and are certainly among the handsomest of all God s creatures No more handsome man than Burgo Fitzgerald lived in his days and this merit at any rate was his that he thought nothing of his own beauty But he lived ever without conscience without purpose with no idea that it behoved him as a man to do anything but eat and drink or ride well to hounds till some poor brute much nobler than himself perished beneath him He chiefly concerns our story at this present time because the Lady Glencora who had loved him and would have married him had not those sagacious heads prevented it was a cousin of Alice Vavasor s She was among those very great relations with whom Alice was connected by her mother s side being indeed so near to Lady Macleod that she was first cousin to that lady only once removed Lady Midlothian was aunt to the Lady Glencora and our Alice might have called cousins and not been forbidden with the old Lord of the Isles Lady Glencora s father who was dead however some time previous to that affair with Burgo and with the Marquis of Auld Reekie who was Lady Glencora s uncle and had been her guardian But Alice had kept herself aloof from her grand relations on her mother s side choosing rather to hold herself as belonging to those who were her father s kindred With Lady Glencora however she had for a short time for some week or ten days been on terms of almost affectionate intimacy It had been then when the wayward heiress with the bright waving locks had been most strongly minded to give herself and her wealth to Burgo Fitzgerald Burgo had had money dealings with George Vavasor and knew him knew him intimately and had learned the fact of his cousinship between the heiress and his friend s cousin Whereupon in the agony of those weeks in which the sagacious heads were resisting her love Lady Glencora came to her cousin in Queen Anne Street and told Alice all that tale Was Alice she asked afraid of the marquises and the countesses or of all the rank and all the money which they boasted Alice answered that she was not at all afraid of them Then would she permit Lady Glencora and Burgo to see each other in the drawing room at Queen Anne Street just once Just once so that they might arrange that little plan of an elopement But Alice could not do that for her newly found cousin She endeavoured to explain that it was not the dignity of the sagacious heads which stood in her way but her woman s feeling of what was right and wrong in such a matter Why should I not marry him said Lady Glencora with her eyes flashing He is my equal Alice explained that she had no word to say against such a marriage She counselled her cousin to be true to her love if her love was in itself true But she an unmarried woman who had hitherto not known her cousin might not give such help as that If you will not help me I am helpless said the Lady Glencora and then she kneeled at Alice s knees and threw her wavy locks abroad on Alice s lap How shall I bribe you said Lady Glencora Next to him I will love you better than all the world But Alice though she kissed the fair forehead and owned that such reward would be worth much to her could not take any bribe for such a cause Then Lady Glencora had been angry with her calling her heartless and threatening her that she too might have sorrow of her own and want assistance Alice told nothing of her own tale how she had loved her cousin and had been forced to give him up but said what kind words she could and she of the waving hair and light blue eyes had been pacified Then she had come again had come daily while the sagacious heads were at work and Alice in her trouble had been a comfort to her But the sagacious heads were victorious as we know and Lady Glencora M Cluskie became Lady Glencora Palliser with all the propriety in the world instead of becoming wife to poor Burgo with all imaginable impropriety And then she wrote a letter to Alice very short and rather sad but still with a certain sweetness in it She had been counselled that it was not fitting for her to love as she had thought to love and she had resolved to give up her dream Her cousin Alice she knew would respect her secret She was going to become the wife of the best man she thought in all the world and it should be the one care of her life to make him happy She said not a word in all her letter of loving this newly found lord She was to be married at once Would Alice be one among the bevy of bridesmaids who were to grace the ceremony Alice wished her joy heartily heartily she said but had declined that office of bridesmaid She did not wish to undergo the cold looks of the Lady Julias and Lady Janes who all would know each other but none of whom would know her So she sent her cousin a little ring and asked her to keep it amidst all the wealthy tribute of marriage gifts which would be poured forth at her feet From that time to this present Alice had heard no more of Lady Glencora She had been married late in the preceding season and had gone away with mister Palliser spending her honeymoon amidst the softnesses of some Italian lake They had not returned to England till the time had come for them to encounter the magnificent Christmas festivities of mister Palliser s uncle the Duke On this occasion Gatherum Castle the vast palace which the Duke had built at a cost of nearly a quarter of a million was opened as it had never been opened before for the Duke s heir had married to the Duke s liking and the Duke was a man who could do such things handsomely when he was well pleased Then there had been a throng of bridal guests and a succession of bridal gaieties which had continued themselves even past the time at which mister Palliser was due at Westminster and mister Palliser was a legislator who served his country with the utmost assiduity So the London season commenced progressed and was consumed and still Alice heard nothing more of her friend and cousin Lady Glencora But this had troubled her not at all A chance circumstance the story of which she had told to no one had given her a short intimacy with this fair child of the gold mines but she had felt that they two could not live together in habits of much intimacy She had when thinking of the young bride only thought of that wild love episode in the girl s life It had been strange to her that she should in one week have listened to the most passionate protestations from her friend of love for one man and then have been told in the next that another man was to be her friend s husband But she reflected that her own career was much the same only with the interval of some longer time But her own career was not the same Glencora had married mister Palliser had married him without pausing to doubt but Alice had gone on doubting till at last she had resolved that she would not marry mister Grey She thought of this much in those days at Cheltenham and wondered often whether Glencora lived with her husband in the full happiness of conjugal love One morning about three days after mister Grey s visit there came to her two letters as to neither of which did she know the writer by the handwriting Lady Macleod had told her with some hesitation indeed for Lady Macleod was afraid of her but had told her nevertheless more than once that those noble relatives had heard of the treatment to which mister Grey was being subjected and had expressed their great sorrow if not dismay or almost anger Lady Macleod indeed had gone as far as she dared and might have gone further without any sacrifice of truth Lady Midlothian had said that it would be disgraceful to the family and Lady Glencora s aunt the Marchioness of Auld Reekie had demanded to be told what it was the girl wanted When the letters came Lady Macleod was not present and I am disposed to think that one of them had been written by concerted arrangement with her But if so she had not dared to watch the immediate effect of her own projectile This one was from Lady Midlothian Of the other Lady Macleod certainly knew nothing though it also had sprung out of the discussions which had taken place as to Alice s sins in the Auld Reekie Midlothian set This other letter was from Lady Glencora Alice opened the two one without reading the other very slowly Lady Midlothian s was the first opened and then came a spot of anger on Alice s cheeks as she saw the signature and caught a word or two as she allowed her eye to glance down the page Then she opened the other which was shorter and when she saw her cousin s signature Glencora Palliser she read that letter first read it twice before she went back to the disagreeable task of perusing Lady Midlothian s lecture The reader shall have both the letters but that from the Countess shall have precedence Castle Reekie N B Oct one hundred eighty six MY DEAR MISS VAVASOR I have not the pleasure of knowing you personally though I have heard of you very often from our dear mutual friend and relative Lady Macleod with whom I understand that you are at present on a visit Your grandmother by the mother s side Lady Flora Macleod and my mother the Countess of Leith were half sisters and though circumstances since that have prevented our seeing so much of each other as is desirable I have always remembered the connection and have ever regarded you as one in whose welfare I am bound by ties of blood to take a warm interest Since that what does she mean by since that said Alice to herself She has never set eyes on me at all Why does she talk of not having seen as much of me as is desirable I had learned with great gratification that you were going to be married to a most worthy gentleman mister John Grey of Nethercoats in Cambridgeshire When I first heard this I made it my business to institute some inquiries and I was heartily glad to find that your choice had done you so much credit If the reader has read Alice s character as I have meant it should be read it will thoroughly be understood that this was wormwood to her I was informed that mister Grey is in every respect a gentleman that he is a man of most excellent habits and one to whom any young woman could commit her future happiness with security that his means are very good for his position and that there was no possible objection to such a marriage All this gave great satisfaction to me in which I was joined by the Marchioness of Auld Reekie who is connected with you almost as nearly as I am and who I can assure you feels a considerable interest in your welfare I am staying with her now and in all that I say she agrees with me You may feel then how dreadfully we were dismayed when we were told by dear Lady Macleod that you had told mister Grey that you intended to change your mind My dear Miss Vavasor can this be true There are things in which a young lady has no right to change her mind after it has been once made up and certainly when a young lady has accepted a gentleman that is one of them He cannot legally make you become his wife but he has a right to claim you before God and man Have you considered that he has probably furnished his house in consequence of his intended marriage and perhaps in compliance with your own especial wishes I think that Lady Macleod must have told the Countess something that she had heard about the garden Have you reflected that he has of course told all his friends Have you any reason to give I am told none Nothing should ever be done without a reason much less such a thing as this in which your own interests and I may say respectability are involved I hope you will think of this before you persist in destroying your own happiness and perhaps that of a very worthy man I had heard some years ago when you were much younger that you had become imprudently attached in another direction with a gentleman with none of those qualities to recommend him which speak so highly for mister Grey It would grieve me very much as it would also the Marchioness who in this matter thinks exactly as I do if I were led to suppose that your rejection of mister Grey had been caused by any renewal of that project Nothing my dear Miss Vavasor could be more unfortunate and I might almost add a stronger word I have been advised that a line from me as representing your poor mother s family especially as I have at the present moment the opportunity of expressing Lady Auld Reekie s sentiments as well as my own might be of service I implore you my dear Miss Vavasor to remember what you owe to God and man and to carry out an engagement made by yourself that is in all respects comme il faut and which will give entire satisfaction to your friends and relatives MARGARET M MIDLOTHIAN I think that Lady Macleod had been wrong in supposing that this could do any good She should have known Alice better and should also have known the world better But her own reverence for her own noble relatives was so great that she could not understand even yet that all such feeling was wanting to her niece It was to her impossible that the expressed opinion of such an one as the Countess of Midlothian owning her relationship and solicitude and condescending at the same time to express friendship she could not I say understand that the voice of such an one so speaking should have no weight whatever But I think that she had been quite right in keeping out of Alice s way at the moment of the arrival of the letter Alice read it slowly and then replacing it in its envelope leaned back quietly in her chair with her eyes fixed upon the teapot on the table She had however the other letter on which to occupy her mind and thus relieve her from the effects of too deep an animosity against the Countess The Lady Glencora s letter was as follows Matching Priory Thursday DEAR COUSIN I have just come home from Scotland where they have been telling me something of your little troubles I had little troubles once too and you were so good to me Will you come to us here for a few weeks We shall be here till Christmas time when we go somewhere else I have told my husband that you are a great friend of mine as well as a cousin and that he must be good to you He is very quiet and works very hard at politics but I think you will like him Do come There will be a good many people here so that you will not find it dull If you will name the day we will send the carriage for you at Matching Station and I dare say I can manage to come myself Yours affectionately G PALLISER P S I know what will be in your mind You will say why did not she come to me in London She knew the way to Queen Anne Street well enough Dear Alice don t say that Believe me I had much to do and think of in London And if I was wrong yet you will forgive me mister Palliser says I am to give you his love as being a cousin and say that you must come This letter was certainly better than the other but Alice on reading it came to a resolve that she would not accept the invitation In the first place even that allusion to her little troubles jarred upon her feelings and then she thought that her rejection of mister Grey could be no special reason why she should go to Matching Priory Was it not very possible that she had been invited that she might meet Lady Midlothian there and encounter all the strength of a personal battery from the Countess Lady Glencora s letter she would of course answer but to Lady Midlothian she would not condescend to make any reply whatever About eleven o clock Lady Macleod came down to her For half an hour or so Alice said nothing nor did Lady Macleod ask any question She looked inquisitively at Alice eyeing the letter which was lying by the side of her niece s workbasket but she said no word about mister Grey or the Countess At last Alice spoke Aunt she said I have had a letter this morning from your friend Lady Midlothian She is my cousin Alice and yours as much as mine Your cousin then aunt But it is of more moment that she is your friend She certainly is not mine nor can her cousinship afford any justification for her interfering in my affairs Alice from her position Her position can be nothing to me aunt I will not submit to it There is her letter which you can read if you please After that you may burn it I need hardly say that I shall not answer it And what am I to say to her Alice Nothing from me aunt from yourself whatever you please of course Then there was silence between them for a few minutes And I have had another letter from Lady Glencora who married mister Palliser and whom I knew in London last spring And has that offended you too No there is no offence in that She asks me to go and see her at Matching Priory her husband s house but I shall not go But at last Alice agreed to pay this visit and it may be as well to explain here how she was brought to do so She wrote to Lady Glencora declining and explaining frankly that she did decline because she thought it probable that she might there meet Lady Midlothian Lady Midlothian she said had interfered very unwarrantably in her affairs and she did not wish to make her acquaintance To this Lady Glencora replied post haste that she had intended no such horrid treachery as that for Alice that neither would Lady Midlothian be there nor any of that set by which Alice knew that Lady Glencora referred specially to her aunt the Marchioness that no one would be at Matching who could torment Alice either with right or without it except so far as I myself may do so Lady Glencora said and then she named an early day in November at which she would herself undertake to meet Alice at the Matching Station On receipt of this letter Alice after two days doubt accepted the invitation CHAPTER XIX Tribute from Oileymead Kate Vavasor in writing to her cousin Alice felt some little difficulty in excusing herself for remaining in Norfolk with missus Greenow She had laughed at missus Greenow before she went to Yarmouth and had laughed at herself for going there And in all her letters since she had spoken of her aunt as a silly vain worldly woman weeping crocodile tears for an old husband whose death had released her from the tedium of his company and spreading lures to catch new lovers But yet she agreed to stay with her aunt and remain with her in lodgings at Norwich for a month But missus Greenow had about her something more than Kate had acknowledged when she first attempted to read her aunt s character She was clever and in her own way persuasive She was very generous and possessed a certain power of making herself pleasant to those around her In asking Kate to stay with her she had so asked as to make it appear that Kate was to confer the favour She had told her niece that she was all alone in the world I have money she had said with more appearance of true feeling than Kate had observed before I have money but I have nothing else in the world I have no home Why should I not remain here in Norfolk where I know a few people If you ll say that you ll go anywhere else with me I ll go to any place you ll name Kate had believed this to be hardly true She had felt sure that her aunt wished to remain in the neighbourhood of her seaside admirers but nevertheless she had yielded and at the end of October the two ladies with Jeannette settled themselves in comfortable lodgings within the precincts of the Close at Norwich mister Greenow at this time had been dead very nearly six months but his widow made some mistakes in her dates and appeared to think that the interval had been longer On the day of their arrival at Norwich it was evident that this error had confirmed itself in her mind Only think she said as she unpacked a little miniature of the departed one and sat with it for a moment in her hands as she pressed her handkerchief to her eyes only think that it is barely nine months since he was with me Six you mean aunt said Kate unadvisedly Only nine months repeated missus Greenow as though she had not heard her niece Only nine months After that Kate attempted to correct no more such errors It happened in May Miss Jeannette said afterwards to Miss Vavasor and that as we reckons it will be just a twelvemonth come Christmas But Kate paid no attention to this And Jeannette was very ungrateful and certainly should have indulged herself in no such sarcasms When missus Greenow made a slight change in her mourning which she did on her arrival at Norwich using a little lace among her crapes Jeannette reaped a rich harvest in gifts of clothes missus Greenow knew well enough that she expected more from a servant than mere service that she wanted loyalty discretion and perhaps sometimes a little secrecy and as she paid for these things she should have had them Kate undertook to stay a month with her aunt at Norwich and missus Greenow undertook that mister Cheesacre should declare himself as Kate s lover before the expiration of the month It was in vain that Kate protested that she wanted no such lover and that she would certainly reject him if he came That s all very well my dear Aunt Greenow would say A girl must settle herself some day you know and you d have it all your own way at Oileymead But the offer certainly showed much generosity on the part of Aunt Greenow inasmuch as mister Cheesacre s attentions were apparently paid to herself rather than to her niece mister Cheesacre was very attentive He had taken the lodgings in the Close and had sent over fowls and cream from Oileymead and had called on the morning after their arrival but in all his attentions he distinguished the aunt more particularly than the niece I am all for mister Cheesacre Miss said Jeannette once The Captain is perhaps the nicerer looking gentleman and he ain t so podgy like but what s good looks if a gentleman hasn t got nothing I can t abide anything that s poor neither can t Missus From which it was evident that Jeannette gave Miss Vavasor no credit in having mister Cheesacre in her train Captain Bellfield was also at Norwich having obtained some quasi military employment there in the matter of drilling volunteers Certain capacities in that line it may be supposed that he possessed and as his friend Cheesacre said of him he was going to earn an honest penny once in his life The Captain and mister Cheesacre had made up any little differences that had existed between them at Yarmouth and were close allies again when they left that place Some little compact on matters of business must have been arranged between them for the Captain was in funds again He was in funds again through the liberality of his friend and no payment of former loans had been made nor had there been any speech of such mister Cheesacre had drawn his purse strings liberally and had declared that if all went well the hospitality of Oileymead should not be wanting during the winter Captain Bellfield had nodded his head and declared that all should go well You won t see much of the Captain I suppose said mister Cheesacre to missus Greenow on the morning of the day after her arrival at Norwich He had come across the whole way from Oileymead to ask her if she found herself comfortable and perhaps with an eye to the Norwich markets at the same time He now wore a pair of black riding boots over his trousers and a round topped hat and looked much more at home than he had done by the seaside Not much I dare say said the widow He tells me that he must be on duty ten or twelve hours a day Poor fellow It s a deuced good thing for him and he ought to be very much obliged to me for putting him in the way of getting it But he told me to tell you that if he didn t call you were not to be angry with him Oh no I shall remember of course You see if he don t work now he must come to grief He hasn t got a shilling that he can call his own Hasn t he really Not a shilling missus Greenow and then he s awfully in debt He isn t a bad fellow you know only there s no trusting him for anything Then after a few further inquiries that were almost tender and a promise of further supplies from the dairy mister Cheesacre took his leave almost forgetting to ask after Miss Vavasor But as he left the house he had a word to say to Jeannette He hasn t been here has he Jenny We haven t seen a sight of him yet sir and I have thought it a little odd Then mister Cheesacre gave the girl half a crown and went his way Jeannette I think must have forgotten that the Captain had looked in after leaving his military duties on the preceding evening The Captain s ten or twelve hours of daily work was performed no doubt at irregular intervals some days late and some days early for he might be seen about Norwich almost at all times during the early part of that November and he might be very often seen going into the Close In Norwich there are two weekly market days but on those days the Captain was no doubt kept more entirely to his military employment for at such times he never was seen near the Close Now mister Cheesacre s visits to the town were generally made on market days and so it happened that they did not meet On such occasions mister Cheesacre always was driven to missus Greenow s door in a cab for he would come into town by railway and he would deposit a basket bearing the rich produce of his dairy It was in vain that missus Greenow protested against these gifts for she did protest and declared that if they were continued they would be sent back They were however continued and missus Greenow was at her wits end about them Cheesacre would not come up with them but leaving them would go about his business and would return to see the ladies On such occasions he would be very particular in getting his basket from Jeannette As he did so he would generally ask some question about the Captain and Jeannette would give him answers confidentially so that there was a strong friendship between these two What am I to do about it said missus Greenow as Kate came into the sitting room one morning and saw on the table a small hamper lined with a clean cloth It s as much as Jeannette has been able to carry So it is ma am quite and I m strong in the arm too ma am What am I to do Kate He is such a good creature And he do admire you both so much said Jeannette Of course I don t want to offend him for many reasons said the aunt looking knowingly at her niece I don t know anything about your reasons aunt but if I were you I should leave the basket just as it is till he comes in the afternoon Would you mind seeing him yourself Kate and explaining to him that it won t do to get on in this way Perhaps you wouldn t mind telling him that if he ll promise not to bring any more you won t object to take this one Indeed aunt I can t do that They re not brought to me Oh Kate Nonsense aunt I won t have you say so before Jeannette too I think it s for both ma am I do indeed And there certainly ain t any cream to be bought like it in Norwich nor yet eggs I wonder what there is in the basket And the widow lifted up the corner of the cloth I declare if there isn t a turkey poult already My said Jeannette A turkey poult Why that s worth ten and sixpence in the market if it s worth a penny It s out of the question that I should take upon myself to say anything to him about it said Kate Upon my word I don t see why you shouldn t as well as I said missus Greenow I ll tell you what ma am said Jeannette let me just ask him who they re for he ll tell me anything Don t do anything of the kind Jeannette said Kate Of course aunt they re brought for you There s no doubt about that A gentleman doesn t bring cream and turkeys to I ve never heard of such a thing I don t see why a gentleman shouldn t bring cream and turkeys to you just as well as to me Indeed he told me once as much himself Then if they re for me I ll leave them down outside the front door and he may find his provisions there And Kate proceeded to lift the basket off the table Leave it alone Kate said missus Greenow with a voice that was rather solemn and which had too something of sadness in its tone Leave it alone I ll see mister Cheesacre myself And I do hope you won t mention my name It s the most absurd thing in the world The man never spoke two dozen words to me in his life He speaks to me though said missus Greenow I dare say he does said Kate And about you too my dear He doesn t come here with those big flowers in his button hole for nothing said Jeannette not if I knows what a gentleman means Of course he doesn t said missus Greenow If you don t object aunt said Kate I will write to grandpapa and tell him that I will return home at once What because of mister Cheesacre said missus Greenow I don t think you ll be so silly as that my dear On the present occasion missus Greenow undertook that she would see the generous gentleman and endeavour to stop the supplies from his farmyard It was well understood that he would call about four o clock when his business in the town would be over and that he would bring with him a little boy who would carry away the basket At that hour Kate of course was absent and the widow received mister Cheesacre alone The basket and cloth were there in the sitting room and on the table were laid out the rich things which it had contained the turkey poult first on a dish provided in the lodging house then a dozen fresh eggs in a soup plate then the cream in a little tin can which for the last fortnight had passed regularly between Oileymead and the house in the Close and as to which mister Cheesacre was very pointed in his inquiries with Jeannette Then behind the cream there were two or three heads of broccoli and a stick of celery as thick as a man s wrist Altogether the tribute was a very comfortable assistance to the housekeeping of a lady living in a small way in lodgings mister Cheesacre when he saw the array on the long sofa table knew that he was to prepare himself for some resistance but that resistance would give him he thought an opportunity of saying a few words that he was desirous of speaking and he did not altogether regret it I just called in he said to see how you were We are not likely to starve said missus Greenow pointing to the delicacies from Oileymead Just a few trifles that my old woman asked me to bring in said Cheesacre She insisted on putting them up But your old woman is by far too magnificent said missus Greenow She really frightens Kate and me out of our wits mister Cheesacre had no wish that Miss Vavasor s name should be brought into play upon the occasion Dear missus Greenow said he there is no cause for you to be alarmed I can assure you Mere trifles light as air you know I don t think anything of such things as these But I and Kate think a great deal of them a very great deal I can assure you Do you know we had a long debate this morning whether or no we would return them to Oileymead Return them missus Greenow Yes indeed what are women situated as we are to do under such circumstances When gentlemen will be too liberal their liberality must be repressed And have I been too liberal missus Greenow What is a young turkey and a stick of celery when a man is willing to give everything that he has in the world You ve got a great deal more in the world mister Cheesacre than you d like to part with But we won t talk of that now When shall we talk of it If you really have anything to say you had by far better speak to Kate herself missus Greenow you mistake me Indeed you mistake me Just at this moment as he was drawing close to the widow she heard or fancied that she heard Jeannette s step and going to the sitting room door called to her maid Jeannette did not hear her but the bell was rung and then Jeannette came You may take these things down Jeannette she said mister Cheesacre has promised that no more shall come But I haven t promised said mister Cheesacre You will oblige me and Kate I know and Jeannette tell Miss Vavasor that I am ready to walk with her Then mister Cheesacre knew that he could not say those few words on that occasion and as the hour of his train was near he took his departure and went out of the Close followed by the little boy carrying the basket the cloth and the tin can CHAPTER XX Which Shall It Be The next day was Sunday and it was well known at the lodging house in the Close that mister Cheesacre would not be seen there then missus Greenow had specially warned him that she was not fond of Sunday visitors fearing that otherwise he might find it convenient to give them too much of his society on that idle day In the morning the aunt and niece both went to the Cathedral and then at three o clock they dined But on this occasion they did not dine alone Charlie Fairstairs who with her family had come home from Yarmouth had been asked to join them and in order that Charlie might not feel it dull missus Greenow had with her usual good nature invited Captain Bellfield A very nice little dinner they had The captain carved the turkey giving due honour to mister Cheesacre as he did so and when he nibbled his celery with his cheese he was prettily jocose about the richness of the farmyard at Oileymead He is the most generous man I ever met said missus Greenow So he is said Captain Bellfield and we ll drink his health Poor old Cheesy It s a great pity he shouldn t get himself a wife I don t know any man more calculated to make a young woman happy said missus Greenow No indeed said Miss Fairstairs I m told that his house and all about it is quite beautiful Especially the straw yard and the horse pond said the Captain And then they drank the health of their absent friend It had been arranged that the ladies should go to church in the evening and it was thought that Captain Bellfield would perhaps accompany them but when the time for starting came Kate and Charlie were ready but the widow was not and she remained in order as she afterwards explained to Kate that Captain Bellfield might not seem to be turned out of the house He had made no offer churchwards and Poor man as missus Greenow said in her little explanation if I hadn t let him stay there he would have had no resting place for the sole of his foot but some horrid barrack room Therefore the Captain was allowed to find a resting place in missus Greenow s drawing room but on the return of the young ladies from church he was not there and the widow was alone looking back she said to things that were gone that were gone But come dears I am not going to make you melancholy So they had tea and mister Cheesacre s cream was used with liberality Captain Bellfield had not allowed the opportunity to slip idly from his hands In the first quarter of an hour after the younger ladies had gone he said little or nothing but sat with a wine glass before him which once or twice he filled from the decanter I m afraid the wine is not very good said missus Greenow But one can t get good wine in lodgings I m not thinking very much about it missus Greenow that s the truth said the Captain I daresay the wine is very good of its kind Then there was another period of silence between them I suppose you find it rather dull living in lodgings don t you asked the Captain I don t know quite what you mean by dull Captain Bellfield but a woman circumstanced as I am can t find her life very gay It s not a full twelvemonth yet since I lost all that made life desirable and sometimes I wonder at myself for holding up as well as I do It s wicked to give way to grief too much missus Greenow That s what my dear Kate always says to me and I m sure I do my best to overcome it Upon this soft tears trickled down her cheek showing in their course that she at any rate used no paint in producing that freshness of colour which was one of her great charms Then she pressed her handkerchief to her eyes and removing it smiled faintly on the Captain I didn t intend to treat you to such a scene as this Captain Bellfield There is nothing on earth missus Greenow I desire so much as permission to dry those tears Time alone can do that Captain Bellfield time alone But cannot time be aided by love and friendship and affection By friendship yes What would life be worth without the solace of friendship And how much better is the warm glow of love Captain Bellfield as he asked this question deliberately got up and moved his chair over to the widow s side But the widow as deliberately changed her position to the corner of a sofa The Captain did not at once follow her nor did he in any way show that he was aware that she had fled from him How much better is the warm glow of love he said again contenting himself with looking into her face with all his eyes He had hoped that he would have been able to press her hand by this time The warm glow of love Captain Bellfield if you have ever felt it If I have ever felt it Do I not feel it now missus Greenow There can be no longer any mask kept upon my feelings I never could restrain the yearnings of my heart when they have been strong Have they often been strong Captain Bellfield Yes often in various scenes of life on the field of battle I did not know that you had seen active service What not on the plains of Zuzuland when with fifty picked men I kept five hundred Caffres at bay for seven weeks never knew the comfort of a bed or a pillow to my head for seven long weeks Not for seven weeks said missus Greenow No Did I not see active service at Essiquebo on the burning coast of Guiana when all the wild Africans from the woods rose up to destroy the colony or again at the mouth of the Kitchyhomy River when I made good the capture of a slaver by my own hand and my own sword I really hadn t heard said missus Greenow Ah I understand I know Cheesy is the best fellow in the world in some respects but he cannot bring himself to speak well of a fellow behind his back I know who has belittled me Who was the first to storm the heights of Inkerman demanded the Captain thinking in the heat of the moment that he might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb But when you spoke of yearnings I thought you meant yearnings of a softer kind So I did So I did I don t know why I have been led away to speak of deeds that are very seldom mentioned at any rate by myself But I cannot bear that a slanderous backbiting tongue should make you think that I have seen no service I have served her Majesty in the four quarters of the globe missus Greenow and now I am ready to serve you in any way in which you will allow me to make my service acceptable Whereupon he took one stride over to the sofa and went down upon his knees before her But Captain Bellfield I don t want any services Pray get up now the girl will come in I care nothing for any girl I am planted here till some answer shall have been made to me till some word shall have been said that may give me a little hope Then he attempted to get hold of her hand but she put them behind her back and shook her head Arabella he said will you not speak a word to me Not a word Captain Bellfield till you get up and I won t have you call me Arabella I am the widow of Samuel Greenow than whom no man was more respected where he was known and it is not fitting that I should be addressed in that way But I want you to become my wife and then Ah then indeed But that then isn t likely to come Get up Captain Bellfield or I ll push you over and then ring the bell A man never looks so much like a fool as when he s kneeling down unless he s saying his prayers as you ought to be doing now Get up I tell you It s just half past seven and I told Jeannette to come to me then There was that in the widow s voice which made him get up and he rose slowly to his feet You ve pushed all the chairs about you stupid man she said Then in one minute she had restored the scattered furniture to their proper places and had rung the bell When Jeannette came she desired that tea might be ready by the time that the young ladies returned and asked Captain Bellfield if a cup should be set for him This he declined and bade her farewell while Jeannette was still in the room She shook hands with him without any sign of anger and even expressed a hope that they might see him again before long He s a very handsome man is the Captain said Jeannette as the hero of the Kitchyhomy River descended the stairs You shouldn t think about handsome men child said missus Greenow And I m sure I don t said Jeannette Not no more than anybody else but if a man is handsome ma am why it stands to reason that he is handsome I suppose Captain Bellfield has given you a kiss and a pair of gloves As for gloves and such like mister Cheesacre is much better for giving than the Captain as we all know don t we ma am But in regard to kisses they re presents as I never takes from anybody Let everybody pay his debts If the Captain ever gets a wife let him kiss her On the following Tuesday morning mister Cheesacre as usual called in the Close but he brought with him no basket He merely left a winter nosegay made of green leaves and laurestinus flowers and sent up a message to say that he should call at half past three and hoped that he might then be able to see missus Greenow on particular business That means you Kate said missus Greenow No it doesn t it doesn t mean me at all At any rate he won t see me I dare say it s me he wishes to see It seems to be the fashionable plan now for gentlemen to make offers by deputy If he says anything I can only refer him to you you know Yes you can you can tell him simply that I won t have him But he is no more thinking of me than Than he is of me you were going to say No aunt I wasn t going to say that at all Well we shall see If he does mean anything of course you can please yourself but I really think you might do worse But if I don t want to do at all Very well you must have your own way I can only tell you what I think At half past three o clock punctually mister Cheesacre came to the door and was shown up stairs He was told by Jeannette that Captain Bellfield had looked in on the Sunday afternoon but that Miss Fairstairs and Miss Vavasor had been there the whole time He had not got on his black boots nor yet had his round topped hat And as he did wear a new frock coat and had his left hand thrust into a kid glove Jeannette was quite sure that he intended business of some kind With new boots creaking loudly he walked up into the drawing room and there he found the widow alone Thanks for the flowers she said at once It was so good of you to bring something that we could accept As for that said he I don t see why you should scruple about a trifle of cream but I hope that any such feeling as that will be over before long To this the widow made no answer but she looked very sweetly on him as she bade him sit down He did sit down but first he put his hat and stick carefully away in one corner and then he pulled off his glove somewhat laboriously for his hand was warm He was clearly prepared for great things As he pushed up his hair with his hands there came from his locks an ambrosial perfume as of marrow oil and there was a fixed propriety of position of every hair of his whiskers which indicated very plainly that he had been at a hairdresser s shop since he left the market Nor do I believe that he had worn that coat when he came to the door earlier in the morning If I were to say that he had called at his tailor s also I do not think that I should be wrong How goes everything at Oileymead said missus Greenow seeing that her guest wanted some little assistance in leading off the conversation Pretty well missus Greenow pretty well Everything will go very well if I am successful in the object which I have on hand to day I m sure I hope you ll be successful in all your undertakings In all my business undertakings I am missus Greenow There isn t a shilling due on my land to e er a bank in Norwich and I haven t thrashed out a quarter of last year s corn yet which is more than many of them can say But there ain t many of them who don t have to pay rent and so perhaps I oughtn t to boast I know that Providence has been very good to you mister Cheesacre as regards worldly matters And I haven t left it all to Providence either Those who do generally go to the wall as far as I can see I m always at work late and early and I know when I get a profit out of a man s labour and when I don t as well as though it was my only chance of bread and cheese I always thought you understood farming business mister Cheesacre Yes I do I like a bit of fun well enough when the time for it comes as you saw at Yarmouth And I keep my three or four hunters as I think a country gentleman should and I shoot over my own ground But I always stick to my work There are men like Bellfield who won t work What do they come to They re always borrowing But he has fought his country s battles mister Cheesacre He fight I suppose he s been telling you some of his old stories He was ten years in the West Indies and all his fighting was with the mosquitoes But he was in the Crimea At Inkerman for instance He in the Crimea Well never mind But do you inquire before you believe that story But as I was saying missus Greenow you have seen my little place at Oileymead A charming house All you want is a mistress for it That s it that s just it All I want is a mistress for it And there s only one woman on earth that I would wish to see in that position Arabella Greenow will you be that woman As he made the offer he got up and stood before her placing his right hand upon his heart Illustration Arabella Greenow will you be that woman I mister Cheesacre she said Yes you Who else Since I saw you what other woman has been anything to me or indeed I may say before Since the first day I saw you I felt that there my happiness depended Oh mister Cheesacre I thought you were looking elsewhere No no no There never was such a mistake as that I have the highest regard and esteem for Miss Vavasor but really mister Cheesacre what am I to say to you What are you to say to me Say that you ll be mine Say that I shall be yours Say that all I have at Oileymead shall be yours Say that the open carriage for a pair of ponies to be driven by a lady which I have been looking at this morning shall be yours Yes indeed the sweetest thing you ever saw in your life just like one that the lady of the Lord Lieutenant drives about in always That s what you must say Come missus Greenow Ah mister Cheesacre you don t know what it is to have buried the pride of your youth hardly yet twelve months But you have buried him and there let there be an end of it Your sitting here all alone morning noon and night won t bring him back I m sorry for him I am indeed Poor Greenow But what more can I do I can do more mister Cheesacre I can mourn for him in solitude and in silence No no no What s the use of it breaking your heart for nothing and my heart too You never think of that And mister Cheesacre spoke in a tone that was full of reproach It cannot be mister Cheesacre Ah but it can be Come missus Greenow We understand each other well enough now surely Come dearest And he approached her as though to put his arm round her waist But at that moment there came a knock at the door and Jeannette entering the room told her mistress that Captain Bellfield was below and wanted to know whether he could see her for a minute on particular business Show Captain Bellfield up certainly said missus Greenow D Captain Bellfield said mister Cheesacre CHAPTER XXI Alice Is Taught to Grow Upwards Towards the Light Before the day came on which Alice was to go to Matching Priory she had often regretted that she had been induced to make the promise and yet she had as often resolved that there was no possible reason why she should not go to Matching Priory But she feared this commencement of a closer connection with her great relations She had told herself so often that she was quite separated from them that the slight accident of blood in no way tied her to them or them to her this lesson had been so thoroughly taught to her by the injudicious attempts of Lady Macleod to teach an opposite lesson that she did not like the idea of putting aside the effect of that teaching And perhaps she was a little afraid of the great folk whom she might probably meet at her cousin s house Lady Glencora herself she had liked and had loved too with that momentary love which certain circumstances of our life will sometimes produce a love which is strong while it lasts but which can be laid down when the need of it is passed She had liked and loved Lady Glencora and had in no degree been afraid of her during those strange visitings in Queen Anne Street but she was by no means sure that she should like Lady Glencora in the midst of her grandeur and surrounded by the pomp of her rank She would have no other friend or acquaintance in that house and feared that she might find herself desolate cold and wounded in her pride She had been tricked into the visit too or rather had tricked herself into it She had been sure that there had been a joint scheme between her cousin and Lady Midlothian and could not resist the temptation of repudiating it in her letter to Lady Glencora But there had been no such scheme she had wronged Lady Glencora and had therefore been unable to resist her second request But she felt unhappy fearing that she would be out of her element and more than once half made up her mind to excuse herself Her aunt had from the first thought well of her going believing that it might probably be the means of reconciling her to mister Grey Moreover it was a step altogether in the right direction Lady Glencora would if she lived become a Duchess and as she was decidedly Alice s cousin of course Alice should go to her house when invited It must be acknowledged that Lady Macleod was not selfish in her worship of rank She had played out her game in life and there was no probability that she would live to be called cousin by a Duchess of Omnium She bade Alice go to Matching Priory simply because she loved her niece and therefore wished her to live in the best and most eligible way within her reach I think you owe it as a duty to your family to go said Lady Macleod What further correspondence about her affairs had passed between Lady Macleod and Lady Midlothian Alice never knew She steadily refused all entreaty made that she would answer the Countess s letter and at last threatened her aunt that if the request were further urged she would answer it telling Lady Midlothian that she had been very impertinent I am becoming a very old woman Alice the poor lady said piteously and I suppose I had better not interfere any further Whatever I have said I have always meant to be for your good Then Alice got up and kissing her aunt tried to explain to her that she resented no interference from her and felt grateful for all that she both said and did but that she could not endure meddling from people whom she did not know and who thought themselves entitled to meddle by their rank And because they are cousins as well said Lady Macleod in a softly sad apologetic voice Alice left Cheltenham about the middle of November on her road to Matching Priory She was to sleep in London one night and go down to Matching in Yorkshire with her maid on the following day Her father undertook to meet her at the Great Western Station and to take her on the following morning to the Great Northern He said nothing in his letter about dining with her but when he met her muttered something about an engagement and taking her home graciously promised that he would breakfast with her on the following morning I m very glad you are going Alice he said when they were in the cab together Why papa Why because I think it s the proper thing to do You know I ve never said much to you about these people They re not connected with me and I know that they hate the name of Vavasor not but what the name is a deal older than any of theirs and the family too And therefore I don t understand why you think I m specially right If you were to say I was specially wrong I should be less surprised and of course I shouldn t go You should go by all means Rank and wealth are advantages let anybody say what they will to the contrary Why else does everybody want to get them But I shan t get them by going to Matching Priory You ll get part of their value Take them as a whole the nobility of England are pleasant acquaintances to have I haven t run after them very much myself though I married as I may say among them That very thing rather stood in my way than otherwise But you may be sure of this that men and women ought to grow like plants upwards Everybody should endeavour to stand as well as he can in the world and if I had a choice of acquaintance between a sugar baker and a peer I should prefer the peer unless indeed the sugar baker had something very strong on his side to offer I don t call that tuft hunting and it does not necessitate toadying It s simply growing up towards the light as the trees do Alice listened to her father s worldly wisdom with a smile but she did not attempt to answer him It was very seldom indeed that he took upon himself the labour of lecturing her or that he gave her even as much counsel as he had given now Well papa I hope I shall find myself growing towards the light she said as she got out of the cab Then he had not entered the house but had taken the cab on with him to his club On her table Alice found a note from her cousin George I hear you are going down to the Pallisers at Matching Priory to morrow and as I shall be glad to say one word to you before you go will you let me see you this evening say at nine G V She felt immediately that she could not help seeing him but she greatly regretted the necessity She wished that she had gone directly from Cheltenham to the North regardless even of those changes of wardrobe which her purposed visit required Then she set herself to considering How had George heard of her visit to the Priory and how had he learned the precise evening which she would pass in London Why should he be so intent on watching all her movements as it seemed that he was As to seeing him she had no alternative so she completed her arrangements for her journey before nine and then awaited him in the drawing room I m so glad you re going to Matching Priory were the first words he said He too might have taught her to grow towards the light if she had asked him for his reasons but this she did not do just then How did you learn that I was going she said I heard it from a friend of mine Well from Burgo Fitzgerald if you must know From mister Fitzgerald said Alice in profound astonishment How could mister Fitzgerald have heard of it That s more than I know Alice Not directly from Lady Glencora I should say That would be impossible Yes quite so no doubt I think she keeps up her intimacy with Burgo s sister and perhaps it got round to him in that way And did he tell you also that I was going to morrow He must have known all about it very accurately No then I asked Kate and Kate told me when you were going Yes I know Kate has been wrong hasn t she Kate was cautioned no doubt to say nothing about your comings and goings to so inconsiderable a person as myself But you must not be down upon Kate She never mentioned it till I showed by my question to her that I knew all about your journey to Matching I own I do not understand why it should be necessary to keep me so much in the dark Alice felt that she was blushing The caution had been given to Kate because Kate still transgressed in her letters by saying little words about her brother And Alice did not even now believe Kate to have been false to her but she saw that she herself had been imprudent I cannot understand it continued George speaking without looking at her It was but the other day that we were such dear friends Do you remember the balcony at Basle and now it seems that we are quite estranged nay worse than estranged that I am as it were under some ban Have I done anything to offend you Alice If so speak out like a woman of spirit as you are Nothing said Alice Then why am I tabooed Why was I told the other day that I might not congratulate you on your happy emancipation I say boldly that had you resolved on that while we were together in Switzerland you would have permitted me as a friend almost as a brother to discuss it with you I think not George I am sure you would And why has Kate been warned not to tell me of this visit to the Pallisers I know she has been warned though she has not confessed it Alice sat silent not knowing what to say in answer to this charge brought against her thinking perhaps that the questioner would allow his question to pass without an answer But Vavasor was not so complaisant If there be any reason Alice I think that I have a right to ask it For a few seconds she did not speak a word but sat considering He also remained silent with his eyes fixed upon her She looked at him and saw nothing but his scar nothing but his scar and the brightness of his eyes which was almost fierce She knew that he was in earnest and therefore resolved that she would be in earnest also I think that you have such a right she said at last Then let me exercise it I think that you have such a right but I think also that you are ungenerous to exercise it I cannot understand that By heavens Alice I cannot be left in this suspense If I have done anything to offend you perhaps I can remove the offence by apology You have done nothing to offend me Or if there be any cause why our friendship should be dropped why we should be on a different footing to each other in London than we were in Switzerland I may acknowledge it if it be explained to me But I cannot put up with the doubt when I am told that I have a right to demand its solution Then I will be frank with you George though my being so will as you may guess be very painful She paused again looking at him to see if yet he would spare her but he was all scar and eyes as before and there was no mercy in his face Your sister George has thought that my parting with mister Grey might lead to a renewal of a purpose of marriage between you and me You know her eagerness and will understand that it may have been necessary that I should require silence from her on that head You ought now to understand it all I then am being punished for her sins he said and suddenly the scar on his face was healed up again and there was something of the old pleasantness in his eyes I have said nothing about any sins George but I have found it necessary to be on my guard Well he said after a short pause You are an honest woman Alice the honestest I ever knew I will bring Kate to order and now we may be friends again may we not And he extended his hand to her across the table Yes she said certainly if you wish it She spoke doubtingly with indecision in her voice as though remembering at the moment that he had given her no pledge I certainly do wish it very much said he and then she gave him her hand And I may now talk about your new freedom No said she no Do not speak of that A woman does not do what I have done in that affair without great suffering I have to think of it daily but do not make me speak of it But this other subject this visit to Matching surely I may speak of that There was something now in his voice so bright that she felt the influence of it and answered him cheerfully I don t see what you can have to say about it But I have a great deal I am so glad you are going Mind you cement a close intimacy with mister Palliser With mister Palliser Yes with mister Palliser You must read all the blue books about finance I ll send them to you if you like it Oh George I m quite in earnest That is not in earnest about the blue books as you would not have time but about mister Palliser He will be the new Chancellor of the Exchequer without a doubt Will he indeed But why should I make a bosom friend of the Chancellor of the Exchequer I don t want any public money But I do my girl Don t you see No I don t I think I shall get returned at this next election I m sure I hope you will And if I do of course it will be my game to support the ministry or rather the new ministry for of course there will be changes I hope they will be on the right side Not a doubt of that Alice I wish they might be changed altogether Ah that s impossible It s very well as a dream but there are no such men as you want to see men really from the people strong enough to take high office A man can t drive four horses because he s a philanthropist or rather a philhorseophist and is desirous that the team should be driven without any hurt to them A man can t govern well simply because he is genuinely anxious that men should be well governed And will there never be any such men I won t say that I don t mind confessing to you that it is my ambition to be such a one myself But a child must crawl before he can walk Such a one as I hoping to do something in politics must spare no chance It would be something to me that mister Palliser should become the friend of any dear friend of mine especially of a dear friend bearing the same name I m afraid George you ll find me a bad hand at making any such friendship They say he is led immensely by his wife and that she is very clever But I mean this chiefly Alice that I do hope I shall have all your sympathy in any political career that I may make and all your assistance also My sympathy I think I can promise you My assistance I fear would be worthless By no means worthless Alice not if I see you take that place in the world which I hope to see you fill Do you think women nowadays have no bearing upon the politics of the times Almost as much as men have In answer to which Alice shook her head but nevertheless she felt in some way pleased and flattered George left her without saying a word more about her marriage prospects past or future and Alice as she went to bed felt glad that this explanation between them had been made CHAPTER XXII Dandy and Flirt Alice reached the Matching Road Station about three o clock in the afternoon without adventure and immediately on the stopping of the train became aware that all trouble was off her own hands A servant in livery came to the open window and touching his hat to her inquired if she were Miss Vavasor Then her dressing bag and shawls and cloaks were taken from her and she was conveyed through the station by the station master on one side of her the footman on the other and by the railway porter behind She instantly perceived that she had become possessed of great privileges by belonging even for a time to Matching Priory and that she was essentially growing upwards towards the light Outside on the broad drive before the little station she saw an omnibus that was going to the small town of Matching intended for people who had not grown upwards as had been her lot and she saw also a light stylish looking cart which she would have called a Whitechapel had she been properly instructed in such matters and a little low open carriage with two beautiful small horses in which was sitting a lady enveloped in furs Of course this was Lady Glencora Another servant was standing on the ground holding the horses of the carriage and the cart Dear Alice I m so glad you ve come said a voice from the furs Look here dear your maid can go in the dog cart with your things it wasn t a dog cart but Lady Glencora knew no better she ll be quite comfortable there and do you get in here Are you very cold Oh no not cold at all But it is awfully cold You ve been in the stuffy carriage but you ll find it cold enough out here I can tell you Oh Lady Glencora I am so sorry that I ve brought you out on such a morning said Alice getting in and taking the place assigned her next to the charioteer What nonsense Sorry Why I ve looked forward to meeting you all alone ever since I knew you were coming If it had snowed all the morning I should have come just the same I drive out almost every day when I m down here that is when the house is not too crowded or I can make an excuse Wrap these things over you there are plenty of them You shall drive if you like Alice however declined the driving expressing her gratitude in what prettiest words she could find I like driving better than anything I think mister Palliser doesn t like ladies to hunt and of course it wouldn t do as he does not hunt himself I do ride but he never gets on horseback I almost fancy I should like to drive four in hand only I know I should be afraid It would look very terrible said Alice Yes wouldn t it The look would be the worst of it as it is all the world over Sometimes I wish there were no such things as looks I don t mean anything improper you know only one does get so hampered right and left for fear of missus Grundy I endeavour to go straight and get along pretty well on the whole I suppose Baker you must put Dandy in the bar he pulls so going home that I can t hold him in the check She stopped the horses and Baker a very completely got up groom of some forty years of age who sat behind got down and put the impetuous Dandy in the bar thereby changing the rein so that the curb was brought to bear on him They re called Dandy and Flirt continued Lady Glencora speaking to Alice Ain t they a beautiful match The Duke gave them to me and named them himself Did you ever see the Duke Illustration Baker you must put Dandy in the bar Never said Alice He won t be here before Christmas but you shall be introduced some day in London He s an excellent creature and I m a great pet of his though after all I never speak half a dozen words to him when I see him He s one of those people who never talk I m one of those who like talking as you ll find out I think it runs in families and the Pallisers are non talkers That doesn t mean that they are not speakers for mister Palliser has plenty to say in the House and they declare that he s one of the few public men who ve got lungs enough to make a financial statement without breaking down Alice was aware that she had as yet hardly spoken herself and began to bethink herself that she didn t know what to say Had Lady Glencora paused on the subject of Dandy and Flirt she might have managed to be enthusiastic about the horses but she could not discuss freely the general silence of the Palliser family nor the excellent lungs as regarded public purposes of the one who was the husband of her present friend So she asked how far it was to Matching Priory You re not tired of me already I hope said Lady Glencora I didn t mean that said Alice I delight in the drive But somehow one expects Matching Station to be near Matching Ah yes that s a great cheat It s not Matching Station at all but Matching Road Station and it s eight miles It is a great bore for though the omnibus brings our parcels we have to be constantly sending over and it s very expensive I can assure you I want mister Palliser to have a branch but he says he would have to take all the shares himself and that would cost more I suppose Is there a town at Matching Oh a little bit of a place I ll go round by it if you like and in at the further gate Oh no said Alice Ah but I should like It was a borough once and belonged to the Duke but they put it out at the Reform Bill They made some kind of bargain he was to keep either Silverbridge or Matching but not both mister Palliser sits for Silverbridge you know The Duke chose Silverbridge or rather his father did as he was then going to build his great place in Barsetshire that s near Silverbridge But the Matching people haven t forgiven him yet He was sitting for Matching himself when the Reform Bill passed Then his father died and he hasn t lived there much since It s a great deal nicer place than Gatherum Castle only not half so grand I hate grandeur don t you I never tried much of it as you have Come now that s not fair There s no one in the world less grand than I am I mean that I ve not had grand people about me Having cut all your cousins and Lady Midlothian in particular like a naughty girl as you are I was so angry with you when you accused me of selling you about that You ought to have known that I was the last person in the world to have done such a thing I did not think you meant to sell me but I thought Yes you did Alice I know what you thought you thought that Lady Midlothian was making a tool of me that I might bring you under her thumb so that she might bully you into mister Grey s arms That s what you thought I don t know that I was at all entitled to your good opinion but I was not entitled to that special bad opinion I had no bad opinion but it was so necessary that I should guard myself You shall be guarded I ll take you under my shield mister Grey shan t be named to you except that I shall expect you to tell me all about it and you must tell me all about that dangerous cousin too of whom they were saying such terrible things down in Scotland I had heard of him before These last words Lady Glencora spoke in a lower voice and in an altered tone slowly as though she were thinking of something that pained her It was from Burgo Fitzgerald that she had heard of George Vavasor Alice did not know what to say She found it impossible to discuss all the most secret and deepest of her feelings out in that open carriage perhaps in the hearing of the servant behind on this her first meeting with her cousin of whom in fact she knew very little She had not intended to discuss these things at all and certainly not in such a manner as this So she remained silent This is the beginning of the park said Lady Glencora pointing to a grand old ruin of an oak tree which stood on the wide margin of the road outside the rounded corner of the park palings propped up with a skeleton of supporting sticks all round it And that is Matching oak under which Coeur de Lion or Edward the Third I forget which was met by Sir Guy de Palisere as he came from the war or from hunting or something of that kind It was the king you know who had been fighting or whatever it was and Sir Guy entertained him when he was very tired Jeffrey Palliser who is my husband s cousin says that old Sir Guy luckily pulled out his brandy flask But the king immediately gave him all the lands of Matching only there was a priory then and a lot of monks and I don t quite understand how that was But I know one of the younger brothers always used to be abbot and sit in the House of Lords And the king gave him Littlebury at the same time which is about seven miles away from here As Jeffrey Palliser says it was a great deal of money for a pull at his flask Jeffrey Palliser is here now and I hope you ll like him If I have no child and mister Palliser were not to marry again Jeffrey would be the heir And here again her voice was low and slow and altogether changed in its tone I suppose that s the way most of the old families got their estates Either so or by robbery Many of them were terrible thieves my dear and I dare say Sir Guy was no better than he should be But since that they have always called some of the Pallisers Plantagenet My husband s name is Plantagenet The Duke is called George Plantagenet and the king was his godfather The queen is my godmother I believe but I don t know that I m much the better for it There s no use in godfathers and godmothers do you think there is Not much as it s managed now If I had a child Oh Alice it s a dreadful thing not to have a child when so much depends on it But you re such a short time married yet Ah well I can see it in his eyes when he asks me questions but I don t think he d say an unkind word not if his own position depended on it Ah well this is Matching That other gate we passed where Dandy wanted to turn in that s where we usually go up but I ve brought you round to show you the town That s the inn whoever can possibly come to stay there I don t know I never saw anybody go in or out That s the baker who bakes our bread we baked it at the house at first but nobody could eat it and I know that that man there mends mister Palliser s shoes He s very particular about his shoes We shall see the church as we go in at the other gate It is in the park and is very pretty but not half so pretty as the priory ruins close to the house The ruins are our great lion I do so love to wander about them at moonlight I often think of you when I do I don t know why But I do know why and I ll tell you some day Come Miss Flirt As they drove up through the park Lady Glencora pointed out first the church and then the ruins through the midst of which the road ran and then they were at once before the front door The corner of the modern house came within two hundred yards of the gateway of the old priory It was a large building very pretty with two long fronts but it was no more than a house It was not a palace nor a castle nor was it hardly to be called a mansion It was built with gabled roofs four of which formed the side from which the windows of the drawing rooms opened out upon a lawn which separated the house from the old ruins and which indeed surrounded the ruins and went inside them forming the present flooring of the old chapel and the old refectory and the old cloisters Much of the cloisters indeed was standing and there the stone pavement remained but the square of the cloisters was all turfed and in the middle of it stood a large modern stone vase out of the broad basin of which hung flowering creepers and green tendrils As Lady Glencora drove up to the door a gentleman who had heard the sound of the wheels came forth to meet them There s mister Palliser said she that shows that you are an honoured guest for you may be sure that he is hard at work and would not have come out for anybody else Plantagenet here is Miss Vavasor perished Alice my husband Then mister Palliser put forth his hand and helped her out of the carriage I hope you ve not found it very cold said he The winter has come upon us quite suddenly He said nothing more to her than this till he met her again before dinner He was a tall thin man apparently not more than thirty years of age looking in all respects like a gentleman but with nothing in his appearance that was remarkable It was a face that you might see and forget and see again and forget again and yet when you looked at it and pulled it to pieces you found that it was a fairly good face showing intellect in the forehead and much character in the mouth The eyes too though not to be called bright had always something to say for themselves looking as though they had a real meaning But the outline of the face was almost insignificant being too thin and he wore no beard to give it character But indeed mister Palliser was a man who had never thought of assisting his position in the world by his outward appearance Not to be looked at but to be read about in the newspapers was his ambition Men said that he was to be Chancellor of the Exchequer and no one thought of suggesting that the insignificance of his face would stand in his way Are the people all out his wife asked him The men have not come in from shooting at least I think not and some of the ladies are driving I suppose But I haven t seen anybody since you went Of course you haven t He never has time Alice to see any one But we ll go up stairs dear I told them to let us have tea in my dressing room as I thought you d like that better than going into the drawing room before you had taken off your things You must be famished I know Then you can come down or if you want to avoid two dressings you can sit over the fire up stairs till dinner time So saying she skipped up stairs and Alice followed her Here s my dressing room and here s your room all but opposite You look out into the park It s pretty isn t it But come into my dressing room and see the ruins out of the window Alice followed Lady Glencora across the passage into what she called her dressing room and there found herself surrounded by an infinitude of feminine luxuries The prettiest of tables were there the easiest of chairs the most costly of cabinets the quaintest of old china ornaments It was bright with the gayest colours made pleasant to the eye with the binding of many books having nymphs painted on the ceiling and little Cupids on the doors Isn t it pretty she said turning quickly on Alice I call it my dressing room because in that way I can keep people out of it but I have my brushes and soap in a little closet there and my clothes my clothes are everywhere I suppose only there are none of them here Isn t it pretty Very pretty The Duke did it all He understands such things thoroughly Now to mister Palliser a dressing room is a dressing room and a bedroom a bedroom He cares for nothing being pretty not even his wife or he wouldn t have married me You wouldn t say that if you meant it Well I don t know Sometimes when I look at myself when I simply am myself with no making up or grimacing you know I think I m the ugliest young woman the sun ever shone on And in ten years time I shall be the ugliest old woman Only think my hair is beginning to get grey and I m not twenty one yet Look at it and she lifted up the wavy locks just above her ear But there s one comfort he doesn t care about beauty How old are you Over five and twenty said Alice Nonsense then I oughtn t to have asked you I am so sorry That s nonsense at any rate Why should you think I should be ashamed of my age I don t know why only somehow people are and I didn t think you were so old Five and twenty seems so old to me It would be nothing if you were married only you see you won t get married Perhaps I may yet some day Of course you will You ll have to give way You ll find that they ll get the better of you Your father will storm at you and Lady Macleod will preach at you and Lady Midlothian will jump upon you I m not a bit afraid of Lady Midlothian I know what it is my dear to be jumped upon We talked with such horror of the French people giving their daughters in marriage just as they might sell a house or a field but we do exactly the same thing ourselves When they all come upon you in earnest how are you to stand against them How can any girl do it I think I shall be able To be sure you re older and you are not so heavily weighted But never mind I didn t mean to talk about that not yet at any rate Well now my dear I must go down The Duchess of saint Bungay is here and mister Palliser will be angry if I don t do pretty to her The Duke is to be the new President of the Council or rather I believe he is President now I try to remember it all but it is so hard when one doesn t really care two pence how it goes Not but what I m very anxious that mister Palliser should be Chancellor of the Exchequer And now will you remain here or will you come down with me or will you go to your own room and I ll call for you when I go down to dinner We dine at eight Alice decided that she would stay in her own room till dinner time and was taken there by Lady Glencora She found her maid unpacking her clothes and for a while employed herself in assisting at the work but that was soon done and then she was left alone I shall feel so strange ma am among all those people down stairs said the girl They all seem to look at me as though they didn t know who I was You ll get over that soon Jane I suppose I shall but you see they re all like knowing each other miss Alice when she sat down alone felt herself to be very much in the same condition as her maid What would the Duchess of saint Bungay or mister Jeffrey Palliser who himself might live to be a duke if things went well for him care for her As to mister Palliser the master of the house it was already evident to her that he would not put himself out of his way for her Had she not done wrong to come there If it were possible for her to fly away back to the dullness of Queen Anne Street or even to the preachings of Lady Macleod would she not do so immediately What business had she she asked herself to come to such a house as that Lady Glencora was very kind to her but frightened her even by her kindness Moreover she was aware that Lady Glencora could not devote herself especially to any such guest as she was Lady Glencora must of course look after her duchesses and do pretty as she called it to her husband s important political alliances And then she began to think about Lady Glencora herself What a strange weird nature she was with her round blue eyes and wavy hair looking sometimes like a child and sometimes almost like an old woman And how she talked What things she said and what terrible forebodings she uttered of stranger things that she meant to say Why had she at their first meeting made that allusion to the mode of her own betrothal and then checking herself for speaking of it so soon almost declare that she meant to speak more of it hereafter She should never mention it to any one said Alice to herself If her lot in life has not satisfied her there is so much the more reason why she should not mention it Then Alice protested to herself that no father no aunt no Lady Midlothian should persuade her into a marriage of which she feared the consequences But Lady Glencora had made for herself excuses which were not altogether untrue She had been very young and had been terribly weighted with her wealth And it seemed to Alice that her cousin had told her everything in that hour and a half that they had been together She had given a whole history of her husband and of herself She had said how indifferent he was to her pleasures and how vainly she strove to interest herself in his pursuits And then as yet she was childless and without prospect of a child when as she herself had said so much depended on it It was very strange to Alice that all this should have been already told to her And why should Lady Glencora think of Alice when she walked out among the priory ruins by moonlight The two hours seemed to her very long as though she were passing her time in absolute seclusion at Matching Of course she did not dare to go down stairs But at last her maid came to dress her How do you get on below Jane her mistress asked her Why miss they are uncommon civil and I don t think after all it will be so bad We had our teas very comfortable in the housekeeper s room There are five or six of us altogether all ladies maids miss and there s nothing on earth to do all the day long only sit and do a little needlework over the fire A few minutes before eight Lady Glencora knocked at Alice s door and took her arm to lead her to the drawing room Alice saw that she was magnificently dressed with an enormous expanse of robe and that her locks had been so managed that no one could suspect the presence of a grey hair Indeed with all her magnificence she looked almost a child Let me see she said as they went down stairs together I ll tell Jeffrey to take you in to dinner He s about the easiest young man we have here He rather turns up his nose at everything but that doesn t make him the less agreeable does it dear unless he turns up his nose at you you know But perhaps he will No he won t do that That would be uncourteous and he s the most courteous man in the world There s nobody here you see she said as they entered the room and I didn t suppose there would be It s always proper to be first in one s own house I do so try to be proper and it is such trouble Talking of people earning their bread Alice I m sure I earn mine Oh dear what fun it would be to be sitting somewhere in Asia eating a chicken with one s fingers and lighting a big fire outside one s tent to keep off the lions and tigers Fancy your being on one side of the fire and the lions and tigers on the other grinning at you through the flames Then Lady Glencora strove to look like a lion and grinned at herself in the glass That sort of grin wouldn t frighten me said Alice I dare say not I have been reading about it in that woman s travels Oh here they are and I mustn t make any more faces Duchess do come to the fire I hope you ve got warm again This is my cousin Miss Vavasor The Duchess made a stiff little bow of condescension and then declared that she was charmingly warm I don t know how you manage in your house but the staircases are so comfortable Now at Longroyston we ve taken all the trouble in the world put down hot water pipes all over the house and everything else that could be thought of and yet you can t move about the place without meeting with draughts at every corner of the passages The Duchess spoke with an enormous emphasis on every other word sometimes putting so great a stress on some special syllable as almost to bring her voice to a whistle This she had done with the word pipes to a great degree so that Alice never afterwards forgot the hot water pipes of Longroyston I was telling Lady Glencora Miss Palliser that I never knew a house so warm as this or I m sorry to say and here the emphasis was very strong on the word sorry so cold as Longroyston And the tone in which Longroyston was uttered would almost have drawn tears from a critical audience in the pit of a playhouse The Duchess was a woman of about forty very handsome but with no meaning in her beauty carrying a good fixed colour in her face which did not look like paint but which probably had received some little assistance from art She was a well built sizeable woman with good proportions and fine health but a fool She had addressed herself to one Miss Palliser but two Miss Pallisers cousins of Plantagenet Palliser had entered the room at the same time of whom I may say whatever other traits of character they may have possessed that at any rate they were not fools It s always easy to warm a small house like this said Miss Palliser whose Christian names unfortunately for her were Iphigenia Theodata and who by her cousin and sister was called Iphy and I suppose equally difficult to warm a large one such as Longroyston The other Miss Palliser had been christened Euphemia We ve got no pipes Duchess at any rate said Lady Glencora and Alice as she sat listening thought she discerned in Lady Glencora s pronunciation of the word pipes an almost hidden imitation of the Duchess s whistle It must have been so for at the moment Lady Glencora s eye met Alice s for an instant and was then withdrawn so that Alice was compelled to think that her friend and cousin was not always quite successful in those struggles she made to be proper Then the gentlemen came in one after another and other ladies till about thirty people were assembled mister Palliser came up and spoke another word to Alice in a kind voice meant to express some sense of connection if not cousinship My wife has been thinking so much of your coming I hope we shall be able to amuse you Alice who had already begun to feel desolate was grateful and made up her mind that she would try to like mister Palliser Jeffrey Palliser was almost the last in the room but directly he entered Lady Glencora got up from her seat and met him as he was coming into the crowd You must take my cousin Alice Vavasor in to dinner she said and will you oblige me to day Yes as you ask me like that Then try to make her comfortable After that she introduced them and Jeffrey Palliser stood opposite to Alice talking to her till dinner was announced CHAPTER XXIII Dinner at Matching Priory Alice found herself seated near to Lady Glencora s end of the table and in spite of her resolution to like mister Palliser she was not sorry that such an arrangement had been made mister Palliser had taken the Duchess out to dinner and Alice wished to be as far removed as possible from her Grace She found herself seated between her bespoken friend Jeffrey Palliser and the Duke and as soon as she was seated Lady Glencora introduced her to her second neighbour My cousin Duke Lady Glencora said and a terrible Radical Oh indeed I m glad of that We re sadly in want of a few leading Radicals and perhaps I may be able to gain one now Alice thought of her cousin George and wished that he instead of herself was sitting next to the Duke of saint Bungay But I m afraid I never shall be a leading Radical she said You shall lead me at any rate if you will said he As the little dogs lead the blind men said Lady Glencora No Lady Glencora not so But as the pretty women lead the men who have eyes in their head There is nothing I want so much Miss Vavasor as to become a Radical if I only knew how I think it s very easy to know how said Alice Do you I don t I ve voted for every liberal measure that has come seriously before Parliament since I had a seat in either House and I ve not been able to get beyond Whiggery yet Have you voted for the ballot asked Alice almost trembling at her own audacity as she put the question Well no I ve not And I suppose that is the crux But the ballot has never been seriously brought before any House in which I have sat I hate it with so keen a private hatred that I doubt whether I could vote for it But the Radicals love it said Alice Palliser said the Duke speaking loudly from his end of the table I m told you can never be entitled to call yourself a Radical till you ve voted for the ballot I don t want to be called a Radical said mister Palliser or to be called anything at all Except Chancellor of the Exchequer said Lady Glencora in a low voice And that s about the finest ambition by which a man can be moved said the Duke The man who can manage the purse strings of this country can manage anything Then that conversation dropped and the Duke ate his dinner I was especially commissioned to amuse you said mister Jeffrey Palliser to Alice But when I undertook the task I had no conception that you would be calling Cabinet Ministers over the coals about their politics I did nothing of the kind surely mister Palliser I suppose all Radicals do vote for the ballot and that s why I said it Your definition was perfectly just I dare say only Only what Lady Glencora need not have been so anxious to provide specially for your amusement Not but what I m very much obliged to her of course But Miss Vavasor unfortunately I m not a politician I haven t a chance of a seat in the House and so I despise politics Women are not allowed to be politicians in this country Thank God they can t do much in that way not directly I mean Only think where we should be if we had a feminine House of Commons with feminine debates carried on of course with feminine courtesy My cousins Iphy and Phemy there would of course be members You don t know them yet No not yet Are they politicians Not especially They have their tendencies which are decidedly liberal There has never been a Tory Palliser known you know But they are too clever to give themselves up to anything in which they can do nothing Being women they live a depressed life devoting themselves to literature fine arts social economy and the abstract sciences They write wonderful letters but I believe their correspondence lists are quite full so that you have no chance at present of getting on either of them I haven t the slightest pretension to ask for such an honour Oh if you mean because you don t know them that has nothing to do with it But I have no claim either private or public That has nothing to do with it either They don t at all seek people of note as their correspondents Free communication with all the world is their motto and Rowland Hill is the god they worship Only they have been forced to guard themselves against too great an accession of paper and ink Are you fond of writing letters Miss Vavasor Yes to my friends but I like getting them better I shrewdly suspect they don t read half what they get Is it possible any one should go through two sheets of paper filled by our friend the Duchess there No their delight is in writing They sit each at her desk after breakfast and go on till lunch There is a little rivalry between them not expressed to each other but visible to their friends Iphy certainly does get off the greater number and I m told crosses quite as often as Phemy but then she has the advantage of a bolder and larger hand Do they write to you Oh dear no I don t think they ever write to any relative They don t discuss family affairs and such topics as that Architecture goes a long way with them and whether women ought to be clerks in public offices Iphy has certain American correspondents that take up much of her time but she acknowledges she does not read their letters Then I certainly shall not write to her But you are not American I hope I do hate the Americans It s the only strong political feeling I have I went there once and found I couldn t live with them on any terms But they please themselves I don t see they are to be hated because they don t live after our fashion Oh it s jealousy of course I know that I didn t come across a cab driver who wasn t a much better educated man than I am And as for their women they know everything But I hated them and I intend to hate them You haven t been there Oh no Then I will make bold to say that any English lady who spent a month with them and didn t hate them would have very singular tastes I begin to think they ll eat each other up and then there ll come an entirely new set of people of a different sort I always regarded the States as a Sodom and Gomorrah prospering in wickedness on which fire and brimstone were sure to fall sooner or later I think that s wicked I am wicked as Topsy used to say Do you hunt No Do you shoot Shoot What with a gun Yes I was staying in a house last week with a lady who shot a good deal No I don t shoot Do you ride No I wish I did I have never ridden because I ve no one to ride with me Do you drive No I don t drive either Then what do you do I sit at home and Mend your stockings No I don t do that because it s disagreeable but I do work a good deal Sometimes I have amused myself by reading Ah they never do that here I have heard that there is a library but the clue to it has been lost and nobody now knows the way I don t believe in libraries Nobody ever goes into a library to read any more than you would into a larder to eat But there is this difference the food you consume does come out of the larders but the books you read never come out of the libraries Except Mudie s said Alice Ah yes he is the great librarian And you mean to read all the time you are here Miss Vavasor I mean to walk about the priory ruins sometimes Then you must go by moonlight and I ll go with you Only isn t it rather late in the year for that I should think it is for you mister Palliser Then the Duke spoke to her again and she found that she got on very well during dinner But she could not but feel angry with herself in that she had any fear on the subject and yet she could not divest herself of that fear She acknowledged to herself that she was conscious of a certain inferiority to Lady Glencora and to mister Jeffrey Palliser which almost made her unhappy As regarded the Duke on the other side of her she had no such feeling He was old enough to be her father and was a Cabinet Minister therefore he was entitled to her reverence But how was it that she could not help accepting the other people round her as being indeed superior to herself Was she really learning to believe that she could grow upwards by their sunlight Jeffrey is a pleasant fellow is he not said Lady Glencora to her as they passed back through the billiard room to the drawing room Very pleasant a little sarcastic perhaps I should think you would soon find yourself able to get the better of that if he tries it upon you said Lady Glencora and then the ladies were all in the drawing room together It is quite deliciously warm coming from one room to another said the Duchess putting her emphasis on the one and the other Then we had better keep continually moving said a certain missus Conway Sparkes a literary lady who had been very handsome who was still very clever who was not perhaps very good natured and of whom the Duchess of saint Bungay was rather afraid I hope we may be warm here too said Lady Glencora But not deliciously warm said missus Conway Sparkes It makes me tremble in every limb when missus Sparkes attacks her Lady Glencora said to Alice in Alice s own room that night for I know she ll tell the Duke and he ll tell that tall man with red hair whom you see standing about and the tall man with red hair will tell mister Palliser and then I shall catch it And who is the tall man with red hair He s a political link between the Duke and mister Palliser His name is Bott and he s a Member of Parliament But why should he interfere I suppose it s his business I don t quite understand all the ins and outs of it I believe he s to be one of mister Palliser s private secretaries if he becomes Chancellor of the Exchequer Perhaps he doesn t tell only I think he does all the same He always calls me Lady Glen cowrer He comes out of Lancashire and made calico as long as he could get any cotton But this happened in the bedroom and we must go back for a while to the drawing room The Duchess had made no answer to missus Sparkes and so nothing further was said about the warmth Nor indeed was there any conversation that was comfortably general The number of ladies in the room was too great for that and ladies do not divide themselves nicely into small parties as men and women do when they are mixed Lady Glencora behaved pretty by telling the Duchess all about her pet pheasants missus Conway Sparkes told ill natured tales of some one to Miss Euphemia Palliser one of the Duchess s daughters walked off to a distant piano with an admiring friend and touched a few notes while Iphigenia Palliser boldly took up a book and placed herself at a table Alice who was sitting opposite to Lady Glencora began to speculate whether she might do the same but her courage failed her and she sat on telling herself that she was out of her element Alice Vavasor said Lady Glencora after a while suddenly and in a somewhat loud voice can you play billiards No said Alice rather startled Then you shall learn to night and if nobody else will teach you you shall be my pupil Whereupon Lady Glencora rang the bell and ordered that the billiard table might be got ready You ll play Duchess of course said Lady Glencora It is so nice and warm that I think I will said the Duchess but as she spoke she looked suspiciously to that part of the room where missus Conway Sparkes was sitting Let us all play said missus Conway Sparkes and then it will be nicer and perhaps warmer too The gentlemen joined them just as they were settling themselves round the table and as many of them stayed there the billiard room became full Alice had first a cue put into her hand and making nothing of that was permitted to play with a mace The duty of instructing her devolved on Jeffrey Palliser and the next hour passed pleasantly not so pleasantly she thought afterwards as did some of those hours in Switzerland when her cousins were with her After all she could get more out of her life with such associates as them than she could with any of these people at Matching She felt quite sure of that though Jeffrey Palliser did take great trouble to teach her the game and once or twice made her laugh heartily by quizzing the Duchess s attitude as she stood up to make her stroke I wish I could play billiards said missus Sparkes on one of these occasions I do indeed I thought you said you were coming to play said the Duchess almost majestically and with a tone of triumph evidently produced by her own successes Only to see your Grace said missus Sparkes I don t know that there is anything more to see in me than in anybody else said the Duchess mister Palliser that was a cannon Will you mark that for our side Illustration mister Palliser that was a cannon Oh no Duchess you hit the same ball twice Very well then I suppose Miss Vavasor plays now That was a miss Will you mark that if you please This latter demand was made with great stress as though she had been defrauded in the matter of the cannon and was obeyed Before long the Duchess with her partner Lady Glencora won the game which fact however was I think owing rather to Alice s ignorance than to her Grace s skill The Duchess however was very triumphant and made her way back into the drawing room with a step which seemed to declare loudly that she had trumped missus Sparkes at last Not long after this the ladies went up stairs on their way to bed Many of them perhaps did not go to their pillows at once as it was as yet not eleven o clock and it was past ten when they all came down to breakfast At any rate Alice who had been up at seven did not go to bed then nor for the next two hours I ll come into your room just for one minute Lady Glencora said as she passed on from the door to her own room and in about five minutes she was back with her cousin Would you mind going into my room it s just there and sitting with Ellen for a minute This Lady Glencora said in the sweetest possible tone to the girl who was waiting on Alice and then when they were alone together she got into a little chair by the fireside and prepared herself for conversation I must keep you up for a quarter of an hour while I tell you something But first of all how do you like the people Will you be able to be comfortable with them Alice of course said that she thought she would and then there came that little discussion in which the duties of mister Bott the man with the red hair were described But I ve got something to tell you said Lady Glencora when they had already been there some twenty minutes Sit down opposite to me and look at the fire while I look at you Is it anything terrible It s nothing wrong Oh Lady Glencora if it s I won t have you call me Lady Glencora Don t I call you Alice Why are you so unkind to me I have not come to you now asking you to do for me anything that you ought not to do But you are going to tell me something Alice felt sure that the thing to be told would have some reference to mister Fitzgerald and she did not wish to hear mister Fitzgerald s name from her cousin s lips Tell you something of course I am I m going to tell you that that in writing to you the other day I wrote a fib But it wasn t that I wished to deceive you only I couldn t say it all in a letter Say all what You know I confessed that I had been very bad in not coming to you in London last year I never thought of it for a moment You did not care whether I came or not was that it But never mind Why should you have cared But I cared I told you in my letter that I didn t come because I had so many things on hand Of course that was a fib Everybody makes excuses of that kind said Alice But they don t make them to the very people of all others whom they want to know and love I was longing to come to you every day But I feared I could not come without speaking of him and I had determined never to speak of him again This she said in that peculiar low voice which she assumed at times Then why do it now Lady Glencora I won t be called Lady Glencora Call me Cora I had a sister once older than I and she used to call me Cora If she had lived But never mind that now She didn t live I ll tell you why I do it now Because I cannot help it Besides I ve met him I ve been in the same room with him and have spoken to him What s the good of any such resolution now And you have met him Yes he mister Palliser knew all about it When he talked of taking me to the house I whispered to him that I thought Burgo would be there Do not call him by his Christian name said Alice almost with a shudder Why not why not his Christian name I did when I told my husband Or perhaps I said Burgo Fitzgerald Well And he bade me go He said it didn t signify and that I had better learn to bear it Bear it indeed If I am to meet him and speak to him and look at him surely I may mention his name And then she paused for an answer May I not What am I to say exclaimed Alice Anything you please that s not a falsehood But I ve got you here because I don t think you will tell a falsehood Oh Alice I do so want to go right and it is so hard Hard indeed poor creature for one so weighted as she had been and sent out into the world with so small advantages of previous training or of present friendship Alice began to feel now that she had been enticed to Matching Priory because her cousin wanted a friend and of course she could not refuse to give the friendship that was asked from her She got up from her chair and kneeling down at the other s feet put up her face and kissed her I knew you would be good to me said Lady Glencora I knew you would And you may say whatever you like But I could not bear that you should not know the real reason why I neither came to you nor sent for you after we went to London You ll come to me now won t you dear Yes and you ll come to me said Alice making in her mind a sort of bargain that she was not to be received into mister Palliser s house after the fashion in which Lady Midlothian had proposed to receive her But it struck her at once that this was unworthy of her and ungenerous But I ll come to you she added whether you come to me or not I will go to you said Lady Glencora of course why shouldn t I But you know what I mean We shall have dinners and parties and lots of people And we shall have none said Alice smiling And therefore there is so much more excuse for your coming to me or rather I mean so much more reason for I don t want excuses Well dear I m so glad I ve told you I was afraid to see you in London I should hardly have known how to look at you then But I ve got over that now Then she smiled and returned the kiss which Alice had given her It was singular to see her standing on the bedroom rug with all her magnificence of dress but with her hair pushed back behind her ears and her eyes red with tears as though the burden of the magnificence remained to her after its purpose was over I declare it s ever so much past twelve Good night now dear I wonder whether he s come up But I should have heard his step if he had He never treads lightly He seldom gives over work till after one and sometimes goes on till three It s the only thing he likes I believe God bless you good night I ve such a deal more to say to you and Alice you must tell me something about yourself too won t you dear Then without waiting for an answer Lady Glencora went leaving Alice in a maze of bewilderment She could hardly believe that all she had heard and all she had done had happened since she left Queen Anne Street that morning CHAPTER XXIV Three Politicians mister Palliser was one of those politicians in possessing whom England has perhaps more reason to be proud than of any other of her resources and who as a body give to her that exquisite combination of conservatism and progress which is her present strength and best security for the future He could afford to learn to be a statesman and had the industry wanted for such training He was born in the purple noble himself and heir to the highest rank as well as one of the greatest fortunes of the country already very rich surrounded by all the temptations of luxury and pleasure and yet he devoted himself to work with the grinding energy of a young penniless barrister labouring for a penniless wife and did so without any motive more selfish than that of being counted in the roll of the public servants of England He was not a brilliant man and understood well that such was the case He was now listened to in the House as the phrase goes but he was listened to as a laborious man who was in earnest in what he did who got up his facts with accuracy and who dull though he be was worthy of confidence And he was very dull He rather prided himself on being dull and on conquering in spite of his dullness He never allowed himself a joke in his speeches nor attempted even the smallest flourish of rhetoric He was very careful in his language labouring night and day to learn to express himself with accuracy with no needless repetition of words perspicuously with regard to the special object he might have in view He had taught himself to believe that oratory as oratory was a sin against that honesty in politics by which he strove to guide himself He desired to use words for the purpose of teaching things which he knew and which others did not know and he desired also to be honoured for his knowledge But he had no desire to be honoured for the language in which his knowledge was conveyed He was an upright thin laborious man who by his parts alone could have served no political party materially but whose parts were sufficient to make his education integrity and industry useful in the highest degree It is the trust which such men inspire which makes them so serviceable trust not only in their labour for any man rising from the mass of the people may be equally laborious nor yet simply in their honesty and patriotism The confidence is given to their labour honesty and patriotism joined to such a personal stake in the country as gives them a weight and ballast which no politician in England can possess without it If he was dull as a statesman he was more dull in private life and it may be imagined that such a woman as his wife would find some difficulty in making his society the source of her happiness Their marriage in a point of view regarding business had been a complete success and a success too when on the one side that of Lady Glencora there had been terrible dangers of shipwreck and when on his side also there had been some little fears of a mishap As regards her it has been told how near she went to throwing herself with all her vast wealth into the arms of a young man whom no father no guardian could have regarded as a well chosen husband for any girl one who as yet had shown no good qualities who had been a spendthrift unprincipled and debauched Alas she had loved him It is possible that her love and her wealth might have turned him from evil to good But who would have ventured to risk her I will not say her and her vast inheritances on such a chance That evil however had been prevented and those about her had managed to marry her to a young man very steady by nature with worldly prospects as brilliant as her own and with a station than which the world offers nothing higher His little threatened mischance a passing fancy for a married lady who was too wise to receive vows which were proffered not in the most ardent manner had from special reasons given some little alarm to his uncle which had just sufficed at the time to make so very judicious a marriage doubly pleasant to that noble duke So that all things and all people had conspired to shower substantial comforts on the heads of this couple when they were joined together and men and women had not yet ceased to declare how happy were both in the accumulated gifts of fortune And as regards mister Palliser I think that his married life and the wife whom he certainly had not chosen but who had dropped upon him suited him admirably He wanted great wealth for that position at which he aimed He had been rich before his marriage with his own wealth so rich that he could throw thousands away if he wished it but for him and his career was needed that colossal wealth which would make men talk about it which would necessitate an expansive expenditure reaching far and wide doing nothing or less than nothing for his own personal comfort but giving to him at once that rock like solidity which is so necessary to our great aristocratic politicians And his wife was as far as he knew all that he desired He had not dabbled much in the fountains of Venus though he had forgotten himself once and sinned in coveting another man s wife But his sin then had hardly polluted his natural character and his desire had been of a kind which was almost more gratified in its disappointment than it would have been in its fruition On the morning after the lady had frowned on him he had told himself that he was very well out of that trouble He knew that it would never be for him to hang up on the walls of a temple a well worn lute as a votive offering when leaving the pursuits of love Idoneus puellis he never could have been So he married Lady Glencora and was satisfied The story of Burgo Fitzgerald was told to him and he supposed that most girls had some such story to tell He thought little about it and by no means understood her when she said to him with all the impressiveness which she could throw into the words You must know that I have really loved him You must love me now he had replied with a smile and then as regarded his mind the thing was over And since his marriage he had thought that things matrimonial had gone well with him and with her too He gave her almost unlimited power of enjoying her money and interfered but little in her way of life Sometimes he would say a word of caution to her with reference to those childish ways which hardly became the dull dignity of his position and his words then would have in them something of unintentional severity whether instigated or not by the red haired Radical Member of Parliament I will not pretend to say but on the whole he was contented and loved his wife as he thought very heartily and at least better than he loved any one else One cause of unhappiness or rather one doubt as to his entire good fortune was beginning to make itself felt as his wife had to her sorrow already discovered He had hoped that before this he might have heard that she would give him a child But the days were young yet for that trouble and the care had not become a sorrow But this judicious arrangement as to properties this well ordered alliance between families had not perhaps suited her as well as it had suited him I think that she might have learned to forget her early lover or to look back upon it with a soft melancholy hardly amounting to regret had her new lord been more tender in his ways with her I do not know that Lady Glencora s heart was made of that stern stuff which refuses to change its impressions but it was a heart and it required food To love and fondle someone to be loved and fondled were absolutely necessary to her happiness She wanted the little daily assurance of her supremacy in the man s feelings the constant touch of love half accidental half contrived the passing glance of the eye telling perhaps of some little joke understood only between them two rather than of love the softness of an occasional kiss given here and there when chance might bring them together some half pretended interest in her little doings a nod a wink a shake of the head or even a pout It should have been given to her to feed upon such food as this daily and then she would have forgotten Burgo Fitzgerald But mister Palliser understood none of these things and therefore the image of Burgo Fitzgerald in all his beauty was ever before her eyes But not the less was mister Palliser a prosperous man as to the success of whose career few who knew him had much doubt It might be written in the book of his destiny that he would have to pass through some violent domestic trouble some ruin in the hopes of his home of a nature to destroy then and for ever the worldly prospects of other men But he was one who would pass through such violence should it come upon him without much scathe To lose his influence with his party would be worse to him than to lose his wife and public disgrace would hit him harder than private dishonour And the present was the very moment in which success was as was said coming to him He had already held laborious office under the Crown but had never sat in the Cabinet He had worked much harder than Cabinet Ministers generally work but hitherto had worked without any reward that was worth his having For the stipend which he had received had been nothing to him as the great stipend which he would receive if his hopes were true would also be nothing to him To have ascendancy over other men to be known by his countrymen as one of their real rulers to have an actual and acknowledged voice in the management of nations those were the rewards for which he looked and now in truth it seemed as though they were coming to him It was all but known that the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer would separate himself from the Government carrying various others with him either before or immediately consequent on the meeting of Parliament and it was all but known also that mister Palliser would fill his place taking that high office at once although he had never hitherto sat in that august assembly which men call the Cabinet He could thus afford to put up with the small everyday calamity of having a wife who loved another man better than she loved him The presence of the Duke of saint Bungay at Matching was assumed to be a sure sign of mister Palliser s coming triumph The Duke was a statesman of a very different class but he also had been eminently successful as an aristocratic pillar of the British Constitutional Republic He was a minister of very many years standing being as used to cabinet sittings as other men are to their own armchairs but he had never been a hard working man Though a constant politician he had ever taken politics easy whether in office or out The world had said before now that the Duke might be Premier only that he would not take the trouble He had been consulted by a very distinguished person so the papers had said more than once as to the making of Prime Ministers His voice in council was esteemed to be very great He was regarded as a strong rock of support to the liberal cause and yet nobody ever knew what he did nor was there much record of what he said The offices which he held or had held were generally those to which no very arduous duties were attached In severe debates he never took upon himself the brunt of opposition oratory What he said in the House was generally short and pleasant with some slight drolling undercurrent of uninjurious satire running through it But he was a walking miracle of the wisdom of common sense He never lost his temper He never made mistakes He never grew either hot or cold in a cause He was never reckless in politics and never cowardly He snubbed no man and took snubbings from no man He was a Knight of the Garter a Lord Lieutenant of his county and at sixty two had his digestion unimpaired and his estate in excellent order He was a great buyer of pictures which perhaps he did not understand and a great collector of books which certainly he never read All the world respected him and he was a man to whom the respect of all the world was as the breath of his nostrils But even he was not without his peacock on the wall his skeleton in the closet his thorn in his side though the peacock did not scream loud the skeleton was not very terrible in his anatomical arrangement nor was the thorn likely to fester to a gangrene The Duke was always in awe about his wife He was ever uneasy about his wife but it must not be supposed that he feared the machinations of any Burgo Fitzgerald as being destructive of his domestic comfort The Duchess was and always had been all that is proper Ladies in high rank when gifted with excelling beauty have often been made the marks of undeserved calumny but no breath of slander had ever touched her name I doubt if any man alive had ever had the courage even to wink at her since the Duke had first called her his own Nor was she a spendthrift or a gambler She was not fast in her tastes or given to any pursuit that was objectionable She was simply a fool and as a fool was ever fearing that she was the mark of ridicule In all such miseries she would complain sorrowfully piteously and occasionally very angrily to her dear Duke and protector till sometimes her dear Duke did not quite know what to do with her or how to protect her It did not suit him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke of saint Bungay to beg mercy for that poor wife of his from such a one as missus Conway Sparkes nor would it be more in his way to lodge a formal complaint against that lady before his host or hostess as one boy at school may sometimes do as regards another If you don t like the people my dear we will go away he said to her late on that evening of which we have spoken No she replied I do not wish to go away I have said that we would stay till December and Longroyston won t be ready before that But I think that something ought to be done to silence that woman And the accent came strong upon something and then again with terrific violence upon woman The Duke did not know how to silence missus Conway Sparkes It was a great principle of his life never to be angry with any one How could he get at missus Conway Sparkes I don t think she is worth your attention said the husband That s all very well Duke said the wife and perhaps she is not But I find her in this house and I don t like to be laughed at I think Lady Glencora should make her know her place Lady Glencora is very young my dear I don t know about being so very young said the Duchess whose ear had perhaps caught some little hint of poor Lady Glencora s almost unintentional mimicry Now as appeals of this kind were being made frequently to the Duke and as he was often driven to say some word of which he himself hardly approved to some one in protection of his Duchess he was aware that the matter was an annoyance and at times almost wished that her Grace was at Longroyston And there was a third politician staying at Matching Priory who had never yet risen to the rank of a statesman but who had his hopes This was mister Bott the member for saint Helens whom Lady Glencora had described as a man who stood about with red hair and perhaps told tales of her to her husband mister Bott was a person who certainly had had some success in life and who had won it for himself He was not very young being at this time only just on the right side of fifty He was now enjoying his second session in Parliament having been returned as a pledged disciple of the Manchester school Nor had he apparently been false to his pledges At saint Helens he was still held to be a good man and true But they who sat on the same side with him in the House and watched his political manoeuvres knew that he was striving hard to get his finger into the public pie He was not a rich man though he had made calico and had got into Parliament And though he claimed to be a thoroughgoing Radical he was a man who liked to live with aristocrats and was fond of listening to the whispers of such as the Duke of saint Bungay or mister Palliser It was supposed that he did understand something of finance He was at any rate great in figures and as he was possessed of much industry and was obedient withal he was a man who might make himself useful to a Chancellor of the Exchequer ambitious of changes There are men who get into such houses as Matching Priory and whose presence there is a mystery to many as to whom the ladies of the house never quite understand why they are entertaining such a guest And mister Bott is coming mister Palliser had said to his wife mister Bott Lady Glencora had answered Goodness me who is mister Bott He is member for saint Helens said mister Palliser A very serviceable man in his way And what am I to do with him asked Lady Glencora I don t know that you can do anything with him He is a man who has a great deal of business and I dare say he will spend most of his time in the library So mister Bott arrived But though a huge pile of letters and papers came to him every morning by post he unfortunately did not seem to spend much of his time in the library Perhaps he had not found the clue to that lost apartment Twice he went out shooting but as on the first day he shot the keeper and on the second very nearly shot the Duke he gave that up Hunting he declined though much pressed to make an essay in that art by Jeffrey Palliser He seemed to spend his time as Lady Glencora said in standing about except at certain times when he was closeted with mister Palliser and when it may be presumed he made himself useful On such days he would be seen at the hour of lunch with fingers much stained with ink and it was generally supposed that on those occasions he had been counting up taxes and calculating the effect of great financial changes He was a tall wiry strong man with a bald head and bristly red beard which however was cut off from his upper and under lip This was unfortunate as had he hidden his mouth he would not have been in so marked a degree an ugly man His upper lip was very long and his mouth was mean But he had found that without the help of a razor to these parts he could not manage his soup to his satisfaction and preferring cleanliness to beauty had shaved himself accordingly I shouldn t dislike mister Bott so much Lady Glencora said to her husband if he didn t rub his hands and smile so often and seem to be going to say something when he really is not going to say anything I don t think you need trouble yourself about him my dear mister Palliser had answered But when he looks at me in that way I can t help stopping as I think he is going to speak and then he always says Can I do anything for you Lady Glen cowrer She instantly saw that her husband did not like this Don t be angry with me dear she said You must admit that he is rather a bore I am not at all angry Glencora said the husband and if you insist upon it I will see that he leaves and in such case will of course never ask him again But that might be prejudicial to me as he is a man whom I trust in politics and who may perhaps be serviceable to me Of course Lady Glencora declared that mister Bott might remain as long as he and her husband desired and of course she mentioned his name no more to mister Palliser but from that time forth she regarded mister Bott as an enemy and felt also that mister Bott regarded her in the same light When it was known among outside politicians that the Duke of saint Bungay was staying at Matching Priory outside politicians became more sure than ever that mister Palliser would be the new Chancellor of the Exchequer The old minister and the young minister were of course arranging matters together But I doubt whether mister Palliser and the Duke ever spoke on any such topic during the entire visit Though mister Bott was occasionally closeted with mister Palliser the Duke never troubled himself with such closetings He went out shooting on his pony read his newspaper wrote his notes and looked with the eye of a connoisseur over all mister Palliser s farming apparatus You seem to have a good man I should say said the Duke What Hubbings Yes he was a legacy from my uncle when he gave me up the Priory A very good man I should say Of course he won t make it pay but he ll make it look as though it did which is the next best thing I could never get rent out of land that I farmed myself never I suppose not said mister Palliser who did not care much about it The Duke would have talked to him by the hour together about farming had mister Palliser been so minded but he talked to him very little about politics Nor during the whole time of his stay at Matching did the Duke make any other allusion to mister Palliser s hopes as regarded the ministry than that in which he had told Lady Glencora at the dinner table that her husband s ambition was the highest by which any man could be moved But mister Bott was sometimes honoured by a few words with the Duke We shall muster pretty strong your Grace mister Bott had said to him one day before dinner That depends on how the changes go said the Duke I suppose there will be a change Oh yes there ll be a change certainly I should say And it will be in your direction And in Palliser s Yes I should think so that is if it suits him By the by mister Bott Then there was a little whispered communication in which perhaps mister Bott was undertaking some commission of that nature which Lady Glencora had called telling CHAPTER XXV In Which Much of the History of the Pallisers Is Told At the end of ten days Alice found herself quite comfortable at Matching Priory She had now promised to remain there till the second week of December at which time she was to go to Vavasor Hall there to meet her father and Kate The Pallisers were to pass their Christmas with the Duke of Omnium in Barsetshire We always are to do that said Glencora It is the state occasion at Gatherum Castle but it only lasts for one week Then we go somewhere else Oh dear Why do you say oh dear Because I don t think I mean to tell you Then I m sure I won t ask That s so like you Alice But I can be as firm as you and I m sure I won t tell you unless you do ask But Alice did not ask and it was not long before Lady Glencora s firmness gave way But as I have said Alice had become quite comfortable at Matching Priory Perhaps she was already growing upwards towards the light At any rate she could listen with pleasure to the few words the Duke would say to her She could even chat a little to the Duchess so that her Grace had observed to Lady Glencora that her cousin was a very nice person a very nice person indeed What a pity it was that she had been so ill treated by that gentleman in Oxfordshire Lady Glencora had to explain that the gentleman lived in Cambridgeshire and that he at any rate had not treated anybody ill Do you mean that she jilted him said the Duchess almost whistling and opening her eyes very wide Dear me I m sorry for that I shouldn t have thought it And when she next spoke to Alice she assumed rather a severe tone of emphasis but this was soon abandoned when Alice listened to her with complacency Alice also had learned to ride or rather had resumed her riding which for years had been abandoned Jeffrey Palliser had been her squire and she had become intimate with him so as to learn to quarrel with him and to like him to such an extent that Lady Glencora had laughingly told her that she was going to do more I rather think not said Alice But what has thinking to do with it Who ever thinks about it I don t just at present at any rate Upon my word it would be very nice and then perhaps some day you d be the Duchess Glencora don t talk such nonsense Those are the speculations which people make Only I should spite you by killing myself so that he might marry again How can you say such horrid things I think I shall some day What right have I to stand in his way He spoke to me the other day about Jeffrey s altered position and I knew what he meant or rather what he didn t mean to say but what he thought But I shan t kill myself I should think not I only know one other way said Lady Glencora You are thinking of things which should never be in your thoughts said Alice vehemently Have you no trust in God s providence Cannot you accept what has been done for you mister Bott had gone away much to Lady Glencora s delight but had unfortunately come back again On his return Alice heard more of the feud between the Duchess and missus Conway Sparkes I did not tell you said Lady Glencora to her friend I did not tell you before he went that I was right about his tale bearing And did he bear tales Yes I did get the scolding and I know very well that it came through him though mister Palliser did not say so But he told me that the Duchess had felt herself hurt by that other woman s way of talking But it was not your fault No that s what I said It was he who desired me to ask missus Conway Sparkes to come here I didn t want her She goes everywhere and it is thought a catch to get her but if she had been drowned in the Red Sea I shouldn t have minded When I told him that he said it was nonsense which of course it was and then he said I ought to make her hold her tongue Of course I said I couldn t missus Conway Sparkes wouldn t care for me If she quizzed me myself I told him that I could take care of myself though she were ten times missus Conway Sparkes and had written finer poetry than Tennyson It is fine some of it said Alice Oh I dare say I know a great deal of it by heart only I wouldn t give her the pleasure of supposing that I had ever thought so much about her poetry And then I told him that I couldn t take care of the Duchess and he told me that I was a child He only meant that in love I am a child I know that Why didn t he marry some strong minded ferocious woman that could keep his house in order and frown missus Sparkes out of her impudence It wasn t my fault You didn t tell him that But I did Then he kissed me and said it was all right and told me that I should grow older And missus Sparkes will grow more impudent I said and the Duchess more silly And after that I went away Now this horrid mister Bott has come back again and only that it would be mean in me to condescend so far I would punish him He grins and smiles at me and rubs his big hands more than ever because he feels that he has behaved badly Is it not horrid to have to live in the house with such people I don t think you need mind him much Yes but I am the mistress here and am told that I am to entertain the people Fancy entertaining the Duchess of saint Bungay and mister Bott Alice had now become so intimate with Lady Glencora that she did not scruple to read her wise lectures telling her that she allowed herself to think too much of little things and too much also of some big things As regards mister Bott said Alice I think you should bear it as though there were no such person But that would be pretence especially to you No it would not be pretence it would be the reticence which all women should practise and you in your position more almost than any other woman Then Lady Glencora pouted told Alice that it was a pity she had not married mister Palliser and left her That evening the evening of mister Bott s return to Matching that gentleman found a place near to Alice in the drawing room He had often come up to her rubbing his hands together and saying little words as though there was some reason from their positions that they two should be friends Alice had perceived this and had endeavoured with all her force to shake him off but he was a man who if he understood a hint never took it A cold shoulder was nothing to him if he wanted to gain the person who showed it him His code of perseverance taught him that it was a virtue to overcome cold shoulders The man or woman who received his first overtures with grace would probably be one on whom it would be better that he should look down and waste no further time whereas he or she who could afford to treat him with disdain would no doubt be worth gaining Such men as mister Bott are ever gracious to cold shoulders The colder the shoulders the more gracious are the mister Botts What a delightful person is our dear friend Lady Glencora said mister Bott having caught Alice in a position from which she could not readily escape Alice had half a mind to differ or to make any remark that might rid her from mister Bott But she did not dare to say a word that might seem to have been said playfully Yes indeed she replied How very cold it is to night She was angry with herself for her own stupidity as soon as the phrase was out of her mouth and then she almost laughed as she thought of the Duchess and the hot water pipes at Longroyston Yes it is cold You and her ladyship are great friends I believe Miss Vavasor She is my cousin said Alice Ah yes that is so pleasant I have reason to know that mister Palliser is very much gratified that you should be so much with her This was unbearable Alice could not quite assume sufficient courage to get up from her chair and walk away from him and yet she felt that she must escape further conversation I don t know that I am very much with her and if I were I can t think it would make any difference to mister Palliser But mister Bott was not a man to be put down when he had a purpose in hand I can assure you that those are his sentiments Of course we all know that dear Lady Glencora is young She is very young mister Bott I really would rather not talk about my cousin But dear Miss Vavasor when we both have her welfare in view I haven t her welfare in view mister Bott not in the least There is no reason why I should You must excuse me if I say I cannot talk about her welfare with a perfect stranger Then she did get up and went away from the Member of Parliament leaving him rather astonished at her audacity But he was a constant man and his inner resolve was simply to the effect that he would try it again I wonder whether Jeffrey Palliser did think much of the difference between his present position and that which would have been his had Lady Glencora been the happy possessor of a cradle up stairs with a boy in it I suppose he must have done so It is hardly possible that any man should not be alive to the importance of such a chance His own present position was one of the most unfortunate which can fall to the lot of a man His father the Duke s youngest brother had left him about six hundred a year and had left him also a taste for living with people of six thousand The propriety of earning his bread had never been put before him His father had been in Parliament and had been the most favoured son of the old Duke who for some years before his death had never spoken to him who now reigned over the house of the Pallisers Jeffrey s father had been brought up at Matching Priory as scions of ducal houses are brought up and on the old man s death had been possessed of means sufficient to go on in the same path though with difficulty His brother had done something for him and at various times he had held some place near the throne But on his death when the property left behind him was divided between his son and three daughters Jeffrey Palliser became possessed of the income above stated Of course he could live on it and as during the winter months of the year a home was found for him free of cost he could keep hunters and live as rich men live But he was a poor embarrassed man without prospects until this fine ducal prospect became opened to him by the want of that cradle at Matching Priory But the prospect was no doubt very distant Lady Glencora might yet have as many sons as Hecuba Or she might die and some other more fortunate lady might become the mother of his cousin s heir Or the Duke might marry and have a son And moreover his cousin was only one year older than himself and the great prize if it came his way might not come for forty years as yet Nevertheless his hand might now be acceptable in quarters where it would certainly be rejected had Lady Glencora possessed that cradle up stairs We cannot but suppose that he must have made some calculations of this nature It is a pity you should do nothing all your life his cousin Plantagenet said to him one morning just at this time Jeffrey had sought the interview in his cousin s room and I fear had done so with some slight request for ready money What am I to do said Jeffrey At any rate you might marry Oh yes I could marry There s no man so poor but what he can do that The question would be how I might like the subsequent starvation I don t see that you need starve Though your own fortune is small it is something and many girls have fortunes of their own Jeffrey thought of Lady Glencora but he made no allusion to her in speech I don t think I m very good at that kind of thing he said When the father and mother came to ask of my house and my home I should break down I don t say it as praising myself indeed quite the reverse but I fear I have not a mercenary tendency That s nonsense Oh yes quite so I admit that Men must have mercenary tendencies or they would not have bread The man who ploughs that he may live does so because he luckily has a mercenary tendency Just so But you see I am less lucky than the ploughman There is no vulgar error so vulgar that is to say common or erroneous as that by which men have been taught to say that mercenary tendencies are bad A desire for wealth is the source of all progress Civilization comes from what men call greed Let your mercenary tendencies be combined with honesty and they cannot take you astray This the future Chancellor of the Exchequer said with much of that air and tone of wisdom which a Chancellor of the Exchequer ought to possess But I haven t got any such tendencies said Jeffrey Would you like to occupy a farm in Scotland said Plantagenet Palliser And pay rent You would have to pay rent of course Thank you no It would be dishonest as I know I should never pay it You are too old I fear for the public service You mean a desk in the Treasury with a hundred a year Yes I think I am too old But have you no plan of your own Not much of one Sometimes I have thought I would go to New Zealand You would have to be a farmer there No I shouldn t do that I should get up an opposition to the Government and that sort of thing and then they would buy me off and give me a place That does very well here Jeffrey if a man can get into Parliament and has capital enough to wait but I don t think it would do out there Would you like to go into Parliament What here Of course I should Only I should be sure to get terribly into debt I don t owe very much now not to speak of except what I owe you You owe nothing to me said Plantagenet with some little touch of magniloquence in his tone No don t speak of it I have no brother and between you and me it means nothing You see Jeffrey it may be that I shall have to look to you as my my my heir in short Hereupon Jeffrey muttered something as to the small probability of such necessity and as to the great remoteness of any result even if it were so That s all true said the elder heir of the Pallisers but still In short I wish you would do something Do you think about it and then some day speak to me again Jeffrey as he left his cousin with a cheque for Lfive hundred in his waist coat pocket thought that the interview which had at one time taken important dimensions had not been concluded altogether satisfactorily A seat in Parliament Yes indeed If his cousin would so far use his political monetary or ducal interest as to do that for him as to give him something of the status properly belonging to the younger son of the House then indeed life would have some charms for him But as for the farm in Scotland or a desk at an office in London his own New Zealand plan would be better than those And then as he went along of course he bethought himself that it might be his lot yet to die and at least to be buried in the purple as a Duke of Omnium If so certainly it would be his duty to prepare another heir and leave a duke behind him if it were possible Are you going to ride with us after lunch said Lady Glencora to him as he strolled into the drawing room No said Jeffrey I m going to study To do what said Lady Glencora To study or rather I shall spend to day in sitting down and considering what I will study My cousin has just been telling me that I ought to do something So you ought said Iphigenia energetically from her writing desk But he didn t seem to have any clear opinion what it ought to be You see there can t be two Chancellors of the Exchequer at the same time missus Sparkes what ought a young man like me to set about doing Go into Parliament I should say said missus Sparkes Ah yes exactly He had some notion of that kind too but he didn t name any particular place I think I ll try the City of London They ve four there and of course the chance of getting in would thereby be doubled I thought that commercial men were generally preferred in the City said the Duchess taking a strong and good natured interest in the matter mister Palliser means to make a fortune in trade as a preliminary said missus Sparkes I don t think he meant anything of the kind said the Duchess At any rate I have got to do something so I can t go and ride said Jeffrey And you ought to do something said Iphigenia from her desk Twice during this little conversation Lady Glencora had looked up catching Alice s eye and Alice had well known what she had meant You see the glance had said Plantagenet is beginning to take an interest in his cousin and you know why The man who is to be the father of the future dukes must not be allowed to fritter away his time in obscurity Had I that cradle up stairs Jeffrey might be as idle as he pleased Alice understood it well Of course Jeffrey did join the riding party What is a man like me to do who wants to do something he said to Alice Alice was quite aware that Lady Glencora had contrived some little scheme that mister Palliser should be riding next to her She liked mister Palliser and therefore had no objection but she declared to herself that her cousin was a goose for her pains missus Sparkes says you ought to go into Parliament Yes and the dear Duchess would perhaps suggest a house in Belgrave Square I want to hear your advice now I can only say ditto to Miss Palliser What Iphy About procrastination But you see the more of my time he steals the better it is for me That s the evil you have got to cure My cousin Plantagenet suggested marriage A very good thing too I m sure said Alice only it depends something on the sort of wife you get You mean of course how much money she has Not altogether Looking at it from my cousin s point of view I suppose that it is the only important point Who are there coming up this year in the way of heiresses Upon my word I don t know In the first place how much money makes an heiress For such a fellow as me I suppose ten thousand pounds ought to do That s not much said Alice who had exactly that amount of her own No perhaps that s too moderate But the lower one went in the money speculation the greater would be the number to choose from and the better the chance of getting something decent in the woman herself I have something of my own not much you know so with the lady s ten thousand pounds we might be able to live in some second rate French town perhaps But I don t see what you would gain by that My people here would have got rid of me That seems to be the great thing If you hear of any girl with about that sum moderately good looking not too young so that she might know something of the world decently born and able to read and write perhaps you will bear me in mind Yes I will said Alice who was quite aware that he had made an accurate picture of her own position When I meet such a one I will send for you at once You know no such person now Well no not just at present I declare I don t think he could do anything better her cousin said to her that night Lady Glencora was now in the habit of having Alice with her in what she called her dressing room every evening and then they would sit till the small hours came upon them mister Palliser always burnt the midnight oil and came to bed with the owls They would often talk of him and his prospects till Alice had perhaps inspired his wife with more of interest in him and them than she had before felt And Alice had managed generally to drive her friend away from those topics which were so dangerous those allusions to her childlessness and those hints that Burgo Fitzgerald was still in her thoughts And sometimes of course they had spoken of Alice s own prospects till she got into a way of telling her cousin freely all that she felt On such occasions Lady Glencora would always tell her that she had been right if she did not love the man Though your finger were put out for the ring said Lady Glencora on one such occasion you should go back if you did not love him But I did love him said Alice Then I don t understand it said Lady Glencora and in truth close as was their intimacy they did not perfectly understand each other But on this occasion they were speaking of Jeffrey Palliser I declare I don t think he could do any better said Lady Glencora If you talk such nonsense I will not stay said Alice But why should it be nonsense You would be very comfortable with your joint incomes He is one of the best fellows in the world It is clear that he likes you and then we should be so near to each other I am sure mister Palliser would do something for him if he married and especially if I asked him I only know of two things against it And what are they That he would not take me for his wife and that I would not take him for my husband Why not What do you dislike in him I don t dislike him at all I like him very much indeed But one can t marry all the people one likes But what reason is there why you shouldn t marry him This chiefly said Alice after a pause that I have just separated myself from a man whom I certainly did love truly and that I cannot transfer my affections quite so quickly as that As soon as the words were out of her mouth she knew that they should not have been spoken It was exactly what Glencora had done She had loved a man and had separated herself from him and had married another all within a month or two Lady Glencora first became red as fire over her whole face and shoulders and Alice afterwards did the same as she looked up as though searching in her cousin s eyes for pardon It is an unmaidenly thing to do certainly said Lady Glencora very slowly and in her lowest voice Nay it is unwomanly but one may be driven One may be so driven that all gentleness of womanhood is driven out of one Oh Glencora I did not propose that you should do it as a sudden thing Glencora I did do it suddenly I know it I did it like a beast that is driven as its owner chooses I know it I was a beast Oh Alice if you know how I hate myself But I love you with all my heart said Alice Glencora I have learned to love you so dearly Then you are the only being that does He can t love me How is it possible You and perhaps another There are many who love you He loves you mister Palliser loves you It is impossible I have never said a word to him that could make him love me I have never done a thing for him that can make him love me The mother of his child he might have loved because of that Why should he love me We were told to marry each other and did it When could he have learned to love me But Alice he requires no loving either to take it or to give it I wish it were so with me Alice said what she could to comfort her but her words were but of little avail as regarded those marriage sorrows Forgive you at last Glencora said What have I to forgive You don t suppose I do not know it all and think of it all without the chance of some stray word like that Forgive you I am so grateful that you love me Some one s love I must have found or I could not have remained here CHAPTER XXVI Lady Midlothian A week or ten days after this Alice when she came down to the breakfast parlour one morning found herself alone with mister Bott It was the fashion at Matching Priory for people to assemble rather late in the day The nominal hour for breakfast was ten and none of the ladies of the party were ever seen before that Some of the gentlemen would breakfast earlier especially on hunting mornings and on some occasions the ladies when they came together would find themselves altogether deserted by their husbands and brothers On this day it was fated that mister Bott alone should represent the sterner sex and when Alice entered the room he was standing on the rug with his back to the fire waiting till the appearance of some other guest should give him the sanction necessary for the commencement of his morning meal Alice when she saw him would have retreated had it been possible for she had learned to dislike him greatly and was indeed almost afraid of him but she could not do so without making her flight too conspicuous Do you intend to prolong your stay here Miss Vavasor said mister Bott taking advantage of the first moment at which she looked up from a letter which she was reading For a few more days I think said Alice Ah I m glad of that mister Palliser has pressed me so much to remain till he goes to the Duke s that I cannot get away sooner As I am an unmarried man myself I can employ my time as well in one place as in another at this time of the year at least You must find that very convenient said Alice Yes it is convenient You see in my position Parliamentary position I mean I am obliged as a public man to act in concert with others A public man can be of no service unless he is prepared to do that We must give and take you know Miss Vavasor As Miss Vavasor made no remark in answer to this mister Bott continued I always say to the men of my party of course I regard myself as belonging to the extreme Radicals Oh indeed said Alice Yes I came into Parliament on that understanding and I have never seen any occasion as yet to change any political opinion that I have expressed But I always say to the gentlemen with whom I act that nothing can be done if we don t give and take I don t mind saying to you Miss Vavasor that I look upon our friend mister Palliser as the most rising public man in the country I do indeed I am happy to hear you say so said his victim who found herself driven to make some remark And I as an extreme Radical do not think I can serve my party better than by keeping in the same boat with him as long as it will hold the two He ll make a Government hack of you a friend of mine said to me the other day And I ll make a Manchester school Prime Minister of him I replied I rather think I know what I m about Miss Vavasor No doubt said Alice And so does he and so does he mister Palliser is not the man to be led by the nose by any one But it s a fair system of give and take You can t get on in politics without it What a charming woman is your relative Lady Glencowrer I remember well what you said to me the other evening Do you said Alice And I quite agree with you that confidential intercourse regarding dear friends should not be lightly made Certainly not said Alice But there are occasions Miss Vavasor there are occasions when the ordinary laws by which we govern our social conduct must be made somewhat elastic I don t think this one of them mister Bott Is it not Just listen to me for one moment Miss Vavasor Our friend mister Palliser I am proud to say relies much upon my humble friendship Our first connection has of course been political but it has extended beyond that and has become pleasantly social I may say very pleasantly social What a taste mister Palliser must have Alice thought to herself But I need not tell you that Lady Glencowrer is very young we may say very young indeed mister Bott I will not talk to you about Lady Glencora Palliser This Alice said in a determined voice and with all the power of resistance at her command She frowned too and looked savagely at mister Bott But he was a man of considerable courage and knew how to bear such opposition without flinching When I tell you Miss Vavasor that I speak solely with a view to her domestic happiness I don t think that she wishes to have any such guardian of her happiness But if he wishes it Miss Vavasor Now I have the means of knowing that he has the greatest reliance on your judgement Hereupon Alice got up with the intention of leaving the room but she was met at the door by missus Conway Sparkes Are you running from your breakfast Miss Vavasor said she No missus Sparkes I am running from mister Bott said Alice who was almost beside herself with anger mister Bott what is this said missus Sparkes Ha ha ha laughed mister Bott Alice returned to the room and missus Sparkes immediately saw that she had in truth been running from mister Bott I hope I shall be able to keep the peace said she I trust his offence was not one that requires special punishment Ha ha ha again laughed mister Bott who rather liked his position Alice was very angry with herself feeling that she had told more of the truth to missus Sparkes than she should have done unless she was prepared to tell the whole As it was she wanted to say something and did not know what to say but her confusion was at once stopped by the entrance of Lady Glencora missus Sparkes good morning said Lady Glencora I hope nobody has waited breakfast Good morning mister Bott Oh Alice What is the matter said Alice going up to her Oh Alice such a blow But Alice could see that her cousin was not quite in earnest that the new trouble though it might be vexatious was no great calamity Come here said Lady Glencora and they both went into an embrasure of the window Now I shall have to put your confidence in me to the test This letter is from whom do you think How can I guess From Lady Midlothian and she s coming here on Monday on her road to London Unless you tell me that you are quite sure this is as unexpected by me as by you I will never speak to you again I am quite sure of that Ah then we can consult But first we ll go and have some breakfast Then more ladies swarmed into the room the Duchess and her daughter and the two Miss Pallisers and others and mister Bott had his hands full in attending or rather in offering to attend to their little wants The morning was nearly gone before Alice and her cousin had any further opportunity of discussing in private the approach of Lady Midlothian but mister Palliser had come in among them and had been told of the good thing which was in store for him We shall be delighted to see Lady Midlothian said mister Palliser But there is somebody here who will not be at all delighted to see her said Lady Glencora to her husband Is there indeed said he Who is that Her most undutiful cousin Alice Vavasor But Alice mister Palliser knows nothing about it and it is too long to explain I am extremely sorry began mister Palliser I can assure you it does not signify in the least said Alice It will only be taking me away three days earlier Upon hearing this mister Palliser looked very serious What quarrel could Miss Vavasor have had with Lady Midlothian which should make it impossible for them to be visitors at the same house It will do no such thing said Lady Glencora Do you mean to say that you are coward enough to run away from her I m afraid Miss Vavasor that we can hardly bid her not come said mister Palliser In answer to this Alice protested that she would not for worlds have been the means of keeping Lady Midlothian away from Matching I should tell you mister Palliser that I have never seen Lady Midlothian though she is my far away cousin Nor have I ever quarrelled with her But she has given me advice by letter and I did not answer her because I thought she had no business to interfere I shall go away not because I am afraid of her but because after what has passed our meeting would be unpleasant to her You could tell her that Miss Vavasor is here said mister Palliser And then she need not come unless she pleased The matter was so managed at last that Alice found herself unable to leave Matching without making more of Lady Midlothian s coming than it was worth It would undoubtedly be very disagreeable this unexpected meeting with her relative but as Lady Glencora said Lady Midlothian would not eat her In truth she felt ashamed of herself in that she was afraid of her relative No doubt she was afraid of her So much she was forced to admit to herself But she resolved at last that she would not let her drive her out of the house Is mister Bott an admirer of your cousin missus Sparkes said that evening to Lady Glencora A very distant one I should think said Lady Glencora Goodness gracious exclaimed an old lady who had been rather awed by Alice s intimacy and cousinship with Lady Glencora it s the very last thing I should have dreamt of But I didn t dream it first or last said missus Sparkes Why do you ask said Lady Glencora Don t suppose that I am asking whether Miss Vavasor is an admirer of his said missus Sparkes I have no suspicion of that nature I rather think that when he plays Bacchus she plays Ariadne with full intention of flying from him in earnest Is mister Bott inclined to play Bacchus asked Lady Glencora I rather thought he was this morning If you observe he has something of a godlike and triumphant air about him I don t think his godship will triumph there said Lady Glencora I really think she would be throwing herself very much away said the old lady Miss Vavasor is not at all disposed to do that said missus Sparkes Then that conversation was allowed to drop On the following Monday Lady Midlothian arrived The carriage was sent to meet her at the station about three o clock in the afternoon and Alice had to choose whether she would undergo her first introduction immediately on her relative s arrival or whether she would keep herself out of the way till she should meet her in the drawing room before dinner I shall receive her when she comes said Lady Glencora and of course will tell her that you are here Yes that will be best and dear me I declare I don t know how to manage it I ll bring her to you in my room if you like it No that would be too solemn said Alice That would make her understand that I thought a great deal about her Then we ll let things take their chance and you shall come across her just as you would any other stranger It was settled at last that this would be the better course but that Lady Midlothian was to be informed of Alice s presence at the Priory as soon as she should arrive Alice was in her own room when the carriage in which sat the unwelcome old lady was driven up to the hall door She heard the wheels plainly and knew well that her enemy was within the house She had striven hard all the morning to make herself feel indifferent to this arrival but had not succeeded and was angry with herself at finding that she sat up stairs with an anxious heart because she knew that her cousin was in the room down stairs What was Lady Midlothian to her that she should be afraid of her And yet she was very much afraid of Lady Midlothian She questioned herself on the subject over and over again and found herself bound to admit that such was the fact At last about five o clock having reasoned much with herself and rebuked herself for her own timidity she descended into the drawing room Lady Glencora having promised that she would at that hour be there and on opening the door became immediately conscious that she was in the presence of her august relative There sat Lady Midlothian in a great chair opposite the fire and Lady Glencora sat near to her on a stool One of the Miss Pallisers was reading in a further part of the room and there was no one else present in the chamber The Countess of Midlothian was a very little woman between sixty and seventy years of age who must have been very pretty in her youth At present she made no pretension either to youth or beauty as some ladies above sixty will still do but sat confessedly an old woman in all her external relations She wore a round bonnet which came much over her face being accustomed to continue the use of her bonnet till dinner time when once she had been forced by circumstances to put it on She wore a short cloak which fitted close to her person and though she occupied a great arm chair sat perfectly upright looking at the fire Very small she was but she carried in her grey eyes and sharp cut features a certain look of importance which saved her from being considered as small in importance Alice as soon as she saw her knew that she was a lady over whom no easy victory could be obtained Here is Alice said Lady Glencora rising as her cousin entered the room Alice let me introduce you to Lady Midlothian Alice as she came forward was able to assume an easy demeanour even though her heart within was failing her She put out her hand leaving it to the elder lady to speak the first words of greeting I am glad at last to be able to make your acquaintance my dear said Lady Midlothian very glad But still Alice did not speak Your aunt Lady Macleod is one of my oldest friends and I have heard her speak of you very often And Lady Macleod has often spoken to me of your ladyship said Alice Then we know each other s names said the Countess and it will be well that we should be acquainted with each other s persons I am becoming an old woman and if I did not learn to know you now or very shortly I might never do so Alice could not help thinking that even under those circumstances neither might have had so far as that was concerned much cause of sorrow but she did not say so She was thinking altogether of Lady Midlothian s letter to her and trying to calculate whether or no it would be well for her to rush away at once to the subject That Lady Midlothian would mention the letter Alice felt well assured and when could it be better mentioned than now in Glencora s presence when no other person was near them to listen to her You are very kind said Alice I would wish to be so said Lady Midlothian Blood is thicker than water my dear and I know no earthly ties that can bind people together if those of family connection will not do so Your mother when she and I were young was my dearest friend I never knew my mother said Alice feeling however as she spoke that the strength of her resistance to the old woman was beginning to give way No my dear you never did and that is to my thinking another reason why they who loved her should love you But Lady Macleod is your nearest relative on your mother s side I mean and she has done her duty by you well Indeed she has Lady Midlothian She has and others therefore have been the less called upon to interfere I only say this my dear in my own vindication feeling perhaps that my conduct needs some excuse I m sure Alice does not think that said Lady Glencora It is what I think rather than what Alice thinks that concerns my own shortcomings said Lady Midlothian with a smile which was intended to be pleasant But I have wished to make up for former lost opportunities Alice knew that she was about to refer to her letter and trembled I am very anxious now to be reckoned one of Alice Vavasor s friends if she will allow me to become so I can only be too proud if If what my dear said the old lady I believe that she meant to be gracious but there was something in her manner or perhaps rather in her voice so repellant that Alice felt that they could hardly become true friends If what my dear Alice means began Lady Glencora Let Alice say what she means herself said Lady Midlothian I hardly know how to say what I do mean said Alice whose spirit within her was rising higher as the occasion for using it came upon her I am assured that you and I Lady Midlothian differ very much as to a certain matter and as it is one in which I must be guided by my own opinion and not that of any other person perhaps You mean about mister Grey Yes said Alice I mean about mister Grey I think so much about that matter and your happiness as therein concerned that when I heard that you were here I was determined to take Matching in my way to London so that I might have an opportunity of speaking to you Then you knew that Alice was here said Lady Glencora Of course I did I suppose you have heard all the history Glencora Lady Glencora was forced to acknowledge that she had heard the history the history being poor Alice s treatment of mister Grey And what do you think of it Both Alice and her hostess looked round to the further end of the room in which Miss Palliser was reading intending thus to indicate that the lady knew as yet none of the circumstances and that there could be no good reason why she should be instructed in them at this moment Perhaps another time and another place may be better said Lady Midlothian but I must go the day after to morrow indeed I thought of going to morrow Oh Lady Midlothian exclaimed Lady Glencora You must regard this as merely a passing visit made upon business But as I was saying when shall I get an opportunity of speaking to Alice where we need not be interrupted Lady Glencora suggested her room up stairs and offered the use of it then or on that night when the world should be about to go to bed But the idea of this premeditated lecture was terrible to Alice and she determined that she would not endure it Lady Midlothian it would really be of no use Of no use my dear No indeed I did get your letter you know And as you have not answered it I have come all this way to see you I shall be so sorry if I give offence but it is a subject which I cannot bring myself to discuss she was going to say with a stranger but she was able to check herself before the offensive word was uttered which I cannot bring myself to discuss with any one But you don t mean to say that you won t see me I will not talk upon that matter said Alice I will not do it even with Lady Macleod No said Lady Midlothian and her sharp grey eyes now began to kindle with anger and therefore it is so very necessary that other friends should interfere But I will endure no interference said Alice either from persons who are friends or who are not friends And as she spoke she rose from her chair You must forgive me Lady Midlothian if I say that I can have no conversation with you on this matter Then she walked out of the room leaving the Countess and Lady Glencora together As she went Miss Palliser lifted her eyes from her book and knew that there had been a quarrel but I doubt if she had heard any of the words which had been spoken The most self willed young woman I ever met in my life said Lady Midlothian as soon as Alice was gone Illustration The most self willed young woman I ever met in my life I knew very well how it would be said Lady Glencora But it is quite frightful my dear She has been engaged with the consent of all her friends to this young man I know all about it But you must think she is very wrong I don t quite understand her but I suppose she fears they would not be happy together Understand her I should think not nobody can understand her A young woman to become engaged to a gentleman in that way before all the world as one may say to go to his house as I am told and talk to the servants and give orders about the furniture and then turn round and simply say that she has changed her mind She hasn t given the slightest reason to my knowledge And Lady Midlothian as she insisted on the absolute iniquity of Alice s proceedings almost startled Lady Glencora by the eagerness of her countenance Lady Midlothian had been one of those who even now not quite two years ago had assisted in obtaining the submission of Lady Glencora herself Lady Midlothian seemed on the present occasion to remember nothing of this but Lady Glencora remembered it very exactly I shall not give it up continued Lady Midlothian I have the greatest possible objection to her father who contrived to connect himself with our family in a most shameful manner without the slightest encouragement I don t think I have spoken to him since but I shall see him now and tell him my opinion Alice held her ground and avoided all further conversation with Lady Midlothian A message came to her through Lady Glencora imploring her to give way but she was quite firm Good bye to you Lady Midlothian said to her as she went Even yet I hope that things may go right and if so you will find that I can forget and forgive If perseverance merits success said Lady Glencora to Alice she ought to succeed But she won t succeed said Alice CHAPTER XXVII The Priory Ruins Lady Midlothian went away on her road to London on the Wednesday morning and Alice was to follow her on the next day It was now December and the weather was very clear and frosty but at night there was bright moonlight On this special night the moon would be full and Lady Glencora had declared that she and Alice would go out amidst the ruins It was no secret engagement having been canvassed in public and having been met with considerable discouragement by some of the party mister Palliser had remarked that the night air would be very cold and mister Bott had suggested all manner of evil consequences Had mister Palliser alone objected Lady Glencora might have given way but mister Bott s word riveted her purpose We are not going to be frightened Lady Glencora said People do not generally walk out at night in December mister Palliser observed That s just the reason why we want to do it said Lady Glencora But we shall wrap ourselves up and nobody need be afraid Jeffrey we shall expect you to stand sentinel at the old gate and guard us from the ghosts Jeffrey Palliser bargaining that he might be allowed a cigar promised that he would do as he was bidden The party at Matching Priory had by this time become very small There were indeed no guests left not counting those of the Palliser family excepting Miss Vavasor mister Bott and an old lady who had been a great friend of mister Palliser s mother It was past ten in the evening when Lady Glencora declared that the time had arrived for them to carry out their purpose She invited the two Miss Pallisers to join her but they declined urging their fear of the night air and showing by their manner that they thought the proposition a very imprudent one mister Bott offered to accompany them but Lady Glencora declined his attendance very stoutly No indeed mister Bott you were one of those who preached a sermon against my dissipation in the morning and I m not going to allow you to join it now the time for its enjoyment has come My dear Lady Glencora if I were you indeed I wouldn t said the old lady looking round towards mister Palliser My dear missus Marsham if you were me indeed you would and Lady Glencora also looked at her husband I think it a foolish thing to do said mister Palliser sternly If you forbid it of course we won t go said Lady Glencora Forbid it no I shall not forbid it Allons donc said Lady Glencora She and Alice were already muffled in cloaks and thick shawls and Alice now followed her out of the room There was a door which opened from the billiard room out on to the grand terrace which ran in front of the house and here they found Jeffrey Palliser already armed with his cigar Alice to tell the truth would much have preferred to abandon the expedition but she had felt that it would be cowardly in her to desert Lady Glencora There had not arisen any very close intimacy between her and mister Palliser but she entertained a certain feeling that mister Palliser trusted her and liked her to be with his wife She would have wished to justify this supposed confidence and was almost sure that mister Palliser expected her to do so in this instance She did say a word or two to her cousin up stairs urging that perhaps her husband would not like it Let him say so plainly said Lady Glencora and I ll give it up instantly But I m not going to be lectured out of my purposes secondhand by mister Bott or old Mother Marsham I understand all these people my dear And if you throw me over Alice I ll never forgive you Lady Glencora added After this Alice resolved that she would not throw her friend over She was afraid to do so But she was also becoming a little afraid of her friend afraid that she would be driven some day either to throw her over or to say words to her that would be very unpalatable Now Jeffrey said Lady Glencora as they walked abreast along the broad terrace towards the ruins when we get under the old gateway you must let me and Alice go round the dormitory and the chapel alone Then we ll come back by the cloisters and we ll take another turn outside with you The outside is the finest by this light only I want to show Alice something by ourselves You re not afraid I know and if Miss Vavasor is not Miss Vavasor who I think would have allowed you to call her by her other name on such an occasion as this is never afraid Glencora how dare you say so said Alice I really think we had better go back She felt herself to be very angry with her cousin She almost began to fear that she had mistaken her and had thought better of her than she had deserved What she had now said struck Alice as being vulgar as being premeditated vulgarity and her annoyance was excessive Of course mister Palliser would think that she was a consenting party to the proposition made to him Go back said Glencora No indeed We ll go on and leave him here Then he can call nobody anything Don t be angry with me she said as soon as they were out of hearing The truth is this if you choose to have him for your husband you may But if I do not choose Then there can be no harm done and I will tell him so But Alice think of this Whom will you meet that would suit you better And you need not decide now You need not say a word but leave me to tell him that if it is to be thought of at all it cannot be thought of till he meets you in London Trust me you will be safe with me You shall tell him nothing of the kind said Alice I believe you to be joking throughout and I think the joke is a bad one No there you wrong me Indeed I am not joking I know that in what I am saying I am telling you the simple truth He has said enough to me to justify me in saying so Alice think of it all It would reconcile me to much and it would be something to be the mother of the future Duke of Omnium To me it would be nothing said Alice less than nothing I mean to say that the temptation is one so easily resisted that it acts in the other way Don t say anything more about it Glencora If you don t wish it I will not No I do not wish it I don t think I ever saw moonlight so bright as this Look at the lines of that window against the light They are clearer than you ever see them in the day They were now standing just within the gateway of the old cruciform chapel having entered the transept from a ruined passage which was supposed to have connected the church with the dormitory The church was altogether roofless but the entire walls were standing The small clerestory windows of the nave were perfect and the large windows of the two transepts and of the west end were nearly so Of the opposite window which had formed the back of the choir very little remained The top of it with all its tracery was gone and three broken upright mullions of uneven heights alone remained This was all that remained of the old window but a transom or cross bar of stone had been added to protect the carved stone work of the sides and save the form of the aperture from further ruin That this transom was modern was to be seen from the magnificent height and light grace of the workmanship in the other windows in which the long slender mullions rose from the lower stage or foundation of the whole up into the middle tracery of the arch without protection or support and then lost themselves among the curves not running up into the roof or soffit and there holding on as though unable to stand alone Such weakness as that had not as yet shown itself in English church architecture when Matching Priory was built Illustration The Priory Ruins Is it not beautiful said Glencora I do love it so And there is a peculiar feeling of cold about the chill of the moon different from any other cold It makes you wrap yourself up tight but it does not make your teeth chatter and it seems to go into your senses rather than into your bones But I suppose that s nonsense she added after a pause Not more so than what people are supposed to talk by moonlight That s unkind I d like what I say on such an occasion to be more poetical or else more nonsensical than what other people say under the same circumstances And now I ll tell you why I always think of you when I come here by moonlight But I suppose you don t often come Yes I do that is to say I did come very often when we had the full moon in August The weather wasn t like this and I used to run out through the open windows and nobody knew where I was gone I made him come once but he didn t seem to care about it I told him that part of the refectory wall was falling so he looked at that and had a mason sent the next day If anything is out of order he has it put to rights at once There would have been no ruins if all the Pallisers had been like him So much the better for the world No I say no Things may live too long But now I m going to tell you Do you remember that night I brought you home from the play to Queen Anne Street Indeed I do very well Alice had occasion to remember it for it had been in the carriage on that evening that she had positively refused to give any aid to her cousin in that matter relating to Burgo Fitzgerald And do you remember how the moon shone then Yes I think I do I know I do As we came round the corner out of Cavendish Square he was standing there and a friend of yours was standing with him What friend of mine Never mind that it does not matter now Do you mean my cousin George Yes I do mean your cousin and oh Alice dear Alice I don t know why I should love you for if you had not been hardhearted that night stony cruel in your hard propriety I should have gone with him then and all this icy coldness would have been prevented She was standing quite close to Alice and as she spake she shook with shivering and wrapped her furs closer and still closer about her You are very cold said Alice We had better go in No I am not cold not in that way I won t go in yet Jeffrey will come to us directly Yes we should have escaped that night if you would have allowed him to come into your house Ah well we didn t and there s an end of it But Glencora you cannot regret it Not regret it Alice where can your heart be Or have you a heart Not regret it I would give everything I have in the world to have been true to him They told me that he would spend my money Though he should have spent every farthing of it I regret it though he should have made me a beggar I regret it They told me that he would ill use me and desert me perhaps beat me I do not believe it but even though that should have been so I regret it It is better to have a false husband than to be a false wife Glencora do not speak like that Do not try to make me think that anything could tempt you to be false to your vows Tempt me to be false Why child it has been all false throughout I never loved him How can you talk in that way when you know that I never loved him They browbeat me and frightened me till I did as I was told and now what am I now You are his honest wife Glencora listen to me And Alice took hold of her arm No she said no I am not honest By law I am his wife but the laws are liars I am not his wife I will not say the thing that I am When I went to him at the altar I knew that I did not love the man that was to be my husband But him Burgo I love him with all my heart and soul I could stoop at his feet and clean his shoes for him and think it no disgrace Oh Cora my friend do not say such words as those Remember what you owe your husband and yourself and come away I do know what I owe him and I will pay it him Alice if I had a child I think I would be true to him Think I know I would though I had no hour of happiness left to me in my life But what now is the only honest thing that I can do Why leave him so leave him that he may have another wife and be the father of a child What injury shall I do him by leaving him He does not love me you know yourself that he does not love me I know that he does Alice that is untrue He does not and you have seen clearly that it is so It may be that he can love no woman But another woman would give him a son and he would be happy I tell you that every day and every night every hour of every day and of every night I am thinking of the man I love I have nothing else to think of I have no occupation no friends no one to whom I care to say a word But I am always talking to Burgo in my thoughts and he listens to me I dream that his arm is round me Oh Glencora Well Do you begrudge me that I should tell you the truth You have said that you would be my friend and you must bear the burden of my friendship And now this is what I want to tell you Immediately after Christmas we are to go to Monkshade and he will be there Lady Monk is his aunt You must not go No power should take you there That is easily said child but all the same I must go I told mister Palliser that he would be there and he said it did not signify He actually said that it did not signify I wonder whether he understands what it is for people to love each other whether he has ever thought about it You must tell him plainly that you will not go I did I told him plainly as words could tell him Glencora he said and you know the way he looks when he means to be lord and master and put on the very husband indeed This is an annoyance which you must bear and overcome It suits me that we should go to Monkshade and it does not suit me that there should be any one whom you are afraid to meet Could I tell him that he would lose his wife if I did go Could I threaten him that I would throw myself into Burgo s arms if that opportunity were given to me You are very wise and very prudent What would you have had me say I would have you now tell him everything rather than go to that house Alice look here I know what I am and what I am like to become I loathe myself and I loathe the thing that I am thinking of I could have clung to the outside of a man s body to his very trappings and loved him ten times better than myself ay even though he had ill treated me if I had been allowed to choose a husband for myself Burgo would have spent my money all that it would have been possible for me to give him But there would have been something left and I think that by that time I could have won even him to care for me But with that man Alice you are very wise What am I to do Alice had no doubt as to what her cousin should do She should be true to her marriage vow whether that vow when made were true or false She should be true to it as far as truth would now carry her And in order that she might be true she should tell her husband as much as might be necessary to induce him to spare her the threatened visit to Monkshade All that she said to Lady Glencora as they walked slowly across the chapel But Lady Glencora was more occupied with her own thoughts than with her friend s advice Here s Jeffrey she said What an unconscionable time we have kept him Don t mention it he said And I shouldn t have come to you now only that I thought I should find you both freezing into marble We are not such cold blooded creatures as that are we Alice said Lady Glencora And now we ll go round the outside only we must not stay long or we shall frighten those two delicious old duennas missus Marsham and mister Bott These last words were said as it were in a whisper to Alice but they were so whispered that there was no real attempt to keep them from the ears of mister Jeffrey Palliser Glencora Alice thought should not have allowed the word duenna to have passed her lips in speaking to any one but above all she should not have done so in the hearing of mister Palliser s cousin They walked all round the ruin on a raised gravel path which had been made there and Alice who could hardly bring herself to speak so full was her mind of that which had just been said to her was surprised to find that Glencora could go on in her usual light humour chatting as though there were no weight within her to depress her spirits CHAPTER XXVIII Alice Leaves the Priory As they came in at the billiard room door mister Palliser was there to meet them You must be very cold he said to Glencora who entered first No indeed said Glencora but her teeth were chattering and her whole appearance gave the lie to her words Jeffrey said mister Palliser turning to his cousin I am angry with you You at least should have known better than to have allowed her to remain so long Then mister Palliser turned away and walked his wife off taking no notice whatsoever of Miss Vavasor Alice felt the slight and understood it all He had told her plainly enough though not in words that he had trusted his wife with her and that she had betrayed the trust She might have brought Glencora in within five or six minutes instead of allowing her to remain out there in the freezing night air for nearly three quarters of an hour That was the accusation which mister Palliser made against her and he made it with the utmost severity He asked no question of her whether she were cold He spoke no word to her nor did he even look at her She might get herself away to her bedroom as she pleased Alice understood all this completely and though she knew that she had not deserved such severity she was not inclined to resent it There was so much in mister Palliser s position that was to be pitied that Alice could not find it in her heart to be angry with him He is provoked with us now said Jeffrey Palliser standing with her for a moment in the billiard room as he handed her a candle He is afraid that she will have caught cold Yes and he thinks it wrong that she should remain out at night so long You can easily understand Miss Vavasor that he has not much sympathy for romance I dare say he is right said Alice not exactly knowing what to say and not being able to forget what had been said about herself and Jeffrey Palliser when they first left the house Romance usually means nonsense I believe That is not Glencora s doctrine No but she is younger than I am My feet are very cold mister Palliser and I think I will go up to my room Good night said Jeffrey offering her his hand I think it so hard that you should have incurred his displeasure It will not hurt me said Alice smiling No but he does not forget Even that will not hurt me Good night mister Palliser As it is the last night may I say good night Alice I shall be away to morrow before you are up He still held her hand but it had not been in his for half a minute and she had thought nothing of that nor did she draw it away even now suddenly No said she Glencora was very wrong there doing an injury without meaning it to both of us There can be no possible reason why you should call me otherwise than is customary Can there never be a reason No mister Palliser Good night and if I am not to see you to morrow morning good bye You will certainly not see me to morrow morning Good bye Had it not been for this folly of Glencora s our acquaintance would have been very pleasant To me it has been very pleasant Good night Then she left him and went up alone to her own room Whether or no other guests were still left in the drawing room she did not know but she had seen that mister Palliser took his wife up stairs and therefore she considered herself right in presuming that the party was broken up for the night mister Palliser Plantagenet Palliser according to all rules of courtesy should have said a word to her as he went but as I have said before Alice was disposed to overlook his want of civility on this occasion So she went up alone to her room and was very glad to find herself able to get close to a good fire She was in truth very cold cold to her bones in spite of what Lady Glencora had said on behalf of the moonlight They two had been standing all but still during the greater part of the time that they had been talking and Alice as she sat herself down found that her feet were numbed with the damp that had penetrated through her boots Certainly mister Palliser had reason to be angry that his wife should have remained out in the night air so long though perhaps not with Alice And then she began to think of what had been told her and to try to think of what under such circumstances it behoved her to do She could not doubt that Lady Glencora had intended to declare that if opportunity offered itself she would leave her husband and put herself under the protection of mister Fitzgerald and Alice moreover had become painfully conscious that the poor deluded unreasoning creature had taught herself to think that she might excuse herself for this sin to her own conscience by the fact that she was childless and that she might thus give to the man who had married her an opportunity of seeking another wife who might give him an heir Alice well knew how insufficient such an excuse would be even to the wretched woman who had framed it for herself But still it would operate manifestly had already operated on her mind teaching her to hope that good might come out of evil Alice who was perfectly clearsighted as regarded her cousin however much impaired her vision might have been with reference to herself saw nothing but absolute ruin ruin of the worst and most intolerable description in the plan which Lady Glencora seemed to have formed To her it was black in the depths of hell and she knew that to Glencora also it was black I loathe myself Glencora had said and the thing that I am thinking of What was Alice to do under these circumstances mister Palliser she was aware had quarrelled with her for in his silent way he had first shown that he had trusted her as his wife s friend and then on this evening he had shown that he had ceased to trust her But she cared little for this If she told him that she wished to speak to him he would listen let his opinion of her be what it might and having listened he would surely act in some way that would serve to save his wife What mister Palliser might think of herself Alice cared but little But then there came to her an idea that was in every respect feminine that in such a matter she had no right to betray her friend When one woman tells the story of her love to another woman the confidant always feels that she will be a traitor if she reveals the secret Had Lady Glencora made Alice believe that she meditated murder or robbery Alice would have had no difficulty in telling the tale and thus preventing the crime But now she hesitated feeling that she would disgrace herself by betraying her friend And after all was it not more than probable that Glencora had no intention of carrying out a threat the very thought of which must be terrible to herself As she was thinking of all this sitting in her dressing gown close over the fire there came a loud knock at the door which as she had turned the key she was forced to answer in person She opened the door and there was Iphigenia Palliser Jeffrey s cousin and mister Palliser s cousin Miss Vavasor she said I know that I am taking a great liberty but may I come into your room for a few minutes I so much wish to speak to you Alice of course bade her enter and placed a chair for her by the fire Alice Vavasor had made very little intimacy with either of the two Miss Pallisers It had seemed to herself as though there had been two parties in the house and that she had belonged to the one which was headed by the wife whereas the Miss Pallisers had been naturally attached to that of the husband These ladies as she had already seen almost idolized their cousin and though Plantagenet Palliser had till lately treated Alice with the greatest personal courtesy there had been no intimacy of friendship between them and consequently none between her and his special adherents Nor was either of these ladies prone to sudden friendship with such a one as Alice Vavasor A sudden friendship with a snuffy president of a foreign learned society with some personally unknown lady employed on female emigration was very much in their way But Alice had not shown herself to be useful or learned and her special intimacy with Lady Glencora had marked her out as in some sort separated from them and their ways I know that I am intruding said Miss Palliser as though she were almost afraid of Alice Oh dear no said Alice If I can do anything for you I shall be very happy You are going to morrow and if I did not speak to you now I should have no other opportunity Glencora seems to be very much attached to you and we all thought it so good a thing that she should have such a friend I hope you have not all changed your minds said Alice with a faint smile thinking as she spoke that the all must have been specially intended to include the master of the house Oh no by no means I did not mean that My cousin mister Palliser I mean liked you so much when you came And he does not like me quite so much now because I went out in the moonlight with his wife Isn t that it Well no Miss Vavasor I had not intended to mention that at all I had not indeed I have seen him certainly since you came in just for a minute and he is vexed But it is not about that that I would speak to you I saw plainly enough that he was angry with me He thought you would have brought her in earlier And why should he think that I can manage his wife She was the mistress out there as she is in here mister Palliser has been unreasonable Not that it signifies I don t think he has been unreasonable I don t indeed Miss Vavasor He has certainly been vexed Sometimes he has much to vex him You see Glencora is very young mister Bott also had declared that Lady Glencora was very young It was probable therefore that that special phrase had been used in some discussion among mister Palliser s party as to Glencora s foibles So thought Alice as the remembrance of the word came upon her She is not younger than when mister Palliser married her Alice said You mean that if a man marries a young wife he must put up with the trouble That is a matter of course But their ages in truth are very suitable My cousin himself is not yet thirty When I say that Glencora is young You mean that she is younger in spirit and perhaps in conduct than he had expected to find her But you are not to suppose that he complains Miss Vavasor He is much too proud for that I should hope so said Alice thinking of mister Bott I hardly know how to explain to you what I wish to say or how far I may be justified in supposing that you will believe me to be acting solely on Glencora s behalf I think you have some influence with her and I know no one else that has any My friendship with her is not of very long date Miss Palliser I know it but still there is the fact Am I not right in supposing In supposing what In supposing that you had heard the name of mister Fitzgerald as connected with Glencora s before her marriage with my cousin Alice paused a moment before she answered Yes I had she then said And I think you were agreed with her other relations that such a marriage would have been very dreadful I never spoke of the matter in the presence of any relatives of Glencora s You must understand Miss Palliser that though I am her far away cousin I do not even know her nearest connections I never saw Lady Midlothian till she came here the other day But you advised her to abandon mister Fitzgerald Never I know she was much with you just at that time I used to see her certainly Then there was a pause and Miss Palliser in truth scarcely knew how to go on There had been a hardness about Alice which her visitor had not expected an unwillingness to speak or even to listen which made Miss Palliser almost wish that she were out of the room She had however mentioned Burgo Fitzgerald s name and out of the room now she could not go without explaining why she had done so But at this point Alice came suddenly to her assistance Just then she was often with me said Alice continuing her reply and there was much talk between us about mister Fitzgerald What was my advice then can be of little matter but in this we shall be both agreed Miss Palliser that Glencora now should certainly not be called upon to be in his company She has told you then Yes she has told me That he is to be at Lady Monk s She has told me that mister Palliser expects her to meet him at the place to which they are going when they leave the Duke s and that she thinks it hard that she should be subjected to such a trial It should be no trial Miss Vavasor How can it be otherwise Come Miss Palliser if you are her friend be fair to her I am her friend but I am above everything my cousin s friend He has told me that she has complained of having to meet this man He declares that it should be nothing to her and that the fear is an idle folly It should be nothing to her but still the fear may not be idle Is there any reason any real reason why she should not go Miss Vavasor I conjure you to tell me even though in doing so you must cast so deep reproach upon her name Anything will be better than utter disgrace and sin I conceive that I cast no reproach upon her in saying that there is great reason why she should not go to Monkshade You think there is absolute grounds for interference I must tell him you know openly what he would have to fear I think nay Miss Palliser I know that there is ample reason why you should save her from being taken to Monkshade if you have the power to do so I can only do it or attempt to do it by telling him just what you tell me Then tell him You must have thought of that I suppose before you came to me Yes yes Miss Vavasor I had thought of it No doubt I had thought of it But I had believed all through that you would assure me that there was no danger I believed that you would have said that she was innocent And she is innocent said Alice rising from her chair as though she might thus give emphasis to words which she hardly dared to speak above a whisper She is innocent Who accuses her of guilt You ask me a question on his behalf On hers and on his Miss Vavasor A question which I feel myself bound to answer truly to answer with reference to the welfare of them both but I will not have it said that I accuse her She had been attached to mister Fitzgerald when your cousin married her He knew that this had been the case She told him the whole truth In a worldly point of view her marriage with mister Fitzgerald would probably have been very imprudent It would have been utterly ruinous Perhaps so I say nothing about that But as it turned out she gave up her own wishes and married your cousin I don t know about her own wishes Miss Vavasor It is what she did She would have married mister Fitzgerald had she not been hindered by the advice of those around her It cannot be supposed that she has forgotten him in so short a time There can be no guilt in her remembrance There is guilt in loving any other than her husband Then Miss Palliser it was her marriage that was guilty and not her love But all that is done and past It should be your cousin s object to teach her to forget mister Fitzgerald and he will not do that by taking her to a house where that gentleman is staying She has said so much to you herself I do not know that I need declare to you what she has said herself You have asked me a question and I have answered it and I am thankful to you for having asked it What object can either of us have but to assist her in her position And to save him from dishonour I had so hoped that this was simply a childish dread on her part It is not so It is no childish dread If you have the power to prevent her going to Lady Monk s I implore you to use it Indeed I will ask you to promise me that you will do so After what you have said I have no alternative Exactly There is no alternative Either for his sake or for hers there is none Thereupon Miss Palliser got up and wishing her companion good night took her departure Throughout the interview there had been no cordiality of feeling between them There was no pretence of friendship even as they were parting They acknowledged that their objects were different That of Alice was to save Lady Glencora from ruin That of Miss Palliser was to save her cousin from disgrace with perhaps some further honest desire to prevent sorrow and sin One loved Lady Glencora and the other clearly did not love her But nevertheless Alice felt that Miss Palliser in coming to her had acted well and that to herself this coming had afforded immense relief Some step would now be taken to prevent that meeting which she had so deprecated and it would be taken without any great violation of confidence on her part She had said nothing as to which Lady Glencora could feel herself aggrieved On the next morning she was down in the breakfast room soon after nine and had not been in the room many minutes before mister Palliser entered The carriage is ordered for you at a quarter before ten he said and I have come down to give you your breakfast There was a smile on his face as he spoke and Alice could see that he intended to make himself pleasant Will you allow me to give you yours instead said she But as it happened no giving on either side was needed as Alice s breakfast was brought to her separately Glencora bids me say that she will be down immediately said mister Palliser Alice then made some inquiry with reference to the effects of last night s imprudence which received only a half pronounced reply mister Palliser was willing to be gracious but did not intend to be understood as having forgiven the offence The Miss Pallisers then came in together and after them mister Bott closely followed by missus Marsham and all of them made inquiries after Lady Glencora as though it was to be supposed that she might probably be in a perilous state after what she had undergone on the previous evening mister Bott was particularly anxious The frost was so uncommonly severe said he that any delicate person like Lady Glencora must have suffered in remaining out so long The insinuation that Alice was not a delicate person and that as regarded her the severity of the frost was of no moment was very open and was duly appreciated mister Bott was aware that his great patron had in some sort changed his opinion about Miss Vavasor and he was of course disposed to change his own A fortnight since Alice might have been as delicate as she pleased in mister Bott s estimation I hope you do not consider Lady Glencora delicate said Alice to mister Palliser She is not robust said the husband By no means said missus Marsham Indeed no said mister Bott Alice knew that she was being accused of being robust herself but she bore it in silence Ploughboys and milkmaids are robust and the accusation was a heavy one Alice however thought that she would not have minded it if she could have allowed herself to reply but this at the moment of her going away she could not do I think she is as strong as the rest of us said Iphigenia Palliser who felt that after last night she owed something to Miss Vavasor As some of us said mister Bott determined to persevere in his accusation At this moment Lady Glencora entered and encountered the eager inquiries of her two duennas These however she quickly put aside and made her way up to Alice The last morning has come then she said Yes indeed said Alice mister Palliser must have thought that I was never going On the other hand said he I have felt much obliged to you for staying But he said it coldly and Alice began to wish that she had never seen Matching Priory Obliged exclaimed Lady Glencora I can t tell you how much obliged I am Oh Alice I wish you were going to stay with us We are leaving this in a week s time said mister Palliser Of course we are said Lady Glencora With all my heart I wish we were not Dear Alice I suppose we shall not meet till we are all in town You will let me know when you come up said Alice I will send to you instantly and Alice I will write to you from Gatherum or from Monkshade Alice could not help looking around and catching Miss Palliser s eye Miss Palliser was standing with her foot on the fender but was so placed that she could see Alice She made a slight sign with her head as much as to say that Lady Glencora must have no opportunity of writing from the latter place but she said nothing Then the carriage was announced and mister Palliser took Alice out on his arm Don t come to the door Glencora he said I especially wish you not to do so The two cousins then kissed each other and Alice went away to the carriage Good bye Miss Vavasor said mister Palliser but he expressed no wish that he might see her again as his guest at Matching Priory Alice as she was driven in solitary grandeur to the railway station could not but wish that she had never gone there CHAPTER XXIX Burgo Fitzgerald On the night before Christmas Eve two men were sitting together in George Vavasor s rooms in Cecil Street It was past twelve o clock and they were both smoking there were square bottles on the table containing spirits with hot water and cold water in jugs and one of the two men was using and had been using these materials for enjoyment Vavasor had not been drinking nor did it appear as though he intended to begin There was a little weak brandy and water in a glass by his side but there it had remained untouched for the last twenty minutes His companion however had twice in that time replenished his beaker and was now puffing out the smoke of his pipe with the fury of a steamer s funnel when she has not yet burned the black off her last instalment of fresh coals This man was Burgo Fitzgerald He was as handsome as ever a man whom neither man nor woman could help regarding as a thing beautiful to behold but not the less was there in his eyes and cheeks a look of haggard dissipation of riotous living which had become wearisome by its continuance even to himself that told to all who saw him much of the history of his life Most men who drink at nights and are out till cockcrow doing deeds of darkness become red in their faces have pimpled cheeks and watery eyes and are bloated and not comfortable to be seen It is a kind dispensation of Providence who thus affords to such sinners a visible sign to be seen day by day of the injury which is being done The first approach of a carbuncle on the nose about the age of thirty has stopped many a man from drinking No one likes to have carbuncles on his nose or to appear before his female friends with eyes which look as though they were swimming in grog But to Burgo Fitzgerald Providence in her anger had not afforded this protection He became at times pale sallow worn and haggard He grew thin and still thinner At times he had been ill to death s door Among his intimate friends there were those who heard him declare frequently that his liver had become useless to him and that as for gastric juices he had none left to him But still his beauty remained The perfect form of his almost god like face was the same as ever and the brightness of his bright blue eye was never quenched On the present occasion he had come to Vavasor s room with the object of asking from him certain assistance and perhaps also some amount of advice But as regarded the latter article he was I think in the state of most men when they seek for counsellors who shall counsel them to do evil Advice administered in accordance with his own views would give him comfortable encouragement but advice on the other side he was prepared to disregard altogether These two men had known each other long and a close intimacy had existed between them in the days past previous to Lady Glencora s engagement with mister Palliser When Lady Glencora endeavoured vainly as we know to obtain aid from Alice Vavasor Burgo had been instigated to believe that Alice s cousin might assist him Any such assistance George Vavasor would have been quite ready to give Some pecuniary assistance he had given he at that time having been in good funds Perhaps he had for a moment induced Burgo to think that he could obtain for the pair the use of the house in Queen Anne Street as a point at which they might meet and from whence they might start on their journey of love All that was over Those hopes had been frustrated and Lady Glencora M Cluskie had become Lady Glencora Palliser and not Lady Glencora Fitzgerald But now other hopes had sprung up and Burgo was again looking to his friend for assistance I believe she would Burgo said as he lifted the glass to his mouth It s a thing of that sort that a man can only believe perhaps only hope till he has tried I know that she is not happy with him and I have made up my mind that I will at least ask her But he would have her fortune all the same I don t know how that would be I haven t inquired and I don t mean to inquire Of course I don t expect you or any one else to believe me but her money has no bearing on the question now Heaven knows I want money bad enough but I wouldn t take away another man s wife for money You don t mean to say you think it would be wicked I supposed you to be above those prejudices It s all very well for you to chaff It s no chaff at all I tell you fairly I wouldn t run away with any man s wife I have an old fashioned idea that when a man has got a wife he ought to be allowed to keep her Public opinion I know is against me I think he ran away with my wife said Burgo with emphasis that s the way I look at it She was engaged to me first and she really loved me while she never cared for him Nevertheless marriage is marriage and the law is against you But if I did go in for such a troublesome job at all I certainly should keep an eye upon the money It can make no difference It did make a difference I suppose when you first thought of marrying her Of course it did My people brought us together because she had a large fortune and I had none There s no doubt in the world about that And I ll tell you what I believe that old harridan of an aunt of mine is willing to do the same thing now again Of course she doesn t say as much She wouldn t dare do that but I do believe she means it I wonder where she expects to go to That s grateful on your part Upon my soul I hate her I do indeed It isn t love for me now so much as downright malice against Palliser because he baulked her project before She is a wicked old woman Some of us fellows are wicked enough you and I for instance Thank you I don t know however that I am qualified to run in a curricle with you But we are angels to such an old she devil as that You may believe me or not as you like I dare say you won t believe me I ll say I do at any rate The truth is I want to get her partly because I love her but chiefly because I do believe in my heart that she loves me It s for her sake then You are ready to sacrifice yourself to do her a good turn As for sacrificing myself that s done I m a man utterly ruined and would cut my throat to morrow for the sake of my relations if I cared enough about them I know my own condition pretty well I have made a shipwreck of everything and have now only got to go down among the breakers Only you would like to take Lady Glencora with you No by heavens But sometimes when I do think about it at all which I do as seldom as I can it seems to me that I might still become a different fellow if it were possible for me to marry her Had you married her when she was free to marry any one and when her money was her own it might have been so I think it would be quite as much so now I do indeed If I could get her once say to Italy or perhaps to Greece I think I could treat her well and live with her quietly I know that I would try Without the assistance of brandy and cigars Yes And without any money With only a little I know you ll laugh at me but I make pictures to myself of a sort of life which I think would suit us and be very different from this hideous way of living with which I have become so sick that I loathe it Something like Juan and Haidee with Planty Pall coming after you like old Lambro By the nickname of Planty Pall George Vavasor intended to designate Lady Glencora s present husband He d get a divorce of course and then we should be married I really don t think he d dislike it when it was all done They tell me he doesn t care for her You have seen her since her marriage Yes twice And have spoken to her Once only so as to be able to do more than ask her if she were well Once for about two minutes I did speak to her And what did she say She said it would be better that we should not meet When she said that I knew that she was still fond of me I could have fallen at her feet that moment only the room was full of people I do think that she is fond of me Vavasor paused a few minutes I dare say she is fond of you he then said but whether she has pluck for such a thing as this is more than I can say Probably she has not And if she has probably you would fail in carrying out your plan I must get a little money first said Burgo And that s an operation which no doubt you find more difficult every day as you grow older It seems to be much the same sort of thing I went to Magruin this morning He s the fellow that lives out near Gray s Inn Lane Just beyond the Foundling Hospital I went to him and he was quite civil about it He says I owe him over three thousand pounds but that doesn t seem to make any difference How much did you ever have from him I don t recollect that I ever absolutely had any money He got a bill of mine from a tailor who went to smash and he kept on renewing that till it grew to be ever so many bills I think he did once let me have twenty four pounds but certainly never more than that And he says he ll give you money now I suppose you told him why you wanted it I didn t name her but I told him what would make him understand that I hoped to get off with a lady who had a lot of tin I asked him for two hundred and fifty He says he ll let me have one hundred and fifty on a bill at two months for five hundred with your name to it With my name to it That s kind on his part and on yours too Of course I can t take it up at the end of two months I dare say not said Vavasor But he won t come upon you then nor for a year or more afterwards I did pay you what you lent me before Yes you did I always thought that to be a special compliment on your part And you ll find I ll pull you through now in some way If I don t succeed in this I shall go off the hooks altogether soon and if I were dead my people would pay my debts then Before the evening was over Vavasor promised the assistance asked of him He knew that he was lending his name to a man who was utterly ruined and putting it into the hands of another man who was absolutely without conscience in the use he would make of it He knew that he was creating for himself trouble and in all probability loss which he was ill able to bear But the thing was one which came within the pale of his laws Such assistance as that he might ask of others and had asked and received before now It was a reckless deed on his part but then all his doings were reckless It was consonant with his mode of life I thought you would old fellow said Burgo as he got up to go away Perhaps you know I shall pull through in this and perhaps after all some part of her fortune will come with her If so you ll be all right Perhaps I may But look here Burgo don t you give that fellow up the bill till you ve got the money into your fist You may be quite easy about that I know their tricks He and I will go to the bank together and we shall squabble there at the door about four or five odd sovereigns and at last I shall have to give him up two or three Beastly old robber I declare I think he s worse than I am myself Then Burgo Fitzgerald took a little more brandy and water and went away He was living at this time in the house of one of his relatives in Cavendish Square north of Oxford Street His uncles and his aunts and all those who were his natural friends had clung to him with a tenacity that was surprising for he had never been true to any of them and did not even pretend to like them His father with whom for many years he had not been on speaking terms was now dead but he had sisters whose husbands would still open their houses to him either in London or in the country would open their houses to him and lend him their horses and provide him with every luxury which the rich enjoy except ready money When the uttermost stress of pecuniary embarrassment would come upon him they would pay something to stave off the immediate evil And so Burgo went on Nobody now thought of saying much to reproach him It was known to be waste of words and trouble in vain They were still fond of him because he was beautiful and never vain of his beauty because in the midst of his recklessness there was always about him a certain kindliness which made him pleasant to those around him He was soft and gracious with children and would be very courteous to his lady cousins They knew that as a man he was worthless but nevertheless they loved him I think the secret of it was chiefly in this that he seemed to think so little of himself But now as he walked home in the middle of the night from Cecil Street to Cavendish Square he did think much of himself Indeed such self thoughts come naturally to all men be their outward conduct ever so reckless Every man to himself is the centre of the whole world the axle on which it all turns All knowledge is but his own perception of the things around him All love and care for others and solicitude for the world s welfare are but his own feelings as to the world s wants and the world s merits He had played his part as a centre of all things very badly Of that he was very well aware He had sense enough to know that it should be a man s lot to earn his bread after some fashion and he often told himself that never as yet had he earned so much as a penny roll He had learned to comprehend that the world s progress depends on the way in which men do their duty by each other that the progress of one generation depends on the discharge of such duties by that which preceded it and he knew that he in his generation had done nothing to promote such progress He thoroughly despised himself if there might be any good in that But on such occasions as these when the wine he had drunk was sufficient only to drive away from him the numbness of despair when he was all alone with the cold night air upon his face when the stars were bright above him and the world around him was almost quiet he would still ask himself whether there might not yet be even for him some hope of a redemption some chance of a better life in store for him He was still young wanting some years of thirty Could there be even for him some mode of extrication from his misery We know what was the mode which now at this moment was suggesting itself to him He was proposing to himself as the best thing that he could do to take away another man s wife and make himself happy with her What he had said to Vavasor as to disregarding Lady Glencora s money had been perfectly true That in the event of her going off with him some portion of her enormous wealth would still cling to her he did believe Seeing that she had no children he could not understand where else it should all go But he thought of this as it regarded her not as it regarded him When he had before made his suit to her a suit which was then honourable however disadvantageous it might have seemed to be to her he had made in his mind certain calculations as to the good things which would result to him if he were successful He would keep hounds and have three or four horses every day for his own riding and he would have no more interviews with Magruin waiting in that rogue s dingy back parlour for many a weary wretched half hour till the rogue should be pleased to show himself So far he had been mercenary but he had learned to love the girl and to care more for her than for her money and when the day of disappointment came upon him the day on which she had told him that all between them was to be over for ever he had for a few hours felt the loss of his love more than the loss of his money Then he had had no further hope No such idea as that which now filled his mind had then come upon him The girl had gone from him and married another man and there was an end of it But by degrees tidings had reached him that she was not happy reaching him through the mouths of people who were glad to exaggerate all that they had heard A whole tribe of his female relatives had been anxious to promote his marriage with Lady Glencora M Cluskie declaring that after all that was come and gone Burgo would come forth from his troubles as a man of great wealth So great was the wealth of the heiress that it might withstand even his propensities for spending That whole tribe had been bitterly disappointed and when they heard that mister Palliser s marriage had given him no child and that Lady Glencora was unhappy they made their remarks in triumph rather than in sorrow I will not say that they looked forward approvingly to such a step as that which Burgo now wished to take though as regarded his aunt Lady Monk he himself had accused her but they whispered that such things had been done and must be expected when marriages were made up as had been that marriage between mister Palliser and his bride As he walked on thinking of his project he strove hard to cheat himself into a belief that he would do a good thing in carrying Lady Glencora away from her husband Bad as had been his life he had never before done aught so bad as that The more fixed his intention became the more thoroughly he came to perceive how great and grievous was the crime which he contemplated To elope with another man s wife no longer appeared to him to be a joke at which such men as he might smile But he tried to think that in this case there would be special circumstances which would almost justify him and also her They had loved each other and had sworn to love each other with constancy There had been no change in the feelings or even in the wishes of either of them But cold people had come between them with cold calculations and had separated them She had been he told himself made to marry a man she did not love If they two loved each other truly would it not still be better that they should come together Would not the sin be forgiven on account of the injustice which had been done to them Had mister Palliser a right to expect more from a wife who had been made to marry him without loving him Then he reverted to those dreams of a life of love in some sunny country of which he had spoken to Vavasor and he strove to nourish them Vavasor had laughed at him talking of Juan and Haidee But Vavasor he said to himself was a hard cold man who had no touch of romance in his character He would not be laughed out of his plan by such as he nor would he be frightened by the threat of any Lambro who might come after him whether he might come in the guise of indignant uncle or injured husband He had crossed from Regent Street through Hanover Square and as he came out by the iron gates into Oxford Street a poor wretched girl lightly clad in thin raiment into whose bones the sharp freezing air was penetrating asked him for money Would he give her something to get drink so that for a moment she might feel the warmth of her life renewed Such midnight petitions were common enough in his ears and he was passing on without thinking of her But she was urgent and took hold of him For love of God she said if it s only a penny to get a glass of gin Feel my hand how cold it is And she strove to put it up against his face He looked round at her and saw that she was very young sixteen perhaps at the most and that she had once nay very lately been exquisitely pretty There still lingered about her eyes some remains of that look of perfect innocency and pure faith which had been hers not more than twelve months since And now at midnight in the middle of the streets she was praying for a pennyworth of gin as the only comfort she knew or could expect You are cold said he trying to speak to her cheerily Cold said she repeating the word and striving to wrap herself closer in her rags as she shivered Oh God if you knew what it was to be as cold as I am I have nothing in the world not one penny not a hole to lie in We are alike then said Burgo with a slight low laugh I also have nothing You cannot be poorer than I am You poor she said And then she looked up into his face Gracious how beautiful you are Such as you are never poor He laughed again in a different tone He always laughed when any one told him of his beauty I am a deal poorer than you my girl he said You have nothing I have thirty thousand pounds worse than nothing But come along and I will get you something to eat Will you said she eagerly Then looking up at him again she exclaimed Oh you are so handsome He took her to a public house and gave her bread and meat and beer and stood by her while she ate it She was shy with him then and would fain have taken it to a corner by herself had he allowed her He perceived this and turned his back to her but still spoke to her a word or two as she ate The woman at the bar who served him looked at him wonderingly staring into his face and the pot boy woke himself thoroughly that he might look at Burgo and the waterman from the cab stand stared at him and women who came in for gin looked almost lovingly up into his eyes He regarded them all not at all showing no feeling of disgrace at his position and no desire to carry himself as a ruffler He quietly paid what was due when the girl had finished her meal and then walked with her out of the shop And now said he what must I do with you If I give you a shilling can you get a bed She told him that she could get a bed for sixpence Then keep the other sixpence for your breakfast said he But you must promise me that you will buy no gin to night She promised him and then he gave her his hand as he wished her good night his hand which it had been the dearest wish of Lady Glencora to call her own She took it and pressed it to her lips I wish I might once see you again she said because you are so good and so beautiful He laughed again cheerily and walked on crossing the street towards Cavendish Square She stood looking at him till he was out of sight and then as she moved away let us hope to the bed which his bounty had provided and not to a gin shop she exclaimed to herself again and again Gracious how beautiful he was He s a good un the woman at the public house had said as soon as he left it but my did you ever see a man s face handsome as that fellow s Illustration Burgo Fitzgerald Poor Burgo All who had seen him since life had begun with him had loved him and striven to cherish him And with it all to what a state had he come Poor Burgo had his eyes been less brightly blue and his face less godlike in form it may be that things would have gone better with him A sweeter tempered man than he never lived nor one who was of a kinder nature At this moment he had barely money about him to take him down to his aunt s house at Monkshade and as he had promised to be there before Christmas Day he was bound to start on the next morning before help from mister Magruin was possible Nevertheless out of his very narrow funds he had given half a crown to comfort the poor creature who had spoken to him in the street CHAPTER XXX Containing a Love Letter

none	none	If a woman she had said again won t venture her fortune for the man she loves her love is not worth having All this George Vavasor remembered now and as he remembered it he asked himself whether the woman that had once loved him would venture her fortune for him still Though his sister had pressed him on the subject with all the vehemence that she could use he had hardly hitherto made up his mind that he really desired to marry Alice 
707_138866_000003_000001	train-clean-360	There had grown upon him lately certain Bohemian propensities a love of absolute independence in his thoughts as well as actions which were antagonistic to marriage 
none	none	He was almost inclined to think that marriage was an old fashioned custom fitted indeed well enough for the usual dull life of the world at large as many men both in heathen and in Christian ages have taught themselves to think of religion but which was not adapted to his advanced intelligence If he loved any woman he loved his cousin Alice 
707_138866_000003_000003	train-clean-360	If he thoroughly respected any woman he respected her 
707_138866_000003_000004	train-clean-360	But that idea of tying himself down to a household was in itself distasteful to him 
none	none	It is a thing terrible to think of he once said to a congenial friend in these days of his life that a man should give permission to a priest to tie him to another human being like a Siamese twin so that all power of separate and solitary action should be taken from him for ever 
707_138866_000003_000006	train-clean-360	The beasts of the field do not treat each other so badly 
none	none	They neither drink themselves drunk nor eat themselves stupid nor do they bind themselves together in a union which both would have to hate In this way George Vavasor trying to imitate the wisdom of the brutes had taught himself some theories of a peculiar nature But nevertheless as he thought of Alice Vavasor on this occasion he began to feel that if a Siamese twin were necessary for him she of all others was the woman to whom he would wish to be so bound 
707_138866_000004_000000	train-clean-360	And if he did it at all he must do it now 
none	none	Under the joint instigation of himself and his sister as he thought and perhaps not altogether without reason she had broken her engagement with mister Grey That she would renew it again if left to herself he believed probable And then despite that advanced intelligence which had taught him to regard all forms and ceremonies with the eye of a philosopher he had still enough of human frailty about him to feel keenly alive to the pleasure of taking from John Grey the prize which John Grey had so nearly taken from him If Alice could have been taught to think as he did as to the absurdity of those indissoluble ties that would have been better But nothing would have been more impossible than the teaching of such a lesson to his cousin Alice George Vavasor was a man of courage and dared do most things but he would not have dared to commence the teaching of such a lesson to her 
707_138866_000005_000000	train-clean-360	And now at this moment what was his outlook into life generally 
none	none	He had very high ambition and a fair hope of gratifying it if he could only provide that things should go well with him for a year or so 
707_138866_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He was still a poor man having been once nearly a rich man but still so much of the result of his nearly acquired riches remained to him that on the strength of them he might probably find his way into Parliament 
707_138866_000005_000003	train-clean-360	He had paid the cost of the last attempt and might in a great degree carry on this present attempt on credit 
none	none	If he succeeded there would be open to him a mode of life agreeable in itself and honourable among men 
707_138866_000005_000005	train-clean-360	But how was he to bear the cost of this for the next year or the next two years 
none	none	His grandfather was still alive and would probably live over that period If he married Alice he would do so with no idea of cheating her out of her money 
707_138866_000005_000008	train-clean-360	She should learn nay she had already learned from his own lips how perilous was his enterprise 
none	none	But he knew her to be a woman who would boldly risk all in money though no consideration would induce her to stir a hair s breadth towards danger in reputation Towards teaching her that doctrine at which I have hinted he would not have dared to make an attempt but he felt that he should have no repugnance to telling her that he wanted to spend all her money in the first year or two of their married life He was still in his arm chair thinking of all this with that small untasted modicum of brandy and water beside him when he heard some distant Lambeth clock strike three from over the river Then he rose from his seat and taking the candles in his hand sat himself down at a writing desk on the other side of the room
707_138866_000006_000002	train-clean-360	 I needn t send it when it s written he said to himself and the chances are that I won t Then he took his paper and wrote as follows 
none	none	DEAR ALICE 
707_138866_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The time was when the privilege was mine of beginning my letters to you with a warmer show of love than the above word contains when I might and did call you dearest but I lost that privilege through my own folly and since that it has been accorded to another 
707_138866_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But you have found with a thorough honesty of purpose than which I know nothing greater that it has behoved you to withdraw that privilege also 
707_138866_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I need hardly say that I should not have written as I now write had you not found it expedient to do as you have done 
707_138866_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I now once again ask you to be my wife 
none	none	In spite of all that passed in those old days of all the selfish folly of which I was then guilty I think you know and at the time knew that I ever loved you I claim to say for myself that my love to you was true from first to last and I claim from you belief for that statement 
707_138866_000008_000005	train-clean-360	Indeed I do not think that you ever doubted my love 
none	none	Nevertheless when you told me that I might no longer hope to make you my wife I had no word of remonstrance that I could utter You acted as any woman would act whom love had not made a fool 
707_138866_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Then came the episode of mister Grey and bitter as have been my feelings whilst that engagement lasted I never made any attempt to come between you and the life you had chosen 
none	none	In saying this I do not forget the words which I spoke last summer at Basle when as far as I knew you still intended that he should be your husband But what I said then was nothing to that which with much violence I refrained from saying 
707_138866_000009_000005	train-clean-360	Whether you remember those few words I cannot tell but certainly you would not have remembered them would not even have noticed them had your heart been at Nethercoats 
707_138866_000010_000000	train-clean-360	But all this is nothing 
none	none	You are now again a free woman and once again I ask you to be my wife We are both older than we were when we loved before and will both be prone to think of marriage in a somewhat different light 
707_138866_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Then personal love for each other was most in our thoughts 
none	none	God forbid that it should not be much in our thoughts now Perhaps I am deceiving myself in saying that it is not even now stronger in mine than any other consideration But we have both reached that time of life when it is probable that in any proposition of marriage we should think more of our adaptability to each other than we did before 
707_138866_000010_000005	train-clean-360	For myself I know that there is much in my character and disposition to make me unfit to marry a woman of the common stamp 
none	none	You know my mode of life and what are my hopes and my chances of success 
707_138866_000010_000007	train-clean-360	I run great risk of failing 
none	none	It may be that I shall encounter ruin where I look for reputation and a career of honour The chances are perhaps more in favour of ruin than of success But whatever may be the chances I shall go on as long as any means of carrying on the fight are at my disposal 
707_138866_000010_000010	train-clean-360	If you were my wife to morrow I should expect to use your money if it were needed in struggling to obtain a seat in Parliament and a hearing there 
707_138866_000010_000011	train-clean-360	I will hardly stoop to tell you that I do not ask you to be my wife for the sake of this aid but if you were to become my wife I should expect all your cooperation with your money possibly but certainly with your warmest spirit 
707_138866_000011_000000	train-clean-360	And now once again Alice dearest Alice will you be my wife 
none	none	I have been punished and I have kissed the rod as I never kissed any other rod 
707_138866_000011_000002	train-clean-360	You cannot accuse my love 
none	none	Since the time in which I might sit with my arm round your waist I have sat with it round no other waist Since your lips were mine no other lips have been dear to me Since you were my counsellor I have had no other counsellor unless it be poor Kate whose wish that we may at length be married is second in earnestness only to my own Nor do I think you will doubt my repentance Such repentance indeed claims no merit as it has been the natural result of the loss which I have suffered Providence has hitherto been very good to me in not having made that loss irremediable by your marriage with mister Grey I wish you now to consider the matter well and to tell me whether you can pardon me and still love me Do I flatter myself when I feel that I doubt your pardon almost more than I doubt your love Think of this thing in all its bearings before you answer me 
707_138866_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I am so anxious that you should think of it that I will not expect your reply till this day week 
707_138866_000012_000002	train-clean-360	It can hardly be your desire to go through life unmarried 
none	none	I should say that it must be essential to your ambition that you should join your lot to that of some man the nature of whose aspirations would be like to your own It is because this was not so as regarded him whose suit you had accepted that you found yourself at last obliged to part from him May I not say that with us there would be no such difference 
707_138866_000012_000006	train-clean-360	It is because I believe that in this respect we are fitted for each other as man and woman seldom are fitted that I once again ask you to be my wife 
none	none	This will reach you at Vavasor where you will now be with the old squire and Kate 
707_138866_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I have told her nothing of my purpose in writing this letter 
none	none	If it should be that your answer is such as I desire I should use the opportunity of our re engagement to endeavour to be reconciled to my grandfather 
707_138866_000013_000003	train-clean-360	He has misunderstood me and has ill used me But I am ready to forgive that if he will allow me to do so 
none	none	In such case you and Kate would arrange that and I would if possible go down to Vavasor while you are there But I am galloping on a head foolishly in thinking of this and am counting up my wealth while the crockery in my basket is so very fragile One word from you will decide whether or no I shall ever bring it into market If that word is to be adverse do not say anything of a meeting between me and the Squire Under such circumstances it would be impossible 
707_138866_000014_000002	train-clean-360	But oh Alice do not let it be adverse 
707_138866_000014_000003	train-clean-360	I think you love me 
707_138866_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Your woman s pride towards me has been great and good and womanly but it has had its way and if you love me might now be taught to succumb 
707_138866_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Dear Alice will you be my wife 
707_138866_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Yours in any event most affectionately 
none	none	GEORGE VAVASOR Vavasor when he had finished his letter went back to his seat over the fire and there he sat with it close at his hand for nearly an hour Once or twice he took it up with fingers almost itching to throw it into the fire He took it up and held the corners between his forefinger and thumb throwing forward his hand towards the flame as though willing that the letter should escape from him and perish if chance should so decide 
707_138866_000018_000003	train-clean-360	But chance did not so decide and the letter was put back upon the table at his elbow 
none	none	Then when the hour was nearly over he read it again I ll bet two to one that she gives way he said to himself as he put the sheet of paper back into the envelope
707_138866_000018_000006	train-clean-360	 Women are such out and out fools Then he took his candle and carrying his letter with him went into his bedroom 
707_138866_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The next morning was the morning of Christmas Eve 
none	none	At about nine o clock a boy came into his room who was accustomed to call for orders for the day
707_138866_000019_000002	train-clean-360	 Jem he said to the boy there s half a crown lying there on the looking glass Jem looked and acknowledged the presence of the half crown 
none	none	Is it a head or a tail Jem asked the boy s master 
707_138866_000019_000004	train-clean-360	Jem scrutinized the coin and declared that the uppermost surface showed a tail 
707_138866_000019_000005	train-clean-360	 Then take that letter and post it said George Vavasor 
707_138866_000019_000006	train-clean-360	Whereupon Jem asking no question and thinking but little of the circumstances under which the command was given did take the letter and did post it 
none	none	In due accordance with postal regulations it reached Vavasor Hall and was delivered to Alice on the Christmas morning A merry Christmas did not fall to the lot of George Vavasor on the present occasion An early Christmas box he did receive in the shape of a very hurried note from his friend Burgo
707_138866_000020_000002	train-clean-360	 This will be brought to you by Stickling the note said but who Stickling was Vavasor did not know 
707_138866_000020_000003	train-clean-360	 I send the bill 
none	none	Couldn t you get the money and send it me as I don t want to go up to town again before the thing comes off 
707_138866_000020_000005	train-clean-360	You re a trump and will do the best you can 
707_138866_000020_000006	train-clean-360	Don t let that rogue off for less than a hundred and twenty Yours B F Vavasor therefore having nothing better to do spent his Christmas morning in calling on mister Magruin 
none	none	Oh mister Vavasor said Magruin really this is no morning for business
707_138866_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Time and tide wait for no man mister Magruin and my friend wants his money to morrow 
none	none	Oh mister Vavasor to morrow
707_138866_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes to morrow 
707_138866_000024_000001	train-clean-360	If time and tide won t wait neither will love Come mister Magruin out with your cheque book and don t let s have any nonsense 
707_138866_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 But is the lady sure mister Vavasor asked mister Magruin anxiously 
none	none	Ladies never are sure said Vavasor hardly more sure than bills made over to money lenders I m not going to wait here all day 
707_138866_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Are you going to give him the money 
707_138866_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Christmas day mister Vavasor 
none	none	There s no getting money in the city to day But Vavasor before he left did get the money from mister Magruin Lone hundred twenty two tens for which an acceptance at two months for Lfive hundred was given in exchange and carried it off in triumph
707_138866_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Do tell him to be punctual said mister Magruin when Vavasor took his leave 
none	none	I do so like young men to be punctual But I really think mister Fitzgerald is the most unpunctual young man I ever did know yet
707_138866_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I think he is said George Vavasor as he went away 
none	none	He ate his Christmas dinner in absolute solitude at an eating house near his lodgings It may be supposed that no man dares to dine at his club on a Christmas Day 
707_138866_000030_000002	train-clean-360	He at any rate did not so dare and after dinner he wandered about through the streets wondering within his mind how he would endure the restraints of married life 
707_138866_000030_000003	train-clean-360	And the same dull monotony of his days was continued for a week during which he waited not impatiently for an answer to his letter 
none	none	And before the end of the week the answer came CHAPTER XXXI Among the Fells Alice came down to breakfast on that Christmas morning at Vavasor Hall without making any sign as to the letter she had received The party there consisted of her grandfather her father her cousin Kate and herself They all made their Christmas salutations as is usual and Alice received and made hers as did the others without showing that anything had occurred to disturb her tranquillity Kate remarked that she had heard that morning from Aunt Greenow and promised to show Alice the letter after breakfast But Alice said no word of her own letter Why didn t your aunt come here to eat her Christmas dinner said the Squire Perhaps sir because you didn t ask her said Kate standing close to her grandfather for the old man was somewhat deaf And why didn t you ask her that is if she stands upon asking to come to her old home Nay sir but I couldn t do that without your bidding We Vavasors are not always fond of meeting each other Hold your tongue Kate I know what you mean and you should be the last to speak of it Alice my dear come and sit next to me I am much obliged to you for coming down all this way to see your old grandfather at Christmas I am indeed I only wish you had brought better news about your sweetheart She ll think better of it before long sir said her father Papa you shouldn t say that You would not wish me to marry against my own judgement I don t know much about ladies judgements said the old man It does seem to me that when a lady makes a promise she ought to keep it According to that said Kate if I were engaged to a man and found that he was a murderer I still ought to marry him But mister Grey is not a murderer said the Squire Pray pray don t talk about it said Alice If you do I really cannot sit and hear it I have given over saying anything on the subject said John Vavasor speaking as though he had already expended upon it a vast amount of paternal eloquence He had however never said more than has been recorded in these pages Alice during this conversation sat with her cousin s letter in her pocket and as yet had not even begun to think what should be the nature of her reply The Squire of Vavasor Hall was a stout old man with a red face and grey eyes which looked fiercely at you and with long grey hair and a rough grey beard which gave him something of the appearance of an old lion He was passionate unreasoning and specially impatient of all opposition but he was affectionate prone to forgive when asked to do so unselfish and hospitable He was moreover guided strictly by rules which he believed to be rules of right His grandson George had offended him very deeply had offended him and never asked his pardon He was determined that such pardon should never be given unless it were asked for with almost bended knees but nevertheless this grandson should be his heir That was his present intention The right of primogeniture could not in accordance with his theory be abrogated by the fact that it was in George Vavasor s case protected by no law The Squire could leave Vavasor Hall to whom he pleased but he could not have hoped to rest quietly in his grave should it be found that he had left it to any one but the eldest son of his own eldest son Though violent and even stern he was more prone to love than to anger and though none of those around him dared to speak to him of his grandson yet he longed in his heart for some opportunity of being reconciled to him The whole party went to church on this Christmas morning The small parish church of Vavasor an unpretending wooden structure with a single bell which might be heard tinkling for a mile or two over the fells stood all alone about half a mile from the Squire s gate Vavasor was a parish situated on the intermediate ground between the mountains of the lake country and the plains Its land was unproductive ill drained and poor and yet it possessed little or none of the beauty which tourists go to see It was all amidst the fells and very dreary There were long skirtings of dark pines around a portion of the Squire s property and at the back of the house there was a thick wood of firs running up to the top of what was there called the Beacon Hill Through this there was a wild steep walk which came out upon the moorland and from thence there was a track across the mountain to Hawes Water and Naddale and on over many miles to the further beauties of Bowness and Windermere They who knew the country and whose legs were of use to them could find some of the grandest scenery in England within reach of a walk from Vavasor Hall but to others the place was very desolate For myself I can find I know not what of charm in wandering over open unadorned moorland It must be more in the softness of the grass to the feet and the freshness of the air to the lungs than in anything that meets the eye You might walk for miles and miles to the north east or east or south east of Vavasor without meeting any object to arrest the view The great road from Lancaster to Carlisle crossed the outskirts of the small parish about a mile from the church and beyond that the fell seemed to be interminable Towards the north it rose and towards the south it fell and it rose and fell very gradually Here and there some slight appearance of a valley might be traced which had been formed by the action of the waters but such breakings of ground were inconsiderable and did not suffice to interrupt the stern sameness of the everlasting moorland The daily life at Vavasor was melancholy enough for such a one as the Squire s son who regarded London as the only place on the earth s surface in which a man could live with comfort The moors offered no charms to him Nor did he much appreciate the homely comforts of the Hall for the house though warm was old fashioned and small and the Squire s cook was nearly as old as the Squire himself John Vavasor s visits to Vavasor were always visits of duty rather than of pleasure But it was not so with Alice She could be very happy there with Kate for like herself Kate was a good walker and loved the mountains Their regard for each other had grown and become strong because they had gone together o er river and moor and because they had together disregarded those impediments of mud and wet which frighten so many girls away from the beauties of nature On this Christmas Day they all went to church the Squire being accompanied by Alice in a vehicle which in Ireland is called an inside jaunting car and which is perhaps the most uncomfortable kind of vehicle yet invented while John Vavasor walked with his niece But the girls had arranged that immediately after church they would start for a walk up the Beacon Hill across the fells towards Hawes Water They always dined at the Hall at the vexatious hour of five but as their church service with the sacrament included would be completed soon after twelve and as lunch was a meal which the Squire did not himself attend they could have full four hours for their excursion This had all been planned before Alice received her letter but there was nothing in that to make her change her mind about the walk Alice my dear said the old man to her when they were together in the jaunting car you ought to get married The Squire was hard of hearing and under any circumstances an inside jaunting car is a bad place for conversation as your teeth are nearly shaken out of your head by every movement which the horse makes Alice therefore said nothing but smiled faintly in reply to her grandfather On returning from church he insisted that Alice should again accompany him telling her specially that he desired to speak to her My dear child he said I have been thinking a great deal about you and you ought to get married Well sir perhaps I shall some day Not if you quarrel with all your suitors said the old man You quarrelled with your cousin George and now you have quarrelled with mister Grey You ll never get married my dear if you go on in that way Why should I be married more than Kate Oh Kate I don t know that anybody wants to marry Kate I wish you d think of what I say If you don t get married before long perhaps you ll never get married at all Gentlemen won t stand that kind of thing for ever The two girls took a slice of cake each in her hand and started on their walk We shan t be able to get to the lake said Kate No said Alice but we can go as far as the big stone on Swindale Fell where we can sit down and see it Do you remember the last time we sat there said Kate It is nearly three years ago and it was then that you told me that all was to be over between you and George Do you remember what a fool I was and how I screamed in my sorrow I sometimes wonder at myself and my own folly How is it that I can never get up any interest about my own belongings And then we got soaking wet through coming home I remember that very well And how dark it was That was in September but we had dined early If we go as far as Swindale we shall have it very dark coming home to day but I don t mind that through the Beacon Wood because I know my way so well You won t be afraid of half an hour s dark Oh no said Alice Yes I do remember that day Well it s all for the best I suppose And now I must read you my aunt s letter Then while they were still in the wood Kate took out the letter from her aunt and read it while they still walked slowly up the hill It seemed that hitherto neither of her two suitors had brought the widow to terms Indeed she continued to write of mister Cheesacre as though that gentleman were inconsolable for the loss of Kate and gave her niece much serious advice as to the expedience of returning to Norfolk in order that she might secure so eligible a husband You must understand all the time Alice said Kate pausing as she read the letter that the dear man has never given me the slightest ground for the faintest hope and that I know to a certainty that he makes an offer to her twice a week that is on every market day You can t enjoy half the joke if you won t bear that in mind Alice promised that she would bear it all in mind and then Kate went on with her reading Poor Bellfield was working very hard at his drill missus Greenow went on to say so hard that sometimes she really thought the fatigue would be too much for his strength He would come in sometimes of an evening and just take a cup of tea generally on Mondays and Thursdays These are not market days at Norwich said Kate and thus unpleasant meetings are avoided He comes in said missus Greenow and takes a little tea and sometimes I think that he will faint at my feet That he kneels there on every occasion said Kate and repeats his offer also twice a week I have not the least doubt in the world And will she accept him at last Really I don t know what to think of it Sometimes I fancy that she likes the fun of the thing but that she is too wide awake to put herself in any man s power I have no doubt she lends him money because he wants it sadly and she is very generous She gives him money I feel sure but takes his receipt on stamped paper for every shilling That s her character all over The letter then went on to say that the writer had made up her mind to remain at Norwich certainly through the winter and spring and that she was anxiously desirous that her dear Kate should go back to her Come and have one other look at Oileymead said the letter and then if you make up your mind that you don t like it or him I won t ask you to think of them ever again I believe him to be a very honest fellow Did you ever know such a woman said Kate with all her faults I believe she would go through fire and water to serve me I think she d lend me money without any stamped paper Then Aunt Greenow s letter was put up and the two girls had come out upon the open fell It was a delicious afternoon for a winter s walk The air was clear and cold but not actually frosty The ground beneath their feet was dry and the sky though not bright had that appearance of enduring weather which gives no foreboding of rain There is a special winter s light which is very clear though devoid of all brilliancy through which every object strikes upon the eye with well marked lines and under which almost all forms of nature seem graceful to the sight if not actually beautiful But there is a certain melancholy which ever accompanies it It is the light of the afternoon and gives token of the speedy coming of the early twilight It tells of the shortness of the day and contains even in its clearness a promise of the gloom of night It is absolute light but it seems to contain the darkness which is to follow it I do not know that it is ever to be seen and felt so plainly as on the wide moorland where the eye stretches away over miles and sees at the world s end the faint low lines of distant clouds settling themselves upon the horizon Such was the light of this Christmas afternoon and both the girls had felt the effects of it before they reached the big stone on Swindale Fell from which they intended to look down upon the loveliness of Hawes Water As they went up through the wood there had been some laughter between them over Aunt Greenow s letter and they had discussed almost with mirth the merits of Oileymead and mister Cheesacre but as they got further on to the fell and as the half melancholy wildness of the place struck them their words became less light and after a while they almost ceased to speak Alice had still her letter in her pocket She had placed it there when she came down to breakfast and had carried it with her since She had come to no resolution as yet as to her answer to it nor had she resolved whether or no she would show it to Kate Kate had ever been regarded by her as her steadfast friend In all these affairs she had spoken openly to Kate We know that Kate had in part betrayed her but Alice suspected no such treason She had often quarrelled with Kate but she had quarrelled with her not on account of any sin against the faith of their friendship She believed in her cousin perfectly though she found herself often called upon to disagree with her almost violently Why should she not show this letter to Kate and discuss it in all its bearings before she replied to it This was in her mind as she walked silently along over the fell The reader will surmise from this that she was already half inclined to give way and to join her lot to that of her cousin George Alas yes The reader will be right in his surmise And yet it was not her love for the man that prompted her to run so terrible a risk Had it been so I think that it would be easier to forgive her She was beginning to think that love the love of which she had once thought so much did not matter Of what use was it and to what had it led What had love done for her friend Glencora What had love done for her Had she not loved John Grey and had she not felt that with all her love life with him would have been distasteful to her It would have been impossible for her to marry a man whom personally she disliked but she liked her cousin George well enough as she said to herself almost indifferently Upon the whole it was a grievous task to her in these days this having to do something with her life Was it not all vain and futile As for that girl s dream of the joys of love which she had once dreamed that had gone from her slumbers never to return How might she best make herself useful useful in some sort that might gratify her ambition that was now the question which seemed to her to be of most importance Her cousin s letter to her had been very crafty He had studied the whole of her character accurately as he wrote it When he had sat down to write it he had been indifferent to the result but he had written it with that care to attain success which a man uses when he is anxious not to fail in an attempt Whether or no he cared to marry his cousin was a point so little interesting to him that chance might decide it for him but when chance had decided that he did wish it it was necessary for his honour that he should have that for which he condescended to ask His letter to her had been clever and very crafty At any rate he does me justice she said to herself when she read those words about her money and the use which he proposed to make of it He is welcome to it all if it will help him in his career whether he has it as my friend or as my husband Then she thought of Kate s promise of her little mite and declared to herself that she would not be less noble than her cousin Kate And would it not be well that she should be the means of reconciling George to his grandfather George was the representative of the family of a family so old that no one now knew which had first taken the ancient titular name of some old Saxon landowner the parish or the man There had been in old days some worthy Vavaseurs as Chaucer calls them whose rank and bearing had been adopted on the moorland side Of these things Alice thought much and felt that it should be her duty so to act that future Vavasors might at any rate not be less in the world than they who had passed away In a few years at furthest George Vavasor must be Vavasor of Vavasor Would it not be right that she should help him to make that position honourable They walked on exchanging now and again a word or two till the distant Cumberland mountains began to form themselves in groups of beauty before their eyes There s Helvellyn at last said Kate I m always happy when I see that And isn t that Kidsty Pike asked Alice No you don t see Kidsty yet But you will when you get up to the bank there That s Scaw Fell on the left the round distant top I can distinguish it though I doubt whether you can Then they went on again and were soon at the bank from whence the sharp top of the mountain which Alice had named was visible And now we are on Swindale and in five minutes we shall get to the stone In less than five minutes they were there and then but not till then the beauty of the little lake lying down below them in the quiet bosom of the hills disclosed itself A lake should I think be small and should be seen from above to be seen in all its glory The distance should be such that the shadows of the mountains on its surface may just be traced and that some faint idea of the ripple on the waters may be present to the eye And the form of the lakes should be irregular curving round from its base among the lower hills deeper and still deeper into some close nook up among the mountains from which its head waters spring It is thus that a lake should be seen and it was thus that Hawes Water was seen by them from the flat stone on the side of Swindale Fell The basin of the lake has formed itself into the shape of the figure of three and the top section of the figure lies embosomed among the very wildest of the Westmoreland mountains Altogether it is not above three miles long and every point of it was to be seen from the spot on which the girls sat themselves down The water beneath was still as death and as dark and looked almost as cold But the slow clouds were passing over it and the shades of darkness on its surface changed themselves with gradual changes And though no movement was visible there was ever and again in places a slight sheen upon the lake which indicated the ripple made by the breeze I m so glad I ve come here said Alice seating herself I cannot bear the idea of coming to Vavasor without seeing one of the lakes at least We ll get over to Windermere one day said Kate I don t think we shall I don t think it possible that I should stay long Kate I ve got a letter to show you And there was that in the tone of her voice which instantly put Kate upon her mettle Kate seated herself also and put up her hand for the letter Is it from mister Grey she asked No said Alice it is not from mister Grey And she gave her companion the paper Kate before she had touched it had seen that it was from her brother George and as she opened it looked anxiously into Alice s face Has he offended you Kate asked Illustration Swindale Fell Read it said Alice and then we ll talk of it afterwards as we go home Then she got up from the stone and walked a step or two towards the brow of the fell and stood there looking down upon the lake while Kate read the letter Well she said when she returned to her place Well said Kate Alice Alice it will indeed be well if you listen to him Oh Alice may I hope Alice my own Alice my darling my friend Say that it shall be so And Kate knelt at her friend s feet upon the heather and looked up into her face with eyes full of tears What shall we say of a woman who could be as false as she had been and yet could be so true Alice made no immediate answer but still continued to gaze down over her friend upon the lake Alice continued Kate I did not think I should be made so happy this Christmas Day You could not have the heart to bring me here and show me this letter in this way and bid me read it so calmly and then tell me that it is all for nothing No you could not do that Alice I am so happy I will so love this place I hated it before And then she put her face down upon the boulder stone and kissed it Still Alice said nothing but she began to feel that she had gone further than she had intended It was almost impossible for her now to say that her answer to George must be a refusal Then Kate again went on speaking But is it not a beautiful letter Say Alice is it not a letter of which if you were his brother you would feel proud if another girl had shown it to you I do feel proud of him I know that he is a man with a manly heart and manly courage who will yet do manly things Here out on the mountain with nobody near us with Nature all round us I ask you on your solemn word as a woman do you love him Love him said Alice Yes love him as a woman should love her husband Is not your heart his Alice there need be no lies now If it be so it should be your glory to say so here to me as you hold that letter in your hand I can have no such glory Kate I have ever loved my cousin but not so passionately as you seem to think Then there can be no passion in you Perhaps not Kate I would sometimes hope that it is so But come we shall be late and you will be cold sitting there I would sit here all night to be sure that your answer would be as I would have it But Alice at any rate you shall tell me before I move what your answer is to be I know you will not refuse him but make me happy by saying so with your own lips I cannot tell you before you move Kate And why not Because I have not as yet resolved Ah that is impossible That is quite impossible On such a subject and under such circumstances a woman must resolve at the first moment You had resolved I know before you had half read the letter though perhaps it may not suit you to say so You are quite mistaken Come along and let us walk and I will tell you all Then Kate arose and they turned their back to the lake and began to make their way homewards I have not made up my mind as to what answer I will give him but I have shown you his letter in order that I might have some one with whom I might speak openly I knew well how it would be and that you would strive to hurry me into an immediate promise No no I want nothing of the kind But yet I could not deny myself the comfort of your friendship No Alice I will not hurry you I will do nothing that you do not wish But you cannot be surprised that I should be very eager Has it not been the longing of all my life Have I not passed my time plotting and planning and thinking of it till I have had time to think of nothing else Do you know what I suffered when through George s fault the engagement was broken off Was it not martyrdom to me that horrid time in which your Crichton from Cambridgeshire was in the ascendant Did I not suffer the tortures of purgatory while that went on and yet on the whole did I not bear them with patience And now can you be surprised that I am wild with joy when I begin to see that everything will be as I wish for it will be as I wish Alice It may be that you have not resolved to accept him But you would have resolved to refuse him instantly had that been your destined answer to his letter There was but little more said between them on the subject as they were passing over the fell but when they were going down the path through the Beacon Wood Kate again spoke You will not answer him without speaking to me first said Kate I will at any rate not send my answer without telling you said Alice And you will let me see it Nay said Alice I will not promise that But if it is unfavourable I will show it you Then I shall never see it said Kate laughing But that is quite enough for me I by no means wish to criticise the love sweet words in which you tell him that his offences are all forgiven I know how sweet they will be Oh heavens how I envy him Then they were at home and the old man met them at the front door glowering at them angrily from out his old leonine eyes because the roast beef was already roasted He had his great uncouth silver watch in his hand which was always a quarter of an hour too fast and he pointed at it fiercely showing them the minute hand at ten minutes past the hour But grandpapa you are always too fast said Kate And you are always too slow miss said the hungry old squire Indeed it is not five yet Is it Alice And how long are you going to be dressing Not ten minutes are we Alice And grandpapa pray don t wait Don t wait That s what they always say he muttered peevishly As if one would be any better waiting for them after the meat is on the table But neither Kate nor Alice heard this as they were already in their rooms Nothing more was said that evening between Alice and Kate about the letter but Kate as she wished her cousin good night inside her bedroom door spoke to her just one word Pray for him to night she said as you pray for those you love best Alice made no answer but we may believe that she did as she was desired to do CHAPTER XXXII Containing an Answer to the Love Letter Alice had had a week allowed to her to write her answer but she sent it off before the full week was past Why should I keep him in suspense she said If it is to be so there can be no good in not saying so at once Then she thought also that if this were to be her destiny it might be well for mister Grey that all his doubts on the matter should be dispelled She had treated him badly very badly She had so injured him that the remembrance of the injury must always be a source of misery to her but she owed to him above everything to let him know what were her intentions as soon as they were settled She tried to console herself by thinking that the wound to him would be easy to cure He also is not passionate she said But in so saying she deceived herself He was a man in whom Love could be very passionate and was moreover one in whom Love could hardly be renewed Each morning Kate asked her whether her answer was written and on the third day after Christmas just before dinner Alice said that she had written it and that it was gone But it isn t post day said Kate for the post illuminated Vavasor but three days a week I have given a boy sixpence to take it to Shap said Alice blushing And what have you said asked Kate taking hold of the other s arm I have kept my promise said Alice and do you keep yours by asking no further questions My sister my own sister said Kate And then as Alice met her embrace there was no longer any doubt as to the nature of the reply After this there was of course much close discussion between them as to what other steps should now be taken Kate wanted her cousin to write immediately to mister Grey and was somewhat frightened when Alice declined to do so till she had received a further letter from George You have not proposed any horrid stipulations to him exclaimed Kate I don t know what you may call horrid stipulations said Alice gravely My conditions have not been very hard and I do not think you would have disapproved them But he He is so impetuous Will he disapprove them I have told him But Kate this is just what I did not mean to tell you Why should there be secrets between us said Kate There shall be none then I have told him that I cannot bring myself to marry him instantly that he must allow me twelve months to wear off if I can in that time much of sadness and of self reproach which has fallen to my lot Twelve months Alice Listen to me I have said so But I have told him also that if he wishes it still I will at once tell papa and grandpapa that I hold myself as engaged to him so that he may know that I bind myself to him as far as it is possible that I should do so And I have added something else Kate she continued to say after a slight pause something else which I can tell you though I could tell it to no other person I can tell you because you would do and will do the same I have told him that any portion of my money is at his service which may be needed for his purposes before that twelve months is over Oh Alice No no You shall not do that It is too generous And Kate perhaps felt at the moment that her brother was a man to whom such an offer could hardly be made with safety But I have done it Mercury with sixpence in his pocket is already posting my generosity at Shap And to tell the truth Kate it is no more than fair He has honestly told me that while the old Squire lives he will want my money to assist him in a career of which I do much more than approve It has been my earnest wish to see him in Parliament It will now be the most earnest desire of my heart the one thing as to which I shall feel an intense anxiety How then can I have the face to bid him wait twelve months for that which is specially needed in six months time It would be like the workhouses which are so long in giving bread that in the mean time the wretches starve But the wretch shan t starve said Kate My money small as it is will carry him over this bout I have told him that he shall have it and that I expect him to spend it Moreover I have no doubt that Aunt Greenow would lend me what he wants But I should not wish him to borrow from Aunt Greenow She would advance him the money as you say upon stamped paper and then talk of it He shall have mine said Kate And who are you said Alice laughing You are not going to be his wife He shall not touch your money till you are his wife said Kate very seriously I wish you would consent to change your mind about this stupid tedious year and then you might do as you pleased I have no doubt such a settlement might be made as to the property here when my grandfather hears of it as would make you ultimately safe And do you think I care to be ultimately safe as you call it Kate my dear you do not understand me I suppose not And yet I thought that I had known something about you It is because I do not care for the safety of which you speak that I am now going to become your brother s wife Do you suppose that I do not see that I must run much risk You prefer the excitement of London to the tranquillity may I say of Cambridgeshire Exactly and therefore I have told George that he shall have my money whenever he wants it Kate was very persistent in her objection to this scheme till George s answer came His answer to Alice was accompanied by a letter to his sister and after that Kate said nothing more about the money question She said no more then but it must not therefore be supposed that she was less determined than she had been that no part of Alice s fortune should be sacrificed to her brother s wants at any rate before Alice should become her brother s wife But her brother s letter for the moment stopped her mouth It would be necessary that she should speak to him before she again spoke to Alice In what words Alice had written her assent it will be necessary that the reader should know in order that something may be understood of the struggle which she made upon the occasion but they shall be given presently when I come to speak of George Vavasor s position as he received them George s reply was very short and apparently very frank He deprecated the delay of twelve months and still hoped to be able to induce her to be more lenient to him He advised her to write to mister Grey at once and as regarded the Squire he gave her carte blanche to act as she pleased If the Squire required any kind of apology expression of sorrow and asking for pardon or such like he George would under the circumstances as they now existed comply with the requisition most willingly He would regard it as a simple form made necessary by his coming marriage As to Alice s money he thanked her heartily for her confidence If the nature of his coming contest at Chelsea should make it necessary he would use her offer as frankly as it had been made Such was his letter to Alice What was contained in his letter to Kate Alice never knew Then came the business of telling this new love tale the third which poor Alice had been forced to tell her father and grandfather and a grievous task it was In this matter she feared her father much more than her grandfather and therefore she resolved to tell her grandfather first or rather she determined that she would tell the Squire and that in the mean time Kate should talk to her father Grandpapa she said to him the morning after she had received her cousin s second letter The old man was in the habit of breakfasting alone in a closet of his own which was called his dressing room but in which he kept no appurtenances for dressing but in lieu of them a large collection of old spuds and sticks and horse s bits There was a broken spade here and a hoe or two and a small table in the corner was covered with the debris of tradesmen s bills from Penrith and dirty scraps which he was wont to call his farm accounts Grandpapa said Alice rushing away at once into the middle of her subject you told me the other day that you thought I ought to be married Did I my dear Well yes so I did And so you ought I mean to that mister Grey That is impossible sir Then what s the use of your coming and talking to me about it This made Alice s task not very easy but nevertheless she persevered I am come grandpapa to tell you of another engagement Another said he And by the tone of his voice he accused his granddaughter of having a larger number of favoured suitors than ought to fall to the lot of any young lady It was very hard upon her but still she went on You know said she that some years ago I was to have been married to my cousin George and then she paused Well said the old man And I remember you told me then that you were much pleased So I was George was doing well then or which is more likely had made us believe that he was doing well Have you made it up with him again Yes sir And that s the meaning of your jilting mister Grey is it Poor Alice It is hard to explain how heavy a blow fell upon her from the open utterance of that word Of all words in the language it was the one which she now most dreaded She had called herself a jilt with that inaudible voice which one uses in making self accusations but hitherto no lips had pronounced the odious word to her ears Poor Alice She was a jilt and perhaps it may have been well that the old man should tell her so Grandpapa she said and there was that in the tone of her voice which somewhat softened the Squire s heart Well my dear I don t want to be ill natured So you are going at last to marry George are you I hope he ll treat you well that s all Does your father approve of it I have told you first sir because I wish to obtain your consent to seeing George again here as your grandson Never said the old man snarling never If he has been wrong he will beg your pardon If he has been wrong Didn t he want to squander every shilling of the property property which has never belonged to him property which I could give to Tom Dick or Harry to morrow if I liked If he has been wrong I am not defending him sir but I thought that perhaps on such an occasion as this A Tom Fool s occasion You ve got money of your own He ll spend all that now He will be less likely to do so if you will recognise him as your heir Pray believe sir that he is not the sort of man that he was He must be a very clever sort of man I think when he has talked you out of such a husband as John Grey It s astounding to me with that ugly mug of his Well my dear if your father approves of it and if George will ask my pardon but I don t think he ever will He will sir I am his messenger for as much as that Oh you are are you Then you may also be my messenger to him and tell him that for your sake I will let him come back here I know he ll insult me the first day but I ll try and put up with it for your sake my dear Of course I must know what your father thinks about it It may be imagined that Kate s success was even less than that which Alice achieved I knew it would be so said John Vavasor when his niece first told him and as he spoke he struck his hand upon the table I knew all along how it would be And why should it not be so Uncle John He is your brother and I will not tell you why You think that he is a spendthrift I think that he is as unsafe a man as ever I knew to be intrusted with the happiness of any young woman That is all You are hard upon him uncle Perhaps so Tell Alice this from me that as I have never yet been able to get her to think anything of my opinion I do not at all expect that I shall be able to induce her to do so now I will not even make the attempt As my son in law I will not receive George Vavasor Tell Alice that Alice was told her father s message but Kate in telling it felt no deep regret She well knew that Alice would not be turned back from her present intention by her father s wishes Nor would it have been very reasonable that she should Her father had for many years relieved himself from the burden of a father s cares and now had hardly the right to claim a father s privileges We will now go once again to George Vavasor s room in Cecil Street in which he received Alice s letter He was dressing when it was first brought to him and when he recognised the handwriting he put it down on his toilet table unopened He put it down and went on brushing his hair as though he were determined to prove to himself that he was indifferent as to the tidings which it might contain He went on brushing his hair and cleaning his teeth and tying his cravat carefully over his turned down collar while the unopened letter lay close to his hand Of course he was thinking of it of course he was anxious of course his eye went to it from moment to moment But he carried it with him into the sitting room still unopened and so it remained until after the girl had brought him his tea and his toast And now said he as he threw himself into his arm chair let us see what the girl of my heart says to me The girl of his heart said to him as follows MY DEAR GEORGE I feel great difficulty in answering your letter Could I have my own way I should make no answer to it at present but leave it for the next six months so that then such answer might hereafter be made as circumstances should seem to require This will be little flattering to you but it is less flattering to myself Whatever answer I may make how can anything in this affair be flattering either to you or to me We have been like children who have quarrelled over our game of play till now at the close of our little day of pleasure we are fain to meet each other in tears and acknowledge that we have looked for delights where no delights were to be found Kate who is here talks to me of passionate love There is no such passion left to me nor as I think to you either It would not now be possible that you and I should come together on such terms as that We could not stand up together as man and wife with any hope of a happy marriage unless we had both agreed that such happiness might be had without passionate love You will see from all this that I do not refuse your offer Without passion I have for you a warm affection which enables me to take a livelier interest in your career than in any other of the matters which are around me Of course if I become your wife that interest will be still closer and dearer and I do feel that I can take in it that concern which a wife should have in her husband s affairs If it suits you I will become your wife but it cannot be quite at once I have suffered much from the past conflicts of my life and there has been very much with which I must reproach myself I know that I have behaved badly Sometimes I have to undergo the doubly bitter self accusation of having behaved in a manner which the world will call unfeminine You must understand that I have not passed through this unscathed and I must beg you to allow me some time for a cure A perfect cure I may never expect but I think that in twelve months from this time I may so far have recovered my usual spirit and ease of mind as to enable me to devote myself to your happiness Dear George if you will accept me under such circumstances I will be your wife and will endeavour to do my duty by you faithfully I have said that even now as your cousin I take a lively interest in your career of course I mean your career as a politician and especially in your hopes of entering Parliament I understand accurately as I think what you have said about my fortune and I perfectly appreciate your truth and frankness If I had nothing of my own you in your circumstances could not possibly take me as your wife I know moreover that your need of assistance from my means is immediate rather than prospective My money may be absolutely necessary to you within this year during which as I tell you most truly I cannot bring myself to become a married woman But my money shall be less cross grained than myself You will take it as frankly as I mean it when I say that whatever you want for your political purposes shall be forthcoming at your slightest wish Dear George let me have the honour and glory of marrying a man who has gained a seat in the Parliament of Great Britain Of all positions which a man may attain that to me is the grandest I shall wait for a further letter from you before I speak either to my father or to my grandfather If you can tell me that you accede to my views I will at once try to bring about a reconciliation between you and the Squire I think that that will be almost easier than inducing my father to look with favour upon our marriage But I need hardly say that should either one or the other oppose it or should both do so that would not turn me from my purpose I also wait for your answer to write a last line to mister Grey Your affectionate cousin ALICE VAVASOR George Vavasor when he had read the letter threw it carelessly from him on to the breakfast table and began to munch his toast He threw it carelessly from him as though taking a certain pride in his carelessness Very well said he so be it It is probably the best thing that I could do whatever the effect may be on her Then he took up his newspaper But before the day was over he had made many plans plans made almost unconsciously as to the benefit which might accrue to him from the offer which she had made of her money And before night he had written that reply to her of which we have heard the contents and had written also to his sister Kate a letter of which Kate had kept the contents to herself CHAPTER XXXIII Monkshade When the first of the new year came round Lady Glencora was not keeping her appointment at Lady Monk s house She went to Gatherum Castle and let us hope that she enjoyed the magnificent Christmas hospitality of the Duke but when the time came for moving on to Monkshade she was indisposed and mister Palliser went thither alone Lady Glencora returned to Matching and remained at home while her husband was away in company with the two Miss Pallisers When the tidings reached Monkshade that Lady Glencora was not to be expected Burgo Fitzgerald was already there armed with such pecuniary assistance as George Vavasor had been able to wrench out of the hands of mister Magruin Burgo said his aunt catching him one morning near his bedroom door as he was about to go down stairs in hunting trim Burgo your old flame Lady Glencora is not coming here Lady Glencora not coming said Burgo betraying by his look and the tone of his voice too clearly that this change in the purpose of a married lady was to him of more importance than it should have been Such betrayal however to Lady Monk was not perhaps matter of much moment No she is not coming It can t be matter of any moment to you now But by heavens it is said he putting his hand up to his forehead and leaning back against the wall of the passage as though in despair It is matter of moment to me I am the most unfortunate devil that ever lived Fie Burgo fie You must not speak in that way of a married woman I begin to think it is better that she should not come At this moment another man booted and spurred came down the passage upon whom Lady Monk smiled sweetly speaking some pretty little word as he passed Burgo spoke never a word but still stood leaning against the wall with his hand to his forehead showing that he had heard something which had moved him greatly Come back into your room Burgo said his aunt and they both went in at the door that was nearest to them for Lady Monk had been on the look out for him and had caught him as soon as he appeared in the passage If this does annoy you you should keep it to yourself What will people say How can I help what they say But you would not wish to injure her I suppose I thought it best to tell you for fear you should show any special sign of surprise if you heard of it first in public It is very weak in you to allow yourself to feel that sort of regard for a married woman If you cannot constrain yourself I shall be afraid to let you meet her in Brook Street Burgo looked for a moment into his aunt s face without answering her and then turned away towards the door You can do as you please about that said he but you know as well as I do what I have made up my mind to do Nonsense Burgo I know nothing of the kind But do you go down stairs to breakfast and don t look like that when you go among the people there Lady Monk was a woman now about fifty years of age who had been a great beauty and who was still handsome in her advanced age Her figure was very good She was tall and of fine proportion though by no means verging to that state of body which our excellent American friend and critic mister Hawthorne has described as beefy and has declared to be the general condition of English ladies of Lady Monk s age Lady Monk was not beefy She was a comely handsome upright dame one of whom as regards her outward appearance England might be proud and of whom Sir Cosmo Monk was very proud She had come of the family of the Worcestershire Fitzgeralds of whom it used to be said that there never was one who was not beautiful and worthless Looking at Lady Monk you would hardly think that she could be a worthless woman but there were one or two who professed to know her and who declared that she was a true scion of the family to which she belonged that even her husband s ample fortune had suffered from her extravagance that she had quarrelled with her only son and had succeeded in marrying her daughter to the greatest fool in the peerage She had striven very hard to bring about a marriage between her nephew and the great heiress and was a woman not likely to pardon those who had foiled her At this moment Burgo felt very certain that his aunt was aware of his purpose and could not forgive her for pretending to be innocent of it In this he was most ungrateful as well as unreasonable and very indiscreet also Had he been a man who ever reflected he must have known that such a woman as his aunt could only assist him as long as she might be presumed to be ignorant of his intention But Burgo never reflected The Fitzgeralds never reflected till they were nearer forty than thirty and then people began to think worse of them than they had thought before When Burgo reached the dining room there were many men there but no ladies Sir Cosmo Monk a fine bald headed hale man of about sixty was standing up at the sideboard cutting a huge game pie He was a man also who did not reflect much but who contrived to keep straight in his course through the world without much reflection Palliser is coming without her he said in his loud clear voice thinking nothing of his wife s nephew She s ill she says I m sorry for it said one man She s a deal the better fellow of the two She has twice more go in her than Planty Pall said another Planty is no fool I can tell you said Sir Cosmo coming to the table with his plate full of pie We think he s about the most rising man we have Sir Cosmo was the member for his county and was a Liberal He had once when a much younger man been at the Treasury and had since always spoken of the Whig Government as though he himself were in some sort a part of it Burgo do you hear that Palliser is coming without his wife said one man a very young man who hardly knew what had been the circumstances of the case The others when they saw Burgo enter had been silent on the subject of Lady Glencora I have heard and be d d to him said Burgo Then there was suddenly a silence in the room and everyone seemed to attend assiduously to his breakfast It was very terrible this clear expression of a guilty meaning with reference to the wife of another man Burgo regarded neither his plate nor his cup but thrusting his hands into his breeches pockets sat back in his chair with the blackness as of a thunder cloud upon his brow Illustration I have heard said Burgo Burgo you had better eat your breakfast said Sir Cosmo I don t want any breakfast He took however a bit of toast and crumbling it up in his hand as he put a morsel into his mouth went away to the sideboard and filled for himself a glass of cherry brandy If you don t eat any breakfast the less of that you take the better said Sir Cosmo I m all right now said he and coming back to the table went through some form of making a meal with a roll and a cup of tea They who were then present used afterwards to say that they should never forget that breakfast There had been something they declared in the tone of Burgo s voice when he uttered his curse against mister Palliser which had struck them all with dread There had too they said been a blackness in his face so terrible to be seen that it had taken from them all the power of conversation Sir Cosmo when he had broken the ominous silence had done so with a manifest struggle The loud clatter of glasses with which Burgo had swallowed his dram as though resolved to show that he was regardless who might know that he was drinking added to the feeling It may easily be understood that there was no further word spoken at that breakfast table about Planty Pall or his wife On that day Burgo Fitzgerald startled all those who saw him by the mad way in which he rode Early in the day there was no excuse for any such rashness The hounds went from wood to wood and men went in troops along the forest sides as they do on such occasions But Burgo was seen to cram his horse at impracticable places and to ride at gates and rails as though resolved to do himself and his uncle s steed a mischief This was so apparent that some friend spoke to Sir Cosmo Monk about it I can do nothing said Sir Cosmo He is a man whom no one s words will control Something has ruffled him this morning and he must run his chance till he becomes quiet In the afternoon there was a good run and Burgo again rode as hard as he could make his horse carry him but then there was the usual excuse for hard riding and such riding in a straight run is not dangerous as it is when the circumstances of the occasion do not warrant it But be that as it may Burgo went on to the end of the day without accident and as he went home assured Sir Cosmo in a voice which was almost cheery that his mare Spinster was by far the best thing in the Monkshade stables Indeed Spinster made quite a character that day and was sold at the end of the season for three hundred guineas on the strength of it I am however inclined to believe that there was nothing particular about the mare Horses always catch the temperament of their riders and when a man wishes to break his neck he will generally find a horse willing to assist him in appearance but able to save him in the performance Burgo at any rate did not break his neck and appeared at the dinner table in a better humour than that which he had displayed in the morning On the day appointed mister Palliser reached Monkshade He was in a manner canvassing for the support of the Liberal party and it would not have suited him to show any indifference to the invitation of so influential a man as Sir Cosmo Sir Cosmo had a little party of his own in the House consisting of four or five other respectable country gentlemen who troubled themselves little with thinking and who mostly had bald heads Sir Cosmo was a man with whom it was quite necessary that such an aspirant as mister Palliser should stand well and therefore mister Palliser came to Monkshade although Lady Glencora was unable to accompany him We are so sorry said Lady Monk We have been looking forward to having Lady Glencora with us beyond everything mister Palliser declared that Lady Glencora herself was overwhelmed with grief in that she should have been debarred from making this special visit She had however been so unwell at Gatherum the anxious husband declared as to make it unsafe for her to go again away from home I hope it is nothing serious said Lady Monk with a look of grief so well arranged that any stranger would have thought that all the Pallisers must have been very dear to her heart Then mister Palliser went on to explain that Lady Glencora had unfortunately been foolish During one of those nights of hard frost she had gone out among the ruins at Matching to show them by moonlight to a friend The friend had thoughtlessly foolishly and in a manner which mister Palliser declared to be very reprehensible allowed Lady Glencora to remain among the ruins till she had caught cold How very wrong said Lady Monk with considerable emphasis It was very wrong said mister Palliser speaking of poor Alice almost maliciously However she caught a cold which unfortunately has become worse at my uncle s and so I was obliged to take her home Lady Monk perceived that mister Palliser had in truth left his wife behind because he believed her to be ill and not because he was afraid of Burgo Fitzgerald So accomplished a woman as Lady Monk felt no doubt that the wife s absence was caused by fear of the lover and not by any cold caught in viewing ruins by moonlight She was not to be deceived in such a matter But she became aware that mister Palliser had been deceived As she was right in this we must go back for a moment and say a word of things as they went on at Matching after Alice Vavasor had left that place Alice had told Miss Palliser that steps ought to be taken whatever might be their cost to save Lady Glencora from the peril of a visit to Monkshade To this Miss Palliser had assented and when she left Alice was determined to tell mister Palliser the whole story But when the time for doing so had come her courage failed her She could not find words in which to warn the husband that his wife would not be safe in the company of her old lover The task with Lady Glencora herself bad as that would be might be easier and this task she at last undertook not without success Glencora she said when she found a fitting opportunity you won t be angry I hope if I say a word to you That depends very much upon what the word is said Lady Glencora And here it must be acknowledged that mister Palliser s wife had not done much to ingratiate herself with mister Palliser s cousins not perhaps so much as she should have done seeing that she found them in her husband s house She had taught herself to think that they were hard stiff and too proud of bearing the name of Palliser Perhaps some little attempt may have been made by one or both of them to teach her something and it need hardly be said that such an attempt on the part of a husband s unmarried female relations would not be forgiven by a young bride She had undoubtedly been ungracious and of this Miss Palliser was well aware Well the word shall be as little unpleasant as I can make it said Miss Palliser already appreciating fully the difficulty of her task But why say anything that is unpleasant However if it is to be said let us have it over at once You are going to Monkshade I believe with Plantagenet Well and what of that Dear Glencora I think you had better not go Do you not think so yourself Who has been talking to you said Lady Glencora turning upon her very sharply Nobody has been talking to me not in the sense you mean Plantagenet has spoken to you Not a word said Miss Palliser You may be sure that he would not utter a word on such a subject to anyone unless it were to yourself But dear Glencora you should not go there I mean it in all kindness and love I do indeed Saying this she offered her hand to Glencora and Glencora took it Perhaps you do said she in a low voice Indeed I do The world is so hard and cruel in what it says I do not care two straws for what the world says But he might care It is not my fault I do not want to go to Monkshade Lady Monk was my friend once but I do not care if I never see her again I did not arrange this visit It was Plantagenet who did it But he will not take you there if you say you do not wish it I have said so and he told me that I must go You will hardly believe me but I condescended even to tell him why I thought it better to remain away He told me in answer that it was a silly folly which I must live down and that it did not become me to be afraid of any man Of course you are not afraid but I am afraid That is just the truth I am afraid but what can I do more than I have done This was very terrible to Miss Palliser She had not thought that Lady Glencora would say so much and she felt a true regret in having been made to hear words which so nearly amounted to a confession But for this there was no help now There were not many more words between them and we already know the result of the conversation Lady Glencora became so ill from the effects of her imprudent lingering among the ruins that she was unable to go to Monkshade mister Palliser remained three days at Monkshade and cemented his political alliance with Sir Cosmo much in the same way as he had before done with the Duke of saint Bungay There was little or nothing said about politics and certainly not a word that could be taken as any definite party understanding between the men but they sat at dinner together at the same table drank a glass of wine or two out of the same decanters and dropped a chance word now and again about the next session of Parliament I do not know that anything more had been expected either by mister Palliser or by Sir Cosmo but it seemed to be understood when mister Palliser went away that Sir Cosmo was of opinion that that young scion of a ducal house ought to become the future Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Whig Government I can t see that there s so much in him said one young member of Parliament to Sir Cosmo I rather think that there is all the same said the baronet There s a good deal in him I believe I dare say he s not very bright but I don t know that we want brightness A bright financier is the most dangerous man in the world We ve had enough of that already Give me sound common sense with just enough of the gab in a man to enable him to say what he s got to say We don t want more than that nowadays From which it became evident that Sir Cosmo was satisfied with the new political candidate for high place Lady Monk took an occasion to introduce mister Palliser to Burgo Fitzgerald with what object it is difficult to say unless she was anxious to make mischief between the men Burgo scowled at him but mister Palliser did not notice the scowl and put out his hand to his late rival most affably Burgo was forced to take it and as he did so made a little speech I m sorry that we have not the pleasure of seeing Lady Glencora with you said he She is unfortunately indisposed said mister Palliser I am sorry for it said Burgo very sorry indeed Then he turned his back and walked away The few words he had spoken and the manner in which he had carried himself had been such as to make all those around them notice it Each of them knew that Lady Glencora s name should not have been in Burgo s mouth and all felt a fear not easily to be defined that something terrible would come of it But mister Palliser himself did not seem to notice anything or to fear anything and nothing terrible did come of it during that visit of his to Monkshade CHAPTER XXXIV mister Vavasor Speaks to His Daughter Alice Vavasor returned to London with her father leaving Kate at Vavasor Hall with her grandfather The journey was not a pleasant one mister Vavasor knew that it was his duty to do something to take some steps with the view of preventing the marriage which his daughter meditated but he did not know what that something should be and he did know that whatever it might be the doing of it would be thoroughly disagreeable When they started from Vavasor he had as yet hardly spoken to her a word upon the subject I cannot congratulate you he had simply said I hope the time may come papa when you will Alice had answered and that had been all The squire had promised that he would consent to a reconciliation with his grandson if Alice s father would express himself satisfied with the proposed marriage John Vavasor had certainly expressed nothing of the kind I think so badly of him he had said speaking to the old man of George that I would rather know that almost any other calamity was to befall her than that she should be united to him Then the squire with his usual obstinacy had taken up the cudgels on behalf of his grandson and had tried to prove that the match after all would not be so bad in its results as his son seemed to expect It would do very well for the property he said I would settle the estate on their eldest son so that he could not touch it and I don t see why he shouldn t reform as well as another John Vavasor had then declared that George was thoroughly bad that he was an adventurer that he believed him to be a ruined man and that he would never reform The squire upon this had waxed angry and in this way George obtained aid and assistance down at the old house which he certainly had no right to expect When Alice wished her grandfather good bye the old man gave her a message to his grandson You may tell him said he that I will never see him again unless he begs my pardon for his personal bad conduct to me but that if he marries you I will take care that the property is properly settled upon his child and yours I shall always be glad to see you my dear and for your sake I will see him if he will humble himself to me There was no word spoken then about her father s consent and Alice when she left Vavasor felt that the squire was rather her friend than her enemy in regard to this thing which she contemplated That her father was and would be an uncompromising enemy to her uncompromising though probably not energetical she was well aware and therefore the journey up to London was not comfortable Alice had resolved with great pain to herself that in this matter she owed her father no obedience There cannot be obedience on one side she said to herself without protection and support on the other Now it was quite true that John Vavasor had done little in the way of supporting or protecting his daughter Early in life before she had resided under the same roof with him in London he had as it were washed his hands of all solicitude regarding her and having no other ties of family had fallen into habits of life which made it almost impossible for him to live with her as any other father would live with his child Then when there first sprang up between them that manner of sharing the same house without any joining together of their habits of life he had excused himself to himself by saying that Alice was unlike other girls and that she required no protection Her fortune was her own and at her own disposal Her character was such that she showed no inclination to throw the burden of such disposal on her father s shoulders She was steady too and given to no pursuits which made it necessary that he should watch closely over her She was a girl he thought who could do as well without surveillance as with it as well or perhaps better So it had come to pass that Alice had been the free mistress of her own actions and had been left to make the most she could of her own hours It cannot be supposed that she had eaten her lonely dinners in Queen Anne Street night after night week after week month after month without telling herself that her father was neglecting her She could not perceive that he spent every evening in society but never an evening in her society without feeling that the tie between her and him was not the strong bond which usually binds a father to his child She was well aware that she had been ill used in being thus left desolate in her home She had uttered no word of complaint but she had learned without being aware that she was doing so to entertain a firm resolve that her father should not guide her in her path through life In that affair of John Grey they had both for a time thought alike and mister Vavasor had believed that his theory with reference to Alice had been quite correct She had been left to herself and was going to dispose of herself in a way than which nothing could be more eligible But evil days were now coming and mister Vavasor as he travelled up to London with his daughter seated opposite to him in the railway carriage felt that now at last he must interfere In part of the journey they had the carriage to themselves and mister Vavasor thought that he would begin what he had to say but he put it off till others joined them and then there was no further opportunity for such conversation as that which would be necessary between them They reached home about eight in the evening having dined on the road She will be tired to night he said to himself as he went off to his club and I will speak to her to morrow Alice specially felt his going on this evening When two persons had together the tedium of such a journey as that from Westmoreland up to London there should be some feeling between them to bind them together while enjoying the comfort of the evening Had he stayed and sat with her at her tea table Alice would at any rate have endeavoured to be soft with him in any discussion that might have been raised but he went away from her at once leaving her to think alone over the perils of the life before her I want to speak to you after breakfast to morrow he said as he went out Alice answered that she should be there as a matter of course She scorned to tell him that she was always there always alone at home She had never uttered a word of complaint and she would not begin now The discussion after breakfast the next day was commenced with formal and almost ceremonial preparation The father and daughter breakfasted together with the knowledge that the discussion was coming It did not give to either of them a good appetite and very little was said at table Will you come up stairs said Alice when she perceived that her father had finished his tea Perhaps that will be best said he Then he followed her into the drawing room in which the fire had just been lit Alice said he I must speak to you about this engagement of yours Won t you sit down papa It does look so dreadful your standing up over one in that way He had placed himself on the rug with his back to the incipient fire but now at her request he sat himself down opposite to her I was greatly grieved when I heard of this at Vavasor I am sorry that you should be grieved papa I was grieved I must confess that I never could understand why you treated mister Grey as you have done Oh papa that s done and past Pray let that be among the bygones Does he know yet of your engagement with your cousin He will know it by this time to morrow Then I beg of you as a great favour to postpone your letter to him To this Alice made no answer I have not troubled you with many such requests Alice Will you tell me that this one shall be granted I think that I owe it to him as an imperative duty to let him know the truth But you may change your mind again Alice found that this was hard to bear and hard to answer but there was a certain amount of truth in the grievous reproach conveyed in her father s words which made her bow her neck to it I have no right to say that it is impossible she replied in words that were barely audible No exactly so said her father And therefore it will be better that you should postpone any such communication For how long do you mean Till you and I shall have agreed together that he should be told No papa I will not consent to that I consider myself bound to let him know the truth without delay I have done him a great injury and I must put an end to that as soon as possible You have done him an injury certainly my dear a very great injury said mister Vavasor going away from his object about the proposed letter and I believe he will feel it as such to the last day of his life if this goes on I hope not I believe that it will not be so I feel sure that it will not be so But of course what I am thinking of now is your welfare not his When you simply told me that you intended to Alice winced for she feared to hear from her father that odious word which her grandfather had used to her and indeed the word had been on her father s lips but he had refrained and spared her that you intended to break your engagement with mister Grey he continued I said little or nothing to you I would not ask you to marry any man even though you had yourself promised to marry him But when you tell me that you are engaged to your cousin George the matter is very different I do not think well of your cousin Indeed I think anything but well of him It is my duty to tell you that the world speaks very ill of him He paused but Alice remained silent When you were about to travel with him he continued I ought perhaps to have told you the same But I did not wish to pain you or his sister and moreover I have heard worse of him since then much worse than I had heard before As you did not tell me before I think you might spare me now said Alice No my dear I cannot allow you to sacrifice yourself without telling you that you are doing so If it were not for your money he would never think of marrying you Of that I am well aware said Alice He has told me so himself very plainly And yet you will marry him Certainly I will It seems to me papa that there is a great deal of false feeling about this matter of money in marriage or rather perhaps a great deal of pretended feeling Why should I be angry with a man for wishing to get that for which every man is struggling At this point of George s career the use of money is essential to him He could not marry without it You had better then give him your money without yourself said her father speaking in irony That is just what I mean to do papa said Alice What said mister Vavasor jumping up from his seat You mean to give him your money before you marry him Certainly I do if he should want it or I should rather say as much as he may want of it Heavens and earth exclaimed mister Vavasor Alice you must be mad To part with my money to my friend said she It is a kind of madness of which I need not at any rate be ashamed Tell me this Alice has he got any of it as yet Not a shilling Papa pray do not look at me like that If I had no thought of marrying him you would not call me mad because I lent to my cousin what money he might need I should only say that so much of your fortune was thrown away and if it were not much that would be an end of it I would sooner see you surrender to him the half of all you have without any engagement to marry him than know that he had received a shilling from you under such a promise You are prejudiced against him sir Was it prejudice that made you reject him once before Did you condemn him then through prejudice Had you not ascertained that he was altogether unworthy of you We were both younger then said Alice speaking very softly but very seriously We were both much younger then and looked at life with other eyes than those which we now use For myself I expected much then which I now seem hardly to regard at all and as for him he was then attached to pleasures to which I believe he has now learned to be indifferent Psha ejaculated the father I can only speak as I believe continued Alice And I think I may perhaps know more of his manner of life than you do papa But I am prepared to run risks now which I feared before Even though he were all that you think him to be I would still endeavour to do my duty to him and to bring him to other things What is it you expect to get by marrying him asked mister Vavasor A husband whose mode of thinking is congenial to my own answered Alice A husband who proposes to himself a career in life with which I can sympathize I think that I may perhaps help my cousin in the career which he has chosen and that alone is a great reason why I should attempt to do so With your money said mister Vavasor with a sneer Partly with my money said Alice disdaining to answer the sneer Though it were only with my money even that would be something Well Alice as your father I can only implore you to pause before you commit yourself to his hands If he demands money from you and you are minded to give it to him let him have it in moderation Anything will be better than marrying him I know that I cannot hinder you you are as much your own mistress as I am my own master or rather a great deal more as my income depends on my going to that horrid place in Chancery Lane But yet I suppose you must think something of your father s wishes and your father s opinion It will not be pleasant for you to stand at the altar without my being there near you To this Alice made no answer but she told herself that it had not been pleasant to her to have stood at so many places during the last four years and to have found herself so often alone without her father being near to her That had been his fault and it was not now in her power to remedy the ill effects of it Has any day been fixed between you and him he asked No papa Nothing has been said about that Yes something has been said I have told him that it cannot be for a year yet It is because I told him that that I told him also that he should have my money when he wanted it Not all of it said mister Vavasor I don t suppose he will need it all He intends to stand again for Chelsea and it is the great expense of the election which makes him want money You are not to suppose that he has asked me for it When I made him understand that I did not wish to marry quite yet I offered him the use of that which would be ultimately his own And he has accepted it He answered me just as I had intended that when the need came he would take me at my word Then Alice I will tell you what is my belief He will drain you of every shilling of your money and when that is gone there will be no more heard of the marriage We must take a small house in some cheap part of the town and live on my income as best we may I shall go and insure my life so that you may not absolutely starve when I die Having said this mister Vavasor went away not immediately to the insurance office as his words seemed to imply but to his club where he sat alone reading the newspaper very gloomily till the time came for his afternoon rubber of whist and the club dinner bill for the day was brought under his eye Alice had no such consolations in her solitude She had fought her battle with her father tolerably well but she was now called upon to fight a battle with herself which was one much more difficult to win Was her cousin her betrothed as she now must regard him the worthless heartless mercenary rascal which her father painted him There had certainly been a time and that not very long distant in which Alice herself had been almost constrained so to regard him Since that any change for the better in her opinion of him had been grounded on evidence given either by himself or by his sister Kate He had done nothing to inspire her with any confidence unless his reckless daring in coming forward to contest a seat in Parliament could be regarded as a doing of something And he had owned himself to be a man almost penniless he had spoken of himself as being utterly reckless as being one whose standing in the world was and must continue to be a perch on the edge of a precipice from which any accident might knock him headlong Alice believed in her heart that this last profession or trade to which he had applied himself was becoming as nothing to him that he received from it no certain income no income that a man could make to appear respectable to fathers or guardians when seeking a girl in marriage Her father declared that all men spoke badly of him Alice knew her father to be an idle man a man given to pleasure to be one who thought by far too much of the good things of the world but she had never found him to be either false or malicious His unwonted energy in this matter was in itself evidence that he believed himself to be right in what he said To tell the truth Alice was frightened at what she had done and almost repented of it already Her acceptance of her cousin s offer had not come of love nor had it in truth come chiefly of ambition She had not so much asked herself why she should do this thing as why she should not do it seeing that it was required of her by her friend What after all did it matter That was her argument with herself It cannot be supposed that she looked back on the past events of her life with any self satisfaction There was no self satisfaction but in truth there was more self reproach than she deserved As a girl she had loved her cousin George passionately and that love had failed her She did not tell herself that she had been wrong when she gave him up but she thought herself to have been most unfortunate in the one necessity After such an experience as that would it not have been better for her to have remained without further thought of marriage Then came that terrible episode in her life for which she never could forgive herself She had accepted mister Grey because she liked him and honoured him And I did love him she said to herself now on this morning Poor wretched heart wrung woman As she sat there thinking of it all in her solitude she was to be pitied at any rate if not to be forgiven Now as she thought of Nethercoats with its quiet life its gardens its books and the peaceful affectionate ascendancy of him who would have been her lord and master her feelings were very different from those which had induced her to resolve that she would not stoop to put her neck beneath that yoke Would it not have been well for her to have a master who by his wisdom and strength could save her from such wretched doubtings as these But she had refused to bend and then she had found herself desolate and alone in the world If I can do him good why should I not marry him In that feeling had been the chief argument which had induced her to return such an answer as she had sent to her cousin For myself what does it matter As to this life of mine and all that belongs to it why should I regard it otherwise than to make it of some service to some one who is dear to me He had been ever dear to her from her earliest years She believed in his intellect even if she could not believe in his conduct Kate her friend longed for this thing As for that dream of love it meant nothing and as for those arguments of prudence that cold calculation about her money which all people seemed to expect from her she would throw it to the winds What if she were ruined There was always the other chance She might save him from ruin and help him to honour and fortune But then when the word was once past her lips there returned to her that true woman s feeling which made her plead for a long day which made her feel that that long day would be all too short which made her already dread the coming of the end of the year She had said that she would become George Vavasor s wife but she wished that the saying so might be the end of it When he came to her to embrace her how should she receive him The memory of John Grey s last kiss still lingered on her lips She had told herself that she scorned the delights of love if it were so was she not bound to keep herself far from them if it were so would not her cousin s kiss pollute her It may be as my father says she thought It may be that he wants my money only if so let him have it Surely when the year is over I shall know Then a plan formed itself in her head which she did not make willingly with any voluntary action of her mind but which came upon her as plans do come and recommended itself to her in despite of herself He should have her money as he might call for it all of it excepting some small portion of her income which might suffice to keep her from burdening her father Then if he were contented he should go free without reproach and there should be an end of all question of marriage for her As she thought of this and matured it in her mind the door opened and the servant announced her cousin George CHAPTER XXXV Passion versus Prudence It had not occurred to Alice that her accepted lover would come to her so soon She had not told him expressly of the day on which she would return and had not reflected that Kate would certainly inform him She had been thinking so much of the distant perils of this engagement that this peril so sure to come upon her before many days or hours could pass by had been forgotten When the name struck her ear and George s step was heard outside on the landing place she felt the blood rush violently to her heart and she jumped up from her seat panic stricken and in utter dismay How should she receive him And then again with what form of affection would she be accosted by him But he was there in the room with her before she had had a moment allowed to her for thought She hardly ventured to look up at him but nevertheless she became aware that there was something in his appearance and dress brighter more lover like perhaps newer than was usual with him This in itself was an affliction to her He ought to have understood that such an engagement as theirs not only did not require but absolutely forbade any such symptom of young love as this Even when their marriage came if it must come it should come without any customary sign of smartness without any outward mark of exaltation It would have been very good in him to have remained away from her for weeks and months but to come upon her thus on the first morning of her return was a cruelty not to be forgiven These were the feelings with which Alice regarded her betrothed when he came to see her Alice said he coming up to her with his extended hand Dearest Alice She gave him her hand and muttered some word which was inaudible even to him she gave him her hand and immediately endeavoured to resume it but he held it clenched within his own and she felt that she was his prisoner He was standing close to her now and she could not escape from him She was trembling with fear lest worse might betide her even than this She had promised to marry him and now she was covered with dismay as she felt rather than thought how very far she was from loving the man to whom she had given this promise Alice he said I am a man once again It is only now that I can tell you what I have suffered during these last few years He still held her hand but he had not as yet attempted any closer embrace She knew that she was standing away from him awkwardly almost showing her repugnance to him but it was altogether beyond her power to assume an attitude of ordinary ease Alice he continued I feel that I am a strong man again armed to meet the world at all points Will you not let me thank you for what you have done for me She must speak to him Though the doing so should be ever so painful to her she must say some word to him which should have in it a sound of kindness After all it was his undoubted right to come to her and the footing on which he assumed to stand was simply that which she herself had given to him It was not his fault if at this moment he inspired her with disgust rather than with love I have done nothing for you George she said nothing at all Then she got her hand away from him and retreated back to a sofa where she seated herself leaving him still standing in the space before the fire That you may do much for yourself is my greatest hope If I can help you I will do so most heartily Then she became thoroughly ashamed of her words feeling that she was at once offering to him the use of her purse Of course you will help me he said I am full of plans all of which you must share with me But now at this moment my one great plan is that in which you have already consented to be my partner Alice you are my wife now Tell me that it will make you happy to call me your husband Not for worlds could she have said so at this moment It was ill judged in him to press her thus He should already have seen with half an eye that no such triumph as that which he now demanded could be his on this occasion He had had his triumph when in the solitude of his own room with quiet sarcasm he had thrown on one side of him the letter in which she had accepted him as though the matter had been one almost indifferent to him He had no right to expect the double triumph Then he had frankly told himself that her money would be useful to him He should have been contented with that conviction and not have required her also to speak to him soft winning words of love That must be still distant George she said I have suffered so much And it has been my fault that you have suffered I know that These years of misery have been my doing It was however the year of coming misery that was the most to be dreaded I do not say that she replied nor have I ever thought it I have myself and myself only to blame Here he altogether misunderstood her believing her to mean that the fault for which she blamed herself had been committed in separating herself from him on that former occasion Alice dear let bygones be bygones Bygones will not be bygones It may be well for people to say so but it is never true One might as well say so to one s body as to one s heart But the hairs will grow grey and the heart will grow cold I do not see that one follows upon the other said George My hair is growing very grey and to show that it was so he lifted the dark lock from the side of his forehead and displayed the incipient grizzling of the hair from behind If grey hairs make an old man Alice you will marry an old husband but even you shall not be allowed to say that my heart is old That word husband which her cousin had twice used was painful to Alice s ear She shrunk from it with palpable bodily suffering Marry an old husband His age was nothing to the purpose though he had been as old as Enoch But she was again obliged to answer him I spoke of my own heart said she I sometimes feel that it has grown very old Alice that is hardly cheering to me You have come to me too quickly George and do not reflect how much there is that I must remember You have said that bygones should be bygones Let them be so at any rate as far as words are concerned Give me a few months in which I may learn not to forget them for that will be impossible but to abstain from speaking of them There was something in her look as she spoke and in the tone of her voice that was very sad It struck him forcibly but it struck him with anger rather than with sadness Doubtless her money had been his chief object when he offered to renew his engagement with her Doubtless he would have made no such offer had she been penniless or even had his own need been less pressing But nevertheless he desired something more than money The triumph of being preferred to John Grey of having John Grey sent altogether adrift in order that his old love might be recovered would have been too costly a luxury for him to seek had he not in seeking it been able to combine prudence with the luxury But though his prudence had been undoubted he desired the luxury also It was on a calculation of the combined advantage that he had made his second offer to his cousin As he would by no means have consented to proceed with the arrangement without the benefit of his cousin s money so also did he feel unwilling to dispense with some expression of her love for him which would be to him triumphant Hitherto in their present interview there had certainly been no expression of her love Alice he said your greeting to me is hardly all that I had hoped Is it not said she Indeed George I am sorry that you should be disappointed but what can I say You would not have me affect a lightness of spirit which I do not feel If you wish said he very slowly if you wish to retract your letter to me you now have my leave to do so What an opportunity was this of escape But she had not the courage to accept it What girl under such circumstances would have had such courage How often are offers made to us which we would almost give our eyes to accept but dare not accept because we fear the countenance of the offerer I do not wish to retract my letter said she speaking as slowly as he had spoken but I wish to be left awhile that I may recover my strength of mind Have you not heard doctors say that muscles which have been strained should be allowed rest or they will never entirely renew their tension It is so with me now if I could be quiet for a few months I think I could learn to face the future with a better courage And is that all you can say to me Alice What would you have me say I would fain hear one word of love from you is that unreasonable I would wish to know from your own lips that you have satisfaction in the renewed prospect of our union is that too ambitious It might have been that I was over bold in pressing my suit upon you again but as you accepted it have I not a right to expect that you should show me that you have been happy in accepting it But she had not been happy in accepting it She was not happy now that she had accepted it She could not show to him any sign of such joy as that which he desired to see And now at this moment she feared with an excessive fear that there would come some demand for an outward demonstration of love such as he in his position might have a right to make She seemed to be aware that this might be prevented only by such demeanour on her part as that which she had practised and she could not therefore be stirred to the expression of any word of affection She listened to his appeal and when it was finished she made no reply If he chose to take her in dudgeon he must do so She would make for him any sacrifice that was possible to her but this sacrifice was not possible And you have not a word to say to me he asked She looked up at him and saw that the cicature on his face was becoming ominous his eyes were bent upon her with all their forbidding brilliance and he was assuming that look of angry audacity which was so peculiar to him and which had so often cowed those with whom he was brought in contact No other word at present George I have told you that I am not at ease Why do you press me now He had her letter to him in the breast pocket of his coat and his hand was on it that he might fling it back to her and tell her that he would not hold her to be his promised wife under such circumstances as these The anger which would have induced him to do so was the better part of his nature Three or four years since this better part would have prevailed and he would have given way to his rage But now as his fingers played upon the paper he remembered that her money was absolutely essential to him that some of it was needed by him almost instantly that on this very morning he was bound to go where money would be demanded from him and that his hopes with regard to Chelsea could not be maintained unless he was able to make some substantial promise of providing funds His sister Kate s fortune was just two thousand pounds That and no more was now the capital at his command if he should abandon this other source of aid Even that must go if all other sources should fail him but he would fain have that untouched if it were possible Oh that that old man in Westmoreland would die and be gathered to his fathers now that he was full of years and ripe for the sickle But there was no sign of death about the old man So his fingers released their hold on the letter and he stood looking at her in his anger You wish me then to go from you he said Do not be angry with me George Angry I have no right to be angry But by heaven I am wrong there I have the right and I am angry I think you owed it me to give me some warmer welcome Is it to be thus with us always for the next accursed year Oh George To me it will be accursed But is it to be thus between us always Alice I have loved you above all women I may say that I have never loved any woman but you and yet I am sometimes driven to doubt whether you have a heart in you capable of love After all that has passed all your old protestations all my repentance and your proffer of forgiveness you should have received me with open arms I suppose I may go now and feel that I have been kicked out of your house like a dog If you speak to me like that and look at me like that how can I answer you I want no answer I wanted you to put your hand in mine to kiss me and to tell me that you are once more my own Alice think better of it kiss me and let me feel my arm once more round your waist She shuddered as she sat still silent on her seat and he saw that she shuddered With all his desire for her money his instant need of it this was too much for him and he turned upon his heel and left the room without another word She heard his quick step as he hurried down the stairs but she did not rise to arrest him She heard the door slam as he left the house but still she did not move from her seat Her immediate desire had been that he should go and now he was gone There was in that a relief which almost comforted her And this was the man from whom within the last few days she had accepted an offer of marriage George when he left the house walked hurriedly into Cavendish Square and down along the east side till he made his way out along Princes Street into the Circus in Oxford Street Close to him there in Great Marlborough Street was the house of his parliamentary attorney mister Scruby on whom he was bound to call on that morning As he had walked away from Queen Anne Street he had thought of nothing but that too visible shudder which his cousin Alice had been unable to repress He had been feeding on his anger and indulging it telling himself at one moment that he would let her and her money go from him whither they list and making inward threats in the next that the time should come in which he would punish her for this ill usage But there was the necessity of resolving what he would say to mister Scruby To mister Scruby was still due some trifle on the cost of the last election but even if this were paid mister Scruby would make no heavy advance towards the expense of the next election Whoever might come out at the end of such affairs without a satisfactory settlement of his little bill as had for a while been the case with mister Grimes from the Handsome Man and as indeed still was the case with him as that note of hand at three months date was not yet paid mister Scruby seldom allowed himself to suffer It was true that the election would not take place till the summer but there were preliminary expenses which needed ready money Metropolitan voters as mister Scruby often declared required to be kept in good humour so that mister Scruby wanted the present payment of some five hundred pounds and a well grounded assurance that he would be put in full funds by the beginning of next June Even mister Scruby might not be true as perfect steel if he thought that his candidate at the last moment would not come forth properly prepared Other candidates with money in their pockets might find their way into mister Scruby s offices As George Vavasor crossed Regent Street he gulped down his anger and applied his mind to business Should he prepare himself to give orders that Kate s little property should be sold out or would he resolve to use his cousin s money That his cousin s money would still be at his disposal in spite of the stormy mood in which he had retreated from her presence he felt sure but the asking for it on his part would be unpleasant That duty he must entrust to Kate But as he reached mister Scruby s door he had decided that for such purposes as those now in hand it was preferable that he should use his wife s fortune It was thus that in his own mind he worded the phrase and made for himself an excuse Yes he would use his wife s fortune and explain to mister Scruby that he would be justified in doing so by the fact that his own heritage would be settled on her at her marriage I do not suppose that he altogether liked it He was not at any rate as yet an altogether heartless swindler He could not take his cousin s money without meaning without thinking that he meant to repay her in full all that he took Her behaviour to him this very morning had no doubt made the affair more difficult to his mind and more unpleasant than it would have been had she smiled on him but even as it was he managed to assure himself that he was doing her no wrong and with this self assurance he entered mister Scruby s office The clerks in the outer office were very civil to him and undertook to promise him that he should not be kept waiting an instant There were four gentlemen in the little parlour they said waiting to see mister Scruby but there they should remain till mister Vavasor s interview was over One gentleman as it seemed was even turned out to make way for him for as George was ushered into the lawyer s room a little man looking very meek was hurried away from it You can wait Smithers said mister Scruby speaking from within I shan t be very long Vavasor apologized to his agent for the injury he was doing Smithers but mister Scruby explained that he was only a poor devil of a printer looking for payment of his little account He had printed and posted thirty thousand placards for one of the late Marylebone candidates and found some difficulty in getting his money You see when they re in a small way of business it ruins them said Scruby Now that poor devil he hasn t had a shilling of his money yet and the greater part has been paid out of his pocket to the posters It is hard It comforted Vavasor when he thus heard that there were others who were more backward in their payments even than himself and made him reflect that a longer credit than had yet been achieved by him might perhaps be within his reach It is astonishing how much a man may get done for him said he without paying anything for years Yes that s true So he may if he knows how to go about it But when he does pay mister Vavasor he does it through the nose cent per cent and worse for all his former shortcomings How many there are who never pay at all said George Yes mister Vavasor that s true too But see what a life they lead It isn t a pleasant thing to be afraid of coming into your agent s office not what you would like mister Vavasor not if I know you I never was afraid of meeting anyone yet said Vavasor but I don t know what I may come to Nor never will I ll go bail But Lord love you I could tell you such tales I ve had Members of Parliament past present and future almost down on their knees to me in this little room It s about a month or six weeks before the elections come on when they re at their worst There is so much you see mister Vavasor for which a gentleman must pay ready money It isn t like a business in which a lawyer is supposed to find the capital If I had money enough to pay out of my own pocket all the cost of all the metropolitan gentlemen for whom I act why I could live on the interest without any trouble and go into Parliament myself like a man George Vavasor perfectly understood that mister Scruby was explaining to him with what best attempt at delicacy he could make that funds for the expense of the Chelsea election were not to be forthcoming from the Great Marlborough Street establishment I suppose so said he But you do do it sometimes Never mister Vavasor said mister Scruby very solemnly As a rule never I may advance the money on interest of course when I receive a guarantee from the candidate s father or from six or seven among the committee who must all be very substantial very substantial indeed But in a general way I don t do it It isn t my place I thought you did but at any rate I don t want you to do it for me I m quite sure you don t said mister Scruby with a brighter tone of voice than that he had just been using I never thought you did mister Vavasor Lord bless you mister Vavasor I know the difference between gentlemen as soon as I see them Then they went to business and Vavasor became aware that it would be thought convenient that he should lodge with mister Scruby to his own account a sum not less than six hundred pounds within the next week and it would be also necessary that he should provide for taking up that bill amounting to ninety two pounds which he had given to the landlord of the Handsome Man In short it would be well that he should borrow a thousand pounds from Alice and as he did not wish that the family attorney of the Vavasors should be employed to raise it he communicated to mister Scruby as much of his plans as was necessary feeling more hesitation in doing it than might have been expected from him When he had done so he was very intent on explaining also that the money taken from his cousin and future bride would be repaid to her out of the property in Westmoreland which was did he say settled on himself I am afraid he did Yes yes a family arrangement said mister Scruby as he congratulated him on his proposed marriage mister Scruby did not care a straw from what source the necessary funds might be drawn CHAPTER XXXVI John Grey Goes a Second Time to London Early in that conversation which mister Vavasor had with his daughter and which was recorded a few pages back he implored her to pause a while before she informed mister Grey of her engagement with her cousin Nothing however on that point had been settled between them mister Vavasor had wished her to say that she would not write till he should have assented to her doing so She had declined to bind herself in this way and then they had gone off to other things to George Vavasor s character and the disposition of her money Alice however had felt herself bound not to write to mister Grey quite at once Indeed when her cousin left her she had no appetite for writing such a letter as hers was to be A day or two passed by her in this way and nothing more was said by her or her father It was now the middle of January and the reader may remember that mister Grey had promised that he would come to her in London in that month as soon as he should know that she had returned from Westmoreland She must at any rate do something to prevent that visit mister Grey would not come without giving her notice She knew enough of the habits of the man to be sure of that But she desired that her letter to him should be in time to prevent his to her so when those few days were gone she sat down to write without speaking to her father again upon the subject It was a terrible job perhaps the most difficult of all the difficult tasks which her adverse fate had imposed upon her She found when she did attempt it that she could have done it better if she had done it at the moment when she was writing the other letter to her cousin George Then Kate had been near her and she had been comforted by Kate s affectionate happiness She had been strengthened at that moment by a feeling that she was doing the best in her power if not for herself at any rate for others All that comfort and all that strength had left her now The atmosphere of the fells had buoyed her up and now the thick air of London depressed her She sat for hours with the pen in her hand and could not write the letter She let a day go by and a night and still it was not written She hardly knew herself in her unnatural weakness As the mental photographs of the two men forced themselves upon her she could not force herself to forget those words Look here upon this picture and on this How was it that she now knew how great was the difference between the two men how immense the pre eminence of him whom she had rejected and that she had not before been able to see this on any of those many previous occasions on which she had compared the two together As she thought of her cousin George s face when he left her room a few days since and remembered mister Grey s countenance when last he held her hand at Cheltenham the quiet dignity of his beauty which would submit to show no consciousness of injury she could not but tell herself that when Paradise had been opened to her she had declared herself to be fit only for Pandemonium In that was her chief misery that now now when it was too late she could look at it aright But the letter must be written and on the second day she declared to herself that she would not rise from her chair till it was done The letter was written on that day and was posted I will now ask the reader to go down with me to Nethercoats that we may be present with John Grey when he received it He was sitting at breakfast in his study there and opposite to him lounging in an arm chair with a Quarterly in his hand was the most intimate of his friends Frank Seward a fellow of the college to which they had both belonged mister Seward was a clergyman and the tutor of his college and a man who worked very hard at Cambridge In the days of his leisure he spent much of his time at Nethercoats and he was the only man to whom Grey had told anything of his love for Alice and of his disappointment Even to Seward he had not told the whole story He had at first informed his friend that he was engaged to be married and as he had told this as no secret having even said that he hated secrets on such matters the engagement had been mentioned in the common room of their college and men at Cambridge knew that mister Grey was going to take to himself a wife Then mister Seward had been told that trouble had come and that it was not improbable that there would be no such marriage Even when saying this mister Grey told none of the particulars though he owned to his friend that a heavy blow had struck him His intimacy with Seward was of that thorough kind which is engendered only out of such young and lasting friendship as had existed between them but even to such a friend as this mister Grey could not open his whole heart It was only to a friend who should also be his wife that he could do that as he himself thoroughly understood He had felt that such a friend was wanting to him and he had made the attempt Don t speak of this as yet he had said to mister Seward Of course when the matter is settled those few people who know me must know it But perhaps there may be a doubt as yet and as long as there is a doubt it is better that it should not be discussed He had said no more than this had imputed no blame to Alice had told none of the circumstances but Seward had known that the girl had jilted his friend and had made up his mind that she must be heartless and false He had known also that his friend would never look for any other such companion for his home Letters were brought to each of them on this morning and Seward s attention was of course occupied by those which he received Grey as soon as the envelopes had touched his hand became aware that one of them was from Alice and this he at once opened He did it very calmly but without any of that bravado of indifference with which George Vavasor had received Alice s letter from Westmoreland It is right that I should tell you at once said Alice rushing into the middle of her subject without even the formality of the customary address It is right that I should tell you at once that Oh the difficulty which she had encountered when her words had carried her as far as this that my cousin George Vavasor has repeated to me his offer of marriage and that I have accepted it I tell you chiefly in order that I may save you from the trouble which you purposed to take when I last saw you at Cheltenham I will not tell you any of the circumstances of this engagement because I have no right to presume that you will care to hear them I hardly dare to ask you to believe of me that in all that I have done I have endeavoured to act with truth and honesty That I have been very ignorant foolish what you will that is bad I know well otherwise there could not have been so much in the last few years of my life on which I am utterly ashamed to look back For the injury that I have done you I can only express deep contrition I do not dare to ask you to forgive me ALICE VAVASOR She had tormented herself in writing this had so nearly driven herself distracted with attempts which she had destroyed that she would not even read once to herself these last words He ll know it and that is all that is necessary she said to herself as she sent the letter away from her mister Grey read it twice over leaving the other letters unnoticed on the table by his tea cup He read it twice over and the work of reading it was one to him of intense agony Hitherto he had fed himself with hope That Alice should have been brought to think of her engagement with him in a spirit of doubt and with a mind so troubled that she had been inclined to attempt an escape from it had been very grievous to him but it had been in his mind a fantasy a morbid fear of himself which might be cured by time He at any rate would give all his energies towards achieving such a cure There had been one thing however which he most feared which he had chiefly feared though he had forbidden himself to think that it could be probable and this thing had now happened He had ever disliked and feared George Vavasor not from any effect which the man had upon himself for as we know his acquaintance with Vavasor was of the slightest but he had feared and disliked his influence upon Alice He had also feared the influence of her cousin Kate To have cautioned Alice against her cousins would have been to him impossible It was not his nature to express suspicion to one he loved Is the tone of that letter remembered in which he had answered Alice when she informed him that her cousin George was to go with Kate and her to Switzerland He had written with a pleasant joke words which Alice had been able to read with some little feeling of triumph to her two friends He had not so written because he liked what he knew of the man He disliked all that he knew of him But it had not been possible for him to show that he distrusted the prudence of her whom as his future wife he was prepared to trust in all things I have said that he read Alice s letter with an agony of sorrow as he sat with it in his hand he suffered as probably he had never suffered before But there was nothing in his countenance to show that he was in pain Seward had received some long epistle crossed from end to end indicative I should say of a not far distant termination to that college tutorship and was reading it with placid contentment It did not occur to him to look across at Grey but had he done so I doubt whether he would have seen anything to attract his attention But Grey though he was wounded would not allow himself to be dismayed There was less hope now than before but there might still be hope hope for her even though there might be none for him Tidings had reached his ears also as to George Vavasor which had taught him to believe that the man was needy reckless and on the brink of ruin Such a marriage to Alice Vavasor would be altogether ruinous Whatever might be his own ultimate fate he would still seek to save her from that Her cousin doubtless wanted her money Might it not be possible that he would be satisfied with her money and that thus the woman might be saved Seward he said at last addressing his friend who had not yet come to the end of the last crossed page Is there anything wrong said Seward Well yes there is something a little wrong I fear I must leave you and go up to town to day Nobody ill I hope No nobody is ill But I must go up to London missus Bole will take care of you and you must not be angry with me for leaving you Seward assured him that he would not be in the least angry and that he was thoroughly conversant with the capabilities and good intentions of missus Bole the housekeeper but added that as he was so near his own college he would of course go back to Cambridge He longed to say some word as to the purpose of Grey s threatened journey to make some inquiry as to this new trouble but he knew that Grey was a man who did not well bear close inquiries and he was silent Why not stay here said Grey after a minute s pause I wish you would old fellow I do indeed There was a tone of special affection in his voice which struck Seward at once If I can be of the slightest service or comfort to you I will of course Grey again sat silent for a little while I wish you would I do indeed Then I will And again there was a pause I have got a letter here from Miss Vavasor said Grey May I hope that No it does not bring good news to me I do not know that I can tell it you all I would if I could but the whole story is one not to be told in a hurry I should leave false impressions There are things which a man cannot tell Indeed there are said Seward I wish with all my heart that you knew it all as I know it but that is impossible There are things which happen in a day which it would take a lifetime to explain Then there was another pause I have heard bad news this morning and I must go up to London at once I shall go into Ely so as to be there by twelve and if you will you shall drive me over I may be back in a day certainly in less than a week but it will be a comfort to me to know that I shall find you here The matter was so arranged and at eleven they started During the first two miles not a word was spoken between them Seward Grey said at last if I fail in what I am going to attempt it is probable that you will never hear Alice Vavasor s name mentioned by me again but I want you always to bear this in mind that at no moment has my opinion of her ever been changed nor must you in such case imagine from my silence that it has changed Do you understand me I think I do To my thinking she is the finest of God s creatures that I have known It may be that in her future life she will be severed from me altogether but I shall not therefore think the less well of her and I wish that you as my friend should know that I so esteem her even though her name should never be mentioned between us Seward in some few words assured him that it should be so and then they finished their journey in silence From the station at Ely Grey sent a message by the wires up to John Vavasor saying that he would call on him that afternoon at his office in Chancery Lane The chances were always much against finding mister Vavasor at his office but on this occasion the telegram did reach him there and he remained till the unaccustomed hour of half past four to meet the man who was to have been his son in law Have you heard from her he asked as soon as Grey entered the dingy little room not in Chancery Lane but in its neighbourhood which was allocated to him for his signing purposes Yes said Grey she has written to me And told you about her cousin George I tried to hinder her from writing but she is very wilful Why should you have hindered her If the thing was to be told it is better that it should be done at once But I hoped that there might be an escape I don t know what you think of all this Grey but to me it is the bitterest misfortune that I have known And I ve had some bitter things too he added thinking of that period of his life when the work of which he was ashamed was first ordained as his future task What is the escape that you hoped asked Grey I hardly know The whole thing seems to me to be so mad that I partly trusted that she would see the madness of it I am not sure whether you know anything of my nephew George asked mister Vavasor Very little said Grey I believe him to be utterly an adventurer a man without means and without principle upon the whole about as bad a man as you may meet I give you my word Grey that I don t think I know a worse man He s going to marry her for her money then he will beggar her after that he ll ill treat her and yet what can I do Prevent the marriage But how my dear fellow Prevent it It s all very well to say that and it s the very thing I want to do But how am I to prevent it She s as much her own master as you are yours She can give him every shilling of her fortune to morrow How am I to prevent her from marrying him Let her give him every shilling of her fortune to morrow said Grey And what is she to do then asked mister Vavasor Then then then then let her come to me said John Grey and as he spoke there was the fragment of a tear in his eye and the hint of quiver in his voice Illustration Then then then let her come to me Even the worldly worn out unsympathetic nature of John Vavasor was struck and as it were warmed by this God bless you God bless you my dear fellow I heartily wish for her sake that I could look forward to any such an end to this affair And why not look forward to it You say that he merely wants her money As he wants it let him have it But Grey you do not know Alice you do not understand my girl When she had lost her fortune nothing would induce her to become your wife Leave that to follow as it may said John Grey Our first object must be to sever her from a man who is as you say himself on the verge of ruin and who would certainly make her wretched I am here now not because I wish her to be my own wife but because I wish that she should not become the wife of such a one as your nephew If I were you I would let him have her money If you were I you would have nothing more to do with it than the man that is as yet unborn I know that she will give him her money because she has said so but I have no power as to her giving it or as to her withholding it That s the hardship of my position but it is of no use to think of that now John Grey certainly did not think about it He knew well that Alice was independent and that she was not inclined to give up that independence to anyone He had not expected that her father would be able to do much towards hindering his daughter from becoming the wife of George Vavasor but he had wished that he himself and her father should be in accord in their views and he found that this was so When he left mister Vavasor s room nothing had been said about the period of the marriage Grey thought it improbable that Alice would find herself able to give herself in marriage to her cousin immediately so soon after her breach with him but as to this he had no assurance and he determined to have the facts from her own lips if she would see him So he wrote to her naming a day on which he would call upon her early in the morning and having received from her no prohibition he was in Queen Anne Street at the hour appointed He had conceived a scheme which he had not made known to mister Vavasor and as to the practicability of which he had much doubt but which nevertheless he was resolved to try if he should find the attempt possible He himself would buy off George Vavasor He had ever been a prudent man and he had money at command If Vavasor was such a man as they who knew him best represented him such a purchase might be possible But then before this was attempted he must be quite sure that he knew his man and he must satisfy himself also that in doing so he would not in truth add to Alice s misery He could hardly bring himself to think it possible that she did in truth love her cousin with passionate love It seemed to him as he remembered what Alice had been to himself that this must be impossible But if it were so that of course must put an end to his interference He thought that if he saw her he might learn all this and therefore he went to Queen Anne Street Of course he must come if he will she said to herself when she received his note It can make no matter He will say nothing half so hard to me as what I say to myself all day long But when the morning came and the hour came and the knock at the door for which her ears were on the alert her heart misgave her and she felt that the present moment of her punishment though not the heaviest would still be hard to bear He came slowly up stairs his step was ever slow and gently opened the door for himself Then before he even looked at her he closed it again I do not know how to explain that it was so but it was this perfect command of himself at all seasons which had in part made Alice afraid of him and drove her to believe that they were not fitted for each other She when he thus turned for a moment from her and then walked slowly towards her stood with both her hands leaning on the centre table of the room and with her eyes fixed upon its surface Alice he said walking up to her very slowly Her whole frame shuddered as she heard the sweetness of his voice Had I not better tell the truth of her at once Oh if she could only have been his again What madness during these last six months had driven her to such a plight as this The old love came back upon her Nay it had never gone But that trust in his love returned to her that trust which told her that such love and such worth would have sufficed to make her happy But this confidence in him was worthless now Even though he should desire it she could not change again Alice he said again And then as slowly she looked up at him he asked her for her hand You may give it me he said as to an old friend She put her hand in his hand and then withdrawing it felt that she must never trust herself to do so again Alice he continued I do not expect you to say much to me but there is a question or two which I think you will answer Has a day been fixed for this marriage No she said Will it be in a month Oh no not for a year she replied hurriedly and he knew at once by her voice that she already dreaded this new wedlock Whatever of anger he might before have felt for her was banished She had brought herself by her ill judgement by her ignorance as she had confessed to a sad pass but he believed that she was still worthy of his love And now one other question Alice but if you are silent I will not ask it again Can you tell me why you have again accepted your cousin s offer Because she said very quickly looking up as though she were about to speak with all her old courage But you would never understand me she said and there can be no reason why I should dare to hope that you should ever think well of me again He knew that there was no love no love for that man to whom she had pledged her hand He did not know on the other hand how strong how unchanged how true was her love for himself Indeed of himself he was thinking not at all He desired to learn whether she would suffer if by any scheme he might succeed in breaking off this marriage When he had asked her whether she were to be married at once she had shuddered at the thought When he asked her why she had accepted her cousin she had faltered and hinted at some excuse which he might fail to understand Had she loved George Vavasor he could have understood that well enough Alice he said speaking still very slowly nothing has ever yet been done which need to a certainty separate you and me I am a persistent man and I do not even yet give up all hope A year is a long time As you say yourself I do not as yet quite understand you But Alice and I think that the position in which we stood a few months since justifies me in saying so without offence I love you now as well as ever and should things change with you I cannot tell you with how much joy and eagerness I should take you back to my bosom My heart is yours now as it has been since I knew you Then he again just touched her hand and left her before she had been able to answer a word CHAPTER XXXVII mister Tombe s Advice Alice sat alone for an hour without moving when John Grey had left her and the last words which he had uttered were sounding in her ears all the time My heart is still yours as it has been since I knew you There had been something in his words which had soothed her spirits and had for the moment almost comforted her At any rate he did not despise her He could not have spoken such words as these to her had he not still held her high in his esteem Nay had he not even declared that he would yet take her as his own if she would come to him I cannot tell you with how much joy I would take you back to my bosom Ah that might never be But yet the assurance had been sweet to her dangerously sweet as she soon told herself She knew that she had lost her Eden but it was something to her that the master of the garden had not himself driven her forth She sat there thinking of her fate as though it belonged to some other one not to herself as though it were a tale that she had read Herself she had shipwrecked altogether but though she might sink she had not been thrust from the ship by hands which she loved But would it not have been better that he should have scorned her and reviled her Had he been able to do so he at least would have escaped the grief of disappointed love Had he learned to despise her he would have ceased to regret her She had no right to feel consolation in the fact that his sufferings were equal to her own But when she thought of this she told herself that it could not be that it was so He was a man she said not passionate by nature Alas it was the mistake she had ever made when summing up the items of his character He might be persistent she thought in still striving to do that upon which he had once resolved He had said so and that which he said was always true to the letter But nevertheless when this thing which he still chose to pursue should have been put absolutely beyond his reach he would not allow his calm bosom to be harassed by a vain regret He was a man too whole at every point so Alice told herself to allow his happiness to be marred by such an accident But must the accident occur Was there no chance that he might be saved even from such trouble as might follow upon such a loss Could it not be possible that he might be gratified since it would gratify him and that she might be saved Over and over again she considered this but always as though it were another woman whom she would fain save and not herself But she knew that her own fate was fixed She had been mad when she had done the thing but the thing was not on that account the less done She had been mad when she had trusted herself abroad with two persons both of whom as she had well known were intent on wrenching her happiness from out of her grasp She had been mad when she had told herself whilst walking over the Westmoreland fells that after all she might as well marry her cousin since that other marriage was then beyond her reach Her two cousins had succeeded in blighting all the hopes of her life but what could she now think of herself in that she had been so weak as to submit to such usage from their hands Alas she told herself admitting in her misery all her weakness alas she had no mother She had gloried in her independence and this had come of it She had scorned the prudence of Lady Macleod and her scorn had brought her to this pass Was she to give herself bodily body and soul as she said aloud in her solitary agony to a man whom she did not love Must she submit to his caresses lie on his bosom turn herself warmly to his kisses No she said no speaking audibly as she walked about the room no it was not in my bargain I never meant it But if so what had she meant what had been her dream Of what marriage had she thought when she was writing that letter back to George Vavasor How am I to analyse her mind and make her thoughts and feelings intelligible to those who may care to trouble themselves with the study Any sacrifice she would make for her cousin which one friend could make for another She would fight his battles with her money with her words with her sympathy She would sit with him if he needed it and speak comfort to him by the hour His disgrace should be her disgrace his glory her glory his pursuits her pursuits Was not that the marriage to which she had consented But he had come to her and asked her for a kiss and she had shuddered before him when he made the demand Then that other one had come and had touched her hand and the fibres of her body had seemed to melt within her at the touch so that she could have fallen at his feet She had done very wrong She knew that she had done wrong She knew that she had sinned with that sin which specially disgraces a woman She had said that she would become the wife of a man to whom she could not cleave with a wife s love and mad with a vile ambition she had given up the man for whose modest love her heart was longing She had thrown off from her that wondrous aroma of precious delicacy which is the greatest treasure of womanhood She had sinned against her sex and in an agony of despair as she crouched down upon the floor with her head against her chair she told herself that there was no pardon for her She understood it now and knew that she could not forgive herself But can you forgive her delicate reader Or am I asking the question too early in my story For myself I have forgiven her The story of the struggle has been present to my mind for many years and I have learned to think that even this offence against womanhood may with deep repentance be forgiven And you also must forgive her before we close the book or else my story will have been told amiss But let us own that she had sinned almost damnably almost past forgiveness What think that she knew what love meant and not know which of two she loved What doubt of two men for whose arms she longed of which the kisses would be sweet to bear on which side lay the modesty of her maiden love Faugh She had submitted to pollution of heart and feeling before she had brought herself to such a pass as this Come let us see if it be possible that she may be cleansed by the fire of her sorrow What am I to do She passed that whole day in asking herself that question She was herself astounded at the rapidity with which the conviction had forced itself upon her that a marriage with her cousin would be to her almost impossible and could she permit it to be said of her that she had thrice in her career jilted a promised suitor that three times she would go back from her word because her fancy had changed Where could she find the courage to tell her father to tell Kate to tell even George himself that her purpose was again altered But she had a year at her disposal If only during that year he would take her money and squander it and then require nothing further of her hands might she not thus escape the doom before her Might it not be possible that the refusal should this time come from him But she succeeded in making one resolve She thought at least that she succeeded Come what might she would never stand with him at the altar While there was a cliff from which she might fall water that would cover her a death dealing grain that might be mixed in her cup she could not submit herself to be George Vavasor s wife To no ear could she tell of this resolve To no friend could she hint her purpose She owed her money to the man after what had passed between them It was his right to count upon such assistance as that would give him and he should have it Only as his betrothed she could give it him for she understood well that if there were any breach between them his accepting of such aid would be impossible He should have her money and then when the day came some escape should be found In the afternoon her father came to her and it may be as well to explain that mister Grey had seen him again that day mister Grey when he left Queen Anne Street had gone to his lawyer and from thence had made his way to mister Vavasor It was between five and six when mister Vavasor came back to his house and he then found his daughter sitting over the drawing room fire without lights in the gloom of the evening mister Vavasor had returned with Grey to the lawyer s chambers and had from thence come direct to his own house He had been startled at the precision with which all the circumstances of his daughter s position had been explained to a mild eyed old gentleman with a bald head who carried on his business in a narrow dark clean street behind Doctors Commons mister Tombe was his name No mister Grey had said when mister Vavasor had asked as to the peculiar nature of mister Tombe s business he is not specially an ecclesiastical lawyer He had a partner at Ely and was always employed by my father and by most of the clergy there mister Tombe had evinced no surprise no dismay and certainly no mock delicacy when the whole affair was under discussion George Vavasor was to get present moneys but if it could be so arranged from John Grey s stores rather than from those belonging to Alice mister Tombe could probably arrange that with mister Vavasor s lawyer who would no doubt be able to make difficulty as to raising ready money mister Tombe would be able to raise ready money without difficulty And then at last George Vavasor was to be made to surrender his bride taking or having taken the price of his bargain John Vavasor sat by in silence as the arrangement was being made not knowing how to speak He had no money with which to give assistance I wish you to understand from the lady s father Grey said to the lawyer that the marriage would be regarded by him with as much dismay as by myself Certainly it would be ruinous mister Vavasor had answered And you see mister Tombe mister Grey went on we only wish to try the man If he be not such as we believe him to be he can prove it by his conduct If he is worthy of her he can then take her You merely wish to open her eyes mister Grey said the mild eyed lawyer I wish that he should have what money he wants and then we shall find what it is he really wishes Yes we shall know our man said the lawyer He shall have the money mister Grey and so the interview had been ended mister Vavasor when he entered the drawing room addressed his daughter in a cheery voice What all in the dark Yes papa Why should I have candles when I am doing nothing I did not expect you No I suppose not I came here because I want to say a few words to you about business What business papa Alice well understood the tone of her father s voice He was desirous of propitiating her but was at the same time desirous of carrying some point in which he thought it probable that she would oppose him Well my love if I understood you rightly your cousin George wants some money I did not say that he wants it now but I think he will want it before the time for the election comes If so he will want it at once He has not asked you for it yet No he has merely said that should he be in need he would take me at my word I think there is no doubt that he wants it Indeed I believe that he is almost entirely without present means of his own I can hardly think so but I have no knowledge about it I can only say that he has not asked me yet and that I should wish to oblige him whenever he may do so To what extent Alice I don t know what I have I get about four hundred a year but I do not know what it is worth or how far it can all be turned into money I should wish to keep a hundred a year and let him have the rest What eight thousand pounds said the father who in spite of his wish not to oppose her could not but express his dismay I do not imagine that he will want so much but if he should I wish that he should have it Heaven and earth said John Vavasor Of course we should have to give up the house He could not suppress his trouble or refrain from bursting out in agony at the prospect of such a loss But he has asked me for nothing yet papa No exactly and perhaps he may not but I wish to know what to do when the demand is made I am not going to oppose you now your money is your own and you have a right to do with it as you please but would you gratify me in one thing What is it papa When he does apply let the amount be raised through me How through you Come to me I mean so that I may see the lawyer and have the arrangements made Then he explained to her that in dealing with large sums of money it could not be right that she should do so without his knowledge even though the property was her own I will promise you that I will not oppose your wishes he said Then Alice undertook that when such case should arise the money should be raised through his means The day but one following this she received a letter from Lady Glencora who was still at Matching Priory It was a light spirited chatty amusing letter intended to be happy in its tone intended to have a flavour of happiness but just failing through the too apparent meaning of a word here and there You will see that I am at Matching the letter said whereas you will remember that I was to have been at Monkshade I escaped at last by a violent effort and am now passing my time innocently I fear not so profitably as she would induce me to do with Iphy Palliser You remember Iphy She is a good creature and would fain turn even me to profit if it were possible I own that I am thinking of them all at Monkshade and am in truth delighted that I am not there My absence is entirely laid upon your shoulders That wicked evening amidst the ruins Poor ruins I go there alone sometimes and fancy that I hear such voices from the walls and see such faces through the broken windows All the old Pallisers come and frown at me and tell me that I am not good enough to belong to them There is a particular window to which Sir Guy comes and makes faces at me I told Iphy the other day and she answered me very gravely that I might if I chose make myself good enough for the Pallisers Even for the Pallisers Isn t that beautiful Then Lady Glencora went on to say that her husband intended to come up to London early in the session and that she would accompany him That is added Lady Glencora if I am still good enough for the Pallisers at that time CHAPTER XXXVIII The Inn at Shap When George Vavasor left mister Scruby s office the attentive reader will remember that he did call upon mister Scruby the Parliamentary lawyer and there recognised the necessity of putting himself in possession of a small sum of money with as little delay as possible when he left the attorney s office he was well aware that the work to be done was still before him And he knew also that the job to be undertaken was a very disagreeable job He did not like the task of borrowing his cousin Alice s money We all of us know that swindlers and rogues do very dirty tricks and we are apt to picture to ourselves a certain amount of gusto and delight on the part of the swindlers in the doing of them In this I think we are wrong The poor broken semi genteel beggar who borrows half sovereigns apiece from all his old acquaintances knowing that they know that he will never repay them suffers a separate little agony with each petition that he makes He does not enjoy pleasant sailing in this journey which he is making To be refused is painful to him To get his half sovereign with scorn is painful To get it with apparent confidence in his honour is almost more painful D it he says to himself on such rare occasions I will pay that fellow and yet as he says it he knows that he never will pay even that fellow It is a comfortless unsatisfying trade that of living upon other people s money How was George Vavasor to make his first step towards getting his hand into his cousin s purse He had gone to her asking for her love and she had shuddered when he asked her That had been the commencement of their life under their new engagement He knew very well that the money would be forthcoming when he demanded it but under their present joint circumstances how was he to make the demand If he wrote to her should he simply ask for money and make no allusion to his love If he went to her in person should he make his visit a mere visit of business as he might call on his banker He resolved at last that Kate should do the work for him Indeed he had felt all along that it would be well that Kate should act as ambassador between him and Alice in money matters as she had long done in other things He could talk to Kate as he could not talk to Alice and then between the women those hard money necessities would be softened down by a romantic phraseology which he would not himself know how to use with any effect He made up his mind to see Kate and with this view he went down to Westmoreland and took himself to a small wayside inn at Shap among the fells which had been known to him of old He gave his sister notice that he would be there and begged her to come over to him as early as she might find it possible on the morning after his arrival He himself reached the place late in the evening by train from London There is a station at Shap by which the railway company no doubt conceives that it has conferred on that somewhat rough and remote locality all the advantages of a refined civilization but I doubt whether the Shappites have been thankful for the favour The landlord at the inn for one is not thankful Shap had been a place owing all such life as it had possessed to coaching and posting It had been a stage on the high road from Lancaster to Carlisle and though it lay high and bleak among the fells and was a cold windy thinly populated place filling all travellers with thankfulness that they had not been made Shappites nevertheless it had had its glory in its coaching and posting I have no doubt that there are men and women who look back with a fond regret to the palmy days of Shap Vavasor reached the little inn about nine in the evening on a night that was pitchy dark and in a wind which made it necessary for him to hold his hat on to his head What a beastly country to live in he said to himself resolving that he would certainly sell Vavasor Hall in spite of all family associations if ever the power to do so should be his What trash it is he said hanging on to such a place as that without the means of living like a gentleman simply because one s ancestors have done so And then he expressed a doubt to himself whether all the world contained a more ignorant opinionated useless old man than his grandfather or in short a greater fool Well mister George said the landlord as soon as he saw him a sight of you s guid for sair een It s o er lang since you ve been doon amang the fells But George did not want to converse with the innkeeper or to explain how it was that he did not visit Vavasor Hall The innkeeper no doubt knew all about it knew that the grandfather had quarrelled with his grandson and knew the reason why but George if he suspected such knowledge did not choose to refer to it So he simply grunted something in reply and getting himself in before a spark of fire which hardly was burning in a public room with a sandy floor begged that the little sitting room up stairs might be got ready for him There he passed the evening in solitude giving no encouragement to the landlord who nevertheless looked him up three or four times till at last George said that his head ached and that he would wish to be alone He was always one of them cankery chiels as never have a kindly word for man nor beast said the landlord Seems as though that raw slash in his face had gone right through into his heart After that George was left alone and sat thinking whether it would not be better to ask Alice for two thousand pounds at once so as to save him from the disagreeable necessity of a second borrowing before their marriage He was very uneasy in his mind He had flattered himself through it all that his cousin had loved him He had felt sure that such was the case while they were together in Switzerland When she had determined to give up John Grey of course he had told himself the same thing When she had at once answered his first subsequent overture with an assent he had of course been certain that it was so Dark selfish and even dishonest as he was he had nevertheless enjoyed something of a lover s true pleasure in believing that Alice had still loved him through all their mischances But his joy had in a moment been turned into gall during that interview in Queen Anne Street He had read the truth at a glance A man must be very vain or else very little used to such matters who at George Vavasor s age cannot understand the feelings with which a woman receives him When Alice contrived as she had done to escape the embrace he was so well justified in asking he knew the whole truth He was sore at heart and very angry withal He could have readily spurned her from him and rejected her who had once rejected him He would have done so had not his need for her money restrained him He was not a man who could deceive himself in such matters He knew that this was so and he told himself that he was a rascal Vavasor Hall was by the road about five miles from Shap and it was not altogether an easy task for Kate to get over to the village without informing her grandfather that the visit was to be made and what was its purport She could indeed walk and the walk would not be so long as that she had taken with Alice to Swindale fell but walking to an inn on a high road is not the same thing as walking to a point on a hill side over a lake Had she been dirty draggled and wet through on Swindale fell it would have simply been matter for mirth but her brother she knew would not have liked to see her enter the Lowther Arms at Shap in such a condition It therefore became necessary that she should ask her grandfather to lend her the jaunting car Where do you want to go he asked sharply In such establishments as that at Vavasor Hall the family horse is generally used for double duties Though he draws the lady of the house one day he is not too proud to draw manure on the next And it will always be found that the master of the house gives a great preference to the manure over the lady The squire at Vavasor had come to do so to such an extent that he regarded any application for the animal s services as an encroachment Only to Shap grandpapa To Shap what on earth can take you to Shap There are no shops at Shap I am not going to do shopping I want to see some one there Whom can you want to see at Shap Then it occurred to Kate on the spur of the moment that she might as well tell her grandfather the fact My brother has come down she said and is at the inn there I had not intended to tell you as I did not wish to mention his name till you had consented to receive him here And he expects to come here now does he said the squire Oh no sir I think he has no expectation of the kind He has come down simply to see me about business I believe Business what business I suppose he wants to get your money from you I think it is with reference to his marriage I think he wants me to use my influence with Alice that it may not be delayed Look here Kate if ever you lend him your money or any of it that is of the principal I mean I will never speak to him again under any circumstance And more than that Look here Kate In spite of all that has past and gone the property will become his for his life when I die unless I change my will If he gets your money from you I will change it and he shall not be a shilling richer at my death than he is now You can have the horse to go to Shap What unlucky chance had it been which had put this idea into the old squire s head on this especial morning Kate had resolved that she would entreat her brother to make use of her little fortune She feared that he was now coming with some reference to his cousin s money that something was to be done to enable him to avail himself of his cousin s offer and Kate almost blushing in the solitude of her chamber at the thought was determined that her brother must be saved from such temptation She knew that money was necessary to him She knew that he could not stand a second contest without assistance With all their confidences he had never told her much of his pecuniary circumstances in the world but she was almost sure that he was a poor man He had said as much as that to her and in his letter desiring her to come to him at Shap he had inserted a word or two purposely intended to prepare her mind for monetary considerations As she was jogged along over the rough road to Shap she made up her mind that Aunt Greenow would be the proper person to defray the expense of the coming election To give Kate her due she would have given up every shilling of her own money without a moment s hesitation or any feeling that her brother would be wrong to accept it Nor would she perhaps have been unalterably opposed to his taking Alice s money had Alice simply been his cousin She felt that as Vavasors they were bound to stand by the future head of the family in an attempt which was to be made as she felt for the general Vavasor interest But she could not endure to think that her brother should take the money of the girl whom he was engaged to marry Aunt Greenow s money she thought was fair game Aunt Greenow herself had made various liberal offers to herself which Kate had declined not caring to be under pecuniary obligations even to Aunt Greenow without necessity but she felt that for such a purpose as her brother s contest she need not hesitate to ask for assistance and she thought also that such assistance would be forthcoming Grandpapa knows that you are here George said Kate when their first greeting was over The deuce he does and why did you tell him I could not get the car to come in without letting him know why I wanted it What nonsense as if you couldn t have made any excuse I was particularly anxious that he should not guess that I am here I don t see that it can make any difference George But I see that it can a very great difference It may prevent my ever being able to get near him again before he dies What did he say about my coming He didn t say much He made no offer as to my going there No I should not have gone if he had I don t know now that I ever shall go To be there to do any good so as to make him alter his will and leave me in the position which I have a right to expect would take more time than the whole property is worth And he would endeavour to tie me down in some way I could not stand perhaps ask me to give up my notion for going into Parliament He might ask you but he would not make it ground for another quarrel if you refused He is so unreasonable and ignorant that I am better away from him But Kate you have not congratulated me on my matrimonial prospects Indeed I did George when I wrote to you Did you well I had forgotten I don t know that any very strong congratulatory tone is necessary As things go perhaps it may be as well for all of us and that s about the best that can be said for it Oh George You see I m not romantic Kate as you are Half a dozen children with a small income do not generally present themselves as being desirable to men who wish to push their way in the world You know you have always longed to make her your wife I don t know anything of the kind You have always been under a match making hallucination on that point But in this case you have been so far successful and are entitled to your triumph I don t want any triumph you ought to know that But I ll tell you what I do want Kate I want some money Then he paused but as she did not answer immediately he was obliged to go on speaking I m not at all sure that I have not been wrong in making this attempt to get into Parliament that I m not struggling to pick fruit which is above my reach Don t say that George Ah but I can t help feeling it I need hardly tell you that I am ready to risk anything of my own If I know myself I would toss up to morrow or for the matter of that to day between the gallows and a seat in the House But I cannot go on with this contest by risking what is merely my own Money for immediate use I have none left and my neck though I were ever so willing to risk it is of no service Whatever I have can be yours to morrow said Kate in a hesitating voice which too plainly pronounced her misery as she made the offer She could not refrain herself from making it Though her grandfather s threat was ringing in her ears though she knew that she might be ruining her brother by proposing such a loan she had no alternative When her brother told her of his want of money she could not abstain from tendering to him the use of what was her own No said he I shall not take your money You would not scruple if you knew how welcome you are At any rate I shall not take it I should not think it right All that you have would only just suffice for my present wants and I should not choose to make you a beggar There would moreover be a difficulty about readjusting the payment There would be no difficulty because no one need be consulted but us two I should not think it right and therefore let there be an end of it said George in a tone of voice which had in it something of magniloquence What is it you wish then said Kate who knew too well what he did wish I will explain to you When Alice and I are married of course there will be a settlement made on her and as we are both the grandchildren of the old squire I shall propose that the Vavasor property shall be hers for life in the event of her outliving me Well said Kate And if this be done there can be no harm in my forestalling some of her property which under the circumstances of such a settlement would of course become mine when we are married But the squire might leave the property to whom he pleases We know very well that he won t at any rate leave it out of the family In fact he would only be too glad to consent to such an agreement as that I have proposed because he would thereby rob me of all power in the matter But that could not be done till you are married Look here Kate don t you make difficulties And now as he looked at her the cicature on his face seemed to open and yawn at her If you mean to say that you won t help me do say so and I will go back to London I would do anything in my power to help you that was not wrong Yes anybody could say as much as that That is not much of an offer if you are to keep to yourself the power of deciding what is wrong Will you write to Alice or better still go to her and explain that I want the money How can I go to London now You can do it very well if you choose But if that be too much then write to her It will come much better from you than from me write to her and explain that I must pay in advance the expenses of this contest and that I cannot look for success unless I do so I did not think that the demand would come so quick on me but they know that I am not a man of capital and therefore I cannot expect them to carry on the fight for me unless they know that the money is sure Scruby has been bitten two or three times by these metropolitan fellows and he is determined that he will not be bitten again Then he paused for Kate to speak George she said slowly Well I wish you would try any other scheme but that There is no other scheme That s so like a woman to quarrel with the only plan that is practicable I do not think you ought to take Alice s money My dear Kate you must allow me to be the best judge of what I ought to do and what I ought not to do Alice herself understands the matter perfectly She knows that I cannot obtain this position which is as desirable for her as it is for me And for me as much as for either said Kate interrupting him Very well Alice I say knows that I cannot do this without money and has offered the assistance which I want I would rather that you should tell her how much I want and that I want it now than that I should do so That is all If you are half the woman that I take you to be you will understand this well enough Kate did understand it well enough She was quite awake to the fact that her brother was ashamed of the thing he was about to do so much ashamed of it that he was desirous of using her voice instead of his own I want you to write to her quite at once he continued since you seem to think that it is not worth while to take the trouble of a journey to London There is no question about the trouble said Kate I would walk to London to get the money for you if that were all Do you think that Alice will refuse to lend it me said he looking into her face I am sure that she would not but I think that you ought not to take it from her There seems to me to be something sacred about property that belongs to the girl you are going to marry If there is anything on earth I hate said George walking about the room it is romance If you keep it for reading in your bedroom it s all very well for those who like it but when it comes to be mixed up with one s business it plays the devil If you would only sift what you have said you would see what nonsense it is Alice and I are to be man and wife All our interests and all our money and our station in life whatever it may be are to be joint property And yet she is the last person in the world to whom I ought to go for money to improve her prospects as well as my own That s what you call delicacy I call it infernal nonsense I tell you what I ll do George I ll ask Aunt Greenow to lend you the money or to lend it to me I don t believe she d give me a shilling Moreover I want it quite immediately and the time taken up in letter writing and negotiations would be fatal to me If you won t apply to Alice I must I want you to tell me whether you will oblige me in this matter Kate was still hesitating as to her answer when there came a knock at the door and a little crumpled note was brought up to her A boy had just come with it across the fell from Vavasor Hall and Kate as soon as she saw her name on the outside knew that it was from her grandfather It was as follows If George wishes to come to the Hall let him come If he chooses to tell me that he regrets his conduct to me I will see him What is it said George Then Kate put the note into her brother s hand I ll do nothing of the kind he said What good should I get by going to the old man s house Every good said Kate If you don t go now you never can do so Never till it s my own said George If you show him that you are determined to be at variance with him it never will be your own unless indeed it should some day come to you as part of Alice s fortune Think of it George you would not like to receive everything from her He walked about the room muttering maledictions between his teeth and balancing as best he was able at such a moment his pride against his profit You haven t answered my question said he If I go to the Hall will you write to Alice No George I cannot write to Alice asking her for the money You won t I could not bring myself to do it Then Kate you and my grandfather may work together for the future You may get him to leave you the place if you have skill enough That is as undeserved a reproach as any woman ever encountered said Kate standing her ground boldly before him If you have either heart or conscience you will feel that it is so I m not much troubled with either one or the other I fancy Things are being brought to such a pass with me that I am better without them Will you take my money George just for the present No I haven t much conscience but I have a little left Will you let me write to missus Greenow I have not the slightest objection but it will be of no use whatsoever I will do so at any rate And now will you come to the Hall To beg that old fool s pardon No I won t In the mood I am in at present I couldn t do it I should only anger him worse than ever Tell him that I ve business which calls me back to London at once It is a thousand pities It can t be helped It may make so great a difference to you for your whole life urged Kate I ll tell you what I ll do said George I ll go to Vavasor and put up with the old squire s insolence if you ll make this application for me to Alice I wonder whether it occurred to him that his sister desired his presence at the Hall solely on his own behalf The same idea certainly did not occur to Kate She hesitated feeling that she would almost do anything to achieve a reconciliation between her grandfather and her brother But you ll let me write to Aunt Greenow first said she It will take only two days or at the most three To this George consented as though he were yielding a great deal and Kate with a sore conscience with a full knowledge that she was undertaking to do wrong promised that she would apply to Alice for her money if sufficient funds should not be forthcoming from missus Greenow Thereupon George graciously consented to proceed to his bedroom and put together his clothes with a view to his visit to the Hall I thank Providence Kate that circumstances make it impossible for me to stay above two days I have not linen to last me longer We ll manage that for you at the Hall Indeed you won t do anything of the kind And look Kate when I make that excuse don t you offer to do so I will stay there over to morrow night and shall go into Kendal early so as to catch the express train up on Thursday morning Don t you throw me over by any counter proposition Then they started together in the car and very few words were said till they reached the old lodge which stood at the entrance to the place Eh mister George be that you said the old woman who came out to swing back for them the broken gate A sight of you is good for sair een It was the same welcome that the inn keeper had given him and equally sincere George had never made himself popular about the place but he was the heir I suppose you had better go into the drawing room said Kate while I go to my grandfather You won t find a fire there Manage it how you please but don t keep me in the cold very long Heavens what a country house The middle of January and no fires in the room And remember George when you see him you must say that you regret that you ever displeased him Now that you are here don t let there be any further misunderstanding I think it very probable that there will be said George I only hope he ll let me have the old horse to take me back to Shap if there is There he is at the front door so I shan t have to go into the room without a fire The old man was standing at the hall steps when the car drove up as though to welcome his grandson He put out his hand to help Kate down the steps keeping his eye all the time on George s face So you ve come back the squire said to him Illustration So you ve come back have you said the Squire Yes sir I ve come back like the prodigal son in the parable The prodigal son was contrite I hope you are so Pretty well for that sir I m sorry there has been any quarrel and all that you know Go in said the squire very angrily Go in To expect anything gracious from you would be to expect pearls from swine Go in George went in shrugging his shoulders as his eyes met his sister s It was in this fashion that the reconciliation took place between Squire Vavasor and his heir CHAPTER XXXIX mister Cheesacre s Hospitality As the winter wore itself away mister Cheesacre happy as he was amidst the sports of Norfolk and prosperous as he might be with the augean spoils of Oileymead fretted himself with an intense anxiety to bring to a close that affair which he had on his hands with the widow Greenow There were two special dangers which disturbed him She would give herself and all her money to that adventurer Bellfield or else she would spend her own money so fast before he got hold upon it that the prize would be greatly damaged I m if she hasn t been and set up a carriage he said to himself one day as standing on the pavement of Tombland in Norwich he saw missus Greenow issue forth from the Close in a private brougham accompanied by one of the Fairstairs girls She s been and set up her carriage as sure as my name s Cheesacre Whatever reason he might have to fear the former danger we may declare that he had none whatever as to the latter missus Greenow knew what she was doing with her money as well as any lady in England The private carriage was only a hired brougham taken by the month and as to that boy in buttons whom she had lately established why should she not keep a young servant and call him a page if it gave her any comfort to do so If mister Cheesacre had also known that she had lent the Fairstairs family fifty pounds to help them through with some difficulty which Joe had encountered with the Norwich tradespeople he would have been beside himself with dismay He desired to obtain the prize unmutilated in all its fair proportions Any such clippings he regarded as robberies against himself But he feared Bellfield more than he feared the brougham That all is fair in love and war was no doubt at this period Captain Bellfield s maxim and we can only trust that he found in it some consolation or ease to his conscience in regard to the monstrous lies which he told his friend In war no doubt all stratagems are fair The one general is quite justified in making the other believe that he is far to the right when in truth he is turning his enemy s left flank If successful he will be put upon a pedestal for his clever deceit and crowned with laurels because of his lie If Bellfield could only be successful and achieve for himself the mastery over those forty thousand pounds the world would forgive him and place on his brow also some not uncomfortable crown In the mean time his stratagems were as deep and his lies as profound as those of any general It must not be supposed that Cheesacre ever believed him In the first place he knew that Bellfield was not a man to be believed in any way Had he not been living on lies for the last ten years But then a man may lie in such a way as to deceive though no one believe him mister Cheesacre was kept in an agony of doubt while Captain Bellfield occupied his lodgings in Norwich He fee d Jeannette liberally He even fee d Charlie Fairstairs Miss Fairstairs I mean with gloves and chickens from Oileymead so that he might know whether that kite fluttered about his dovecoat and of what nature were the flutterings He went even further than this and fee d the Captain himself binding him down not to flutter as value given in return for such fees He attempted even to fee the widow cautioning her against the fluttering as he tendered to her on his knees a brooch as big as a breast plate She waved aside the breast plate declaring that the mourning ring which contained poor Greenow s final grey lock of hair was the last article from a jeweller s shop which should ever find a place about her person At the same time she declared that Captain Bellfield was nothing to her mister Cheesacre need have no fears in that quarter But then she added neither was he to have any hope Her affections were all buried under the cold sod This was harassing Nevertheless though no absolute satisfaction was to be attained in the wooing of missus Greenow there was a pleasantness in the occupation which ought to have reconciled her suitors to their destiny With most ladies when a gentleman has been on his knees before one of them in the morning with outspoken protestations of love with clearly defined proffers of marriage with a minute inventory of the offerer s worldly wealth down even to the mahogany furnitured bed chambers as was the case with mister Cheesacre and when all these overtures have been peremptorily declined a gentleman in such a case I say would generally feel some awkwardness in sitting down to tea with the lady at the close of such a performance But with missus Greenow there was no such awkwardness After an hour s work of the nature above described she would play the hostess with a genial hospitality that eased off all the annoyance of disappointment and then at the end of the evening she would accept a squeeze of the hand a good palpable long protracted squeeze with that sort of don t have done now by which Irish young ladies allure their lovers mister Cheesacre on such occasions would leave the Close swearing that she should be his on the next market day or at any rate on the next Saturday Then on the Monday tidings would reach him that Bellfield had passed all Sunday afternoon with his lady love Bellfield to whom he had lent five pounds on purpose that he might be enabled to spend that very Sunday with some officers of the Suffolk volunteers at Ipswich And hearing this he would walk out among those rich heaps at the back of his farmyard uttering deep curses against the falsehood of men and the fickleness of women Driven to despair he at last resolved to ask Bellfield to come to Oileymead for a month That drilling at Norwich or the part of it which was supposed to be profitable was wearing itself out Funds were low with the Captain as he did not scruple to tell his friend Cheesacre and he accepted the invitation I ll mount you with the harriers old fellow Cheesacre had said and give you a little shooting Only I won t have you go out when I m not with you Bellfield agreed Each of them understood the nature of the bargain though Bellfield I think had somewhat the clearer understanding in the matter He would not be so near the widow as he had been at Norwich but he would not be less near than his kind host And his host would no doubt watch him closely but then he also could watch his host There was a railway station not two miles from Oileymead and the journey thence into Norwich was one of half an hour mister Cheesacre would doubtless be very jealous of such journeys but with all his jealousy he could not prevent them And then in regard to this arrangement mister Cheesacre paid the piper whereas Captain Bellfield paid nothing Would it not be sweet to him if he could carry off his friend s prize from under the very eaves of his friend s house And missus Greenow also understood the arrangement Going to Oileymead are you she said when Captain Bellfield came to tell her of his departure Charlie Fairstairs was with her so that the Captain could not utilize the moment in any special way It s quite delightful continued the widow to see how fond you two gentlemen are of each other I think gentlemen always like to go best to gentlemen s houses where there are no ladies said Charlie Fairstairs whose career in life had not as yet been satisfactory to her As for that said Bellfield I wish with all my heart that dear old Cheesy would get a wife He wants a wife badly if ever a man did with all that house full of blankets and crockery Why don t you set your cap at him Miss Fairstairs What at a farmer said Charlie who was particularly anxious that her dear friend missus Greenow should not marry mister Cheesacre and who weakly thought to belittle him accordingly Give him my kind love said missus Greenow thereby resenting the impotent interference And look here Captain Bellfield suppose you both dine with me next Saturday He always comes in on Saturday and you might as well come too Captain Bellfield declared that he would only be too happy And Charlie shall come to set her cap at mister Cheesacre said the widow turning a soft and gracious eye on the Captain I shall be happy to come said Charlie quite delighted but not with that object mister Cheesacre is very respectable I m sure Charlie s mother had been the daughter of a small squire who had let his land to tenants and she was therefore justified by circumstances in looking down upon a farmer The matter was so settled pending the consent of mister Cheesacre and Bellfield went out to Oileymead He knew the ways of the house and was not surprised to find himself left alone till after dusk nor was he much surprised when he learned that he was not put into one of the mahogany furnitured chambers but into a back room looking over the farm yard in which there was no fire place The Captain had already endured some of the evils of poverty and could have put up with this easily had nothing been said about it As it was Cheesacre brought the matter forward and apologized and made the thing difficult You see old fellow he said there are the rooms and of course they re empty But it s such a bore hauling out all the things and putting up the curtains You ll be very snug where you are I shall do very well said Bellfield rather sulkily Of course you ll do very well It s the warmest room in the house in one way He did not say in what way Perhaps the near neighbourhood of the stables may have had a warming effect Bellfield did not like it but what is a poor man to do under such circumstances So he went up stairs and washed his hands before dinner in the room without a fire place flattering himself that he would yet be even with his friend Cheesacre They dined together not in the best humour and after dinner they sat down to enjoy themselves with pipes and brandy and water Bellfield having a taste for everything that was expensive would have preferred cigars but his friend put none upon the table mister Cheesacre though he could spend his money liberally when occasion required such spending knew well the value of domestic economy He wasn t going to put himself out as he called it for Bellfield What was good enough for himself was good enough for Bellfield A beggar you know just a regular beggar as he was betrayed into saying to missus Greenow on some occasion just at this period Poor fellow He only wants money to make him almost perfect missus Greenow had answered and mister Cheesacre had felt that he had made a mistake Both the men became talkative if not good humoured under the effects of the brandy and water and the Captain then communicated missus Greenow s invitation to mister Cheesacre He had had his doubts as to the propriety of doing so thinking that perhaps it might be to his advantage to forget the message But he reflected that he was at any rate a match for Cheesacre when they were present together and finally came to the conclusion that the message should be delivered I had to go and just wish her goodbye you know he said apologetically as he finished his little speech I don t see that at all said Cheesacre Why my dear fellow how foolishly jealous you are If I were to be downright uncivil to her as you would have me be it would only call attention to the thing I m not a bit jealous A man who sits upon his own ground as I do hasn t any occasion to be jealous I don t know what your own ground has to do with it but we ll let that pass I think it has a great deal to do with it If a man does intend to marry he ought to have things comfortable about him unless he wants to live on his wife which I look upon as about the meanest thing a man can do By George I d sooner break stones than that This was hard for any captain to bear even for Captain Bellfield but he did bear it looking forward to revenge There s no pleasing you I know said he But there s the fact I went to say goodbye to her and she asked me to give you that message Shall we go or not Cheesacre sat for some time silent blowing out huge clouds of smoke while he meditated a little plan I ll tell you what it is Bellfield he said at last She s nothing to you and if you won t mind it I ll go missus Jones shall get you anything you like for dinner and and I ll stand you a bottle of the thirty four port But Captain Bellfield was not going to put up with this He had not sold himself altogether to work mister Cheesacre s will No old fellow said he that cock won t fight She has asked me to dine with her on Saturday and I mean to go I don t intend that she shall think that I m afraid of her or of you either You don t don t you No I don t said the Captain stoutly I wish you d pay me some of that money you owe me said Cheesacre So I will when I ve married the widow Ha ha ha Cheesacre longed to turn him out of the house Words to bid him go were so to say upon his tongue But the man would only have taken himself to Norwich and would have gone without any embargo upon his suit all their treaties would then be at an end She knows a trick worth two of that said Cheesacre at last I dare say she does and if so why shouldn t I go and dine with her next Saturday I ll tell you why because you re in my way The deuce is in it if I haven t made the whole thing clear enough I ve told you all my plans because I thought you were my friend and I ve paid you well to help me too and yet it seems to me you d do anything in your power to throw me over only you can t What an ass you are said the Captain after a pause just you listen to me That scraggy young woman Charlie Fairstairs is to be there of course How do you know I tell you that I do know She was present when the whole thing was arranged and I heard her asked and heard her say that she would come and for the matter of that I heard her declare that she wouldn t set her cap at you because you re a farmer Upon my word she s kind Upon my word she is said Cheesacre getting very angry and very red Charlie Fairstairs indeed I wouldn t pick her out of a gutter with a pair of tongs She ain t good enough for my bailiff let alone me But somebody must take her in hand on Saturday if you re to do any good said the crafty Bellfield What the deuce does she have that nasty creature there for said Cheesacre who thought it very hard that everything should not be arranged exactly as he would desire She wants a companion of course You can get rid of Charlie you know when you make her missus Cheesacre Get rid of her You don t suppose she ll ever put her foot in this house Not if I know it I ve detested that woman for the last ten years Cheesacre could forgive no word of slight respecting his social position and the idea of Miss Fairstairs having pretended to look down upon him galled him to the quick You ll have to dine with her at any rate said Bellfield and I always think that four are better company than three on such occasions mister Cheesacre grunted an unwilling assent and after this it was looked upon as an arranged thing that they two should go into Norwich on the Saturday together and that they should both dine with the widow Indeed missus Greenow got two notes one from each of them accepting the invitation Cheesacre wrote in the singular number altogether ignoring Captain Bellfield as he might have ignored his footman had he intended to take one The captain condescended to use the plural pronoun We shall be so happy to come said he Dear old Cheesy is out of his little wits with delight he added and has already begun to polish off the effects of the farmyard Effects of the farmyard said missus Greenow aloud in Jeannette s hearing when she received the note It would be well for Captain Bellfield if he had a few such effects himself You can give him enough ma am said Jeannette to make him a better man than mister Cheesacre any day And for a gentleman of course I say nothing but if I was a lady I know which should be the man for me CHAPTER XL missus Greenow s Little Dinner in the Close How deep and cunning are the wiles of love When that Saturday morning arrived not a word was said by Cheesacre to his rival as to his plans for the day You ll take the dog cart in Captain Bellfield had asked overnight I don t know what I shall do as yet replied he who was master of the house of the dog cart and as he fondly thought of the situation But Bellfield knew that Cheesacre must take the dog cart and was contented His friend would leave him behind if it were possible but Bellfield would take care that it should not be possible Before breakfast mister Cheesacre surreptitiously carried out into the yard a bag containing all his apparatus for dressing his marrow oil for his hair his shirt with the wondrous worked front upon an under stratum of pink to give it colour his shiny boots and all the rest of the paraphernalia When dining in Norwich on ordinary occasions he simply washed his hands there trusting to the chambermaid at the inn to find him a comb and now he came down with his bag surreptitiously and hid it away in the back of the dog cart with secret but alas not unobserved hands hoping that Bellfield would forget his toilet But when did such a Captain ever forget his outward man Cheesacre as he returned through the kitchen from the yard into the front hall perceived another bag lying near the door apparently filled almost as well as his own What the deuce are you going to do with all this luggage said he giving the bag a kick Put it where I saw you putting yours when I opened my window just now said Bellfield D the window exclaimed Cheesacre and then they sat down to breakfast How you do hack that ham about he said If you ever found hams yourself you d be more particular in cutting them This was very bad Even Bellfield could not bear it with equanimity and feeling unable to eat the ham under such circumstances made his breakfast with a couple of fresh eggs If you didn t mean to eat the meat why the mischief did you cut it said Cheesacre Upon my word Cheesacre you re too bad upon my word you are said Bellfield almost sobbing What s the matter now said the other Who wants your ham You do I suppose or you wouldn t cut it No I don t nor anything else either that you ve got It isn t fair to ask a fellow into your house and then say such things to him as that And it isn t what I ve been accustomed to either I can tell you that mister Cheesacre Oh bother It s all very well to say bother but I choose to be treated like a gentleman wherever I go You and I have known each other a long time and I d put up with more from you than from anyone else but Can you pay me the money that you owe me Bellfield said Cheesacre looking hard at him No I can t said Bellfield not immediately Then eat your breakfast and hold your tongue After that Captain Bellfield did eat his breakfast leaving the ham however untouched and did hold his tongue vowing vengeance in his heart But the two men went into Norwich more amicably together than they would have done had there been no words between them Cheesacre felt that he had trespassed a little and therefore offered the Captain a cigar as he seated himself in the cart Bellfield accepted the offering and smoked the weed of peace Now said Cheesacre as he drove into the Swan yard what do you mean to do with yourself all day I shall go down to the quarters and look the fellows up All right But mind this Bellfield it s an understood thing that you re not to be in the Close before four I won t be in the Close before four Very well That s understood If you deceive me I ll not drive you back to Oileymead to night In this instance Captain Bellfield had no intention to deceive He did not think it probable that he could do himself any good by philandering about the widow early in the day She would be engaged with her dinner and with an early toilet Captain Bellfield moreover had learned from experience that the first comer has not always an advantage in ladies society The mind of a woman is greedy after novelty and it is upon the stranger or upon the most strange of her slaves around her that she often smiles the sweetest The cathedral clock therefore had struck four before Captain Bellfield rang missus Greenow s bell and then when he was shown into the drawing room he found Cheesacre there alone redolent with the marrow oil and beautiful with the pink bosom Haven t you seen her yet asked the Captain almost in a whisper No said Cheesacre sulkily Nor yet Charlie Fairstairs I ve seen nobody said Cheesacre But at this moment he was compelled to swallow his anger as missus Greenow accompanied by her lady guest came into the room Whoever would have expected two gentlemen to be so punctual said she especially on market day Market day makes no difference when I come to see you said Cheesacre putting his best foot forward while Captain Bellfield contented himself with saying something civil to Charlie He would bide his time and ride a waiting race The widow was almost gorgeous in her weeds I believe that she had not sinned in her dress against any of those canons which the semi ecclesiastical authorities on widowhood have laid down as to the outward garments fitted for gentlemen s relicts The materials were those which are devoted to the deepest conjugal grief As regarded every item of the written law her suttee worship was carried out to the letter There was the widow s cap generally so hideous so well known to the eyes of all men so odious to womanhood Let us hope that such headgear may have some assuaging effect on the departed spirits of husbands There was the dress of deep clinging melancholy crape of crape which becomes so brown and so rusty and which makes the six months widow seem so much more afflicted a creature than she whose husband is just gone and whose crape is therefore new There were the trailing weepers and the widow s kerchief pinned close round her neck and somewhat tightly over her bosom But there was that of genius about missus Greenow that she had turned every seeming disadvantage to some special profit and had so dressed herself that though she had obeyed the law to the letter she had thrown the spirit of it to the winds Her cap sat jauntily on her head and showed just so much of her rich brown hair as to give her the appearance of youth which she desired Cheesacre had blamed her in his heart for her private carriage but she spent more money I think on new crape than she did on her brougham It never became brown and rusty with her or formed itself into old lumpy folds or shaped itself round her like a grave cloth The written law had not interdicted crinoline and she loomed as large with weeds which with her were not sombre as she would do with her silks when the period of her probation should be over Her weepers were bright with newness and she would waft them aside from her shoulder with an air which turned even them into auxiliaries Her kerchief was fastened close round her neck and close over her bosom but Jeannette well knew what she was doing as she fastened it and so did Jeannette s mistress missus Greenow would still talk much about her husband declaring that her loss was as fresh to her wounded heart as though he on whom all her happiness had rested had left her only yesterday but yet she mistook her dates frequently referring to the melancholy circumstance as having taken place fifteen months ago In truth however mister Greenow had been alive within the last nine months as everybody around her knew But if she chose to forget the exact day why should her friends or dependents remind her of it No friend or dependent did remind her of it and Charlie Fairstairs spoke of the fifteen months with bold confidence false tongued little parasite that she was Looking well said the widow in answer to some outspoken compliment from mister Cheesacre Yes I m well enough in health and I suppose I ought to be thankful that it is so But if you had buried a wife whom you had loved within the last eighteen months you would have become as indifferent as I am to all that kind of thing I never was married yet said mister Cheesacre And therefore you know nothing about it Everything in the world is gay and fresh to you If I were you mister Cheesacre I would not run the risk It is hardly worth a woman s while and I suppose not a man s The sufferings are too great Whereupon she pressed her handkerchief to her eyes But I mean to try all the same said Cheesacre looking the lover all over as he gazed into the fair one s face I hope that you may be successful mister Cheesacre and that she may not be torn away from you early in life Is dinner ready Jeannette That s well mister Cheesacre will you give your arm to Miss Fairstairs There was no doubt as to missus Greenow s correctness As Captain Bellfield held or had held her Majesty s commission he was clearly entitled to take the mistress of the festival down to dinner But Cheesacre would not look at it in this light He would only remember that he had paid for the Captain s food for some time past that the Captain had been brought into Norwich in his gig that the Captain owed him money and ought so to say to be regarded as his property on the occasion I pay my way and that ought to give a man higher station than being a beggarly captain which I don t believe he is if all the truth was known It was thus that he took an occasion to express himself to Miss Fairstairs on that very evening Military rank is always recognised Miss Fairstairs had replied taking mister Cheesacre s remarks as a direct slight upon herself He had taken her down to dinner and had then come to her complaining that he had been injured in being called upon to do so If you were a magistrate mister Cheesacre you would have rank but I believe you are not Charlie Fairstairs knew well what she was about mister Cheesacre had striven much to get his name put upon the commission of the peace but had failed Nasty scraggy old cat Cheesacre said to himself as he turned away from her But Bellfield gained little by taking the widow down He and Cheesacre were placed at the top and bottom of the table so that they might do the work of carving and the ladies sat at the sides missus Greenow s hospitality was very good The dinner was exactly what a dinner ought to be for four persons There was soup fish a cutlet a roast fowl and some game Jeannette waited at table nimbly and the thing could not have been done better missus Greenow s appetite was not injured by her grief and she so far repressed for the time all remembrance of her sorrow as to enable her to play the kind hostess to perfection Under her immediate eye Cheesacre was forced into apparent cordiality with his friend Bellfield and the Captain himself took the good things which the gods provided with thankful good humour Nothing however was done at the dinner table No work got itself accomplished The widow was so accurately fair in the adjustment of her favours that even Jeannette could not perceive to which of the two she turned with the amplest smile She talked herself and made others talk till Cheesacre became almost comfortable in spite of his jealousy And now she said as she got up to leave the room when she had taken her own glass of wine We will allow these two gentlemen just half an hour eh Charlie and then we shall expect them up stairs Ten minutes will be enough for us here said Cheesacre who was in a hurry to utilize his time Half an hour said missus Greenow not without some little tone of command in her voice Ten minutes might be enough for mister Cheesacre but ten minutes was not enough for her Bellfield had opened the door and it was upon him that the widow s eye glanced as she left the room Cheesacre saw it and resolved to resent the injury I ll tell you what it is Bellfield he said as he sat down moodily over the fire I won t have you coming here at all till this matter is settled Till what matter is settled said Bellfield filling his glass You know what matter I mean You take such a deuce of a time about it No I don t I take as little time as anybody could That other fellow has only been dead about nine months and I ve got the thing in excellent training already And what harm do I do You disturb me and you disturb her You do it on purpose Do you suppose I can t see I ll tell you what now if you ll go clean out of Norwich for a month I ll lend you two hundred pounds on the day she becomes missus Cheesacre And where am I to go to You may stay at Oileymead if you like that is on condition that you do stay there And be told that I hack the ham because it s not my own Shall I tell you a piece of my mind Cheesacre What do you mean That woman has no more idea of marrying you than she has of marrying the Bishop Won t you fill your glass old fellow I know where the tap is if you want another bottle You may as well give it up and spend no more money in pink fronts and polished boots on her account You re a podgy man you see and missus Greenow doesn t like podgy men Cheesacre sat looking at him with his mouth open dumb with surprise and almost paralysed with impotent anger What had happened during the last few hours to change so entirely the tone of his dependent captain Could it be that Bellfield had been there during the morning and that she had accepted him You are very podgy Cheesacre Bellfield continued and then you so often smell of the farm yard and you talk too much of your money and your property You d have had a better chance if you had openly talked to her of hers as I have done As it is you haven t any chance at all Bellfield as he thus spoke to the man opposite to him went on drinking his wine comfortably and seemed to be chuckling with glee Cheesacre was so astounded so lost in amazement that the creature whom he had fed whom he had bribed with money out of his own pocket should thus turn against him that for a while he could not collect his thoughts or find voice wherewith to make any answer It occurred to him immediately that Bellfield was even now at this very time staying at his house that he Cheesacre was expected to drive him Bellfield back to Oileymead to his own Oileymead on this very evening and as he thought of this he almost fancied that he must be in a dream He shook himself and looked again and there sat Bellfield eyeing him through the bright colour of a glass of port Now I ve told you a bit of my mind Cheesy my boy continued Bellfield and you ll save yourself a deal of trouble and annoyance if you ll believe what I say She doesn t mean to marry you It s most probable that she ll marry me but at any rate she won t marry you Do you mean to pay me my money sir said Cheesacre at last finding his readiest means of attack in that quarter Yes I do But when When I ve married missus Greenow and therefore I expect your assistance in that little scheme Let us drink her health We shall always be delighted to see you at our house Cheesy my boy and you shall be allowed to hack the hams just as much as you please You shall be made to pay for this said Cheesacre gasping with anger gasping almost more with dismay than he did with anger All right old fellow I ll pay for it with the widow s money Come our half hour is nearly over shall we go up stairs I ll expose you Don t now don t be ill natured Will you tell me where you mean to sleep to night Captain Bellfield If I sleep at Oileymead it will only be on condition that I have one of the mahogany furnitured bedrooms You ll never put your foot in that house again You re a rascal sir Come come Cheesy it won t do for us to quarrel in a lady s house It wouldn t be the thing at all You re not drinking your wine You might as well take another glass and then we ll go up stairs You ve left your traps at Oileymead and not one of them you shall have till you ve paid me every shilling you owe me I don t believe you ve a shirt in the world beyond what you ve got there It s lucky I brought one in to change wasn t it Cheesy I shouldn t have thought of it only for the hint you gave me I might as well ring the bell for Jeannette to put away the wine if you won t take any more Then he rang the bell and when Jeannette came he skipped lightly up stairs into the drawing room Was he here before to day said Cheesacre nodding his head at the doorway through which Bellfield had passed Who The Captain Oh dear no The Captain don t come here much now not to say often by no means He s a confounded rascal Oh mister Cheesacre said Jeannette He is and I ain t sure that there ain t others nearly as bad as he is If you mean me mister Cheesacre I do declare you re a wronging me I do indeed What s the meaning of his going on in this way I don t know nothing of his ways mister Cheesacre but I ve been as true to you sir so I have as true as true And Jeannette put her handkerchief up to her eyes He moved to the door and then a thought occurred to him He put his hand to his trousers pocket and turning back towards the girl gave her half a crown She curtsied as she took it and then repeated her last words Yes mister Cheesacre as true as true mister Cheesacre said nothing further but followed his enemy up to the drawing room What game is up now I wonder said Jeannette to herself when she was left alone They two ll be cutting each other s throatses before they ve done and then my missus will take the surwiver But she made up her mind that Cheesacre should be the one to have his throat cut fatally and that Bellfield should be the survivor Cheesacre when he reached the drawing room found Bellfield sitting on the same sofa with missus Greenow looking at a book of photographs which they both of them were handling together The outside rim of her widow s frill on one occasion touched the Captain s whisker and as it did so the Captain looked up with a gratified expression of triumph If any gentleman has ever seen the same thing under similar circumstances he will understand that Cheesacre must have been annoyed Yes said missus Greenow waving her handkerchief of which little but a two inch deep border seemed to be visible Bellfield knew at once that it was not the same handkerchief which she had waved before they went down to dinner Yes there he is It s so like him And then she apostrophized the carte de visite of the departed one Dear Greenow dear husband When my spirit is false to thee let thine forget to visit me softly in my dreams Thou wast unmatched among husbands Whose tender kindness was ever equal to thine whose sweet temper was ever so constant whose manly care so all sufficient While the words fell from her lips her little finger was touching Bellfield s little finger as they held the book between them Charlie Fairstairs and mister Cheesacre were watching her narrowly and she knew that they were watching her She was certainly a woman of great genius and of great courage Illustration Dear Greenow dear husband Bellfield moved by the eloquence of her words looked with some interest at the photograph There was represented there before him a small grey looking insignificant old man with pig s eyes and a toothless mouth one who should never have been compelled to submit himself to the cruelty of the sun s portraiture Another widow even if she had kept in her book the photograph of such a husband would have scrambled it over silently would have been ashamed to show it Have you ever seen it mister Cheesacre asked missus Greenow It s so like him I saw it at Yarmouth said Cheesacre very sulkily That you did not said the lady with some dignity and not a little of rebuke in her tone simply because it never was at Yarmouth A larger one you may have seen which I always keep and always shall keep close by my bedside Not if I know it said Captain Bellfield to himself Then the widow punished mister Cheesacre for his sullenness by whispering a few words to the Captain and Cheesacre in his wrath turned to Charlie Fairstairs Then it was that he spake out his mind about the Captain s rank and was snubbed by Charlie as was told a page or two back After that coffee was brought to them and here again Cheesacre in his ill humour allowed the Captain to out manoeuvre him It was the Captain who put the sugar into the cups and handed them round He even handed a cup to his enemy None for me Captain Bellfield many thanks for your politeness all the same said mister Cheesacre and missus Greenow knew from the tone of his voice that there had been a quarrel Cheesacre sitting then in his gloom had resolved upon one thing or I may perhaps say upon two things He had resolved that he would not leave the room that evening till Bellfield had left it and that he would get a final answer from the widow if not that night for he thought it very possible that they might both be sent away together then early after breakfast on the following morning For the present he had given up any idea of turning his time to good account He was not perhaps a coward but he had not that special courage which enables a man to fight well under adverse circumstances He had been cowed by the unexpected impertinence of his rival by the insolence of a man to whom he thought that he had obtained the power of being always himself as insolent as he pleased He could not recover his ground quickly or carry himself before his lady s eye as though he was unconscious of the wound he had received So he sat silent while Bellfield was discoursing fluently He sat in silence comforting himself with reflections on his own wealth and on the poverty of the other and promising himself a rich harvest of revenge when the moment should come in which he might tell missus Greenow how absolutely that man was a beggar a swindler and a rascal And he was astonished when an opportunity for doing so came very quickly Before the neighbouring clock had done striking seven Bellfield rose from his chair to go He first of all spoke a word of farewell to Miss Fairstairs then he turned to his late host Good night Cheesacre he said in the easiest tone in the world after that he pressed the widow s hand and whispered his adieu I thought you were staying at Oileymead said missus Greenow I came from there this morning said the Captain But he isn t going back there I can tell you said mister Cheesacre Oh indeed said missus Greenow I hope there is nothing wrong All as right as a trivet said the Captain and then he was off I promised mamma that I would be home by seven said Charlie Fairstairs rising from her chair It cannot be supposed that she had any wish to oblige mister Cheesacre and therefore this movement on her part must be regarded simply as done in kindness to missus Greenow She might be mistaken in supposing that missus Greenow would desire to be left alone with mister Cheesacre but it was clear to her that in this way she could give no offence whereas it was quite possible that she might offend by remaining A little after seven mister Cheesacre found himself alone with the lady I m sorry to find said she gravely that you two have quarrelled missus Greenow said he jumping up and becoming on a sudden full of life that man is a downright swindler Oh mister Cheesacre He is He ll tell you that he was at Inkerman but I believe he was in prison all the time The Captain had been arrested I think twice and thus mister Cheesacre justified to himself this assertion I doubt whether he ever saw a shot fired he continued He s none the worse for that But he tells such lies and then he has not a penny in the world How much do you suppose he owes me now However much it is I m sure you are too much of a gentleman to say Well yes I am said he trying to recover himself But when I asked him how he intended to pay me what do you think he said He said he d pay me when he got your money My money He couldn t have said that But he did missus Greenow I give you my word and honour I ll pay you when I get the widow s money he said You gentlemen must have a nice way of talking about me when I am absent I never said a disrespectful word about you in my life missus Greenow or thought one He does he says horrible things What horrible things mister Cheesacre Oh I can t tell you but he does What can you expect from such a man as that who to my knowledge won t have a change of clothes to morrow except what he brought in on his back this morning Where he s to get a bed to night I don t know for I doubt whether he s got half a crown in the world Poor Bellfield Yes he is poor But how gracefully he carries his poverty I should call it very disgraceful missus Greenow To this she made no reply and then he thought that he might begin his work missus Greenow may I say Arabella mister Cheesacre But mayn t I Come missus Greenow You know well enough by this time what it is I mean What s the use of shilly shallying Shilly shallying mister Cheesacre I never heard such language If I bid you good night now and tell you that it is time for you to go home shall you call that shilly shallying He had made a mistake in his word and repented it I beg your pardon missus Greenow I do indeed I didn t mean anything offensive Shilly shallying indeed There s very little shall in it I can assure you The poor man was dreadfully crestfallen so much so that the widow s heart relented and she pardoned him It was not in her nature to quarrel with people at any rate not with her lovers I beg your pardon missus Greenow said the culprit humbly It is granted said the widow but never tell a lady again that she is shilly shallying And look here mister Cheesacre if it should ever come to pass that you are making love to a lady in earnest I couldn t be more in earnest said he That you are making love to a lady in earnest talk to her a little more about your passion and a little less about your purse Now good night But we are friends Oh yes as good friends as ever Cheesacre as he drove himself home in the dark tried to console himself by thinking of the miserable plight in which Bellfield would find himself at Norwich with no possessions but what he had brought into the town that day in a small bag But as he turned in at his own gate he met two figures emerging one of them was laden with a portmanteau and the other with a hat case It s only me Cheesy my boy said Bellfield I ve just come down by the rail to fetch my things and I m going back to Norwich by the nine point twenty If you ve stolen anything of mine I ll have you prosecuted roared Cheesacre as he drove his gig up to his own door VOLUME II CHAPTER XLI A Noble Lord Dies George Vavasor remained about four days beneath his grandfather s roof but he was not happy there himself nor did he contribute to the happiness of any one else He remained there in great discomfort so long being unwilling to leave till an answer had been received to the request made to Aunt Greenow in order that he might insist on Kate s performance of her promise with reference to Alice if that answer should be unfavourable During these five days Kate did all in her power to induce her brother to be at any rate kind in his manner towards his grandfather but it was in vain The Squire would not be the first to be gracious and George quite as obstinate as the old man would take no steps in that direction till encouraged to do so by graciousness from the other side Poor Kate entreated each of them to begin but her entreaties were of no avail He is an ill mannered cub the old man said and I was a fool to let him into the house Don t mention his name to me again George argued the matter more at length Kate spoke to him of his own interest in the matter urging upon him that he might by such conduct drive the Squire to exclude him altogether from the property He must do as he likes George said sulkily But for Alice s sake Kate answered Alice would be the last to expect me to submit to unreasonable ill usage for the sake of money As regards myself I confess that I m very fond of money and am not particularly squeamish I would do anything that a man can do to secure it But this I can t do I never injured him and I never asked him to injure himself I never attempted to borrow money from him I have never cost him a shilling When I was in the wine business he might have enabled me to make a large fortune simply by settling on me then the reversion of property which when he dies ought to be my own He was so perversely ignorant that he would make no inquiry but chose to think that I was ruining myself at the only time of my life when I was really doing well But he had a right to act as he pleased urged Kate Certainly he had But he had no right to resent my asking such a favour at his hands He was an ignorant old fool not to do it but I should never have quarrelled with him on that account Nature made him a fool and it wasn t his fault But I can t bring myself to kneel in the dirt before him simply because I asked for what was reasonable The two men said very little to each other They were never alone together except during that half hour after dinner in which they were supposed to drink their wine The old Squire always took three glasses of port during this period and expected that his grandson would take three with him But George would drink none at all I have given up drinking wine after dinner said he when his grandfather pushed the bottle over to him I suppose you mean that you drink nothing but claret said the Squire in a tone of voice that was certainly not conciliatory I mean simply what I say said George that I have given up drinking wine after dinner The old man could not openly quarrel with his heir on such a point as that Even mister Vavasor could not tell his grandson that he was going to the dogs because he had become temperate But nevertheless there was offence in it and when George sat perfectly silent looking at the fire evidently determined to make no attempt at conversation the offence grew and became strong What the devil s the use of your sitting there if you neither drink nor talk said the old man No use in the world that I can see said George if however I were to leave you you would abuse me for it I don t care how soon you leave me said the Squire From all which it may be seen that George Vavasor s visit to the hall of his ancestors was not satisfactory On the fourth day about noon came Aunt Greenow s reply Dearest Kate she said I am not going to do what you ask me thus rushing instantly into the middle of her subject You see I don t know my nephew and have no reason for being specially anxious that he should be in Parliament I don t care two straws about the glory of the Vavasor family If I had never done anything for myself the Vavasors would have done very little for me I don t care much about what you call blood I like those who like me and whom I know I am very fond of you and because you have been good to me I would give you a thousand pounds if you wanted it for yourself but I don t see why I am to give my money to those I don t know If it is necessary to tell my nephew of this pray tell him that I mean no offence Your friend C is still waiting waiting waiting patiently but his patience may be exhausted Your affectionate aunt ARABELLA GREENOW Of course she won t said George as he threw back the letter to his sister Why should she I had hoped she would said Kate Why should she What did I ever do for her She is a sensible woman Who is your friend C and why is he waiting patiently He is a man who would be glad to marry her for her money if she would take him Then what does she mean by his patience being exhausted It is her folly She chooses to pretend to think that the man is a lover of mine Has he got any money Yes lots of money or money s worth And what is his name His name is Cheesacre But pray don t trouble yourself to talk about him If he wants to marry you and has plenty of money why shouldn t you take him Good heavens George In the first place he does not want to marry me In the next place all his heart is in his farmyard And a very good place to have it said George Undoubtedly But really you must not trouble yourself to talk about him Only this that I should be very glad to see you well married Should you said she thinking of her close attachment to himself And now about the money said George You must write to Alice at once Oh George Of course you must you have promised Indeed it would have been much wiser if you had taken me at my word and done it at once I cannot do it Then the scar on his face opened itself and his sister stood before him in fear and trembling Do you mean to tell me said he that you will go back from your word and deceive me that after having kept me here by this promise you will not do what you have said you would do Take my money now and pay me out of hers as soon as you are married I will be the first to claim it from her and from you That is nonsense Why should it be nonsense Surely you need have no scruple with me I should have none with you if I wanted assistance Look here Kate I won t have it and there s an end of it All that you have in the world would not pull me through this election and therefore such a loan would be worse than useless And am I to ask her for more than two thousand pounds You are to ask her simply for one thousand That is what I want and must have at present And she knows that I want it and that she is to supply it only she does not know that my need is so immediate That you must explain to her I would sooner burn my hand George But burning your hand unfortunately won t do any good Look here Kate I insist upon your doing this for me If you do not I shall do it of course myself but I shall regard your refusal as an unjustifiable falsehood on your part and shall certainly not see you afterwards I do not wish for reasons which you may well understand to write to Alice myself on any subject at present I now claim your promise to do so and if you refuse I shall know very well what to do Of course she did not persist in her refusal With a sorrowful heart and with fingers that could hardly form the needful letters she did write a letter to her cousin which explained the fact that George Vavasor immediately wanted a thousand pounds for his electioneering purposes It was a stiff uncomfortable letter unnatural in its phraseology telling its own tale of grief and shame Alice understood very plainly all the circumstances under which it was written but she sent back word to Kate at once undertaking that the money should be forthcoming and she wrote again before the end of January saying that the sum named had been paid to George s credit at his own bankers Kate had taken immense pride in the renewal of the match between her brother and her cousin and had rejoiced in it greatly as being her own work But all that pride and joy were now over She could no longer write triumphant notes to Alice speaking always of George as one who was to be their joint hero foretelling great things of his career in Parliament and saying little soft things of his enduring love It was no longer possible to her now to write of George at all and it was equally impossible to Alice Indeed no letters passed between them when that monetary correspondence was over up to the end of the winter Kate remained down in Westmoreland wretched and ill at ease listening to hard words spoken by her grandfather against her brother and feeling herself unable to take her brother s part as she had been wont to do in other times George returned to town at the end of those four days and found that the thousand pounds was duly placed to his credit before the end of the month It is hardly necessary to tell the reader that this money had come from the stores of mister Tombe and that mister Tombe duly debited mister Grey with the amount Alice in accordance with her promise had told her father that the money was needed and her father in accordance with his promise had procured it without a word of remonstrance Surely I must sign some paper Alice had said But she had been contented when her father told her that the lawyers would manage all that It was nearly the end of February when George Vavasor made his first payment to mister Scruby on behalf of the coming election and when he called at mister Scruby s office with this object he received some intelligence which surprised him not a little You haven t heard the news said Scruby What news said George The Marquis is as nearly off the hooks as a man can be mister Scruby as he communicated the tidings showed clearly by his face and voice that they were supposed to be of very great importance but Vavasor did not at first seem to be as much interested in the fate of the Marquis as Scruby had intended I m very sorry for him said George Who is the Marquis There ll be sure to come another so it don t much signify There will come another and that s just it It s the Marquis of Bunratty and if he drops our young Member will go into the Upper House What immediately before the end of the Session George of course knew well enough that such would be the case but the effect which this event would have upon himself now struck him suddenly To be sure said Scruby The writ would be out immediately I should be glad enough of it only that I know that Travers s people have heard of it before us and that they are ready to be up with their posters directly the breath is out of the Marquis s body We must go to work immediately that s all It will only be for part of a Session said George Just so said mister Scruby And then there ll be the cost of another election That s true said mister Scruby but in such cases we do manage to make it come a little cheaper If you lick Travers now it may be that you ll have a walk over for the next Have you seen Grimes asked George Yes I have the blackguard He is going to open his house on Travers s side He came to me as bold as brass and told me so saying that he never liked gentlemen who kept him waiting for his odd money What angers me is that he ever got it We have not managed it very well certainly said Vavasor looking nastily at the attorney We can t help those little accidents mister Vavasor There are worse accidents than that turn up almost daily in my business You may think yourself almost lucky that I haven t gone over to Travers myself He is a Liberal you know and it hasn t been for want of an offer I can tell you Vavasor was inclined to doubt the extent of his luck in this respect and was almost disposed to repent of his Parliamentary ambition He would now be called upon to spend certainly not less than three thousand pounds of his cousin s money on the chance of being able to sit in Parliament for a few months And then after what a fashion would he be compelled to negotiate that loan He might to be sure allow the remainder of this Session to run and stand as he had intended at the general election but he knew that if he now allowed a Liberal to win the seat the holder of the seat would be almost sure of subsequent success He must either fight now or give up the fight altogether and he was a man who did not love to abandon any contest in which he had been engaged Well Squire said Scruby how is it to be And Vavasor felt that he detected in the man s voice some diminution of that respect with which he had hitherto been treated as a paying candidate for a metropolitan borough This lord is not dead yet said Vavasor No he s not dead yet that we have heard but it won t do for us to wait We want every minute of time that we can get There isn t any hope for him I m told It s gout in the stomach or dropsy at the heart or some of those things that make a fellow safe to go It won t do to wait for the next election If you ask me I should say certainly not Indeed I shouldn t wish to have to conduct it under such circumstances I hate a fight when there s no chance of success I grudge spending a man s money in such a case I do indeed mister Vavasor I suppose Grimes s going over won t make much difference The blackguard He ll take a hundred and fifty votes I suppose perhaps more But that is not much in such a constituency as the Chelsea districts You see Travers played mean at the last election and that will be against him But the Conservatives will have a candidate There s no knowing but I don t think they will They ll try one at the general no doubt but if the two sitting Members can pull together they won t have much of a chance Vavasor found himself compelled to say that he would stand and Scruby undertook to give the initiatory orders at once not waiting even till the Marquis should be dead We should have our houses open as soon as theirs said he There s a deal in that So George Vavasor gave his orders If the worst comes to the worst he said to himself I can always cut my throat As he walked from the attorney s office to his club he bethought himself that that might not unprobably be the necessary termination of his career Everything was going wrong with him His grandfather who was eighty years of age would not die appeared to have no symptoms of dying whereas this Marquis who was not yet much over fifty was rushing headlong out of the world simply because he was the one man whose continued life at the present moment would be serviceable to George Vavasor As he thought of his grandfather he almost broke his umbrella by the vehemence with which he struck it against the pavement What right could an ignorant old fool like that have to live for ever keeping the possession of a property which he could not use and ruining those who were to come after him If now at this moment that wretched place down in Westmoreland could become his he might yet ride triumphantly over his difficulties and refrain from sullying his hands with more of his cousin s money till she should become his wife Even that thousand pounds had not passed through his hands without giving him much bitter suffering As is always the case in such matters the thing done was worse than the doing of it He had taught himself to look at it lightly whilst it was yet unaccomplished but he could not think of it lightly now Kate had been right It would have been better for him to take her money Any money would have been better than that upon which he had laid his sacrilegious hands If he could have cut a purse after the old fashion the stain of the deed would hardly have been so deep In these days for more than a month indeed after his return from Westmoreland he did not go near Queen Anne Street trying to persuade himself that he stayed away because of her coldness to him But in truth he was afraid of seeing her without speaking of her money and afraid to see her if he were to speak of it You have seen the Globe someone said to him as he entered the club No indeed I have seen nothing Bunratty died in Ireland this morning I suppose you ll be up for the Chelsea districts CHAPTER XLII Parliament Meets Parliament opened that year on the twelfth of February and mister Palliser was one of the first Members of the Lower House to take his seat It had been generally asserted through the country during the last week that the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer had so to say ceased to exist as such that though he still existed to the outer world drawing his salary and doing routine work if a man so big can have any routine work to do he existed no longer in the inner world of the cabinet He had differed men said with his friend and chief the Prime Minister as to the expediency of repealing what were left of the direct taxes of the country and was prepared to launch himself into opposition with his small bodyguard of followers with all his energy and with all his venom There is something very pleasant in the close bosom friendship and bitter uncompromising animosity of these human gods of these human beings who would be gods were they not shorn so short of their divinity in that matter of immortality If it were so arranged that the same persons were always friends and the same persons were always enemies as used to be the case among the dear old heathen gods and goddesses if Parliament were an Olympus in which Juno and Venus never kissed the thing would not be nearly so interesting But in this Olympus partners are changed the divine bosom now rabid with hatred against some opposing deity suddenly becomes replete with love towards its late enemy and exciting changes occur which give to the whole thing all the keen interest of a sensational novel No doubt this is greatly lessened for those who come too near the scene of action Members of Parliament and the friends of Members of Parliament are apt to teach themselves that it means nothing that Lord This does not hate mister That or think him a traitor to his country or wish to crucify him and that Sir John of the Treasury is not much in earnest when he speaks of his noble friend at the Foreign Office as a god to whom no other god was ever comparable in honesty discretion patriotism and genius But the outside Briton who takes a delight in politics and this description should include ninety nine educated Englishmen out of every hundred should not be desirous of peeping behind the scenes No beholder at any theatre should do so It is good to believe in these friendships and these enmities and very pleasant to watch their changes It is delightful when Oxford embraces Manchester finding that it cannot live without support in that quarter and very delightful when the uncompromising assailant of all men in power receives the legitimate reward of his energy by being taken in among the bosoms of the blessed But although the outer world was so sure that the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer had ceased to exist when the House of Commons met that gentleman took his seat on the Treasury Bench mister Palliser who had by no means given a general support to the Ministry in the last Session took his seat on the same side of the House indeed but low down and near to the cross benches mister Bott sat close behind him and men knew that mister Bott was a distinguished member of mister Palliser s party whatever that party might be Lord Cinquebars moved the Address and I must confess that he did it very lamely He was once accused by mister Maxwell the brewer of making a great noise in the hunting field The accusation could not be repeated as to his performance on this occasion as no one could hear a word that he said The Address was seconded by mister Loftus Fitzhoward a nephew of the Duke of saint Bungay who spoke as though he were resolved to trump poor Lord Cinquebars in every sentence which he pronounced as we so often hear the second clergyman from the Communion Table trumping his weary predecessor who has just finished the Litany not in the clearest or most audible voice Every word fell from mister Fitzhoward with the elaborate accuracy of a separate pistol shot and as he became pleased with himself in his progress and warm with his work he accented his words sharply made rhetorical pauses even moved his hands about in action and quite disgusted his own party who had been very well satisfied with Lord Cinquebars There are many rocks which a young speaker in Parliament should avoid but no rock which requires such careful avoiding as the rock of eloquence Whatever may be his faults let him at least avoid eloquence He should not be inaccurate which however is not much he should not be long winded which is a good deal he should not be ill tempered which is more but none of these faults are so damnable as eloquence All mister Fitzhoward s friends and all his enemies knew that he had had his chance and that he had thrown it away In the Queen s Speech there had been some very lukewarm allusion to remission of direct taxation This remission which had already been carried so far should be carried further if such further carrying were found practicable So had said the Queen Those words it was known could not have been approved of by the energetic and still existing Chancellor of the Exchequer On this subject the mover of the Address said never a word and the seconder only a word or two What they had said had of course been laid down for them though unfortunately the manner of saying could not be so easily prescribed Then there arose a great enemy a man fluent of diction apparently with deep malice at his heart though at home as we used to say at school one of the most good natured fellows in the world one ambitious of that godship which a seat on the other side of the House bestowed and greedy to grasp at the chances which this disagreement in the councils of the gods might give him He was quite content he said to vote for the Address as he believed would be all the gentlemen on his side of the House No one could suspect them or him of giving a factious opposition to Government Had they not borne and forborne beyond all precedent known in that House Then he touched lightly and almost with grace to his opponents on many subjects promising support and barely hinting that they were totally and manifestly wrong in all things But Then the tone of his voice changed and the well known look of fury was assumed upon his countenance Then great Jove on the other side pulled his hat over his eyes and smiled blandly Then members put away the papers they had been reading for a moment and men in the gallery began to listen But The long and the short of it was this that the existing Government had come into power on the cry of a reduction of taxation and now they were going to shirk the responsibility of their own measures They were going to shirk the responsibility of their own election cry although it was known that their own Chancellor of the Exchequer was prepared to carry it out to the full He was willing to carry it out to the full were he not restrained by the timidity falsehood and treachery of his colleagues of whom of course the most timid the most false and the most treacherous was the great god Jove who sat blandly smiling on the other side Illustration Great Jove No one should ever go near the House of Commons who wishes to enjoy all this It was so manifestly evident that neither Jove nor any of his satellites cared twopence for what the irate gentleman was saying nay it became so evident that in spite of his assumed fury the gentleman was not irate He intended to communicate his look of anger to the newspaper reports of his speech and he knew from experience that he could succeed in that And men walked about the House in the most telling moments enemies shaking hands with enemies in a way that showed an entire absence of all good honest hatred among them But the gentleman went on and finished his speech demanding at last in direct terms that the Treasury Jove should state plainly to the House who was to be and who was not to be the bearer of the purse among the gods Then Treasury Jove got up smiling and thanked his enemy for the cordiality of his support He had always he said done the gentleman s party justice for their clemency and had feared no opposition from them and he was glad to find that he was correct in his anticipations as to the course they would pursue on the present occasion He went on saying a good deal about home matters and foreign matters proving that everything was right just as easily as his enemy had proved that everything was wrong On all these points he was very full and very courteous but when he came to the subject of taxation he simply repeated the passage from the Queen s Speech expressing a hope that his right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be able to satisfy the judgement of the House and the wishes of the people That specially personal question which had been asked he did not answer at all But the House was still all agog as was the crowded gallery The energetic and still existing Chancellor of the Exchequer was then present divided only by one little thin Secretary of State from Jove himself Would he get up and declare his purposes He was a man who almost always did get up when an opportunity offered itself or when it did not Some second little gun was fired off from the Opposition benches and then there was a pause Would the purse bearer of Olympus rise upon his wings and speak his mind or would he sit in silence upon his cloud There was a general call for the purse bearer but he floated in silence and was inexplicable The purse bearer was not to be bullied into any sudden reading of the riddle Then there came on a general debate about money matters in which the purse bearer did say a few words but he said nothing as to the great question at issue At last up got mister Palliser towards the close of the evening and occupied a full hour in explaining what taxes the Government might remit with safety and what they might not mister Bott meanwhile prompting him with figures from behind with an assiduity that was almost too persistent According to mister Palliser the words used in the Queen s Speech were not at all too cautious The Members went out gradually and the House became very thin during this oration but the newspapers declared next morning that his speech had been the speech of the night and that the perspicuity of mister Palliser pointed him out as the coming man He returned home to his house in Park Lane quite triumphant after his success and found Lady Glencora at about twelve o clock sitting alone She had arrived in town on that day having come up at her own request instead of remaining at Matching Priory till after Easter as he had proposed He had wished her to stay in order as he had said that there might be a home for his cousins But she had expressed herself unwilling to remain without him explaining that the cousins might have the home in her absence as well as they could in her presence and he had given way But in truth she had learned to hate her cousin Iphy Palliser with a hatred that was unreasonable seeing that she did not also hate Alice Vavasor who had done as much to merit her hatred as had her cousin Lady Glencora knew by what means her absence from Monkshade had been brought about Miss Palliser had told her all that had passed in Alice s bedroom on the last night of Alice s stay at Matching and had by so doing contrived to prevent the visit Lady Glencora understood well all that Alice had said and yet though she hated Miss Palliser for what had been done she entertained no anger against Alice Of course Alice would have prevented that visit to Monkshade if it were in her power to do so Of course she would save her friend It is hardly too much to say that Lady Glencora looked to Alice to save her Nevertheless she hated Iphy Palliser for engaging herself in the same business Lady Glencora looked to Alice to save her and yet it may be doubted whether she did in truth wish to be saved While she was at Matching and before mister Palliser had returned from Monkshade a letter reached her by what means she had never learned A letter has been placed within my writing case she said to her maid quite openly Who put it there The maid had declared her ignorance in a manner that had satisfied Lady Glencora of her truth If such a thing happens again said Lady Glencora I shall be obliged to have the matter investigated I cannot allow that anything should be put into my room surreptitiously There then had been an end of that as regarded any steps taken by Lady Glencora The letter had been from Burgo Fitzgerald and had contained a direct proposal that she should go off with him I am at Matching the letter said at the Inn but I do not dare to show myself lest I should do you an injury I walked round the house yesterday at night and I know that I saw your room If I am wrong in thinking that you love me I would not for worlds insult you by my presence but if you love me still I ask you to throw aside from you that fictitious marriage and give yourself to the man whom if you love him you should regard as your husband There had been more of it but it had been to the same effect To Lady Glencora it had seemed to convey an assurance of devoted love of that love which in former days her friends had told her was not within the compass of Burgo s nature He had not asked her to meet him then but saying that he would return to Matching after Parliament was met begged her to let him have some means of knowing whether her heart was true to him She told no one of the letter but she kept it and read it over and over again in the silence and solitude of her room She felt that she was guilty in thus reading it even in keeping it from her husband s knowledge but though conscious of this guilt though resolute almost in its commission still she determined not to remain at Matching after her husband s departure not to undergo the danger of remaining there while Burgo Fitzgerald should be in the vicinity She could not analyse her own wishes She often told herself as she had told Alice that it would be better for them all that she should go away that in throwing herself even to the dogs if such must be the result she would do more of good than of harm She declared to herself in the most passionate words she could use that she loved this man with all her heart She protested that the fault would not be hers but theirs who had forced her to marry the man she did not love She assured herself that her husband had no affection for her and that their marriage was in every respect prejudicial to him She recurred over and over again in her thoughts to her own childlessness and to his extreme desire for an heir Though I do sacrifice myself she would say I shall do more of good than harm and I cannot be more wretched than I am now But yet she fled to London because she feared to leave herself at Matching when Burgo Fitzgerald should be there She sent no answer to his letter She made no preparation for going with him She longed to see Alice to whom alone since her marriage had she ever spoken of her love and intended to tell her the whole tale of that letter She was as one who in madness was resolute to throw herself from a precipice but to whom some remnant of sanity remained which forced her to seek those who would save her from herself mister Palliser had not seen her since her arrival in London and of course he took her by the hand and kissed her But it was the embrace of a brother rather than of a lover or a husband Lady Glencora with her full woman s nature understood this thoroughly and appreciated by instinct the true bearing of every touch from his hand I hope you are well she said Oh yes quite well And you A little fatigued with your journey I suppose No not much Well we have had a debate on the Address Don t you want to know how it has gone If it has concerned you particularly I do of course Concerned me It has concerned me certainly They haven t appointed you yet have they No they don t appoint people during debates in the House of Commons But I fear I shall never make you a politician I m almost afraid you never will But I m not the less anxious for your success since you wish it yourself I don t understand why you should work so very hard but as you like it I m as anxious as anybody can be that you should triumph Yes I do like it he said A man must like something and I don t know what there is to like better Some people can eat and drink all day and some people can care about a horse I can do neither And there were others Lady Glencora thought who could love to lie in the sun and could look up into the eyes of women and seek their happiness there She was sure at any rate that she knew one such But she said nothing of this I spoke for a moment to Lord Brock said mister Palliser Lord Brock was the name by which the present Jove of the Treasury was known among men And what did Lord Brock say He didn t say much but he was very cordial But I thought Plantagenet that he could appoint you if he pleased Doesn t he do it all Well in one sense he does But I don t suppose I shall ever make you understand He endeavoured however to do so on the present occasion and gave her a somewhat longer lecture on the working of the British Constitution and the manner in which British politics evolved themselves than would have been expected from most young husbands to their young wives under similar circumstances Lady Glencora yawned and strove lustily but ineffectually to hide her yawn in her handkerchief But I see you don t care a bit about it said he peevishly Don t be angry Plantagenet Indeed I do care about it but I am so ignorant that I can t understand it all at once I am rather tired and I think I ll go to bed now Shall you be late No not very that is I shall be rather late I ve a lot of letters I want to write to night as I must be at work all to morrow By the by mister Bott is coming to dine here There will be no one else The next day was a Wednesday and the House would not sit in the evening mister Bott said Lady Glencora showing by her voice that she anticipated no pleasure from that gentleman s company Yes mister Bott Have you any objection Oh no Would you like to dine alone with him Why should I dine alone with him Why shouldn t you eat your dinner with us I hope you are not going to become fastidious and to turn up your nose at people missus Marsham is in town and I dare say she ll come to you if you ask her But this was too much for Lady Glencora She was disposed to be mild but she could not endure to have her two duennas thus brought upon her together on the first day of her arrival in London And missus Marsham would be worse than mister Bott mister Bott would be engaged with mister Palliser during the greater part of the evening I thought said she of asking my cousin Alice Vavasor to spend the evening with me Miss Vavasor said the husband I must say that I thought Miss Vavasor He was going to make some allusion to that unfortunate hour spent among the ruins but he stopped himself I hope you have nothing to say against my cousin said his wife She is my only near relative that I really care for the only woman I mean No I don t mean to say anything against her She s very well as a young lady I dare say I would sooner that you would ask missus Marsham to morrow Lady Glencora was standing waiting to go away to her own room but it was absolutely necessary that this matter should be decided before she went She felt that he was hard to her and unreasonable and that he was treating her like a child who should not be allowed her own way in anything She had endeavoured to please him and having failed was not now disposed to give way As there will be no other ladies here to morrow evening Plantagenet and as I have not yet seen Alice since I have been in town I wish you would let me have my way in this Of course I cannot have very much to say to missus Marsham who is an old woman I especially want missus Marsham to be your friend said he Friendships will not come by ordering Plantagenet said she Illustration Friendships will not come by ordering said Lady Glencora Very well said he Of course you will do as you please I am sorry that you have refused the first favour I have asked you this year Then he left the room and she went away to bed CHAPTER XLIII missus Marsham But Lady Glencora was not brought to repentance by her husband s last words It seemed to her to be so intolerably cruel this demand of his that she should be made to pass the whole of her first evening in town with an old woman for whom it was impossible that she should entertain the slightest regard that she resolved upon rebellion Had he positively ordered missus Marsham she would have sent for that lady and have contented herself with enduring her presence in disdainful silence but mister Palliser had not given any order He had made a request and a request from its very nature admits of no obedience The compliance with a request must be voluntary and she would not send for missus Marsham except upon compulsion Had not she also made a request to him and had not he refused it It was his prerogative undoubtedly to command but in that matter of requests she had a right to expect that her voice should be as potent as his own She wrote a line therefore to Alice before she went to bed begging her cousin to come to her early on the following day so that they might go out together and then afterwards dine in company with mister Bott I know that will be an inducement to you Lady Glencora said because your generous heart will feel of what service you may be to me Nobody else will be here unless indeed missus Marsham should be asked unknown to myself Then she sat herself down to think to think especially about the cruelty of husbands She had been told over and over again in the days before her marriage that Burgo would ill use her if he became her husband The Marquis of Auld Reekie had gone so far as to suggest that Burgo might probably beat her But what hard treatment even what beating could be so unendurable as this total want of sympathy as this deadness in life which her present lot entailed upon her As for that matter of beating she ridiculed the idea in her very soul She sat smiling at the absurdity of the thing as she thought of the beauty of Burgo s eyes of the softness of his touch of the loving almost worshipping tones of his voice Would it not even be better to be beaten by him than to have politics explained to her at one o clock at night by such a husband as Plantagenet Palliser The British Constitution indeed Had she married Burgo they would have been in sunny Italy and he would have told her some other tale than that as they sat together under the pale moonlight She had a little water coloured drawing called Raphael and Fornarina and she was infantine enough to tell herself that the so called Raphael was like her Burgo no not her Burgo but the Burgo that was not hers At any rate all the romance of the picture she might have enjoyed had they allowed her to dispose as she had wished of her own hand She might have sat in marble balconies while the vines clustered over her head and he would have been at her knee hardly speaking to her but making his presence felt by the halo of its divinity He would have called upon her for no hard replies With him near her she would have enjoyed the soft air and would have sat happy without trouble lapped in the delight of loving It was thus that Fornarina sat And why should not such a lot have been hers Her Raphael would have loved her let them say what they would about his cruelty Poor wretched overburthened child to whom the commonest lessons of life had not yet been taught and who had now fallen into the hands of one who was so ill fitted to teach them Who would not pity her Who could say that the fault was hers The world had laden her with wealth till she had had no limb free for its ordinary uses and then had turned her loose to run her race Have you written to your cousin her husband asked her the next morning His voice as he spoke clearly showed that his anger was either over or suppressed Yes I have asked her to come and drive and then to stay for dinner I shall send the carriage for her if she can come The man is to wait for an answer Very well said mister Palliser mildly And then after a short pause he added As that is settled perhaps you would have no objection to ask missus Marsham also Won t she probably be engaged No I think not said mister Palliser And then he added being ashamed of the tinge of falsehood of which he would otherwise have been guilty I know she is not engaged She expects to come then said Lady Glencora I have not asked her if you mean that Glencora Had I done so I should have said so I told her that I did not know what your engagements were I will write to her if you please said the wife who felt that she could hardly refuse any longer Do my dear said the husband So Lady Glencora did write to missus Marsham who promised to come as did also Alice Vavasor Lady Glencora would at any rate have Alice to herself for some hours before dinner At first she took comfort in that reflection but after a while she bethought herself that she would not know what to tell Alice or what not to tell Did she mean to show that letter to her cousin If she did show it then so she argued with herself she must bring herself to endure the wretchedness of her present lot and must give up for ever all her dreams about Raphael and Fornarina If she did not show it or at any rate tell of it then it would come to pass that she would leave her husband under the protection of another man and she would become what she did not dare to name even to herself She declared that so it must be She knew that she would go with Burgo should he ever come to her with the means of going at his and her instant command But should she bring herself to let Alice know that such a letter had been conveyed to her Burgo would never have such power I remember the story of a case of abduction in which a man was tried for his life and was acquitted because the lady had acquiesced in the carrying away while it was in progress She had as she herself declared armed herself with a sure and certain charm or talisman against such dangers which she kept suspended round her neck but whilst she was in the post chaise she opened the window and threw the charm from her no longer desiring as the learned counsel for the defence efficiently alleged to be kept under the bonds of such protection Lady Glencora s state of mind was in its nature nearly the same as that of the lady in the post chaise Whether or no she would use her charm she had not yet decided but the power of doing so was still hers Alice came and the greeting between the cousins was very affectionate Lady Glencora received her as though they had been playmates from early childhood and Alice though such impulsive love was not natural to her as to the other could not bring herself to be cold to one who was so warm to her Indeed had she not promised her love in that meeting at Matching Priory in which her cousin had told her of all her wretchedness I will love you Alice had said and though there was much in Lady Glencora that she could not approve much even that she could not bring herself to like still she would not allow her heart to contradict her words They sat so long over the fire in the drawing room that at last they agreed that the driving should be abandoned What s the use of it said Lady Glencora There s nothing to see and the wind is as cold as charity We are much more comfortable here are we not Alice quite acquiesced in this having no great desire to be driven through the parks in the gloom of a February afternoon If I had Dandy and Flirt up here there would be some fun in it but mister Palliser doesn t wish me to drive in London I suppose it would be dangerous Not in the least I don t think it s that he minds but he has an idea that it looks fast So it does If I were a man I m sure I shouldn t like my wife to drive horses about London And why not Just because you d be a tyrant like other husbands What s the harm of looking fast if one doesn t do anything improper Poor Dandy and dear Flirt I m sure they d like it Perhaps mister Palliser doesn t care for that I can tell you something else he doesn t care for He doesn t care whether Dandy s mistress likes it Don t say that Glencora Why not say it to you Don t teach yourself to think it That s what I mean I believe he would consent to anything that he didn t think wrong Such as lectures about the British Constitution But never mind about that Alice Of course the British Constitution is everything to him and I wish I knew more about it that s all But I haven t told you whom you are to meet at dinner Yes you have mister Bott But there s another guest a missus Marsham I thought I d got rid of her for to day when I wrote to you but I hadn t She s coming She won t hurt me at all said Alice She will hurt me very much She ll destroy the pleasure of our whole evening I do believe that she hates you and that she thinks you instigate me to all manner of iniquity What fools they all are Who are they all Glencora She and that man and Never mind It makes me sick when I think that they should be so blind Alice I hardly know how much I owe to you I don t indeed Everything I believe Lady Glencora as she spoke put her hand into her pocket and grasped the letter which lay there That s nonsense said Alice No it s not nonsense Who do you think came to Matching when I was there What to the house said Alice feeling almost certain that mister Fitzgerald was the person to whom Lady Glencora was alluding No not to the house If it is the person of whom I am thinking said Alice solemnly let me implore you not to speak of him And why should I not speak of him Did I not speak of him before to you and was it not for good How are you to be my friend if I may not speak to you of everything But you should not think of him What nonsense you talk Alice Not think of him How is one to help one s thoughts Look here Her hand was on the letter and it would have been out in a moment and thrown upon Alice s lap had not the servant opened the door and announced missus Marsham Oh how I do wish we had gone to drive said Lady Glencora in a voice which the servant certainly heard and which missus Marsham would have heard had she not been a little hard of hearing in her bonnet How do my dear said missus Marsham I thought I d just come across from Norfolk Street and see you though I am coming to dinner in the evening It s only just a step you know How d ye do Miss Vavasor and she made a salutation to Alice which was nearly as cold as it could be missus Marsham was a woman who had many good points She was poor and bore her poverty without complaint She was connected by blood and friendship with people rich and titled but she paid to none of them egregious respect on account of their wealth or titles She was staunch in her friendships and staunch in her enmities She was no fool and knew well what was going on in the world She could talk about the last novel or if need be about the Constitution She had been a true wife though sometimes too strong minded and a painstaking mother whose children however had never loved her as most mothers like to be loved The catalogue of her faults must be quite as long as that of her virtues She was one of those women who are ambitious of power and not very scrupulous as to the manner in which they obtain it She was hardhearted and capable of pursuing an object without much regard to the injury she might do She would not flatter wealth or fawn before a title but she was not above any artifice by which she might ingratiate herself with those whom it suited her purpose to conciliate She thought evil rather than good She was herself untrue in action if not absolutely in word I do not say that she would coin lies but she would willingly leave false impressions She had been the bosom friend and in many things the guide in life of mister Palliser s mother and she took a special interest in mister Palliser s welfare When he married she heard the story of the loves of Burgo and Lady Glencora and though she thought well of the money she was not disposed to think very well of the bride She made up her mind that the young lady would want watching and she was of opinion that no one would be so well able to watch Lady Glencora as herself She had not plainly opened her mind on this matter to mister Palliser she had not made any distinct suggestion to him that she would act as Argus to his wife mister Palliser would have rejected any such suggestion and missus Marsham knew that he would do so but she had let a word or two drop hinting that Lady Glencora was very young hinting that Lady Glencora s manners were charming in their childlike simplicity but hinting also that precaution was for that reason the more necessary mister Palliser who suspected nothing as to Burgo or as to any other special peril whose whole disposition was void of suspicion whose dry nature realized neither the delights nor the dangers of love acknowledged that Glencora was young He especially wished that she should be discreet and matronly he feared no lovers but he feared that she might do silly things that she would catch cold and not know how to live a life becoming the wife of a Chancellor of the Exchequer Therefore he submitted Glencora and to a certain extent himself into the hands of missus Marsham Lady Glencora had not been twenty four hours in the house with this lady before she recognized in her a duenna In all such matters no one could be quicker than Lady Glencora She might be very ignorant about the British Constitution and alas very ignorant also as to the real elements of right and wrong in a woman s conduct but she was no fool She had an eye that could see and an ear that could understand and an abundance of that feminine instinct which teaches a woman to know her friend or her enemy at a glance at a touch at a word In many things Lady Glencora was much quicker much more clever than her husband though he was to be Chancellor of the Exchequer and though she did know nothing of the Constitution She knew too that he was easily to be deceived that though his intelligence was keen his instincts were dull that he was gifted with no fineness of touch with no subtle appreciation of the characters of men and women and to a certain extent she looked down upon him for his obtusity He should have been aware that Burgo was a danger to be avoided and he should have been aware also that missus Marsham was a duenna not to be employed When a woman knows that she is guarded by a watch dog she is bound to deceive her Cerberus if it be possible and is usually not ill disposed to deceive also the owner of Cerberus Lady Glencora felt that missus Marsham was her Cerberus and she was heartily resolved that if she was to be kept in the proper line at all she would not be so kept by missus Marsham Alice rose and accepted missus Marsham s salutation quite as coldly as it had been given and from that time forward those two ladies were enemies missus Marsham groping quite in the dark partly guessed that Alice had in some way interfered to prevent Lady Glencora s visit to Monkshade and though such prevention was no doubt good in that lady s eyes she resented the interference She had made up her mind that Alice was not the sort of friend that Lady Glencora should have about her Alice recognized and accepted the feud I thought I might find you at home said missus Marsham as I know you are lazy about going out in the cold unless it be for a foolish midnight ramble and missus Marsham shook her head She was a little woman with sharp small eyes with a permanent colour in her face and two short crisp grey curls at each side of her face always well dressed always in good health and as Lady Glencora believed altogether incapable of fatigue The ramble you speak of was very wise I think said Lady Glencora but I never could see the use of driving about in London in the middle of winter One ought to go out of the house every day said missus Marsham I hate all those rules Don t you Alice Alice did not hate them therefore she said nothing My dear Glencora one must live by rules in this life You might as well say that you hated sitting down to dinner So I do very often almost always when there s company You ll get over that feeling after another season in town said missus Marsham pretending to suppose that Lady Glencora alluded to some remaining timidity in receiving her own guests Upon my word I don t think I shall It s a thing that seems always to be getting more grievous instead of less so mister Bott is coming to dine here to night There was no mistaking the meaning of this There was no pretending even to mistake it Now missus Marsham had accepted the right hand of fellowship from mister Bott not because she especially liked him but in compliance with the apparent necessities of mister Palliser s position mister Bott had made good his ground about mister Palliser and missus Marsham as she was not strong enough to turn him off from it had given him the right hand of fellowship mister Bott is a Member of Parliament and a very serviceable friend of mister Palliser s said missus Marsham All the same we do not like mister Bott do we Alice He is Doctor Fell to us only I think we could tell why I certainly do not like him said Alice It can be but of small matter to you Miss Vavasor said missus Marsham as you will not probably have to see much of him Of the very smallest moment said Alice He did annoy me once but will never I dare say have an opportunity of doing so again I don t know what the annoyance may have been Of course you don t missus Marsham But I shouldn t have thought it likely that a person so fully employed as mister Bott and employed too on matters of such vast importance would have gone out of his way to annoy a young lady whom he chanced to meet for a day or two in a country house I don t think that Alice means that he attempted to flirt with her said Lady Glencora laughing Fancy mister Bott s flirtation Perhaps he did not attempt said missus Marsham and the words the tone and the innuendo together were more than Alice was able to bear with equanimity Glencora said she rising from her chair I think I ll leave you alone with missus Marsham I m not disposed to discuss mister Bott s character and certainly not to hear his name mentioned in disagreeable connection with my own But Lady Glencora would not let her go Nonsense Alice she said If you and I can t fight our little battles against mister Bott and missus Marsham without running away it is odd There is a warfare in which they who run away never live to fight another day I hope Glencora you do not count me as your enemy said missus Marsham drawing herself up But I shall certainly if you attack Alice Love me love my dog I beg your pardon Alice but what I meant was this missus Marsham Love me love the best friend I have in the world I did not mean to offend Miss Vavasor said missus Marsham looking at her very grimly Alice merely bowed her head She had been offended and she would not deny it After that missus Marsham took herself off saying that she would be back to dinner She was angry but not unhappy She thought that she could put down Miss Vavasor and she was prepared to bear a good deal from Lady Glencora for mister Palliser s sake as she said to herself with some attempt at a sentimental remembrance of her old friend She s a nasty old cat said Lady Glencora as soon as the door was closed and she said these words with so droll a voice with such a childlike shaking of her head with so much comedy in her grimace that Alice could not but laugh She is said Lady Glencora I know her and you ll have to know her too before you ve done with her It won t at all do for you to run away when she spits at you You must hold your ground and show your claws and make her know that if she spits you can scratch But I don t want to be a cat myself She ll find I m of the genus but of the tiger kind if she persecutes me Alice there s one thing I have made up my mind about I will not be persecuted If my husband tells me to do anything as long as he is my husband I ll do it but I won t be persecuted You should remember that she was a very old friend of mister Palliser s mother I do remember and that may be a very good reason why she should come here occasionally or go to Matching or to any place in which we may be living It s a bore of course but it s a natural bore and one that ought to be borne And that will be the beginning and the end of it I m afraid not my dear It may perhaps be the end of it but I fear it won t be the beginning I won t be persecuted If she gives me advice I shall tell her to her face that it s not wanted and if she insults any friend of mine as she did you I shall tell her that she had better stay away She ll go and tell him of course but I can t help that I ve made up my mind that I won t be persecuted After that Lady Glencora felt no further inclination to show Burgo s letter to Alice on that occasion They sat over the drawing room fire talking chiefly of Alice s affairs till it was time for them to dress But Alice though she spoke much of mister Grey said no word as to her engagement with George Vavasor How could she speak of it inasmuch as she had already resolved already almost resolved that that engagement also should be broken Alice when she came down to the drawing room before dinner found mister Bott there alone She had dressed more quickly than her friend and mister Palliser had not yet made his appearance I did not expect the pleasure of meeting Miss Vavasor to day he said as he came up offering his hand She gave him her hand and then sat down merely muttering some word of reply We spent a very pleasant month down at Matching together didn t you think so I spent a pleasant month there certainly You left if I remember the morning after that late walk out among the ruins That was unfortunate was it not Poor Lady Glencora it made her very ill so much so that she could not go to Monkshade as she particularly wished It was very sad Lady Glencora is very delicate very delicate indeed We who have the privilege of being near her ought always to remember that I don t think she is at all delicate Oh don t you I m afraid that s your mistake Miss Vavasor I believe she has very good health which is the greatest blessing in the world By delicate I suppose you mean weak and infirm Oh dear no not in the least not infirm certainly I should be very sorry to be supposed to have said that Lady Glencora is infirm What I mean is not robust Miss Vavasor Her general organization if you understand me is exquisitely delicate One can see that I think in every glance of her eye Alice was going to protest that she had never seen it at all when mister Palliser entered the room along with missus Marsham The two gentlemen shook hands and then mister Palliser turned to Alice She perceived at once by his face that she was unwelcome and wished herself away from his house It might be all very well for Lady Glencora to fight with missus Marsham and with her husband too in regard to the Marsham persecution but there could be no reason why she should do so He just touched her hand barely closing his thumb upon her fingers and asked her how she was Then he turned away from her side of the fire and began talking to missus Marsham on the other There was that in his face and in his manner which was positively offensive to her He made no allusion to his former acquaintance with her spoke no word about Matching no word about his wife as he would naturally have done to his wife s friend Alice felt the blood mount into her face and regretted greatly that she had ever come among these people Had she not long since made up her mind that she would avoid her great relations and did not all this prove that it would have been well for her to have clung to that resolution What was Lady Glencora to her that she should submit herself to be treated as though she were a poor companion a dependent who received a salary for her attendance an indigent cousin hanging on to the bounty of her rich connection Alice was proud to a fault She had nursed her pride till it was very faulty All her troubles and sorrows in life had come from an overfed craving for independence Why then should she submit to be treated with open want of courtesy by any man but of all men why should she submit to it from such a one as mister Palliser the heir of a ducal house rolling in wealth and magnificent with all the magnificence of British pomp and pride No she would make Lady Glencora understand that the close intimacies of daily life were not possible to them I declare I m very much ashamed said Lady Glencora as she entered the room I shan t apologize to you Alice for it was you who kept me talking but I do beg missus Marsham s pardon missus Marsham was all smiles and forgiveness and hoped that Lady Glencora would not make a stranger of her Then dinner was announced and Alice had to walk down stairs by herself She did not care a doit for that but there had been a disagreeable little contest when the moment came Lady Glencora had wished to give up mister Bott to her cousin but mister Bott had stuck manfully to Lady Glencora s side He hoped to take Lady Glencora down to dinner very often and was not at all disposed to abate his privilege During dinner time Alice said very little nor was there given to her opportunity of saying much She could not but think of the day of her first arrival at Matching Priory when she had sat between the Duke of saint Bungay and Jeffrey Palliser and when everybody had been so civil to her She now occupied one side of the table by herself away from the fire where she felt cold and desolate in the gloom of the large half lighted room mister Palliser occupied himself with missus Marsham who talked politics to him and mister Bott never lost a moment in his endeavours to say some civil word to Lady Glencora Lady Glencora gave him no encouragement but she hardly dared to snub him openly in her husband s immediate presence Twenty times during dinner she said some little word to Alice attempting at first to make the time pleasant and then when the matter was too far gone for that attempting to give some relief But it was of no avail There are moments in which conversation seems to be impossible in which the very gods interfere to put a seal upon the lips of the unfortunate one It was such a moment now with Alice She had never as yet been used to snubbing Whatever position she had hitherto held in that she had always stood foremost much more so than had been good for her When she had gone to Matching she had trembled for her position but there all had gone well with her there Lady Glencora s kindness had at first been able to secure for her a reception that had been flattering and almost better than flattering Jeffrey Palliser had been her friend and would had she so willed it have been more than her friend But now she felt that the halls of the Pallisers were too cold for her and that the sooner she escaped from their gloom and hard discourtesy the better for her missus Marsham when the three ladies had returned to the drawing room together was a little triumphant She felt that she had put Alice down and with the energetic prudence of a good general who knows that he should follow up a victory let the cost of doing so be what it may she determined to keep her down Alice had resolved that she would come as seldom as might be to mister Palliser s house in Park Lane That resolution on her part was in close accordance with missus Marsham s own views Is Miss Vavasor going to walk home she asked Walk home all along Oxford Street Good gracious no Why should she walk The carriage will take her Or a cab said Alice I am quite used to go about London in a cab by myself I don t think they are nice for young ladies after dark said missus Marsham I was going to offer my servant to walk with her She is an elderly woman and would not mind it I m sure Alice is very much obliged said Lady Glencora but she will have the carriage You are very good natured said missus Marsham but gentlemen do so dislike having their horses out at night No gentleman s horses will be out said Lady Glencora savagely and as for mine it s what they are there for It was not often that Lady Glencora made any allusion to her own property or allowed any one near her to suppose that she remembered the fact that her husband s great wealth was in truth her wealth As to many matters her mind was wrong In some things her taste was not delicate as should be that of a woman But as regarded her money no woman could have behaved with greater reticence or a purer delicacy But now when she was twitted by her husband s special friend with ill usage to her husband s horses because she chose to send her own friend home in her own carriage she did find it hard to bear I dare say it s all right said missus Marsham It is all right said Lady Glencora mister Palliser has given me my horses for my own use to do as I like with them and if he thinks I take them out when they ought to be left at home he can tell me so Nobody else has a right to do it Lady Glencora by this time was almost in a passion and showed that she was so My dear Lady Glencora you have mistaken me said missus Marsham I did not mean anything of that kind I am so sorry said Alice And it is such a pity as I am quite used to going about in cabs Of course you are said Lady Glencora Why shouldn t you I d go home in a wheelbarrow if I couldn t walk and had no other conveyance That s not the question missus Marsham understands that Upon my word I don t understand anything said that lady I understand this said Lady Glencora that in all such matters as that I intend to follow my own pleasure Come Alice let us have some coffee and she rang the bell What a fuss we have made about a stupid old carriage The gentlemen did not return to the drawing room that evening having no doubt joint work to do in arranging the great financial calculations of the nation and at an early hour Alice was taken home in Lady Glencora s brougham leaving her cousin still in the hands of missus Marsham CHAPTER XLIV The Election for the Chelsea Districts March came and still the Chancellor of the Exchequer held his position In the early days of March there was given in the House a certain parliamentary explanation on the subject which however did not explain very much to any person A statement was made which was declared by the persons making it to be altogether satisfactory but nobody else seemed to find any satisfaction in it The big wigs of the Cabinet had made an arrangement which from the language used by them on this occasion they must be supposed to have regarded as hardly less permanent than the stars but everybody else protested that the Government was going to pieces and mister Bott was heard to declare in clubs and lobbies and wherever he could get a semi public political hearing that this kind of thing wouldn t do Lord Brock must either blow hot or cold If he chose to lean upon mister Palliser he might lean upon him and mister Palliser would not be found wanting In such case no opposition could touch Lord Brock or the Government That was mister Bott s opinion But if Lord Brock did not so choose why in that case he must expect that mister Palliser and mister Palliser s friends would mister Bott did not say what they would do but he was supposed by those who understood the matter to hint at an Opposition lobby and adverse divisions and to threaten Lord Brock with the open enmity of mister Palliser and of mister Palliser s great follower This kind of thing won t do long you know repeated mister Bott for the second or third time as he stood upon the rug before the fire at his club with one or two of his young friends around him I suppose not said Calder Jones the hunting Member of Parliament whom we once met at Roebury Planty Pall won t stand it I should say What can he do asked another an unfledged Member who was not as yet quite settled as to the leadership under which he intended to work What can he do said mister Bott who on such an occasion as this could be very great who for a moment could almost feel that he might become a leader of a party for himself and some day institute a Bott Ministry What can he do You will very shortly see what he can do He can make himself the master of the occasion If Lord Brock doesn t look about him he ll find that mister Palliser will be in the Cabinet without his help You don t mean to say that the Queen will send for Planty Pall said the young Member I mean to say that the Queen will send for any one that the House of Commons may direct her to call upon said mister Bott who conceived himself to have gauged the very depths of our glorious Constitution How hard it is to make any one understand that the Queen has really nothing to do with it Come Bott draw it mild said Calder Jones whose loyalty was shocked by the utter Manchesterialism of his political friend Not if I know it said mister Bott with something of grandeur in his tone and countenance I never drew it mild yet and I shan t begin now All our political offences against civilization have come from men drawing it mild as you call it Why is it that Englishmen can t read and write as Americans do Why can t they vote as they do even in Imperial France Why are they serfs less free than those whose chains were broken the other day in Russia Why is the Spaniard more happy and the Italian more contented Because men in power have been drawing it mild And mister Bott made an action with his hand as though he were drawing up beer from a patent tap But you can t set aside Her Majesty like that you know said the young Member who had been presented and whose mother s old world notions about the throne still clung to him I should be very sorry said mister Bott I m no republican With all his constitutional love mister Bott did not know what the word republican meant I mean no disrespect to the throne The throne in its place is very well But the power of governing this great nation does not rest with the throne It is contained within the four walls of the House of Commons That is the great truth which all young Members should learn and take to their hearts And you think Planty Pall will become Prime Minister said Calder Jones I haven t said that but there are more unlikely things Among young men I know no man more likely But I certainly think this that if Lord Brock doesn t take him into the Cabinet Lord Brock won t long remain there himself In the meantime the election came on in the Chelsea districts and the whole of the south western part of the metropolis was covered with posters bearing George Vavasor s name Vote for Vavasor and the River Bank That was the cry with which he went to the electors and though it must be presumed that it was understood by some portion of the Chelsea electors it was perfectly unintelligible to the majority of those who read it His special acquaintances and his general enemies called him Viscount Riverbank and he was pestered on all sides by questions as to Father Thames It was mister Scruby who invented the legend and who gave George Vavasor an infinity of trouble by the invention There was a question in those days as to embanking the river from the Houses of Parliament up to the remote desolations of further Pimlico and mister Scruby recommended the coming Member to pledge himself that he would have the work carried on even to Battersea Bridge You must have a subject pleaded mister Scruby No young Member can do anything without a subject And it should be local that is to say if you have anything of a constituency Such a subject as that if it s well worked may save you thousands of pounds thousands of pounds at future elections It won t save me anything at this one I take it But it may secure the seat mister Vavasor and afterwards make you the most popular metropolitan Member in the House that is with your own constituency Only look at the money that would be spent in the districts if that were done It would come to millions sir But it never will be done What matters that and mister Scruby almost became eloquent as he explained the nature of a good parliamentary subject You should work it up so as to be able to discuss it at all points Get the figures by heart and then as nobody else will do so nobody can put you down Of course it won t be done If it were done that would be an end of it and your bread would be taken out of your mouth But you can always promise it at the hustings and can always demand it in the House I ve known men who ve walked into as much as two thousand a year permanent place on the strength of a worse subject than that Vavasor allowed mister Scruby to manage the matter for him and took up the subject of the River Bank Vavasor and the River Bank was carried about by an army of men with iron shoulder straps and huge pasteboard placards six feet high on the top of them You would think as you saw the long rows that the men were being marshalled to their several routes but they always kept together four and twenty at the heels of each other One placard at a time would strike the eye said mister Vavasor counting the expense up to himself There s no doubt of it said mister Scruby in reply One placard will do that if it s big enough but it takes four and twenty to touch the imagination And then sides of houses were covered with that shibboleth Vavasor and the River Bank the same words repeated in columns down the whole sides of houses Vavasor himself declared that he was ashamed to walk among his future constituents so conspicuous had his name become Grimes saw it and was dismayed At first Grimes ridiculed the cry with all his publican s wit Unless he mean to drown hisself in the Reach it s hard to say what he do mean by all that gammon about the River Bank said Grimes as he canvassed for the other Liberal candidate But after a while Grimes was driven to confess that mister Scruby knew what he was about He is a sharp un that he is said Grimes in the inside bar of the Handsome Man and he almost regretted that he had left the leadership of mister Scruby although he knew that on this occasion he would not have gotten his odd money George Vavasor with much labour actually did get up the subject of the River Bank He got himself introduced to men belonging to the Metropolitan Board and went manfully into the matter of pounds shillings and pence He was able even to work himself into an apparent heat when he was told that the thing was out of the question and soon found that he had disciples who really believed in him If he could have brought himself to believe in the thing if he could have been induced himself to care whether Chelsea was to be embanked or no the work would not have been so difficult to him In that case it would have done good to him if to no one else But such belief was beyond him He had gone too far in life to be capable of believing in or of caring for such things He was ambitious of having a hand in the government of his country but he was not capable of caring even for that But he worked He worked hard and spoke vehemently and promised the men of Chelsea Pimlico and Brompton that the path of London westwards had hardly commenced as yet Sloane Street should be the new Cheapside Squares should arise around the Chelsea barracks with sides open to the water for which Belgravia would be deserted There should be palaces there for the rich because the rich spend their riches but no rich man s palace should interfere with the poor man s right to the River Bank Three millions and a half should be spent on the noble street to be constructed the grandest pathway that the world should ever yet have seen three millions and a half to be drawn from to be drawn from anywhere except from Chelsea from the bloated money bags of the City Corporation Vavasor once ventured to declare amidst the encouraging shouts of the men of Chelsea mister Scruby was forced to own that his pupil worked the subject well Upon my word that was uncommon good he said almost patting Vavasor on the back after a speech in which he had vehemently asserted that his ambition to represent the Chelsea districts had all come of his long fixed idea that the glory of future London would be brought about by the embankment of the river at Chelsea But armies of men carrying big boards and public houses open at every corner and placards in which the letters are three feet long cost money Those few modest hundreds which mister Scruby had already received before the work began had been paid on the supposition that the election would not take place till September mister Scruby made an early request a very early request that a further sum of fifteen hundred pounds should be placed in his hands and he did this in a tone which clearly signified that not a man would be sent about through the streets or a poster put upon a wall till this request had been conceded mister Scruby was in possession of two very distinct manners of address In his jovial moods when he was instigating his clients to fight their battles well it might almost be thought that he was doing it really for the love of the thing and some clients so thinking had believed for a few hours that Scruby in his jolly passionate eagerness would pour out his own money like dust trusting implicitly to future days for its return But such clients had soon encountered mister Scruby s other manner and had perceived that they were mistaken The thing had come so suddenly upon George Vavasor that there was not time for him to carry on his further operations through his sister Had he written to Kate let him have written in what language he would she would have first rejoined by a negative and there would have been a correspondence before he had induced her to comply He thought of sending for her by telegram but even in that there would have been too much delay He resolved therefore to make his application to Alice himself and he wrote to her explaining his condition The election had come upon him quite suddenly as she knew he said He wanted two thousand pounds instantly and felt little scruple in asking her for it as he was aware that the old Squire would be only too glad to saddle the property with a legacy to Alice for the repayment of this money though he would not have advanced a shilling himself for the purpose of the election Then he said a word or two as to his prolonged absence from Queen Anne Street He had not been there because he had felt from her manner when they last met that she would for a while prefer to be left free from the unavoidable excitement of such interviews But should he be triumphant in his present contest he should go to her to share his triumph with her or should he fail he should go to her to console him in his failure Within three days he heard from her saying that the money would be at once placed to his credit She sent him also her candid good wishes for success in his enterprise but beyond this her letter said nothing There was no word of love no word of welcome no expression of a desire to see him Vavasor as he perceived all this in the reading of her note felt a triumph in the possession of her money She was ill using him by her coldness and there was comfort in revenge It serves her right he said to himself She should have married me at once when she said she would do so and then it would have been my own When mister Tombe had communicated with John Grey on the matter of this increased demand this demand which mister Tombe began to regard as carrying a love affair rather too far Grey had telegraphed back that Vavasor s demand for money if made through mister John Vavasor was to be honoured to the extent of five thousand pounds mister Tombe raised his eyebrows and reflected that some men were very foolish But John Grey s money matters were of such a nature as to make mister Tombe know that he must do as he was bidden and the money was paid to George Vavasor s account He told Kate nothing of this Why should he trouble himself to do so Indeed at this time he wrote no letters to his sister though she twice sent to him knowing what his exigencies would be and made further tenders of her own money He could not reply to these offers without telling her that money had been forthcoming from that other quarter and so he left them unanswered In the meantime the battle went on gloriously mister Travers the other Liberal candidate spent his money freely or else some other person did so on his behalf When mister Scruby mentioned this last alternative to George Vavasor George cursed his own luck in that he had never found such backers I don t call a man half a Member when he s brought in like that said mister Scruby comforting him He can t do what he likes with his vote He ain t independent You never hear of those fellows getting anything good Pay for the article yourself mister Vavasor and then it s your own That s what I always say mister Grimes went to work strenuously almost fiercely in the opposite interest telling all that he knew and perhaps more than he knew of Vavasor s circumstances He was at work morning noon and night not only in his own neighbourhood but among those men on the river bank of whom he had spoken so much in his interview with Vavasor in Cecil Street The entire Vavasorian army with its placards was entirely upset on more than one occasion and was once absolutely driven ignominiously into the river mud And all this was done under the direction of mister Grimes Vavasor himself was pelted with offal from the sinking tide so that the very name of the River Bank became odious to him He was a man who did not like to have his person touched and when they hustled him he became angry Lord love you mister Vavasor said Scruby that s nothing I ve had a candidate so mauled it was in the Hamlets I think that there wasn t a spot on him that wasn t painted with rotten eggs The smell was something quite awful But I brought him in through it all And mister Scruby at last did as much for George Vavasor as he had done for the hero of the Hamlets At the close of the poll Vavasor s name stood at the head by a considerable majority and Scruby comforted him by saying that Travers certainly wouldn t stand the expense of a petition as the seat was to be held only for a few months And you ve done it very cheap mister Vavasor said Scruby considering that the seat is metropolitan I do say that you have done it cheap Another thousand or twelve hundred will cover everything say thirteen perhaps at the outside And when you shall have fought the battle once again you ll have paid your footing and the fellows will let you in almost for nothing after that A further sum of thirteen hundred pounds was wanted at once and then the whole thing was to be repeated over again in six months time This was not consolatory But nevertheless there was a triumph in the thing itself which George Vavasor was man enough to enjoy It would be something to have sat in the House of Commons though it should only have been for half a session CHAPTER XLV George Vavasor Takes His Seat George Vavasor s feeling of triumph was not unjustifiable It is something to have sat in the House of Commons though it has been but for one session There is on the left hand side of our great national hall on the left hand side as one enters it and opposite to the doors leading to the Law Courts a pair of gilded lamps with a door between them near to which a privileged old dame sells her apples and her oranges solely as I presume for the accommodation of the Members of the House and of the great policeman who guards the pass Between those lamps is the entrance to the House of Commons and none but Members may go that way It is the only gate before which I have ever stood filled with envy sorrowing to think that my steps might never pass under it There are many portals forbidden to me as there are many forbidden to all men and forbidden fruit they say is sweet but my lips have watered after no other fruit but that which grows so high within the sweep of that great policeman s truncheon Ah my male friend and reader who earnest thy bread perhaps as a country vicar or sittest may be at some weary desk in Somerset House or who perhaps rulest the yard behind the Cheapside counter hast thou never stood there and longed hast thou never confessed when standing there that Fate has been unkind to thee in denying thee the one thing that thou hast wanted I have done so and as my slow steps have led me up that more than royal staircase to those passages and halls which require the hallowing breath of centuries to give them the glory in British eyes which they shall one day possess I have told myself in anger and in grief that to die and not to have won that right of way though but for a session not to have passed by the narrow entrance through those lamps is to die and not to have done that which it most becomes an Englishman to have achieved There are doubtless some who come out by that road the loss of whose society is not to be regretted England does not choose her six hundred and fifty four best men One comforts one s self sometimes with remembering that The George Vavasors the Calder Joneses and the Botts are admitted Dishonesty ignorance and vulgarity do not close the gate of that heaven against aspirants and it is a consolation to the ambition of the poor to know that the ambition of the rich can attain that glory by the strength of its riches alone But though England does not send thither none but her best men the best of her Commoners do find their way there It is the highest and most legitimate pride of an Englishman to have the letters M P written after his name No selection from the alphabet no doctorship no fellowship be it of ever so learned or royal a society no knightship not though it be of the Garter confers so fair an honour mister Bott was right when he declared that this country is governed from between the walls of that House though the truth was almost defiled by the lips which uttered it He might have added that from thence flow the waters of the world s progress the fullest fountain of advancing civilization George Vavasor as he went in by the lamps and the apple stall under the guardianship of mister Bott felt all the pride of which I have been speaking He was a man quite capable of feeling such pride as it should be felt capable in certain dreamy moments of looking at the thing with pure and almost noble eyes of understanding the ambition of serving with truth so great a nation as that which fate had made his own Nature I think had so fashioned George Vavasor that he might have been a good and perhaps a great man whereas mister Bott had been born small Vavasor had educated himself to badness with his eyes open He had known what was wrong and had done it having taught himself to think that bad things were best But poor mister Bott had meant to do well and thought that he had done very well indeed He was a tuft hunter and a toady but he did not know that he was doing amiss in seeking to rise by tuft hunting and toadying He was both mean and vain both a bully and a coward and in politics I fear quite unscrupulous in spite of his grand dogmas but he believed that he was progressing in public life by the proper and usual means and was troubled by no idea that he did wrong Vavasor in those dreamy moments of which I have spoken would sometimes feel tempted to cut his throat and put an end to himself because he knew that he had taught himself amiss Again he would sadly ask himself whether it was yet too late always however answering himself that it was too late Even now at this moment as he went in between the lamps and felt much of the honest pride of which I have spoken he told himself that it was too late What could he do now hampered by such a debt as that which he owed to his cousin and with the knowledge that it must be almost indefinitely increased unless he meant to give up this seat in Parliament which had cost him so dearly almost before he had begun to enjoy it But his courage was good and he was able to resolve that he would go on with the business that he had in hand and play out his game to the end He had achieved his seat in the House of Commons and was so far successful Men who had ever been gracious to him were now more gracious than ever and they who had not hitherto treated him with courtesy now began to smile and to be very civil It was no doubt a great thing to have the privilege of that entrance between the lamps mister Bott had the new Member now in hand not because there had been any old friendship between them but mister Bott was on the look out for followers and Vavasor was on the look out for a party A man gets no great thanks for attaching himself to existing power Our friend might have enrolled himself among the general supporters of the Government without attracting much attention He would in such case have been at the bottom of a long list But mister Palliser was a rising man round whom almost without wish of his own a party was forming itself If he came into power as come he must according to mister Bott and many others then they who had acknowledged the new light before its brightness had been declared might expect their reward Vavasor as he passed through the lobby to the door of the House leaning on mister Bott s arm was very silent He had spoken but little since they had left their cab in Palace Yard and was not very well pleased by the garrulity of his companion He was going to sit among the first men of his nation and to take his chance of making himself one of them He believed in his own ability he believed thoroughly in his own courage but he did not believe in his own conduct He feared that he had done feared still more strongly that he would be driven to do that which would shut men s ears against his words and would banish him from high places No man believes in himself who knows himself to be a rascal however great may be his talent or however high his pluck Of course you have heard a debate said mister Bott Yes answered Vavasor who wished to remain silent Many probably No But you have heard debates from the gallery Now you ll hear them from the body of the House and you ll find how very different it is There s no man can know what Parliament is who has never had a seat Indeed no one can thoroughly understand the British Constitution without it I felt very early in life that that should be my line and though it s hard work and no pay I mean to stick to it How do Thompson You know Vavasor He s just returned for the Chelsea Districts and I m taking him up We shan t divide to night shall we Look there s Farringcourt just coming out he s listened to better than any man in the House now but he ll borrow half a crown from you if you ll lend him one How d ye do my lord I hope I have the pleasure of seeing you well and Bott bowed low to a lord who was hurrying through the lobby as fast as his shuffling feet would carry him Of course you know him Vavasor however did not know the lord in question and was obliged to say so I thought you were up to all these things said Bott Taking the peerage generally I am not up to it said Vavasor with a curl on his lip But you ought to have known him That was Viscount Middlesex he has got something on to night about the Irish Church His father is past ninety and he s over sixty We ll go in now but let me give you one bit of advice my dear fellow don t think of speaking this session A Member can do no good at that work till he has learned something of the forms of the House The forms of the House are everything upon my word they are This is mister Vavasor the new Member for the Chelsea Districts Our friend was thus introduced to the doorkeeper who smiled familiarly and seemed to wink his eye Then George Vavasor passed through into the House itself under the wing of mister Bott Vavasor as he walked up the House to the Clerk s table and took the oath and then walked down again felt himself to be almost taken aback by the little notice which was accorded to him It was not that he had expected to create a sensation or that he had for a moment thought on the subject but the thing which he was doing was so great to him that the total indifference of those around him was a surprise to him After he had taken his seat a few men came up by degrees and shook hands with him but it seemed as they did so merely because they were passing that way He was anxious not to sit next to mister Bott but he found himself unable to avoid this contiguity That gentleman stuck to him pertinaciously giving him directions which at the spur of the moment he hardly knew how not to obey So he found himself sitting behind mister Palliser a little to the right while mister Bott occupied the ear of the rising man There was a debate in progress but it seemed to Vavasor as soon as he was able to become critical to be but a dull affair and yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer was on his legs and mister Palliser was watching him as a cat watches a mouse The speaker was full of figures as becomes a Chancellor of the Exchequer and as every new budget of them fell from him mister Bott with audible whispers poured into the ear of his chief certain calculations of his own most of which went to prove that the financier in office was altogether wrong Vavasor thought that he could see that mister Palliser was receiving more of his assistance than was palatable to him He would listen if he did listen without making any sign that he heard and would occasionally shake his head with symptoms of impatience But mister Bott was a man not to be repressed by a trifle When mister Palliser shook his head he became more assiduous than ever and when mister Palliser slightly moved himself to the left he boldly followed him No general debate arose on the subject which the Minister had in hand and when he sat down mister Palliser would not get up though mister Bott counselled him to do so The matter was over for the night and the time had arrived for Lord Middlesex That nobleman got upon his feet with a roll of papers in his hand and was proceeding to address the House on certain matters of church reform with great energy but alas for him and for his feelings before his energy had got itself into full swing the Members were swarming away through the doors like a flock of sheep mister Palliser got up and went and was followed at once by mister Bott who succeeded in getting hold of his arm in the lobby Had not mister Palliser been an even tempered calculating man with a mind and spirit well under his command he must have learned to hate mister Bott before this time Away streamed the Members but still the noble lord went on speaking struggling hard to keep up his fire as though no such exodus were in process There was but little to console him He knew that the papers would not report one sentence in twenty of those he uttered He knew that no one would listen to him willingly He knew that he had worked for weeks and months to get up his facts and he was beginning to know that he had worked in vain As he summoned courage to look round he began to fear that some enemy would count the House and that all would be over He had given heart and soul to this affair His cry was not as Vavasor s cry about the River Bank He believed in his own subject with a great faith thinking that he could make men happier and better and bring them nearer to their God I said that he had worked for weeks and months I might have said that he had been all his life at this work Though he shuffled with his feet when he walked and knocked his words together when he talked he was an earnest man meaning to do well seeking no other reward for his work than the appreciation of those whom he desired to serve But this was never to be his For him there was in store nothing but disappointment And yet he will work on to the end either in this House or in the other labouring wearily without visible wages of any kind and one may say very sadly But when he has been taken to his long rest men will acknowledge that he has done something and there will be left on the minds of those who shall remember him a conviction that he served a good cause diligently and not altogether inefficiently Invisible are his wages yet in some coin are they paid Invisible is the thing he does and yet it is done Let us hope that some sense of this tardy appreciation may soothe his spirit beyond the grave On the present occasion there was nothing to soothe his spirit The Speaker sat urbane and courteous with his eyes turned towards the unfortunate orator but no other ears in the House seemed to listen to him The corps of reporters had dwindled down to two and they used their pens very listlessly taking down here a sentence and there a sentence knowing that their work was naught Vavasor sat it out to the last as it taught him a lesson in those forms of the House which mister Bott had truly told him it would be well that he should learn And at last he did learn the form of a count out Some one from a back seat muttered something which the Speaker understood and that high officer having had his attention called to a fact of which he would never have taken cognizance without such calling did count the House and finding that it contained but twenty three Members he put an end to his own labours and to those of poor Lord Middlesex With what feelings that noble lord must have taken himself home and sat himself down in his study vainly opening a book before his eyes can we not all imagine A man he was with ample means with children who would do honour to his name one whose wife believed in him if no one else would do so a man let us say with a clear conscience to whom all good things had been given But of whom now was he thinking with envy Early on that same day Farringcourt had spoken in the House a man to whom no one would lend a shilling whom the privilege of that House kept out of gaol whose word no man believed who was wifeless childless and unloved But three hundred men had hung listening upon his words When he laughed in his speech they laughed when he was indignant against the Minister they sat breathless as the Spaniard sits in the critical moment of the bull killing Whichever way he turned himself he carried them with him Crowds of Members flocked into the House from libraries and smoking rooms when it was known that this ne er do well was on his legs The Strangers Gallery was filled to overflowing The reporters turned their rapid pages working their fingers wearily till the sweat drops stood upon their brows And as the Premier was attacked with some special impetus of redoubled irony men declared that he would be driven to enrol the speaker among his colleagues in spite of dishonoured bills and evil reports A man who could shake the thunderbolts like that must be paid to shake them on the right side It was of this man and of his success that Lord Middlesex was envious as he sat wretched and respectable in his solitary study mister Bott had left the House with mister Palliser and Vavasor after the count out was able to walk home by himself and think of the position which he had achieved He told himself over and over again that he had done a great thing in obtaining that which he now possessed and he endeavoured to teach himself that the price he was paying for it was not too dear But already there had come upon him something of that feeling that terribly human feeling which deprives every prize that is gained of half its value The mere having it robs the diamond of its purity and mixes vile alloy with the gold Lord Middlesex as he had floundered on into terrible disaster had not been a subject to envy There had been nothing of brilliance in the debate and the Members had loomed no larger than ordinary men at ordinary clubs The very doorkeepers had hardly treated them with respect The great men with whose names the papers are filled had sat silent gloomy and apparently idle As soon as a fair opportunity was given them they escaped out of the House as boys might escape from school Everybody had rejoiced in the break up of the evening except that one poor old lord who had worked so hard Vavasor had spent everything that he had to become a Member of that House and now as he went alone to his lodgings he could not but ask himself whether the thing purchased was worth the purchase money But his courage was still high Though he was gloomy and almost sad he knew that he could trust himself to fight out the battle to the last On the morrow he would go to Queen Anne Street and would demand sympathy there from her who had professed to sympathize with him so strongly in his political desires With her at any rate the glory of his Membership would not be dimmed by any untoward knowledge of the realities She had only seen the play acted from the boxes and to her eyes the dresses would still be of silk velvet and the swords of bright steel CHAPTER XLVI A Love Gift When Alice heard of her cousin s success and understood that he was actually Member of Parliament for the Chelsea Districts she resolved that she would be triumphant She had sacrificed nearly everything to her desire for his success in public life and now that he had achieved the first great step towards that success it would have been madness on her part to decline her share in the ovation If she could not rejoice in that what source of joy would then be left for her She had promised to be his wife and at present she was under the bonds of that promise She had so promised because she had desired to identify her interests with his because she wished to share his risks to assist his struggles and to aid him in his public career She had done all this and he had been successful She strove therefore to be triumphant on his behalf but she knew that she was striving ineffectually She had made a mistake and the days were coming in which she would have to own to herself that she had done so in sackcloth and to repent with ashes But yet she struggled to be triumphant The tidings were first brought to her by her servant and then she at once sat down to write him a word or two of congratulation But she found the task more difficult than she had expected and she gave it up She had written no word to him since the day on which he had left her almost in anger and now she did not know how she was to address him I will wait till he comes she said putting away from her the paper and pens It will be easier to speak than to write But she wrote to Kate and contrived to put some note of triumph into her letter Kate had written to her at length filling her sheet with a loud paean of sincere rejoicing To Kate down in Westmoreland it had seemed that her brother had already done everything He had already tied Fortune to his chariot wheels He had made the great leap and had overcome the only obstacle that Fate had placed in his way In her great joy she almost forgot whence had come the money with which the contest had been won She was not enthusiastic in many things about herself she was never so but now she was elated with an enthusiasm which seemed to know no bounds I am proud she said in her letter to Alice No other thing that he could have done would have made me so proud of him Had the Queen sent for him and made him an earl it would have been as nothing to this When I think that he has forced his way into Parliament without any great friend with nothing to back him but his own wit she had in truth forgotten Alice s money as she wrote that he has achieved his triumph in the metropolis among the most wealthy and most fastidious of the richest city in the world I do feel proud of my brother And Alice I hope that you are proud of your lover Poor girl One cannot but like her pride nay almost love her for it though it was so sorely misplaced It must be remembered that she had known nothing of Messrs Grimes and Scruby and the River Bank and that the means had been wanting to her of learning the principles upon which some metropolitan elections are conducted And Alice I hope that you are proud of your lover He is not my lover Alice said to herself He knows that he is not He understands it though she may not And if not your lover Alice Vavasor what is he then to you And what are you to him if not his love She was beginning to understand that she had put herself in the way of utter destruction that she had walked to the brink of a precipice and that she must now topple over it He is not my lover she said and then she sat silent and moody and it took her hours to get her answer written to Kate On the same afternoon she saw her father for a moment or two So George has got himself returned he said raising his eyebrows Yes he has been successful I m sure you must be glad papa Upon my word I m not He has bought a seat for three months and with whose money has he purchased it Don t let us always speak of money papa When you discuss the value of a thing just purchased you must mention the price before you know whether the purchaser has done well or badly They have let him in for his money because there are only a few months left before the general election Two thousand pounds he has had I believe And if as much more is wanted for the next election he shall have it Very well my dear very well If you choose to make a beggar of yourself I cannot help it Indeed I shall not complain though he should spend all your money if you do not marry him at last In answer to this Alice said nothing On that point her father s wishes were fast growing to be identical with her own I tell you fairly what are my feelings and my wishes he continued Nothing in my opinion would be so deplorable and ruinous as such a marriage You tell me that you have made up your mind to take him and I know well that nothing that I can say will turn you But I believe that when he has spent all your money he will not take you and that thus you will be saved Thinking as I do about him you can hardly expect that I should triumph because he has got himself into Parliament with your money Then he left her and it seemed to Alice that he had been very cruel There had been little she thought nay nothing of a father s loving tenderness in his words to her If he had spoken to her differently might she not even now have confessed everything to him But herein Alice accused him wrongfully Tenderness from him on this subject had we may say become impossible She had made it impossible Nor could he tell her the extent of his wishes without damaging his own cause He could not let her know that all that was done was so done with the view of driving her into John Grey s arms But what words were those for a father to speak to a daughter Had she brought herself to such a state that her own father desired to see her deserted and thrown aside And was it probable that this wish of his should come to pass As to that Alice had already made up her mind She thought that she had made up her mind that she would never become her cousin s wife It needed not her father s wish to accomplish her salvation if her salvation lay in being separated from him On the next morning George went to her The reader will perhaps remember their last interview He had come to her after her letter to him from Westmoreland and had asked her to seal their reconciliation with a kiss but she had refused him He had offered to embrace her and she had shuddered before him fearing his touch telling him by signs much more clear than any words that she felt for him none of the love of a woman Then he had turned from her in anger declaring to her honestly that he was angry Since that he had borrowed her money had made two separate assaults upon her purse and was now come to tell her of the results How was he to address her I beg that it may be also remembered that he was not a man to forget the treatment he had received When he entered the room Alice looked at him at first almost furtively She was afraid of him It must be confessed that she already feared him Had there been in the man anything of lofty principle he might still have made her his slave though I doubt whether he could ever again have forced her to love him She looked at him furtively and perceived that the gash on his face was nearly closed The mark of existing anger was not there He had come to her intending to be gentle if it might be possible He had been careful in his dress as though he wished to try once again if the role of lover might be within his reach Alice was the first to speak George I am so glad that you have succeeded I wish you joy with my whole heart Thanks dearest But before I say another word let me acknowledge my debt Unless you had aided me with your money I could not have succeeded Oh George pray don t speak of that Let me rather speak of it at once and have done If you will think of it you will know that I must speak of it sooner or later He smiled and looked pleasant as he used to do in those Swiss days Well then speak and have done I hope you have trusted me in thus giving me the command of your fortune Oh yes I do believe that you have I need hardly say that I could not have stood for this last election without it and I must try to make you understand that if I had not come forward at this vacancy I should have stood no chance for the next otherwise I should not have been justified in paying so dearly for a seat for one session You can understand that eh Alice Yes I think so Anybody even your father would tell you that though probably he regards my ambition to be a Member of Parliament as a sign of downright madness But I was obliged to stand now if I intended to go on with it as that old lord died so inopportunely Well about the money It is quite upon the cards that I may be forced to ask for another loan when the autumn comes You shall have it George Thanks Alice And now I will tell you what I propose You know that I have been reconciled with a sort of reconciliation to my grandfather Well when the next affair is over I propose to tell him exactly how you and I then stand Do not go into that now George It is enough for you at present to be assured that such assistance as I can give you is at your command I want you to feel the full joy of your success and you will do so more thoroughly if you will banish all these money troubles from your mind for a while They shall at any rate be banished while I am with you said he There let them go And he lifted up his right hand and blew at the tips of his fingers Let them vanish said he It is always well to be rid of such troubles for a time It is well to be rid of them at any time or at all times if only they can be banished without danger But when a man has overused his liver till it will not act for him any longer it is not well for him to resolve that he will forget the weakness of his organ just as he sits down to dinner It was a pretty bit of acting that of Vavasor s when he blew away his cares and upon the whole I do not know that he could have done better But Alice saw through it and he knew that she did so The whole thing was uncomfortable to him except the fact that he had the promise of her further moneys But he did not intend to rest satisfied with this He must extract from her some meed of approbation some show of sympathy some spark of affection true or pretended in order that he might at least affect to be satisfied and be enabled to speak of the future without open embarrassment How could even he take her money from her unless he might presume that he stood with her upon some ground that belonged mutually to them both I have already taken my seat said he Yes I saw that in the newspapers My acquaintance among Members of Parliament is very small but I see that you were introduced as they call it by one of the few men that I do know Is mister Bott a friend of yours No certainly not a friend I may probably have to act with him in public Ah that s just what they said of mister Palliser when they felt ashamed of his having such a man as his guest I think if I were in public life I should try to act with people that I could like Then you dislike mister Bott I do not like him but my feelings about him are not violent He is a vulgar ass said George with no more pretensions to rank himself a gentleman than your footman If I had one But he will get on in Parliament to a certain extent I m afraid I don t quite understand what are the requisites for Parliamentary success or indeed of what it consists Is his ambition do you suppose the same as yours His ambition I take it does not go beyond a desire to be Parliamentary flunkey to a big man with wages if possible but without if the wages are impossible And yours Oh as to mine there are some things Alice that a man does not tell to any one Are there They must be very terrible things The schoolboy when he sits down to make his rhymes dares not say even to his sister that he hopes to rival Milton but he nurses such a hope The preacher when he preaches his sermon does not whisper even to his wife his belief that thousands may perhaps be turned to repentance by the strength of his words but he thinks that the thousand converts are possible And you though you will not say so intend to rival Chatham and to make your thousand converts in politics I like to hear you laugh at me I do indeed It does me good to hear your voice again with some touch of satire in it It brings back the old days the days to which I hope we may soon revert without pain Shall it not be so dearest Her playful manner at once deserted her Why had he made this foolish attempt to be tender I do not know she said gloomily For a few minutes he sat silent fingering some article belonging to her which was lying on the table It was a small steel paper knife of which the handle was cast and gilt a thing of no great value of which the price may have been five shillings He sat with it passing it through his fingers while she went on with her work Who gave you this paper cutter he said suddenly Goodness me why do you ask and especially why do you ask in that way I asked simply because if it is a present to you from any one I will take up something else It was given me by mister Grey He let it drop from his fingers on to the table with a noise and then pushed it from him so that it fell on the other side near to where she sat George she said as she stooped and picked it up your violence is unreasonable pray do not repeat it I did not mean it he said and I beg your pardon I was simply unfortunate in the article I selected And who gave you this In saying which he took up a little ivory foot rule that was folded up so as to bring it within the compass of three inches It so happens that no one gave me that I bought it at a stupid bazaar Then this will do You shall give it me as a present on the renewal of our love It is too poor a thing to give said she speaking still more gloomily than she had done before By no means nothing is too poor if given in that way Anything will do a ribbon a glove a broken sixpence Will you give me something that I may take and taking it may know that your heart is given with it Take the rule if you please she said And about the heart he asked He should have been more of a rascal or less Seeing how very much of a rascal he was already I think it would have been better that he should have been more that he should have been able to content his spirit with the simple acquisition of her money and that he should have been free from all those remains of a finer feeling which made him desire her love also But it was not so It was necessary for his comfort that she should at any rate say she loved him Well Alice and what about the heart he asked again I would so much rather talk about politics George said she The cicatrice began to make itself very visible in his face and the debonair manner was fast vanishing He had fixed his eyes upon her and had inserted his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat Alice that is not quite fair he said I do not mean to be unfair I am not so sure of that I almost think that you do mean it You have told me that you intend to become my wife If after that you wilfully make me miserable will not that be unfair I am not making you miserable certainly not wilfully Did that letter which you wrote to me from Westmoreland mean anything George do not strive to make me think that it meant too much If it did you had better say so at once But Alice though she would have said so had she dared made no answer to this She sat silent turning her face away from his gaze longing that the meeting might be over and feeling that she had lost her own self respect Look here Alice he said I find it very hard to understand you When I look back over all that has passed between us and to that other episode in your life summing it all up with your conduct to me at present I find myself at a loss to read your character I fear I cannot help you in the reading of it When you first loved me for you did love me I understood that well enough There is no young man who in early life does not read with sufficient clearness that sweetest morsel of poetry And when you quarrelled with me judging somewhat harshly of my offences I understood that also for it is the custom of women to be hard in their judgement on such sins When I heard that you had accepted the offer made to you by that gentleman in Cambridgeshire I thought that I understood you still knowing how natural it was that you should seek some cure for your wound I understood it and accused myself not you in that I had driven you to so fatal a remedy Here Alice turned round towards him sharply as though she were going to interrupt him but she said nothing though he paused for her to speak and then he went on And I understood it well when I heard that this cure had been too much for you By heavens yes there was no misunderstanding that I meant no insult to the man when I upset his little toy just now I have not a word to say against him For many women he would make a model husband but you are not one of them And when you discovered this yourself as you did I understood that without difficulty Yes by heavens if ever woman had been driven to a mistake you had been driven to one there Here she looked at him again and met his eyes She looked at him with something of his own fierceness in her face as though she were preparing herself to fight with him but she said nothing at the moment and then he again went on And Alice I understood it also when you again consented to be my wife I thought that I still understood you then I may have been vain to think so but surely it was natural I believed that the old love had come back upon you and again warmed your heart I thought that it had been cold during our separation and I was pleased to think so Was that unnatural Put yourself in my place and say if you would not have thought so I told myself that I understood you then and I told myself that in all that you had done you had acted as a true and good and loving woman I thought of you much and I saw that your conduct as a whole was intelligible and becoming The last word grated on Alice s ears and she showed her anger by the motion of her foot upon the floor Her cousin noted it all but went on as though he had not noted it But now your present behaviour makes all the rest a riddle You have said that you would be my wife declaring thereby that you had forgiven my offences and as I suppose reassuring me of your love and yet you receive me with all imaginable coldness What am I to think of it and in what way would you have me behave to you When last I was here I asked you for a kiss As he said this he looked at her with all his eyes with his mouth just open so as to show the edges of his white teeth with the wound down his face all wide and purple The last word came with a stigmatizing hiss from his lips Though she did not essay to speak he paused again as if he were desirous that she might realize the full purport of such a request I think that in the energy of his speaking a touch of true passion had come upon him that he had forgotten his rascaldom and his need of her money and that he was punishing her with his whole power of his vengeance for the treatment which he had received from her I asked you for a kiss If you are to be my wife you can have no shame in granting me such a request Within the last two months you have told me that you would marry me What am I to think of such a promise if you deny me all customary signs of your affection Then he paused again and she found that the time had come in which she must say something to him Illustration I asked you for a kiss I wonder you cannot understand she said that I have suffered much And is that to be my answer I don t know what answer you want Come Alice do not be untrue you do know what answer I want and you know also whether my wanting it is unreasonable No one ever told me that I was untrue before she said You do know what it is that I desire I desire to learn that the woman who is to be my wife in truth loves me She was standing up and so was he also but still she said nothing He had in his hand the little rule which she had told him that he might take but he held it as though in doubt what he would do with it Well Alice am I to hear anything from you Not now George you are angry and I will not speak to you in your anger Have I not cause to be angry Do you not know that you are treating me badly I know that my head aches and that I am very wretched I wish you would leave me There then is your gift said he and he threw the rule over on to the sofa behind her And there is the trumpery trinket which I had hoped you would have worn for my sake Whereupon something which he had taken from his waistcoat pocket was thrown violently into the fender beneath the fire grate He then walked with quick steps to the door but when his hand was on the handle he turned Alice he said when I am gone try to think honestly of your conduct to me Then he went and she remained still till she heard the front door close behind him When she was sure that he was gone her first movement was made in search of the trinket I fear that this was not dignified on her part but I think that it was natural It was not that she had any desire for the jewel or any curiosity even to see it She would very much have preferred that he should have brought nothing of the kind to her But she had a feminine reluctance that anything of value should be destroyed without a purpose So she took the shovel and poked among the ashes and found the ring which her cousin had thrown there It was a valuable ring bearing a ruby on it between two small diamonds Such at least she became aware had been its bearing but one of the side stones had been knocked out by the violence with which the ring had been flung She searched even for this scorching her face and eyes but in vain Then she made up her mind that the diamond should be lost for ever and that it should go out among the cinders into the huge dust heaps of the metropolis Better that though it was distasteful to her feminine economy than the other alternative of setting the servants to search and thereby telling them something of what had been done When her search was over she placed the ring on the mantelpiece but she knew that it would not do to leave it there so she folded it up carefully in a new sheet of note paper and put it in the drawer of her desk After that she sat herself down at the table to think what she would do but her head was in truth racked with pain and on that occasion she could bring her thoughts to no conclusion CHAPTER XLVII 
1132-138883-0000	train-other-500	mister Cheesacre s Disappointment When missus Greenow was left alone in her lodgings after the little entertainment which she had given to her two lovers she sat herself down to think seriously
none	none	 over her affairs There were three paths open before her She might take mister Cheesacre or she might take Captain Bellfield or she might decide that she would have nothing more to say to either of them 
1132-138883-0001	train-other-500	in the way of courting They were very persistent no doubt but she thought that she would know how to make them understand her
none	none	 if she should really make up her mind 
1132-138883-0002	train-other-500	that she would have neither one nor the other She was going to leave Norwich after Easter and they knew that such was her purpose Something had been said of her returning to Yarmouth in the summer She was a just woman at heart and justice required that each of them should know
1132-138883-0003	train-other-500	what was to be his prospect if she did so return There was a good deal to be said on mister Cheesacre s behalf Mahogany furnitured bedrooms assist one s comfort in this life and heaps of manure though they are not brilliant in romance
1132-138883-0004	train-other-500	are very efficacious in farming missus Greenow by no means despised these things and as for the owner of them though she saw that there was much amiss in his character she thought that his little foibles were of such a nature that she as his wife
1132-138883-0005	train-other-500	or any other woman of spirit might be able to repress them if not to cure them But she had already married for money once as she told herself very plainly on this occasion and she thought that she might now venture on a little love Her marriage for money
none	none	 had been altogether successful The nursing of old Greenow had not been very disagreeable to her nor had it taken longer than she had anticipated She had now got all the reward that she had ever promised herself 
1132-138883-0006	train-other-500	and she really did feel grateful to his memory I almost think that among those plentiful tears some few drops belonged to sincerity She was essentially a happy tempered woman blessed with a good digestion
1132-138883-0007	train-other-500	who looked back upon her past life with contentment and forward to her future life with confidence She would not be greedy she said to herself She did not want more money and therefore she would have none of mister Cheesacre
1132-138883-0008	train-other-500	So far she resolved resolving also that if possible the mahogany furnitured bedrooms should be kept in the family and made over to her niece
none	none	 Kate Vavasor 
1132-138883-0009	train-other-500	But should she marry for love and if so should Captain Bellfield be the man Strange to say his poverty and his scampishness and his lies almost recommended him to her At any rate
1132-138883-0010	train-other-500	it was not of those things that she was afraid She had a woman s true belief in her own power and thought that she could cure them as far as they needed cure As for his stories about Inkerman and his little debts she cared nothing about that
1132-138883-0011	train-other-500	She also had her Inkermans and was quite aware that she made as good use of them as the Captain did of his And as for the debts what was a man to do who hadn t got any money
none	none	 She also had owed for her gloves and corsets 
1132-138883-0012	train-other-500	in the ante Greenow days of her adventures But there was this danger that there might be more behind of which she had never heard Another missus Bellfield was not impossible and what
1132-138883-0013	train-other-500	if instead of being a real captain at all he should be a returned ticket of leave man Such things had happened Her chief security was in this that Cheesacre had known the man for many years
none	none	 and would certainly have told anything against him that he did know Under all these circumstances she could not quite make up her mind either for or against Captain Bellfield Between nine and ten in the evening an hour or so after mister Cheesacre had left her Jeannette 
1132-138883-0014	train-other-500	brought to her some arrowroot with a little sherry in it She usually dined early and it was her habit to take a light repast before she retired for the night Jeannette she said as she stirred the lumps of white sugar in the bowl I m afraid those two gentlemen have quarrelled
1132-138883-0015	train-other-500	Oh laws ma am in course they have How was they to help it Jeannette on these occasions was in the habit of standing beside the chair of her mistress and chatting with her and then if the chatting was much prolonged
1132-138883-0016	train-other-500	she would gradually sink down upon the corner of a chair herself and then the two women would be very comfortable together over the fire Jeannette never forgetting that she was the servant and missus Greenow never forgetting that she was the mistress
1132-138883-0017	train-other-500	And why should they quarrel Jeannette It s very foolish I don t know about being foolish ma am but it s the most natural thing in life
none	none	 If I had two beaux as was a courting me together 
1132-138883-0018	train-other-500	in course I should expect as they would punch each other s heads There s some girls do it a purpose because they like to see it One at a time s what I say
none	none	 You re a young thing Jeannette 
1132-138883-0019	train-other-500	Well ma am yes I am young no doubt But I won t say but what I ve had a beau young as I look But you don t suppose that I want beaux as you call them I don t know ma am as you wants em exactly That s as may be There they are
none	none	 and if they was to blow each other s brains out 
1132-138883-0020	train-other-500	in the gig to night I shouldn t be a bit surprised for one There s nothing won t quiet them at Oileymead to night if brandy and water don t do it
none	none	 As she said this 
1132-138883-0021	train-other-500	Jeannette slipt into her chair and held up her hands in token of the intensity of her fears Why you silly child they re not going home together at all Did not the Captain go away first The Captain did go away first certainly
1132-138883-0022	train-other-500	but I thought perhaps it was to get his pistols and fighting things ready They won t fight Jeannette Gentlemen have given over fighting Have they ma am That makes it much easier for ladies no doubt Perhaps them peaceable ways will come down to such as us in time
1132-138883-0023	train-other-500	It d be a comfort I know to them as are quiet given like me I hate to see men knocking each other s heads about I do So mister Cheesacre and the Captain won t fight ma am Of course they won t you little fool you
none	none	 Dear dear I was so sure we should have had the papers all full of it and perhaps one of them stretched upon his bloody bier 
1132-138883-0024	train-other-500	I wonder which it would have been I always made up my mind that
none	none	 the Captain wouldn t be wounded in any of his wital parts 
1132-138883-0025	train-other-500	unless it was his heart you know ma am But why should they quarrel at all Jeannette It is the most foolish thing Well ma am I don t know about that What else is they to do There s some things as you can cry halves about
none	none	 but there s no crying halves about this About what Jeannette Why about you ma am 
1132-138883-0026	train-other-500	Jeannette I wonder how you can say such things as if I in my position had ever said a word to encourage either of them You know it s not true Jeannette and you shouldn t say so Whereupon missus Greenow put her handkerchief to her eyes
1132-138883-0027	train-other-500	and Jeannette probably in token of contrition put her apron to hers To be sure ma am no lady could have behaved better through it than you have done and goodness knows you have been tried hard Indeed I have Jeannette
1132-138883-0028	train-other-500	And if gentlemen will make fools of themselves it isn t your fault is it ma am But I m so sorry that they should have quarrelled They were such dear friends you know quite all in all to each other When you ve settled which it s to be ma am that ll all come right again
none	none	 seeing that gentlefolks like them have given up fighting as you say 
1132-138883-0029	train-other-500	Then there was a little pause I suppose ma am it won t be mister Cheesacre To be sure he s a man as is uncommonly well to do in the world What s all that to me Jeannette I shall ever regard mister Cheesacre as a dear friend
1132-138883-0030	train-other-500	who has been very good to me at a time of trouble but he ll never be more than that Then it ll be the Captain ma am I m sure for my part I ve always thought the Captain was the nicer gentleman of the two and have always said so He s nothing to me girl
1132-138883-0031	train-other-500	And as for money what s the good of having more than enough If he can bring love you can bring money can t you ma am He s nothing to me girl repeated missus Greenow But he will be said Jeannette plainly asking a question Well I m sure
1132-138883-0032	train-other-500	What s the world come to I wonder when you sit yourself down there and cross examine your mistress in that way Get to bed will you It s near ten o clock I hope I haven t said anything amiss ma am and Jeannette rose from her seat
1132-138883-0033	train-other-500	It s my fault for encouraging you said missus Greenow Go down stairs and finish your work do and then take yourself off to bed
none	none	 Next week we shall have to be packing up 
1132-138883-0034	train-other-500	and there ll be all my things to see to before that So Jeannette got up and departed and after some few further thoughts about Captain Bellfield missus Greenow herself went to her bedroom mister Cheesacre
1132-138883-0035	train-other-500	when he drove back to Oileymead alone from Norwich after dining with missus Greenow had kept himself hot and almost comfortable with passion against Bellfield and his heat if not his comfort had been sustained by his seeing the Captain
1132-138883-0036	train-other-500	with his portmanteau escaping just as he reached his own homestead But early on the following morning his mind reverted to missus Greenow and he remembered with anything but satisfaction some of the hard things which she had said to him
1132-138883-0037	train-other-500	He had made mistakes in his manner of wooing He was quite aware of that now and was determined that they should be rectified for the future She had rebuked him for having said nothing about his love He would instantly mend that fault
1132-138883-0038	train-other-500	And she had bidden him not to be so communicative about his wealth Henceforth he would be dumb on that subject Nevertheless he could not but think that the knowledge of his circumstances which the lady already possessed must be of service to him
none	none	 She can t really like a poor beggarly wretch who hasn t got a shilling he said to himself 
1132-138883-0039	train-other-500	He was very far from feeling that the battle was already lost Her last word to him had been an assurance of her friendship and then why should she have been at so much trouble to tell him the way in which he ought to address her if she were herself indifferent as to his addresses
none	none	 He was no doubt becoming tired of his courtship and heartily wished that the work were over but he was not minded to give it up He therefore prepared himself for another attack and took himself into Norwich without seeking counsel from any one 
1132-138883-0040	train-other-500	He could not trust himself to think that she could really wish to refuse him after all the encouragement she had given him On this occasion he put on no pink shirt or shiny boots being deterred from doing so
none	none	 by a remembrance of Captain Bellfield s ridicule 
1132-138883-0041	train-other-500	but nevertheless he dressed himself with considerable care
none	none	 He clothed his nether person in knickerbockers with tight leathern bright coloured gaiters round his legs being conscious of certain manly graces and symmetrical proportions which might as he thought stand him in good stead And he put on a new shooting coat the buttons on which were elaborate and a wonderful waistcoat worked over with foxes heads He completed his toilet with a round low crowned hat with dog s skin gloves and a cutting whip Thus armed he went forth resolved to conquer or to die as far as death might result from any wound which missus Greenow might be able to give him He waited on this occasion for the coming of no market day indeed the journey into the city was altogether special and he was desirous that she should know that such was the case He drove at a great pace into the inn yard threw his reins to the ostler took just one glass of cherry brandy at the bar and then marched off across the market place to the Close with quiet and decisive steps Is that you Cheesacre said a friendly voice in one of the narrow streets Who expected to see you in Norwich on a Thursday It was Grimsby the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwich a country gentleman and one therefore to whom Cheesacre would generally pay much respect but on this occasion he did not even pull up for an instant or moderate his pace A little bit of private business he said and marched onwards with his head towards the Close I m not going to be afraid of a woman not if I know it he said to himself but nevertheless at a certain pastrycook s of whose shop he had knowledge he pulled up and had another glass of cherry brandy missus Greenow is at home he said to Jeannette not deigning to ask any question Oh yes sir she is at home said Jeannette conscious that some occasion had arrived and in another second he was in the presence of his angel mister Cheesacre whoever expected to see you in Norwich on a Thursday said the lady as she welcomed him using almost the same words as his friend had done in the street Why should not he come into Norwich on a Thursday as well as any one else Did they suppose that he was tied for ever to his ploughs and carts He was minded to conduct himself with a little spirit on this occasion and to improve the opinion which missus Greenow had formed about him On this account he answered her somewhat boldly There s no knowing when I may be in Norwich missus Greenow or when I mayn t I m one of those men of whom nobody knows anything certain except that I pay as I go Then he remembered that he was not to make any more boasts about his money and he endeavoured to cover the error There s one other thing they may all know if they please but we won t say what that is just at present Won t you sit down mister Cheesacre Well thank you I will sit down for a few minutes if you ll let me missus Greenow missus Greenow I m in such a state of mind that I must put an end to it or else I shall be going mad and doing somebody a damage Dear me what has happened to you You re going out shooting presently are you not and missus Greenow looked down at his garments No missus Greenow I m not going out shooting I put on these things because I thought I might take a shot as I came along But I couldn t bring myself to do it and then I wouldn t take them off again What does it matter what a man wears Not in the least so long as he is decent I m sure I m always that missus Greenow Oh dear yes More than that I should say I consider you to be rather gay in your attire I don t pretend to anything of that kind missus Greenow I like to be nice and all that kind of thing There are people who think that because a man farms his own land he must be always in the muck It is the case of course with those who have to make their rent and living out of it Then he remembered that he was again treading on forbidden ground and stopped himself But it don t matter what a man wears if his heart isn t easy within him I don t know why you should speak in that way mister Cheesacre but it s what I have felt every hour since since Greenow left me mister Cheesacre was rather at a loss to know how he should begin This allusion to the departed one did not at all assist him He had so often told the widow that care killed a cat and that a live dog was better than a dead lion and had found so little efficacy in the proverbs that he did not care to revert to them He was aware that some more decided method of proceeding was now required Little hints at love making had been all very well in the earlier days of their acquaintance but there must be something more than little hints before he could hope to bring the matter to a favourable conclusion The widow herself had told him that he ought to talk about love and he had taken two glasses of cherry brandy hoping that they might enable him to do so He had put on a coat with brilliant buttons and new knickerbockers in order that he might be master of the occasion He was resolved to call a spade a spade and to speak boldly of his passion but how was he to begin There was the difficulty He was now seated in a chair and there he remained silent for a minute or two while she smoothed her eyebrows with her handkerchief after her last slight ebullition of grief missus Greenow he exclaimed at last jumping up before her dearest missus Greenow darling missus Greenow will you be my wife There I have said it at last and I mean it Everything that I ve got shall be yours Of course I speak specially of my hand and heart As for love oh Arabella if you only knew me I don t think there s a man in Norfolk better able to love a woman than I am Ever since I first saw you at Yarmouth I ve been in love to that extent that I ve not known what I ve been about If you ll ask them at home they ll tell you that I ve not been able to look after anything about the place not as it should be done I haven t really I don t suppose I ve opened the wages book half a dozen times since last July And has that been my fault mister Cheesacre Upon my word it has I can t move about anywhere without thinking about you My mind s made up I won t stay at Oileymead unless you will come and be its mistress Not stay at Oileymead No indeed I ll let the place and go and travel somewheres What s the use of my hanging on there without the woman of my heart I couldn t do it missus Greenow I couldn t indeed Of course I ve got everything there that money can buy but it s all of no use to a man that s in love Do you know I ve come quite to despise money and stock and all that sort of thing I haven t had my banker s book home these last three months Only think of that now But how can I help you mister Cheesacre Just say one word and the thing ll be done Say you ll be my wife I ll be so good to you I will indeed As for your fortune I don t care that for it I m not like somebody else it s yourself I want You shall be my pet and my poppet and my dearest little duck all the days of your life No mister Cheesacre it cannot be And why not Look here Arabella At these words he rose from his chair and coming immediately before her went down on both knees so close to her as to prevent the possibility of her escaping from him There could be no doubt as to the efficacy of the cherry brandy There he was well down on his knees but he had not got down so low without some little cracking and straining on the part of the gaiters with which his legs were encompassed He in his passion had probably omitted to notice this but missus Greenow who was more cool in her present temperament was painfully aware that he might not be able to rise with ease mister Cheesacre don t make a fool of yourself Get up said she Never till you have told me that you will be mine Then you ll remain there for ever which will be inconvenient I won t have you take hold of my hand mister Cheesacre I tell you to have done Whereupon his grasp upon her hand was released but he made no attempt to rise I never saw a man look so much like a fool in my life said she If you don t get up I ll push you over There don t you hear There s somebody coming But Cheesacre whose senses were less acute than the lady s did not hear I ll never get up said he till you have bid me hope Bid you play the fiddle Get away from my knees at any rate There he ll be in the room now before Illustration mister Cheesacre disturbed Cheesacre now did hear a sound of steps and the door was opened while he made his first futile attempt to get back to a standing position The door was opened and Captain Bellfield entered I beg ten thousand pardons said he but as I did not see Jeannette I ventured to come in May I venture to congratulate my friend Cheesacre on his success In the meantime Cheesacre had risen but he had done so slowly and with evident difficulty I ll trouble you to leave the room Captain Bellfield said he I m particularly engaged with missus Greenow as any gentleman might have seen There wasn t the slightest difficulty in seeing it old fellow said the Captain Shall I wish you joy I ll trouble you to leave the room sir said Cheesacre walking up to him Certainly if missus Greenow will desire me to do so said the Captain Then missus Greenow felt herself called upon to speak Gentlemen I must beg that you will not make my drawing room a place for quarrelling Captain Bellfield lest there should be any misconception I must beg you to understand that the position in which you found mister Cheesacre was one altogether of his own seeking It was not with my consent that he was there I can easily believe that missus Greenow said the Captain Who cares what you believe sir said mister Cheesacre Gentlemen gentlemen this is really unkind Captain Bellfield I think I had better ask you to withdraw By all means said mister Cheesacre As it is absolutely necessary that I should give mister Cheesacre a definite answer after what has occurred Of course said Captain Bellfield preparing to go I ll take another opportunity of paying my respects to you Perhaps I might be allowed to come this evening To this missus Greenow half assented with an uncertain nod and then the Captain went As soon as the door was closed behind his back mister Cheesacre again prepared to throw himself into his former position but to this missus Greenow decidedly objected If he were allowed to go down again there was no knowing what force might be necessary to raise him mister Cheesacre she said let there be an end to this little farce between us Farce said he standing with his hand on his heart and his legs and knickerbockers well displayed It is certainly either a farce or a mistake If the latter and I have been at all to blame I ask your pardon most sincerely But you ll be missus Cheesacre won t you No mister Cheesacre no One husband is enough for any woman and mine lies buried at Birmingham Oh damn it said he in utter disgust at this further reference to mister Greenow The expression at such a moment militated against courtesy but even missus Greenow herself felt that the poor man had been subjected to provocation Let us part friends said she offering him her hand But he turned his back upon her for there was something in his eye that he wanted to hide I believe that he really did love her and that at this moment he would have taken her even though he had learned that her fortune was gone Will you not give me your hand said she in token that there is no anger between us Do think about it again do said he If there s anything you like to have changed I ll change it at once I ll give up Oileymead altogether if you don t like being so near the farm yard I ll give up anything so I will missus Greenow if you only knew how I ve set my heart upon it And now though his back was turned the whimpering of his voice told plainly that tears were in his eyes She was a little touched No woman would feel disposed to marry a man simply because he cried and perhaps few women would be less likely to give way to such tenderness than missus Greenow She understood men and women too well and had seen too much both of the world s rough side and of its smooth side to fall into such a blunder as that but she was touched My friend she said putting her hand upon his arm think no more of it But I can t help thinking of it said he almost blubbering in his earnestness No no no said she still touching him with her hand Why mister Cheesacre how can you bring yourself to care for an old woman like me when so many pretty young ladies would give their eyes to get a kind word from you I don t want any young lady said he There s Charlie Fairstairs who would make as good a wife as any girl I know Psha Charlie Fairstairs indeed The very idea of having such a bride palmed off upon him did something to restore him to his manly courage Or my niece Kate Vavasor who has a nice little fortune of her own and who is as accomplished as she is good looking She s nothing to me missus Greenow That s because you never asked her to be anything If I get her to come back to Yarmouth next summer will you think about it You want a wife and you couldn t do better if you searched all England over It would be so pleasant for us to be such near friends wouldn t it And again she put her hand upon his arm missus Greenow just at present there s only one woman in the world that I can think of And that s my niece And that s yourself I m a broken hearted man I am indeed I didn t ever think I should feel so much about a thing of the kind I didn t really I hardly know what to do with myself but I suppose I d better go back to Oileymead He had become so painfully unconscious of his new coat and his knickerbockers that it was impossible not to pity him I shall always hate the place now he said always That will pass away You d be as happy as a king there if you d take Kate for your queen And what ll you do missus Greenow What shall I do Yes what will you do That is if you marry Kate Why I ll come and stay with you half my time and nurse the children as an old grand aunt should But about Then he hesitated and she asked him of what he was thinking You don t mean to take that man Bellfield do you Come mister Cheesacre that s rank jealousy What right can you have to ask me whether I shall take any man or no man The chances are that I shall remain as I am till I m carried to my grave but I m not going to give any pledge about it to you or to any one You don t know that man missus Greenow you don t indeed I tell it you as your friend Does not it stand to reason when he has got nothing in the world that he must be a beggar It s all very well saying that when a man is courting a lady he shouldn t say much about his money but you won t make me believe that any man will make a good husband who hasn t got a shilling And for lies there s no beating him Why then has he been such a friend of yours Well because I ve been foolish I took up with him just because he looked pleasant I suppose And you want to prevent me from doing the same thing If you were to marry him missus Greenow it s my belief I should do him a mischief it is really I don t think I could stand it a mean skulking beggar I suppose I d better go now Certainly if that s the way you choose to talk about my friends Friends indeed Well I won t say any more at present I suppose if I was to talk for ever it wouldn t be any good Come and talk to Kate Vavasor for ever mister Cheesacre To this he made no reply but went forth from the house and got his gig and drove himself home to Oileymead thinking of his disappointment with all the bitterness of a young lover I didn t ever think I should ever care so much about anything he said as he took himself up to bed that night That evening Captain Bellfield did call in the Close as he had said he would do but he was not admitted Her mistress was very bad with a headache Jeannette said CHAPTER XLVIII Preparations for Lady Monk s Party Early in April the Easter recess being all over Lady Monk gave a grand party in London Lady Monk s town house was in Gloucester Square It was a large mansion and Lady Monk s parties in London were known to be very great affairs She usually gave two or three in the season and spent a large portion of her time and energy in so arranging matters that her parties should be successful As this was her special line in life a failure would have been very distressing to her and we may also say very disgraceful taking into consideration as we should do in forming our judgement on the subject the very large sums of Sir Cosmo s money which she spent in this way But she seldom did fail She knew how to select her days so as not to fall foul of other events It seldom happened that people could not come to her because of a division which occupied all the Members of Parliament or that they were drawn away by the superior magnitude of some other attraction in the world of fashion This giving of parties was her business and she had learned it thoroughly She worked at it harder than most men work at their trades and let us hope that the profits were consolatory It was generally acknowledged to be the proper thing to go to Lady Monk s parties There were certain people who were asked and who went as a matter of course people who were by no means on intimate terms with Lady Monk or with Sir Cosmo but they were people to have whom was the proper thing and they were people who understood that to go to Lady Monk s was the proper thing for them The Duchess of saint Bungay was always there though she hated Lady Monk and Lady Monk always abused her but a card was sent to the Duchess in the same way as the Lord Mayor invites a Cabinet Minister to dinner even though the one man might believe the other to be a thief And missus Conway Sparkes was generally there she went everywhere Lady Monk did not at all know why missus Conway Sparkes was so favoured by the world but there was the fact and she bowed to it Then there were another set the members of which were or were not invited according to circumstances at the time and these were the people who were probably the most legitimate recipients of Lady Monk s hospitality Old family friends of her husband were among the number Let the Tuftons come in April and perhaps again in May then they will not feel their exclusion from that seventh heaven of glory the great culminating crush in July Scores of young ladies who really loved parties belonged to this set The mothers and aunts knew Lady Monk s sisters and cousins They accepted so much of Lady Monk s good things as she vouchsafed them and were thankful Then there was another lot which generally became especially on that great July occasion the most numerous of the three It comprised all those who made strong interest to obtain admittance within her ladyship s house who struggled and fought almost with tooth and nail to get invitations Against these people Lady Monk carried on an internecine war Had she not done so she would have been swamped by them and her success would have been at an end but yet she never dreamed of shutting her doors against them altogether or of saying boldly that none such should hamper her staircases She knew that she must yield but her effort was made to yield to as few as might be possible When she was first told by her factotum in these operations that mister Bott wanted to come she positively declined to have him When it was afterwards intimated to her that the Duchess of saint Bungay had made a point of it she sneered at the Duchess and did not even then yield But when at last it was brought home to her understanding that mister Palliser wished it and that mister Palliser probably would not come himself unless his wishes were gratified she gave way She was especially anxious that Lady Glencora should come to her gathering and she knew that Lady Glencora could not be had without mister Palliser It was very much desired by her that Lady Glencora should be there Burgo said she to her nephew one morning look here Burgo was at the time staying with his aunt in Gloucester Square much to the annoyance of Sir Cosmo who had become heartily tired of his nephew The aunt and the nephew had been closeted together more than once lately and perhaps they understood each other better now than they had done down at Monkshade The aunt had handed a little note to Burgo which he read and then threw back to her You see that she is not afraid of coming said Lady Monk I suppose she doesn t think much about it said Burgo If that s what you really believe you d better give it up Nothing on earth would justify such a step on your part except a thorough conviction that she is attached to you Burgo looked at the fireplace almost savagely and his aunt looked at him very keenly Well she said if there s to be an end of it let there be an end of it I think I d better hang myself he said Burgo I will not have you here if you talk to me in that way I am trying to help you once again but if you look like that and talk like that I will give it up I think you d better give it up Are you becoming cowardly at last With all your faults I never expected that of you No I am not a coward I d go out and fight him at two paces distance with the greatest pleasure in the world You know that s nonsense Burgo It s downright braggadocio Men do not fight now nor at any time would a man be called upon to fight because you simply wanted to take his wife from him If you had done it indeed How am I to do it I d do it to morrow if it depended on me No one can say that I m afraid of anybody or of anything I suppose something in the matter depends on her I believe she loves me if you mean that Look here Burgo and the considerate aunt gave to the impoverished and ruined nephew such counsel as she in accordance with her lights was enabled to bestow I think you were much wronged in that matter After what had passed I thought that you had a right to claim Lady Glencora as your wife mister Palliser in my mind behaved very wrongly in stepping in between you and you and such a fortune as hers in that way He cannot expect that his wife should have any affection for him There is nobody alive who has a greater horror of anything improper in married women than I have I have always shown it When Lady Madeline Madtop left her husband I would never allow her to come inside my doors again though I have no doubt he ill used her dreadfully and there was nothing ever proved between her and Colonel Graham One can t be too particular in such matters But here if you if you can succeed you know I shall always regard the Palliser episode in Lady Glencora s life as a tragical accident I shall indeed Poor dear It was done exactly as they make nuns of girls in Roman Catholic countries and as I should think no harm of helping a nun out of her convent so I should think no harm of helping her now If you are to say anything to her I think you might have an opportunity at the party Burgo was still looking at the fireplace and he sat on looking and still looking but he said nothing You can think of what I have said Burgo continued his aunt meaning that he should get up and go But he did not go Have you anything more that you wish to say to me she asked I ve got no money said Burgo still looking at the fireplace Lady Glencora s property was worth not less than fifty thousand a year He was a young man ambitious of obtaining that almost incredible amount of wealth and who once had nearly reached it by means of her love His present obstacle consisted in his want of a twenty pound note I ve got no money The words were growled out rather than spoken and his eyes were never turned even for a moment towards his aunt s face You ve never got any money said she speaking almost with passion How can I help it I can t make money If I had a couple of hundred pounds so that I could take her I believe that she would go with me It should not be my fault if she did not It would have been all right if she had come to Monkshade I ve got no money for you Burgo I have not five pounds belonging to me But you ve got What said Lady Monk interrupting him sharply Would Cosmo lend it me said he hesitating to go on with that suggestion which he had been about to make The Cosmo of whom he spoke was not his uncle but his cousin No eloquence could have induced his uncle Sir Cosmo to lend him another shilling But the son of the house was a man rich with his own wealth and Burgo had not taxed him for some years I do not know said Lady Monk I never see him Probably not It is hard said Burgo Fancy that a man should be ruined for two hundred pounds just at such a moment of his life as this He was a man bold by nature and he did make his proposition You have jewels aunt could you not raise it for me I would redeem them with the very first money that I got Lady Monk rose in a passion when the suggestion was first made but before the interview was over she had promised that she would endeavour to do something in the way of raising money for him yet once again He was her favourite nephew and the same almost to her as a child of her own With one of her own children indeed she had quarrelled and of the other a married daughter she rarely saw much Such love as she had to give she gave to Burgo and she promised him the money though she knew that she must raise it by some villanous falsehood to her husband On the same morning Lady Glencora went to Queen Anne Street with the purpose of inducing Alice to go to Lady Monk s party but Alice would not accede to the proposition though Lady Glencora pressed it with all her eloquence I don t know her said Alice My dear said Lady Glencora that s absurd Half the people there won t know her But they know her set or know her friends or at any rate will meet their own friends at her house I should only bother you and should not in the least gratify myself The fact is everybody will go who can and I should have no sort of trouble in getting a card for you Indeed I should simply write a note and say I meant to bring you Pray don t do any such thing for I certainly shall not go I can t conceive why you should wish it mister Fitzgerald will be there said Lady Glencora altering her voice altogether and speaking in that low tone with which she used to win Alice s heart down at Matching She was sitting close over the fire leaning low holding up her little hands as a screen to her face and looking at her companion earnestly I m sure that he will be there though nobody has told me That may be a reason for your staying away said Alice slowly but hardly a reason for my going with you Lady Glencora would not condescend to tell her friend in so many words that she wanted her protection She could not bring herself to say that though she wished it to be understood Ah I thought you would have gone said she It would be contrary to all my habits said Alice I never go to people s houses when I don t know them It s a kind of society which I don t like Pray do not ask me Oh very well If it must be so I won t press it Lady Glencora had moved the position of one of her hands so as to get it to her pocket and there had grasped a letter which she still carried but when Alice said those last cold words Pray do not ask me she released the grasp and left the letter where it was I suppose he won t bite me at any rate she said and she assumed that look of childish drollery which she would sometimes put on almost with a grimace but still with so much prettiness that no one who saw her would regret it He certainly can t bite you if you will not let him Do you know Alice though they all say that Plantagenet is one of the wisest men in London I sometimes think that he is one of the greatest fools Soon after we came to town I told him that we had better not go to that woman s house Of course he understood me He simply said that he wished that I should do so I hate anything out of the way he said There can be no reason why my wife should not go to Lady Monk s house as well as to any other There was an end of it you know as far as anything I could do was concerned But there wasn t an end of it with him He insists that I shall go but he sends my duenna with me Dear missus Marsham is to be there She ll do you no harm I suppose I m not so sure of that Alice In the first place one doesn t like to be followed everywhere by a policeman even though one isn t going to pick a pocket And then the devil is so strong within me that I should like to dodge the policeman I can fancy a woman being driven to do wrong simply by a desire to show her policeman that she can be too many for him Glencora you make me so wretched when you talk like that Will you go with me then so that I may have a policeman of my own choosing He asked me if I would mind taking missus Marsham with me in my carriage So I up and spoke very boldly like the proud young porter and told him I would not and when he asked why not I said that I preferred taking a friend of my own a young friend I said and I then named you or my cousin Lady Jane I told him I should bring one or the other And was he angry No he took it very quietly saying something in his calm way about hoping that I should get over a prejudice against one of his earliest and dearest friends He twits at me because I don t understand Parliament and the British Constitution but I know more of them than he does about a woman You are quite sure you won t go then Alice hesitated a moment Do said Lady Glencora and there was an amount of persuasion in her accent which should I think have overcome her cousin s scruples It is against the whole tenor of my life s way she said And Glencora I am not happy myself I am not fit for parties I sometimes think that I shall never go into society again That s nonsense you know I suppose it is but I cannot go now I would if I really thought Oh very well said Lady Glencora interrupting her I suppose I shall get through it If he asks me to dance I shall stand up with him just as though I had never seen him before Then she remembered the letter in her pocket remembered that at this moment she bore about with her a written proposition from this man to go off with him and leave her husband s house She had intended to show it to Alice on this occasion but as Alice had refused her request she was glad that she had not done so You ll come to me the morning after said Lady Glencora as she went This Alice promised to do and then she was left alone Alice regretted regretted deeply that she had not consented to go with her cousin After all of what importance had been her objection when compared with the cause for which her presence had been desired Doubtless she would have been uncomfortable at Lady Monk s house but could she not have borne some hour or two of discomfort on her friend s behalf But in truth it was only after Lady Glencora had left her that she began to understand the subject fully and to feel that she might possibly have been of service in a great danger But it was too late now Then she strove to comfort herself with the reflection that a casual meeting at an evening party in London could not be perilous in the same degree as a prolonged sojourn together in a country house CHAPTER XLIX How Lady Glencora Went to Lady Monk s Party Lady Monk s house in Gloucester Square was admirably well adapted for the giving of parties It was a large house and seemed to the eyes of guests to be much larger than it was The hall was spacious and the stairs went up in the centre facing you as you entered the inner hall Round the top of the stairs there was a broad gallery with an ornamented railing and from this opened the doors into the three reception rooms There were two on the right the larger of which looked out backwards and these two were connected by an archway as though made for folding doors but the doors I believe never were there Fronting the top of the staircase there was a smaller room looking out backwards very prettily furnished and much used by Lady Monk when alone It was here that Burgo had held that conference with his aunt of which mention has been made Below stairs there was the great dining room on which on these occasions a huge buffet was erected for refreshments what I may call a masculine buffet as it was attended by butlers and men in livery and there was a smaller room looking out into the square in which there was a feminine battery for the dispensing of tea and such like smaller good things and from which female aid could be attained for the arrangement or mending of dresses in a further sanctum within it For such purposes as that now on foot the house was most commodious Lady Monk on these occasions was moved by a noble ambition to do something different from that done by her neighbours in similar circumstances and therefore she never came forward to receive her guests She ensconced herself early in the evening in that room at the head of the stairs and there they who chose to see her made their way up to her and spoke their little speeches They who thought her to be a great woman and many people did think her to be great were wont to declare that she never forgot those who did come or those who did not And even they who desired to describe her as little for even Lady Monk had enemies would hint that though she never came out of the room she would rise from her chair and make a step towards the door whenever any name very high in fashionable life greeted her ears So that a mighty Cabinet Minister or a duchess in great repute or any special wonder of the season could not fail of entering her precincts and being seen there for a few moments It would of course happen that the doorway of her chamber would become blocked but there were precautions taken to avoid this inconvenience as far as possible and one man in livery was employed to go backwards and forwards between his mistress and the outer world so as to keep the thread of a passage open But though Lady Monk was in this way enabled to rest herself during her labours there was much in her night s work which was not altogether exhilarating Ladies would come into her small room and sit there by the hour with whom she had not the slightest wish to hold conversation The Duchess of saint Bungay would always be there so that there was a special seat in one corner of the room which was called the Duchess stool I shouldn t care a straw about her Lady Monk had been heard to complain if she would talk to anybody But nobody will talk to her and then she listens to everything There had been another word or two between Burgo Fitzgerald and his aunt before the evening came a word or two in the speaking of which she had found some difficulty She was prepared with the money with that two hundred pounds for which he had asked obtained with what wiles and lies and baseness of subterfuge I need not stop here to describe But she was by no means willing to give this over into her nephew s hands without security She was willing to advance him this money she had been willing even to go through unusual dirt to get it for him but she was desirous that he should have it only for a certain purpose How could she bind him down to spend it as she would have it spent Could she undertake to hand it to him as soon as Lady Glencora should be in his power Even though she could have brought herself to say as much and I think she might also have done so after what she had said she could not have carried out such a plan In that case the want would be instant and the action must be rapid She therefore had no alternative but to entrust him with the bank notes at once Burgo she said if I find that you deceive me now I will never trust you again All right said Burgo as he barely counted the money before he thrust it into his breast pocket It is lent to you for a certain purpose should you happen to want it she said solemnly I do happen to want it very much he answered She did not dare to say more but as her nephew turned away from her with a step that was quite light in its gaiety she almost felt that she was already cozened Let Burgo s troubles be as heavy as they might be there was something to him ecstatic in the touch of ready money which always cured them for the moment Illustration All right said Burgo as he thrust the money into his breast pocket On the morning of Lady Monk s party a few very uncomfortable words passed between mister Palliser and his wife Your cousin is not going then said he Alice is not going Then you can give missus Marsham a seat in your carriage Impossible Plantagenet I thought I had told you that I had promised my cousin Jane But you can take three Indeed I can t unless you would like me to sit out with the coachman There was something in this a tone of loudness a touch of what he called to himself vulgarity which made him very angry So he turned away from her and looked as black as a thundercloud You must know Plantagenet she went on that it is impossible for three women dressed to go out in one carriage I am sure you wouldn t like to see me afterwards if I had been one of them You need not have said anything to Lady Jane when Miss Vavasor refused I had asked you before that And I had told you that I liked going with young women and not with old ones That s the long and the short of it Glencora I wish you would not use such expressions What not the long and the short It s good English Quite as good as mister Bott s when he said in the House the other night that the Government kept their accounts in a higgledy piggledy way You see I have been studying the debates and you shouldn t be angry with me I am not angry with you You speak like a child to say so Then I suppose the carriage must go for missus Marsham after it has taken you It shall go before Jane will not be in a hurry and I am sure I shall not She will think you very uncivil that is all I told her that she could go with you when I heard that Miss Vavasor was not to be there Then Plantagenet you shouldn t have told her so and that s the long but I mustn t say that The truth is this if you give me any orders I ll obey them as far as I can If I can t I ll say so But if I m left to go by my own judgement it s not fair that I should be scolded afterwards I have never scolded you Yes you have You have told me that I was uncivil I said that she would think you so Then if it s only what she thinks I don t care two straws about it She may have the carriage to herself if she likes but she shan t have me in it not unless I m ordered to go I don t like her and I won t pretend to like her My belief is that she follows me about to tell you if she thinks that I do wrong Glencora And that odious baboon with the red bristles does the same thing only he goes to her because he doesn t dare to go to you Plantagenet Palliser was struck wild with dismay He understood well who it was whom his wife intended to describe but that she should have spoken of any man as a baboon with red bristles was terrible to his mind He was beginning to think that he hardly knew how to manage his wife And the picture she had drawn was very distressing to him She had no mother neither had he and he had wished that missus Marsham should give to her some of that matronly assistance and guidance which a mother does give to her young married daughter It was true too as he knew that a word or two as to some socially domestic matters had filtered through to him from mister Bott down at Matching Priory but only in such a way as to enable him to see what counsel it was needful that he should give As for espionage over his wife no man could despise it more than he did No man would be less willing to resort to it And now his wife was accusing him of keeping spies both male and female Glencora he said again and then he stopped not knowing what to say to her Well my dear it s better you should know at once what I feel about it I don t suppose I m very good indeed I dare say I m bad enough but these people about me won t make me any better The duennas don t make the Spanish ladies worth much Duennas After that Lady Glencora sat herself down and mister Palliser stood for some moments looking at her It ended in his making her a long speech in which he said a good deal of his own justice and forbearance and something also of her frivolity and childishness He told her that his only complaint of her was that she was too young and as he did so she made a little grimace not to him but to herself as though saying to herself that that was all he knew about it He did not notice it or if he did his notice did not stop his eloquence He assured her that he was far from keeping any watch over her and declared that she had altogether mistaken missus Marsham s character Then there was another little grimace There s somebody has mistaken it worse than I have the grimace said Of the bristly baboon he condescended to say nothing and he wound up by giving her a cold kiss and saying that he would meet her at Lady Monk s When the evening came or rather the night the carriage went first for missus Marsham and having deposited her at Lady Monk s went back to Park Lane for Lady Glencora Then she had herself driven to saint James s Square to pick up Lady Jane so that altogether the coachman and horses did not have a good time of it I wish he d keep a separate carriage for her Lady Glencora said to her cousin Jane having perceived that her servants were not in a good humour That would be expensive said Lady Jane Yes it would be expensive said Lady Glencora She would not condescend to make any remark as to the non importance of such expense to a man so wealthy as her husband knowing that his wealth was in fact hers Never to him or to any other not even to herself had she hinted that much was due to her because she had been magnificent as an heiress There were many things about this woman that were not altogether what a husband might wish She was not softly delicate in all her ways but in disposition and temper she was altogether generous I do not know that she was at all points a lady but had Fate so willed it she would have been a thorough gentleman missus Marsham was by no means satisfied with the way in which she was treated She would not have cared to go at all to Lady Monk s party had she supposed that she would have to make her entry there alone With Lady Glencora she would have seemed to receive some of that homage which would certainly have been paid to her companion The carriage called moreover before she was fully ready and the footman as he stood at the door to hand her in had been very sulky She understood it all She knew that Lady Glencora had positively declined her companionship and if she resolved to be revenged such resolution on her part was only natural When she reached Lady Monk s house she had to make her way up stairs all alone The servants called her missus Marsh and under that name she got passed on into the front drawing room There she sat down not having seen Lady Monk and meditated over her injuries It was past eleven before Lady Glencora arrived and Burgo Fitzgerald had begun to think that his evil stars intended that he should never see her again He had been wickedly baulked at Monkshade by what influence he had never yet ascertained and now he thought that the same influence must be at work to keep her again away from his aunt s house He had settled in his mind no accurate plan of a campaign he had in his thoughts no fixed arrangement by which he might do the thing which he meditated He had attempted to make some such plan but as is the case with all men to whom thinking is an unusual operation concluded at last that he had better leave it to the course of events It was however obviously necessary that he should see Lady Glencora before the course of events could be made to do anything for him He had written to her making his proposition in bold terms and he felt that if she were utterly decided against him her anger at his suggestion or at least her refusal would have been made known to him in some way Silence did not absolutely give consent but it seemed to show that consent was not impossible From ten o clock to past eleven he stood about on the staircase of his aunt s house waiting for the name which he was desirous of hearing and which he almost feared to hear Men spoke to him and women also but he hardly answered His aunt once called him into her room and with a cautionary frown on her brow bade him go dance Don t look so dreadfully preoccupied she said to him in a whisper But he shook his head at her almost savagely and went away and did not dance Dance How was he to dance with such an enterprise as that upon his mind Even to Burgo Fitzgerald the task of running away with another man s wife had in it something which prevented dancing Lady Monk was older and was able to regulate her feelings with more exactness But Burgo though he could not dance went down into the dining room and drank He took a large beer glass full of champagne and soon after that another The drink did not flush his cheeks or make his forehead red or bring out the sweat drops on his brow as it does with some men but it added a peculiar brightness to his blue eyes It was by the light of his eyes that men knew when Burgo had been drinking At last while he was still in the supper room he heard Lady Glencora s name announced He had already seen mister Palliser come in and make his way up stairs some quarter of an hour before but as to that he was indifferent He had known that the husband was to be there When the long expected name reached his ears his heart seemed to jump within him What on the spur of the moment should he do As he had resolved that he would be doing that something should be done let it be what it might he hurried to the dining room door and was just in time to see and be seen as Lady Glencora was passing up the stairs She was just above him as he got himself out into the hall so that he could not absolutely greet her with his hand but he looked up at her and caught her eye He looked up and moved his hand to her in token of salutation She looked down at him and the expression of her face altered visibly as her glance met his She barely bowed to him with her eyes rather than with her head but he flattered himself that there was at any rate no anger in her countenance How beautiful he was as he gazed up at her leaning against the wall as he stood and watching her as she made her slow way up the stairs She felt that his eyes were on her and where the stairs turned she could not restrain herself from one other glance As her eyes fell on his again his mouth opened and she fancied that she could hear the faint sigh that he uttered It was a glorious mouth such as the old sculptors gave to their marble gods And Burgo if it was so that he had not heart enough to love truly could look as though he loved It was not in him deceit or what men call acting The expression came to him naturally though it expressed so much more than there was within as strong words come to some men who have no knowledge that they are speaking strongly At this moment Burgo Fitzgerald looked as though it were possible that he might die of love Lady Glencora was met at the top of the stairs by Lady Monk who came out to her almost into the gallery with her sweetest smile so that the newly arrived guest of course entered into the small room There sat the Duchess of saint Bungay on her stool in the corner and there next to the Duchess but at the moment engaged in no conversation stood mister Bott There was another lady there who stood very high in the world and whom Lady Monk was very glad to welcome the young Marchioness of Hartletop She was in slight mourning for her father in law the late Marquis had died no t yet quite six months since Very beautiful she was and one whose presence at their houses ladies and gentlemen prized alike She never said silly things like the Duchess never was troublesome as to people s conduct to her was always gracious yet was never led away into intimacies was without peer the best dressed woman in London and yet gave herself no airs and then she was so exquisitely beautiful Her smile was loveliness itself There were indeed people who said that it meant nothing but then what should the smile of a young married woman mean She had not been born in the purple like Lady Glencora her father being a country clergyman who had never reached a higher grade than that of an archdeacon but she knew the ways of high life and what an exigeant husband would demand of her much better than poor Glencora She would have spoken of no man as a baboon with a bristly beard She never talked of the long and the short of it She did not wander out o nights in winter among the ruins She made no fast friendship with ladies whom her lord did not like She had once indeed been approached by a lover since she had been married mister Palliser himself having been the offender but she had turned the affair to infinite credit and profit had gained her husband s closest confidence by telling him of it all had yet not brought on any hostile collision and had even dismissed her lover without annoying him But then Lady Hartletop was a miracle of a woman Lady Glencora was no miracle Though born in the purple she was made of ordinary flesh and blood and as she entered Lady Monk s little room hardly knew how to recover herself sufficiently for the purposes of ordinary conversation Dear Lady Glencora do come in for a moment to my den We were so sorry not to have you at Monkshade We heard such terrible things about your health Lady Glencora said that it was only a cold a bad cold Oh yes we heard something about moonlight and ruins So like you you know I love that sort of thing above all people but it doesn t do does it Circumstances are so exacting I think you know Lady Hartletop and there s the Duchess of saint Bungay mister Palliser was here five minutes since Then Lady Monk was obliged to get to her door again and Lady Glencora found herself standing close to Lady Hartletop We saw mister Palliser just pass through said Lady Hartletop who was able to meet and speak of the man who had dared to approach her with his love without the slightest nervousness Yes he said he should be here said Lady Glencora There s a great crowd said Lady Hartletop I didn t think London was so full Very great said Lady Glencora and then they had said to each other all that society required Lady Glencora as we know could talk with imprudent vehemence by the hour together if she liked her companion but the other lady seldom committed herself by more words than she had uttered now unless it was to her tirewoman How very well you are looking said the Duchess And I heard you had been so ill Of that midnight escapade among the ruins it was fated that Lady Glencora should never hear the last How d ye do Lady Glencowrer sounded in her ear and there was a great red paw stuck out for her to take But after what had passed between Lady Glencora and her husband to day about mister Bott she was determined that she would not take mister Bott s hand How are you mister Bott she said I think I ll look for mister Palliser in the back room Dear Lady Glencora whispered the Duchess in an ecstasy of agony Lady Glencora turned and bowed her head to her stout friend Do let me go away with you There s that woman missus Conway Sparkes coming and you know how I hate her She had nothing to do but to take the Duchess under her wing and they passed into the large room together It is I think more than probable that missus Conway Sparkes had been brought in by Lady Monk as the only way of removing the Duchess from her stool Just within the dancing room Lady Glencora found her husband standing in a corner looking as though he were making calculations I m going away said he coming up to her I only just came because I said I would Shall you be late Oh no I suppose not Shall you dance Perhaps once just to show that I m not an old woman Don t heat yourself Good bye Then he went and in the crush of the doorway he passed Burgo Fitzgerald whose eye was intently fixed upon his wife He looked at Burgo and some thought of that young man s former hopes flashed across his mind some remembrance too of a caution that had been whispered to him but for no moment did a suspicion come to him that he ought to stop and watch by his wife CHAPTER L How Lady Glencora Came Back from Lady Monk s Party Burgo Fitzgerald remained for a minute or two leaning where we last saw him against the dining room wall at the bottom of the staircase and as he did so some thoughts that were almost solemn passed across his mind This thing that he was about to do or to attempt was it in itself a good thing and would it be good for her whom he pretended to love What would be her future if she consented now to go with him and to divide herself from her husband Of his own future he thought not at all He had never done so Even when he had first found himself attracted by the reputation of her wealth he cannot be said to have looked forward in any prudential way to coming years His desire to put himself in possession of so magnificent a fortune had simply prompted him as he might have been prompted to play for a high stake at a gaming table But now during these moments he did think a little of her Would she be happy simply because he loved her when all women should cease to acknowledge her when men would regard her as one degraded and dishonoured when society should be closed against her when she would be driven to live loudly because the softness and graces of quiet life would be denied to her Burgo knew well what must be the nature of such a woman s life in such circumstances Would Glencora be happy with him while living such a life simply because he loved her And under such circumstances was it likely that he would continue to love her Did he not know himself to be the most inconstant of men and the least trustworthy Leaning thus against the wall at the bottom of the stairs he did ask himself all these questions with something of true feeling about his heart and almost persuaded himself that he had better take his hat and wander forth anywhere into the streets It mattered little what might become of himself If he could drink himself out of the world it might be an end of things that would be not altogether undesirable But then the remembrance of his aunt s two hundred pounds came upon him which money he even now had about him on his person and a certain idea of honour told him that he was bound to do that for which the money had been given to him As to telling his aunt that he had changed his mind and therefore refunding the money no such thought as that was possible to him To give back two hundred pounds entire two hundred pounds which were already within his clutches was not within the compass of Burgo s generosity Remembering the cash he told himself that hesitation was no longer possible to him So he gathered himself up stretched his hands over his head uttered a sigh that was audible to all around him and took himself up stairs He looked in at his aunt s room and then he saw her and was seen by her Well Burgo she said with her sweetest smile have you been dancing He turned away from her without answering her muttering something between his teeth about a cold blooded Jezebel which if she had heard it would have made her think him the most ungrateful of men But she did not hear him and smiled still as he went away saying something to missus Conway Sparkes as to the great change for the better which had taken place in her nephew s conduct There s no knowing who may not reform said missus Sparkes with an emphasis which seemed to Lady Monk to be almost uncourteous Burgo made his way first into the front room and then into the larger room where the dancing was in progress and there he saw Lady Glencora standing up in a quadrille with the Marquis of Hartletop Lord Hartletop was a man not much more given to conversation than his wife and Lady Glencora seemed to go through her work with very little gratification either in the dancing or in the society of her partner She was simply standing up to dance because as she had told mister Palliser ladies of her age generally do stand up on such occasions Burgo watched her as she crossed and re crossed the room and at last she was aware of his presence It made no change in her except that she became even somewhat less animated than she had been before She would not seem to see him nor would she allow herself to be driven into a pretence of a conversation with her partner because he was there I will go up to her at once and ask her to waltz Burgo said to himself as soon as the last figure of the quadrille was in action Why should I not ask her as well as any other woman Then the music ceased and after a minute s interval Lord Hartletop took away his partner on his arm into another room Burgo who had been standing near the door followed them at once The crowd was great so that he could not get near them or even keep them in sight but he was aware of the way in which they were going It was five minutes after this when he again saw her and then she was seated on a cane bench in the gallery and an old woman was standing close to her talking to her It was missus Marsham cautioning her against some petty imprudence and Lady Glencora was telling that lady that she needed no such advice in words almost as curt as those I have used Lord Hartletop had left her feeling that as far as that was concerned he had done his duty for the night Burgo knew nothing of missus Marsham had never seen her before and was quite unaware that she had any special connection with mister Palliser It was impossible he thought to find Lady Glencora in a better position for his purpose so he made his way up to her through the crowd and muttering some slight inaudible word offered her his hand That will do very well thank you missus Marsham Lady Glencora said at this moment Pray do not trouble yourself and then she gave her hand to Fitzgerald missus Marsham though unknown to him knew with quite sufficient accuracy who he was and all his history as far as it concerned her friend s wife She had learned the whole story of the loves of Burgo and Lady Glencora Though mister Palliser had never mentioned that man s name to her she was well aware that her duty as a duenna would make it expedient that she should keep a doubly wary eye upon him should he come near the sheepfold And there he was close to them almost leaning over them with the hand of his late lady love the hand of mister Palliser s wife within his own How Lady Glencora might have carried herself at this moment had missus Marsham not been there it is bootless now to surmise but it may be well understood that under missus Marsham s immediate eye all her resolution would be in Burgo s favour She looked at him softly and kindly and though she uttered no articulate word her countenance seemed to show that the meeting was not unpleasant to her Will you waltz said Burgo asking it not at all as though it were a special favour asking it exactly as he might have done had they been in the habit of dancing with each other every other night for the last three months I don t think Lady Glencora will waltz to night said missus Marsham very stiffly She certainly did not know her business as a duenna or else the enormity of Burgo s proposition had struck her so forcibly as to take away from her all her presence of mind Otherwise she must have been aware that such an answer from her would surely drive her friend s wife into open hostility And why not missus Marsham said Lady Glencora rising from her seat Why shouldn t I waltz to night I rather think I shall the more especially as mister Fitzgerald waltzes very well Thereupon she put her hand upon Burgo s arm missus Marsham made still a little effort a little effort that was probably involuntary She put out her hand and laid it on Lady Glencora s left shoulder looking into her face as she did so with all the severity of caution of which she was mistress Lady Glencora shook her duenna off angrily Whether she would put her fate into the hands of this man who was now touching her or whether she would not she had not as yet decided but of this she was very sure that nothing said or done by missus Marsham should have any effect in restraining her What could missus Marsham do mister Palliser was gone Some rumour of that proposed visit to Monkshade and the way in which it had been prevented had reached her ear Some whispers had come to her that Fitzgerald still dared to love as married the woman whom he had loved before she was married There was a rumour about that he still had some hope missus Marsham had never believed that mister Palliser s wife would really be false to her vows It was not in fear of any such catastrophe as a positive elopement that she had taken upon herself the duty of duenna Lady Glencora would no doubt require to be pressed down into that decent mould which it would become the wife of a mister Palliser to assume as her form and this pressing down and this moulding missus Marsham thought that she could accomplish It had not hitherto occurred to her that she might be required to guard mister Palliser from positive dishonour but now now she hardly knew what to think about it What should she do To whom should she go And then she saw mister Bott looming large before her on the top of the staircase Illustration mister Bott on the watch In the meantime Lady Glencora went off towards the dancers leaning on Burgo s arm Who is that woman said Burgo They were the first words he spoke to her though since he had last seen her he had written to her that letter which even now she carried about her His voice in her ears sounded as it used to sound when their intimacy had been close and questions such as that he had asked were common between them And her answer was of the same nature Oh such an odious woman she said Her name is missus Marsham she is my bete noire And then they were actually dancing whirling round the room together before a word had been said of that which was Burgo s settled purpose and which at some moments was her settled purpose also Burgo waltzed excellently and in old days before her marriage Lady Glencora had been passionately fond of dancing She seemed to give herself up to it now as though the old days had come back to her Lady Monk creeping to the intermediate door between her den and the dancing room looked in on them and then crept back again missus Marsham and mister Bott standing together just inside the other door near to the staircase looked on also in horror He shouldn t have gone away and left her said mister Bott almost hoarsely But who could have thought it said missus Marsham I m sure I didn t I suppose you d better tell him said mister Bott But I don t know where to find him said missus Marsham I didn t mean now at once said mister Bott and then he added Do you think it is as bad as that I don t know what to think said missus Marsham The waltzers went on till they were stopped by want of breath I am so much out of practice said Lady Glencora I didn t think I should have been able to dance at all Then she put up her face and slightly opened her mouth and stretched her nostrils as ladies do as well as horses when the running has been severe and they want air You ll take another turn said he Presently said she beginning to have some thought in her mind as to whether missus Marsham was watching her Then there was a little pause after which he spoke in an altered voice Does it put you in mind of old days said he It was of course necessary for him that he should bring her to some thought of the truth It was all very sweet that dancing with her as they used to dance without any question as to the reason why it was so that sudden falling into the old habits as though everything between this night and the former nights had been a dream but this would not further his views The opportunity had come to him which he must use if he intended ever to use such opportunity There was the two hundred pounds in his pocket which he did not intend to give back Does it put you in mind of old days he said The words roused her from her sleep at once and dissipated her dream The facts all rushed upon her in an instant the letter in her pocket the request which she had made to Alice that Alice might be induced to guard her from this danger the words which her husband had spoken to her in the morning and her anger against him in that he had subjected her to the eyes of a missus Marsham her own unsettled mind quite unsettled whether it would be best for her to go or to stay It all came upon her now at the first word of tenderness which Burgo spoke to her It has often been said of woman that she who doubts is lost so often that they who say it now say it simply because others have said it before them never thinking whether or no there be any truth in the proverb But they who have said so thinking of their words as they were uttered have known but little of women Women doubt every day who solve their doubts at last on the right side driven to do so some by fear more by conscience but most of them by that half prudential half unconscious knowledge of what is fitting useful and best under the cirumstances which rarely deserts either men or women till they have brought themselves to the Burgo Fitzgerald state of recklessness Men when they have fallen even to that will still keep up some outward show towards the world but women in this condition defy the world and declare themselves to be children of perdition Lady Glencora was doubting sorely but though doubting she was not as yet lost Does it put you in mind of old days said Burgo She was driven to answer and she knew that much would be decided by the way in which she might now speak You must not talk of that she said very softly May I not And now his tongue was unloosed so that he began to speak quickly May I not And why not They were happy days so happy Were not you happy when you thought Ah dear I suppose it is best not even to think of them Much the best Only it is impossible I wish I knew the inside of your heart Cora so that I could see what it is that you really wish In the old days he had always called her Cora and now the name came from his lips upon her ears as a thing of custom causing no surprise They were standing back behind the circle almost in a corner and Burgo knew well how to speak at such moments so that his words should be audible to none but her whom he addressed You should not have come to me at all she said And why not Who has a better right to come to you Who has ever loved you as I have done Cora did you get my letter Come and dance she said I see a pair of eyes looking at us The pair of eyes which Lady Glencora saw were in the possession of mister Bott who was standing alone leaning against the side of the doorway every now and then raising his heels from the ground so that he might look down upon the sinners as from a vantage ground He was quite alone missus Marsham had left him and had gotten herself away in Lady Glencora s own carriage to Park Lane in order that she might find mister Palliser there if by chance he should be at home Won t it be making mischief missus Marsham had said when mister Bott had suggested this line of conduct There ll be worse mischief if you don t mister Bott had answered He can come back and then he can do as he likes I ll keep my eyes upon them And so he did keep his eyes upon them Again they went round the room or that small portion of the room which the invading crowd had left to the dancers as though they were enjoying themselves thoroughly and in all innocence But there were others besides mister Bott who looked on and wondered The Duchess of saint Bungay saw it and shook her head sorrowing for the Duchess was good at heart missus Conway Sparkes saw it and drank it down with keen appetite as a thirsty man with a longing for wine will drink champagne for missus Conway Sparkes was not good at heart Lady Hartletop saw it and just raised her eyebrows It was nothing to her She liked to know what was going on as such knowledge was sometimes useful but as for heart what she had was in such a matter neither good nor bad Her blood circulated with its ordinary precision and in that respect no woman ever had a better heart Lady Monk saw it and a frown gathered on her brow The fool she said to herself She knew that Burgo would not help his success by drawing down the eyes of all her guests upon his attempt In the meantime mister Bott stood there mounting still higher on his toes straightening his back against the wall Did you get my letter Burgo said again as soon as a moment s pause gave him breath to speak She did not answer him Perhaps her breath did not return to her as rapidly as his But of course he knew that she had received it She would have quickly signified to him that no letter from him had come to her hands had it not reached her Let us go out upon the stairs he said for I must speak to you Oh if you could know what I suffered when you did not come to Monkshade Why did you not come I wish I had not come here she said Because you have seen me That at any rate is not kind of you They were now making their way slowly down the stairs in the crowd towards the supper room All the world was now intent on food and drink and they were only doing as others did Lady Glencora was not thinking where she went but glancing upwards as she stood for a moment wedged upon the stairs her eyes met those of mister Bott A man that can treat me like that deserves that I should leave him That was the thought that crossed her mind at the moment I ll get you some champagne with water in it said Burgo I know that is what you like Do not get me anything she said They had now got into the room and had therefore escaped mister Bott s eyes for the moment mister Fitzgerald and now her words had become a whisper in his ear do what I ask you For the sake of the old days of which you spoke the dear old days which can never come again By G they can said he They can come back and they shall Never But you can still do me a kindness Go away and leave me Go to the sideboard and then do not come back You are doing me an injury while you remain with me Cora he said But she had now recovered her presence of mind and understood what was going on She was no longer in a dream but words and things bore to her again their proper meaning I will not have it mister Fitzgerald she answered speaking almost passionately I will not have it Do as I bid you Go and leave me and do not return I tell you that we are watched This was still true for mister Bott had now again got his eyes on them round the supper room door Whatever was the reward for which he was working private secretaryship or what else it must be owned that he worked hard for it But there are labours which are labours of love Who is watching us said Burgo and what does it matter If you are minded to do as I have asked you But I am not so minded Do you not know that you insult me by proposing it Yes it is an insult Cora unless such an offer be a joy to you If you wish to be my wife instead of his it is no insult How can I be that Her face was not turned to him and her words were half pronounced and in the lowest whisper but nevertheless he heard them Come with me abroad and you shall yet be my wife You got my letter Do what I asked you then Come with me to night The pressing instance of the suggestion the fixing of a present hour startled her back to her propriety mister Fitzgerald she said I asked you to go and leave me If you do not do so I must get up and leave you It will be much more difficult And is that to be all All at any rate now Oh Glencora how could you be so weak Why did you add that word now In truth she added it then at that moment simply feeling that she could thus best secure an immediate compliance with her request I will not go he said looking at her sternly and leaning before her with earnest face with utter indifference as to the eyes of any that might see them I will not go till you tell me that you will see me again I will she said in that low all but unuttered whisper When when when he asked Looking up again towards the doorway in fear of mister Bott s eyes she saw the face of mister Palliser as he entered the room mister Bott had also seen him and had tried to clutch him by the arm but mister Palliser had shaken him off apparently with indifference had got rid of him as it were without noticing him Lady Glencora when she saw her husband immediately recovered her courage She would not cower before him or show herself ashamed of what she had done For the matter of that if he pressed her on the subject she could bring herself to tell him that she loved Burgo Fitzgerald much more easily than she could whisper such a word to Burgo himself mister Bott s eyes were odious to her as they watched her but her husband s glance she could meet without quailing before it Here is mister Palliser said she speaking again in her ordinary clear toned voice Burgo immediately rose from his seat with a start and turned quickly towards the door but Lady Glencora kept her chair mister Palliser made his way as best he could through the crowd up to his wife He too kept his countenance without betraying his secret There was neither anger nor dismay in his face nor was there any untoward hurry in his movement Burgo stood aside as he came up and Lady Glencora was the first to speak I thought you were gone home hours ago she said I did go home he answered but I thought I might as well come back for you What a model of a husband Well I am ready Only what shall we do about Jane mister Fitzgerald I left a scarf in your aunt s room a little black and yellow scarf would you mind getting it for me I will fetch it said mister Palliser and I will tell your cousin that the carriage shall come back for her If you will allow me said Burgo I will do it said mister Palliser and away he went making his slow progress up through the crowd ordering his carriage as he passed through the hall and leaving mister Bott still watching at the door Lady Glencora resolved that she would say nothing to Burgo while her husband was gone There was a touch of chivalry in his leaving them again together which so far conquered her He might have bade her leave the scarf and come at once She had seen moreover that he had not spoken to mister Bott and was thankful to him also for that Burgo also seemed to have become aware that his chance for that time was over I will say good night he said Good night mister Fitzgerald she answered giving him her hand He pressed it for a moment and then turned and went When mister Palliser came back he was no more to be seen Lady Glencora was at the dining room door when her husband returned standing close to mister Bott mister Bott had spoken to her but she made no reply He spoke again but her face remained as immovable as though she had been deaf And what shall we do about missus Marsham she said quite out loud as soon as she put her hand on her husband s arm I had forgotten her missus Marsham has gone home he replied Have you seen her Yes When did you see her She came to Park Lane What made her do that These questions were asked and answered as he was putting her into the carriage She got in just as she asked the last and he as he took his seat did not find it necessary to answer it But that would not serve her turn What made missus Marsham go to you at Park Lane after she left Lady Monk s she asked again mister Palliser sat silent not having made up his mind what he would say on the subject I suppose she went continued Lady Glencora to tell you that I was dancing with mister Fitzgerald Was that it I think Glencora we had better not discuss it now I don t mean to discuss it now or ever If you did not wish me to see mister Fitzgerald you should not have sent me to Lady Monk s But Plantagenet I hope you will forgive me if I say that no consideration shall induce me to receive again as a guest in my own house either missus Marsham or mister Bott mister Palliser absolutely declined to say anything on the subject on that occasion and the evening of Lady Monk s party in this way came to an end CHAPTER LI Bold Speculations on Murder George Vavasor was not in a very happy mood when he left Queen Anne Street after having flung his gift ring under the grate Indeed there was much in his condition as connected with the house which he was leaving which could not but make him unhappy Alice was engaged to be his wife and had as yet said nothing to show that she meditated any breach of that engagement but she had treated him in a way which made him long to throw her promise in her teeth He was a man to whom any personal slight from a woman was unendurable To slights from men unless they were of a nature to provoke offence he was indifferent There was no man living for whose liking or disliking George Vavasor cared anything But he did care much for the good opinion or rather for the personal favour of any woman to whom he had endeavoured to make himself agreeable I will marry you Alice had said to him not in words but in acts and looks which were plainer than words I will marry you for certain reasons of my own which in my present condition make it seem that that arrangement will be more convenient to me than any other that I can make but pray understand that there is no love mixed up with this There is another man whom I love only for those reasons above hinted I do not care to marry him It was thus that he read Alice s present treatment of him and he was a man who could not endure this treatment with ease But though he could throw his ring under the grate in his passion he could not so dispose of her That he would have done so had his hands been free we need not doubt And he would have been clever enough to do so in some manner that would have been exquisitely painful to Alice willing as she might be to be released from her engagement But he could not do this to a woman whose money he had borrowed and whose money he could not repay to a woman more of whose money he intended to borrow immediately As to that latter part of it he did say to himself over and over again that he would have no more of it As he left the house in Queen Anne Street on that occasion he swore that under no circumstances would he be indebted to her for another shilling But before he had reached Great Marlborough Street to which his steps took him he had reminded himself that everything depended on a further advance He was in Parliament but Parliament would be dissolved within three months Having sacrificed so much for his position should he let it all fall from him now now when success seemed to be within his reach That wretched old man in Westmoreland who seemed gifted almost with immortality why could he not die and surrender his paltry acres to one who could use them He turned away from Regent Street into Hanover Square before he crossed to Great Marlborough Street giving vent to his passion rather than arranging his thoughts As he walked the four sides of the square he considered how good it would be if some accident should befall the old man How he would rejoice were he to hear to morrow that one of the trees of the accursed place had fallen on the obstinate old idiot and put an end to him I will not say that he meditated the murder of his grandfather There was a firm conviction on his mind as he thought of all this that such a deed as that would never come in his way But he told himself that if he chose to make the attempt he would certainly be able to carry it through without detection Then he remembered Rush and Palmer the openly bold murderer and the secret poisoner Both of them in Vavasor s estimation were great men He had often said so in company He had declared that the courage of Rush had never been surpassed Think of him he would say with admiration walking into a man s house with pistols sufficient to shoot every one there and doing it as though he were killing rats What was Nelson at Trafalgar to that Nelson had nothing to fear And of Palmer he declared that he was a man of genius as well as courage He had looked the whole thing in the face Vavasor would say and told himself that all scruples and squeamishness are bosh child s tales And so they are Who lives as though they fear either heaven or hell And if we do live without such fear or respect what is the use of telling lies to ourselves To throw it all to the dogs as Palmer did is more manly And be hanged some hearer of George s doctrine replied Yes and be hanged if such is your destiny But you hear of the one who is hanged but hear nothing of the twenty who are not Vavasor walked round Hanover Square nursing his hatred against the old Squire He did not tell himself that he would like to murder his grandfather But he suggested to himself that if he desired to do so he would have courage enough to make his way into the old man s room and strangle him and he explained to himself how he would be able to get down into Westmoreland without the world knowing that he had been there how he would find an entrance into the house by a window with which he was acquainted how he could cause the man to die as though those around him should think it was apoplexy he George Vavasor having read something on that subject lately All this he considered very fully walking rapidly round Hanover Square more than once or twice If he were to become an active student in the Rush or Palmer school he would so study the matter that he would not be the one that should be hung He thought that he could so far trust his own ingenuity But yet he did not meditate murder Beastly old idiot he said to himself he must have his chance as other men have I suppose And then he went across Regent Street to mister Scruby s office in Great Marlborough Street not having as yet come to any positive conclusion as to what he would do in reference to Alice s money But he soon found himself talking to mister Scruby as though there were no doubts as to the forthcoming funds for the next elections And mister Scruby talked to him very plainly as though those funds must be forthcoming before long A stitch in time saves nine said mister Scruby meaning to insinuate that a pound in time might have the same effect And I ll tell you what mister Vavasor of course I ve my outstanding bills for the last affair That s no fault of yours for the things came so sharp one on another that my fellows haven t had time to make it out But if you ll put me in funds for what I must be out of pocket in June Will it be so soon as June They are talking of June Why then I ll lump the two bills together when it s all over In their discussion respecting money mister Scruby injudiciously mentioned the name of mister Tombe No precise caution had been given to him but he had become aware that the matter was being managed through an agency that was not recognized by his client and as that agency was simply a vehicle of money which found its way into mister Scruby s pocket he should have held his tongue But mister Tombe s name escaped from him and Vavasor immediately questioned him Scruby who did not often make such blunders readily excused himself shaking his head and declaring that the name had fallen from his lips instead of that of another man Vavasor accepted the excuse without further notice and nothing more was said about mister Tombe while he was in mister Scruby s office But he had not heard the name in vain and had unfortunately heard it before mister Tombe was a remarkable man in his way He wore powder to his hair was very polite in his bearing was somewhat asthmatic and wheezed in his talking and was moreover the most obedient of men though it was said of him that he managed the whole income of the Ely Chapter just as he pleased Being in these ways a man of note John Grey had spoken of him to Alice and his name had filtered through Alice and her cousin Kate to George Vavasor George seldom forgot things or names and when he heard mister Tombe s name mentioned in connection with his own money matters he remembered that mister Tombe was John Grey s lawyer As soon as he could escape out into the street he endeavoured to put all these things together and after a while resolved that he would go to mister Tombe What if there should be an understanding between John Grey and Alice and mister Tombe should be arranging his money matters for him Would not anything be better than this even that little tragedy down in Westmoreland for which his ingenuity and courage would be required He could endure to borrow money from Alice He might even endure it still though that was very difficult after her treatment of him but he could not endure to be the recipient of John Grey s money By heavens no And as he got into a cab and had himself driven off to the neighbourhood of Doctors Commons he gave himself credit for much fine manly feeling mister Tombe s chambers were found without difficulty and as it happened mister Tombe was there The lawyer rose from his chair as Vavasor entered and bowed his powdered head very meekly as he asked his visitor to sit down mister Vavasor oh yes He had heard the name Yes he was in the habit of acting for his very old friend mister John Grey He had acted for mister John Grey and for mister John Grey s father he or his partner he believed he might say for about half a century There could not be a nicer gentleman than mister John Grey and such a pretty child as he used to be At every new sentence mister Tombe caught his poor asthmatic breath and bowed his meek old head and rubbed his hands together as though he hardly dared to keep his seat in Vavasor s presence without the support of some such motion and wheezed apologetically and seemed to ask pardon of his visitor for not knowing intuitively what was the nature of that visitor s business But he was a sly old fox was mister Tombe and was considering all this time how much it would be well that he should tell mister Vavasor and how much it would be well that he should conceal The fat had got into the fire as he told his old wife when he got home that evening He told his old wife everything and I don t know that any of his clients were the worse for his doing so But while he was wheezing and coughing and apologizing he made up his mind that if George Vavasor were to ask him certain questions it would be best that he should answer them truly If Vavasor did ask those questions he would probably do so upon certain knowledge and if so why in that case lying would be of no use Lying would not put the fat back into the frying pan And even though such questions might be asked without any absolute knowledge they would at any rate show that the questioner had the means of ascertaining the truth He would tell as little as he could but he decided during his last wheeze that he could not lie in the matter with any chance of benefiting his client The prettiest child I ever saw mister Vavasor said mister Tombe and then he coughed violently Some people who knew mister Tombe declared that he nursed his cough I dare say said George Yes indeed ugh ugh ugh Can you tell me mister Tombe whether either you or he have anything to do with the payment of certain sums to my credit at Messrs Hock and Block s Messrs Hock and Block s the bankers in Lom bard Street said mister Tombe taking a little more time Yes I bank there said Vavasor sharply A most respectable house Has any money been paid there to my credit by you mister Tombe May I ask you why you put the question to me mister Vavasor Well I don t think you may That is to say my reason for asking it can have nothing to do with yours for replying to it If you have had no hand in any such payment there is an end of it and I need not take up your time by saying anything more on the subject I am not prepared to go that length mister Vavasor not altogether to go that length ugh ugh ugh Then will you tell me what you have done in the matter Well upon my word you ve taken me a little by surprise Let me see Pinkle Pinkle Pinkle was a clerk who sat in an inner room and mister Tombe s effort to call him seemed to be most ineffectual But Pinkle understood the sound and came Pinkle didn t we pay some money into Hock and Block s a few weeks since to the credit of mister George Vavasor Did we sir said Pinkle who probably knew that his employer was an old fox and who perhaps had caught something of the fox nature himself I think we did Just look Pinkle and Pinkle see the date and let me know all about it It s fine bright weather for this time of year mister Vavasor but these easterly winds ugh ugh ugh Vavasor found himself sitting for an apparently interminable number of minutes in mister Tombe s dingy chamber and was coughed at and wheezed at till he begun to be tired of his position moreover when tired he showed his impatience Perhaps you ll let us write you a line when we have looked into the matter suggested mister Tombe I d rather know at once said Vavasor I don t suppose it can take you very long to find out whether you have paid money to my account by order of mister Grey At any rate I must know before I go away Pinkle Pinkle screamed the old man through his coughing and again Pinkle came Well Pinkle was anything of the kind done or is my memory deceiving me mister Tombe was no doubt lying shamefully for of course he remembered all about it and indeed George Vavasor had learned already quite enough for his own purposes I was going to look said Pinkle and Pinkle again went away I m sorry to give your clerk so much trouble said Vavasor in an angry voice and I think it must be unnecessary Surely you know whether mister Grey has commissioned you to pay money for me We have so many things to do mister Vavasor and so many clients We have indeed You see it isn t only one gentleman s affairs But I think there was something done I do indeed What is mister John Grey s address asked Vavasor very sharply Number five Suffolk Street Pall Mall East said mister Tombe Herein mister Tombe somewhat committed himself His client mister Grey was in fact in town but Vavasor had not known or imagined that such was the case Had mister Tombe given the usual address of Nethercoats nothing further would have been demanded from him on that subject But he had foolishly presumed that the question had been based on special information as to his client s visit to London and he had told the plain truth in a very simple way Number five Suffolk Street said Vavasor writing down the address Perhaps it will be better that I should go to him as you do not seem inclined to give me any information Then he took up his hat and hardly bowing to mister Tombe left the chambers mister Tombe as he did so rose from his chair and bent his head meekly down upon the table Pinkle Pinkle wheezed mister Tombe Never mind never mind Pinkle didn t mind and we may say that he had not minded for up to that moment he had taken no steps towards a performance of the order which had been given him 
2053_138888_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER LII 
none	none	What Occurred in Suffolk Street Pall Mall 
2053_138888_000003_000000	train-clean-360	mister Tombe had gained nothing for the cause by his crafty silence George Vavasor felt perfectly certain as he walked out from the little street which runs at the back of Doctors Commons that the money which he had been using had come in some shape through the hands of John Grey 
2053_138888_000003_000001	train-clean-360	He did not care much to calculate whether the payments had been made from the personal funds of his rival or whether that rival had been employed to dispense Alice s fortune Under either view of the case his position was sufficiently bitter The truth never for a moment occurred to him 
none	none	He never dreamed that there might be a conspiracy in the matter of which Alice was as ignorant as he himself had been He never reflected that his uncle John together with John the lover whom he so hated might be the conspirators 
2053_138888_000003_000004	train-clean-360	To him it seemed to be certain that Alice and mister Grey were in league and if they were in league what must he think of Alice and of her engagement with himself 
2053_138888_000004_000000	train-clean-360	There are men who rarely think well of women who hardly think well of any woman 
none	none	They put their mothers and sisters into the background as though they belonged to some sex or race apart and then declare to themselves and to their friends that all women are false that no woman can be trusted unless her ugliness protect her and that every woman may be attacked as fairly as may game in a cover or deer on a mountain What man does not know men who have so thought 
2053_138888_000004_000002	train-clean-360	I cannot say that such had been Vavasor s creed not entirely such 
none	none	There had been periods of his life when he had believed implicitly in his cousin Alice but then there had been other moments in which he had ridiculed himself for his Quixotism in believing in any woman And as he had grown older the moments of his Quixotism had become more rare There would have been no such Quixotism left with him now had not the various circumstances which I have attempted to describe filled him during the last twelve months with a renewed desire to marry his cousin Every man tries to believe in the honesty of his future wife and therefore Vavasor had tried and had in his way believed He had flattered himself too that Alice s heart had in truth been more prone to him than to that other suitor 
2053_138888_000004_000008	train-clean-360	Grey as he thought had been accepted by her cold prudence but he thought also that she had found her prudence to be too cold and had therefore returned where she had truly loved Vavasor though he did not love much himself was willing enough to be the object of love 
2053_138888_000005_000000	train-clean-360	This idea of his however had been greatly shaken by Alice s treatment of himself personally but still he had not hitherto believed that she was false to him 
2053_138888_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Now what could he believe of her 
none	none	What was there within the compass of such a one to believe As he walked out into saint Paul s Churchyard he called her by every name which is most offensive to a woman s ears 
2053_138888_000005_000003	train-clean-360	He hated her at this moment with even a more bitter hatred than that which he felt towards John Grey 
none	none	She must have deceived him with unparalleled hypocrisy and lied to him and to his sister Kate as hardly any woman had ever lied before 
2053_138888_000005_000005	train-clean-360	Or could it be that Kate also was lying to him 
2053_138888_000005_000006	train-clean-360	If so Kate also should be included in the punishment 
2053_138888_000006_000000	train-clean-360	But why should they have conspired to feed him with these moneys There had been no deceit at any rate in reference to the pounds sterling which Scruby had already swallowed 
2053_138888_000006_000001	train-clean-360	They had been supplied whatever had been the motives of the suppliers and he had no doubt that more would be supplied if he would only keep himself quiet 
2053_138888_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He was still walking westward as he thought of this down Ludgate Hill on his direct line towards Suffolk Street and he tried to persuade himself that it would be well that he should hide his wrath till after provision should have been made for this other election 
2053_138888_000006_000003	train-clean-360	They were his enemies Alice and mister Grey and why should he keep any terms with his enemies 
2053_138888_000006_000004	train-clean-360	It was still a trouble to him to think that he should have been in any way beholden to John Grey but the terrible thing had been done the evil had occurred 
2053_138888_000006_000005	train-clean-360	What would he gain by staying his hand now 
none	none	Still however he walked on quickly along Fleet Street and along the Strand and was already crossing under the Picture Galleries towards Pall Mall East before he had definitely decided what steps he would take on this very day 
2053_138888_000006_000007	train-clean-360	Exactly at the corner of Suffolk Street he met John Grey 
2053_138888_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Grey he said stopping himself suddenly I was this moment going to call on you at your lodgings 
2053_138888_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 At my lodgings were you 
2053_138888_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Shall I return with you 
2053_138888_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 If you please said Vavasor leading the way up Suffolk Street There had been no other greeting than this between them 
2053_138888_000009_000001	train-clean-360	mister Grey himself though a man very courteous in his general demeanour would probably have passed Vavasor in the street with no more than the barest salutation 
none	none	Situated as they were towards each other there could hardly be any show of friendship between them but when Vavasor had spoken to him he had dressed his face in that guise of civility which men always use who do not intend to be offensive but Vavasor dressed his as men dress theirs who do mean to be offensive and mister Grey had thoroughly appreciated the dressing
2053_138888_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 If you will allow me I have the key said Grey 
2053_138888_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Then they both entered the house and Vavasor followed his host up stairs 
2053_138888_000010_000002	train-clean-360	mister Grey as he went up felt almost angry with himself in having admitted his enemy into his lodgings 
none	none	He was sure that no good could come of it and remembered when it was too late that he might easily have saved himself from giving the invitation while he was still in the street There they were however together in the sitting room and Grey had nothing to do but to listen Will you take a chair mister Vavasor he said
2053_138888_000010_000005	train-clean-360	 No said Vavasor I will stand up And he stood up holding his hat behind his back with his left hand with his right leg forward and the thumb of his right hand in his waistcoat pocket 
2053_138888_000010_000006	train-clean-360	He looked full into Grey s face and Grey looked full into his and as he looked the great cicatrice seemed to open itself and to become purple with fresh blood stains 
none	none	I have come here from mister Tombe s office in the City said Vavasor to ask you of what nature has been the interference which you have taken in my money matters 
2053_138888_000012_000000	train-clean-360	This was a question which mister Grey could not answer very quickly 
none	none	In the first place it was altogether unexpected in the next place he did not know what mister Tombe had told and what he had not told and then before he replied he must think how much of the truth he was bound to tell in answer to a question so put to him Do you say that you have come from mister Tombe he asked
2053_138888_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I think you heard me say so 
2053_138888_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I have come here direct from mister Tombe s chambers 
none	none	He is your lawyer I believe He is so
2053_138888_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 And I have come from him to ask you what interference you have lately taken in my money matters 
2053_138888_000016_000001	train-clean-360	When you have answered that I shall have other questions to ask you 
2053_138888_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 But mister Vavasor has it occurred to you that I may not be disposed to answer questions so asked 
none	none	It has not occurred to me to think that you will prevaricate If there has been no such interference I will ask your pardon and go away but if there has been such interference on your part I have a right to demand that you shall explain to me its nature 
2053_138888_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Grey had now made up his mind that it would be better that he should tell the whole story better not only for himself but for all the Vavasors including this angry man himself 
2053_138888_000019_000001	train-clean-360	The angry man evidently knew something and it would be better that he should know the truth There has been such interference mister Vavasor if you choose to call it so 
none	none	Money to the extent of two thousand pounds I think has by my directions been paid to your credit by mister Tombe
2053_138888_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said Vavasor taking his right hand away from his waistcoat and tapping the round table with his fingers impatiently 
none	none	I hardly know how to explain all the circumstances under which this has been done
2053_138888_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I dare say not but nevertheless you must explain them 
2053_138888_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Grey was a man tranquil in temperament very little prone to quarrelling with perhaps an exaggerated idea of the evil results of a row a man who would take infinite trouble to avoid any such scene as that which now seemed to be imminent but he was a man whose courage was quite as high as that of his opponent 
2053_138888_000023_000001	train-clean-360	To bully or be bullied were alike contrary to his nature 
none	none	It was clear enough now that Vavasor intended to bully him and he made up his mind at once that if the quarrel were forced upon him it should find him ready to take his own part
2053_138888_000023_000003	train-clean-360	 My difficulty in explaining it comes from consideration for you he said 
2053_138888_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I beg that your difficulty will cease and that you will have no consideration for me 
none	none	We are so circumstanced towards each other that any consideration must be humbug and nonsense 
2053_138888_000024_000002	train-clean-360	At any rate I intend to have none for you 
2053_138888_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Now let me know why you have meddled with my matters 
2053_138888_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I think I might perhaps better refer you to your uncle 
none	none	No sir mister Tombe is not my uncle s lawyer My uncle never heard his name unless he heard of it from you But it was by agreement with your uncle that I commissioned mister Tombe to raise for you the money you were desirous of borrowing from your cousin 
2053_138888_000027_000001	train-clean-360	We thought it better that her fortune should not be for the moment disturbed 
none	none	But what had you to do with it Why should you have done it In the first place I don t believe your story it is altogether improbable But why should he come to you of all men to raise money on his daughter s behalf Unless you can behave yourself with more discretion mister Vavasor you must leave the room said mister Grey 
2053_138888_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Then as Vavasor simply sneered at him but spoke nothing he went on 
none	none	It was I who suggested to your uncle that this arrangement should be made I did not wish to see Miss Vavasor s fortune squandered
2053_138888_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 And what was her fortune to you sir 
2053_138888_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Are you aware that she is engaged to me as my wife 
2053_138888_000030_000002	train-clean-360	I ask you sir whether you are aware that Miss Vavasor is to be my wife 
2053_138888_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I must altogether decline to discuss with you Miss Vavasor s present or future position 
2053_138888_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 By heavens then you shall hear me discuss it 
none	none	She was engaged to you and she has given you your dismissal 
2053_138888_000032_000002	train-clean-360	If you had understood anything of the conduct which is usual among gentlemen or if you had had any particle of pride in you sir you would have left her and never mentioned her name again 
2053_138888_000032_000003	train-clean-360	I now find you meddling with her money matters so as to get a hold upon her fortune 
2053_138888_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I have no hold upon her fortune 
2053_138888_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir you have 
none	none	You do not advance two thousand pounds without knowing that you have security She has rejected you and in order that you may be revenged or that you may have some further hold upon her that she may be in some sort within your power you have contrived this rascally pettifogging way of obtaining power over her income 
2053_138888_000034_000003	train-clean-360	The money shall be repaid at once with any interest that can be due and if I find you interfering again I will expose you 
none	none	mister Vavasor said Grey very slowly in a low tone of voice but with something in his eye which would have told any bystander that he was much in earnest you have used words in your anger which I cannot allow to pass 
2053_138888_000035_000001	train-clean-360	You must recall them 
none	none	What were the words 
2053_138888_000036_000001	train-clean-360	I said that you were a pettifogging rascal 
none	none	I now repeat them As he spoke he put on his hat so as to leave both his hands ready for action if action should be required 
2053_138888_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Grey was much the larger man and much the stronger 
2053_138888_000037_000001	train-clean-360	It may be doubted whether he knew himself the extent of his own strength but such as it was he resolved that he must now use it 
2053_138888_000037_000002	train-clean-360	 There is no help for it he said as he also prepared for action 
none	none	The first thing he did was to open the door and as he did so he became conscious that his mouth was full of blood from a sharp blow upon his face Vavasor had struck him with his fist and had cut his lip against his teeth Then there came a scramble and Grey was soon aware that he had his opponent in his hands 
2053_138888_000037_000005	train-clean-360	I doubt whether he had attempted to strike a blow or whether he had so much as clenched his fist 
2053_138888_000037_000006	train-clean-360	Vavasor had struck him repeatedly but the blows had fallen on his body or his head and he was unconscious of them 
2053_138888_000037_000007	train-clean-360	He had but one object now in his mind and that object was the kicking his assailant down the stairs 
none	none	Then came a scramble as I have said and Grey had a hold of the smaller man by the nape of his neck So holding him he forced him back through the door on to the landing and there succeeded in pushing him down the first flight of steps 
2053_138888_000037_000010	train-clean-360	Grey kicked at him as he went but the kick was impotent 
none	none	He had however been so far successful that he had thrust his enemy out of the room and had the satisfaction of seeing him sprawling on the landing place 
2053_138888_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Vavasor when he raised himself prepared to make another rush at the room but before he could do so a man from below hearing the noise had come upon him and interrupted him 
2053_138888_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 mister Jones said Grey speaking from above if that gentleman does not leave the house I must get you to search for a policeman 
2053_138888_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Vavasor though the lodging house man had hold of the collar of his coat made no attempt to turn upon his new enemy

none	none	It never occurs to them to turn their teeth upon newcomers in the quarrel So it was with George Vavasor Jones was sufficient to prevent his further attack upon the foe up stairs and therefore he had no alternative but to relinquish the fight What s it all about sir said Jones who kept a tailor s establishment and as a tailor was something of a fighting man himself Of all tradesmen in London the tailors are no doubt the most combative as might be expected from the necessity which lies upon them of living down the general bad character in this respect which the world has wrongly given them What s it all about sir said Jones still holding Vavasor by his coat
2053_138888_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 That man has ill used me and I ve punished him that s all 
2053_138888_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know much about punishing said the tailor 
2053_138888_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 It seems to me he pitched you down pretty clean out of the room above 
2053_138888_000042_000002	train-clean-360	I think the best thing you can do now is to walk yourself off 
2053_138888_000043_000000	train-clean-360	It was the only thing that Vavasor could do and he did walk himself off 
none	none	He walked himself off and went home to his own lodgings in Cecil Street that he might smooth his feathers after the late encounter before he went down to Westminster to take his seat in the House of Commons 
2053_138888_000043_000002	train-clean-360	I do not think that he was comfortable when he got there or that he felt himself very well able to fight another battle that night on behalf of the River Bank

2053_138888_000043_000004	train-clean-360	Grey had probably received more personal damage than had fallen to his share but Grey had succeeded in expelling him from the room and he knew that he had been found prostrate on the landing place when the tailor first saw him 
2053_138888_000044_000000	train-clean-360	But he might probably have got over the annoyance of this feeling had he not been overwhelmed by a consciousness that everything was going badly with him 
2053_138888_000044_000001	train-clean-360	He was already beginning to hate his seat in Parliament 
2053_138888_000044_000002	train-clean-360	What good had it done for him or was it likely to do for him 
2053_138888_000044_000003	train-clean-360	He found himself to be associated there with mister Bott and a few others of the same class men whom he despised and even they did not admit him among them without a certain show of superiority on their part 
none	none	Who has not ascertained by his own experience the different lights through which the same events may be seen according to the success or want of success which pervades the atmosphere at the moment At the present time everything was unsuccessful with George Vavasor and though he told himself almost from hour to hour that he would go on with the thing which he had begun that he would persevere in Parliament till he had obtained a hearing there and created for himself success he could not himself believe in the promises which he had made to himself 
2053_138888_000044_000006	train-clean-360	He had looked forward to his entrance into that Chamber as the hour of his triumph but he had entered it with mister Bott and there had been no triumph to him in doing so 
none	none	He had sworn to himself that when there he would find men to hear him Hitherto indeed he could not accuse himself of having missed his opportunities his election had been so recent that he could hardly yet have made the attempt But he had been there long enough to learn to fancy that there was no glory in attempting 
2053_138888_000044_000010	train-clean-360	This art of speaking in Parliament which had appeared to him to be so grand seemed already to be a humdrum homely dull affair

2053_138888_000044_000015	train-clean-360	Two thousand pounds of his own money and two thousand more of Alice s money or of mister Grey s he had already spent to make his way into that assembly 
2053_138888_000044_000016	train-clean-360	He must spend at any rate two thousand more if he intended that his career should be prolonged beyond a three months sitting and how was he to get this further sum after what had taken place to day 
2053_138888_000045_000000	train-clean-360	He would get it 
2053_138888_000045_000001	train-clean-360	That was his resolve as he walked in by the apple woman s stall under the shadow of the great policeman and between the two august lamps 
2053_138888_000045_000002	train-clean-360	He would get it as long as Alice had a pound over which he could obtain mastery by any act or violence within his compass 
none	none	He would get it even though it should come through the hands of John Grey and mister Tombe

2053_138888_000045_000007	train-clean-360	He would go to Alice and demand the money from her with threats and with that violence in his eyes which he knew so well how to assume 
2053_138888_000045_000008	train-clean-360	He believed that when he so demanded it the money would be forthcoming so as to satisfy at any rate his present emergencies

2053_138888_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Even though the estate might be entailed so as to give him no more than a life interest still money might be raised on it 
2053_138888_000046_000003	train-clean-360	His life interest in it would be worth ten or twelve years purchase 
none	none	He had an idea that his grandfather had not as yet made any such will when he left the place in Westmoreland 
2053_138888_000046_000005	train-clean-360	What a boon it would be if death could be made to overtake the old man before he did so 
2053_138888_000046_000006	train-clean-360	On this very night he walked about the lobbies of the House thinking of all this 
2053_138888_000046_000007	train-clean-360	He went by himself from room to room roaming along passages sitting now for ten minutes in the gallery and then again for a short space in the body of the House till he would get up and wander again out into the lobby impatient of the neighbourhood of mister Bott 
none	none	Certainly just at this time he felt no desire to bring before the House the subject of the River Embankment 
2053_138888_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Nor was mister Grey much happier when he was left alone than was his assailant 
2053_138888_000047_000001	train-clean-360	To give Vavasor his due the memory of the affray itself did not long trouble him much 
none	none	The success between the combatants had been nearly equal and he had at any rate spoken his mind freely His misery had come from other sources But the reflection that he had been concerned in a row was in itself enough to make John Grey wretched for the time Such a misfortune had never hitherto befallen him In all his dealings with men words had been sufficient and generally words of courtesy had sufficed 
2053_138888_000047_000006	train-clean-360	To have been personally engaged in a fighting scramble with such a man as George Vavasor was to him terrible 
2053_138888_000047_000007	train-clean-360	When ordering that his money might be expended with the possible object of saving Alice from her cousin he had never felt a moment s regret he had never thought that he was doing more than circumstances fairly demanded of him 
2053_138888_000047_000008	train-clean-360	But now he was almost driven to utter reproach 
2053_138888_000047_000009	train-clean-360	 Oh Alice that this thing should have come upon me through thy fault 
2053_138888_000048_000000	train-clean-360	When Vavasor was led away down stairs by the tailor and Grey found that no more actual fighting would be required of him he retired into his bedroom that he might wash his mouth and free himself from the stains of the combat 
none	none	He had heard the front door closed and knew that the miscreant was gone the miscreant who had disturbed his quiet Then he began to think what was the accusation with which Vavasor had charged him 
2053_138888_000048_000003	train-clean-360	He had been told that he had advanced money on behalf of Alice in order that he might obtain some power over Alice s fortune and thus revenge himself upon Alice for her treatment of him 
none	none	Nothing could be more damnably false than this accusation 
2053_138888_000048_000005	train-clean-360	Of that he was well aware 
2053_138888_000048_000006	train-clean-360	But were not the circumstances of a nature to make it appear that the accusation was true 
2053_138888_000048_000007	train-clean-360	Security for the money advanced by him of course he had none of course he had desired none of course the money had been given out of his own pocket with the sole object of saving Alice if that might be possible but of all those who might hear of this affair how many would know or even guess the truth 
none	none	While he was in this wretched state of mind washing his mouth and disturbing his spirit mister Jones his landlord came up to him 
2053_138888_000049_000001	train-clean-360	mister Jones had known him for some years and entertained a most profound respect for his character 
none	none	A rather sporting man than otherwise was mister Jones 
2053_138888_000049_000003	train-clean-360	His father had been a tradesman at Cambridge and in this way Jones had become known to mister Grey 
2053_138888_000049_000004	train-clean-360	But though given to sport by which he meant modern prize fighting and the Epsom course on the Derby day mister Jones was a man who dearly loved respectable customers and respectable lodgers 
2053_138888_000049_000005	train-clean-360	mister Grey with his property at Nethercoats and his august manners and his reputation at Cambridge was a most respectable lodger and mister Jones could hardly understand how any one could presume to raise his hand against such a man 
2053_138888_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear dear sir this is a terrible affair he said as he made his way into the room 
2053_138888_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 It was very disagreeable certainly said Grey 
2053_138888_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Was the gentleman known to you asked the tailor 
2053_138888_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I know who he is 
2053_138888_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Any quarrel sir 
none	none	Well yes I should not have pushed him down stairs had he not quarrelled with me We can have the police after him if you wish it sir I don t wish it at all
2053_138888_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Or we might manage to polish him off in any other way you know 
2053_138888_000059_000000	train-clean-360	It was some time before mister Grey could get rid of the tailor but he did so at last without having told any part of the story to that warlike worthy and very anxious individual 
none	none	CHAPTER LIII The Last Will of the Old Squire In the meantime Kate Vavasor was living down in Westmoreland with no other society than that of her grandfather and did not altogether have a very pleasant life of it George had been apt to represent the old man to himself as being as strong as an old tower which though it be but a ruin shows no sign of falling To his eyes the Squire had always seemed to be full of life and power He could be violent on occasions and was hardly ever without violence in his eyes and voice But George s opinion was formed by his wish or rather by the reverses of his wish For years he had been longing that his grandfather should die had been accusing Fate of gross injustice in that she did not snap the thread and with such thoughts in his mind he had grudged every ounce which the Squire s vigour had been able to sustain He had almost taught himself to believe that it would be a good deed to squeeze what remained of life out of that violent old throat But indeed the embers of life were burning low and had George known all the truth he would hardly have inclined his mind to thoughts of murder He was indeed very weak with age and tottering with unsteady steps on the brink of his grave though he would still come down early from his room and would if possible creep out about the garden and into the farmyard He would still sit down to dinner and would drink his allotted portion of port wine in the doctor s teeth The doctor by no means desired to rob him of his last luxury or even to stint his quantity but he recommended certain changes in the mode and time of taking it Against this however the old Squire indignantly rebelled and scolded Kate almost off her legs when she attempted to enforce the doctor s orders What the mischief does it signify the old man said to her one evening what difference will it make whether I am dead or alive unless it is that George would turn you out of the house directly he gets it I was not thinking of any one but yourself sir said Kate with a tear in her eye You won t be troubled to think of me much longer said the Squire and then he gulped down the remaining half of his glass of wine Kate was in truth very good to him Women always are good under such circumstances and Kate Vavasor was one who would certainly stick to such duties as now fell to her lot She was eminently true and loyal to her friends though she could be as false on their behalf as most false people can be on their own She was very good to the old man tending all his wants taking his violence with good humour rather than with submission not opposing him with direct contradiction when he abused his grandson but saying little words to mitigate his wrath if it were possible At such times the Squire would tell her that she also would learn to know her brother s character some day You ll live to be robbed by him and turned out as naked as you were born he said to her one day Then Kate fired up and declared that she fully trusted her brother s love Whatever faults he might have he had been staunch to her So she said and the old man sneered at her for saying so One morning soon after this when she brought him up to his bedroom some mixture of thin porridge which he still endeavoured to swallow for his breakfast he bade her sit down and began to talk to her about the property I know you are a fool he said about all matters of business more of a fool than even women generally are To this Kate acceded with a little smile acknowledging that her understanding was limited I want to see Gogram he said Do you write to him a line telling him to come here to day he or one of his men and send it at once by Peter Gogram was an attorney who lived at Penrith and who was never summoned to Vavasor Hall unless the Squire had something to say about his will Don t you think you d better put it off till you are a little stronger said Kate Whereupon the Squire fired at her such a volley of oaths that she sprang off the chair on which she was sitting and darted across to a little table at which there was pen and ink and wrote her note to mister Gogram before she had recovered from the shaking which the battery had given her She wrote the note and ran away with it to Peter and saw Peter on the pony on his way to Penrith before she dared to return to her grandfather s bedside What should you do with the estate if I left it you the Squire said to her the first moment she was again back with him This was a question she could not answer instantly She stood by his bedside for a while thinking holding her grandfather s hand and looking down upon the bed He with his rough watery old eyes was gazing up into her face as though he were trying to read her thoughts I think I should give it to my brother she said Then I m d if I ll leave it to you said he She did not jump now though he had sworn at her She still stood holding his hand softly and looking down upon the bed If I were you grandfather she said almost in a whisper I would not trust myself to alter family arrangements whilst I was ill I m sure you would advise any one else against doing so And if I were to leave it to Alice she d give it to him too he said speaking his thoughts out loud What it is you see in him I never could even guess He s as ugly as a baboon with his scarred face He has never done anything to show himself a clever fellow Kate give me some of that bottle the man sent Kate handed him his medicine and then stood again by his bedside Where did he get the money to pay for his election the Squire asked as soon as he had swallowed the draught They wouldn t give such a one as him credit a yard further than they could see him I don t know where he got it said Kate lying He has not had yours has he He would not take it sir And you offered it to him Yes sir And he has not had it Not a penny of it sir And what made you offer it to him after what I said to you Because it was my own said Kate stoutly You re the biggest idiot that ever I heard of and you ll know it yourself some day Go away now and let me know when Gogram comes She went away and for a time employed herself about her ordinary household work Then she sat down alone in the dingy old dining room to think what had better be done in her present circumstances The carpet of the room was worn out as were also the covers of the old chairs and the horsehair sofa which was never moved from its accustomed place along the wall It was not a comfortable Squire s residence this old house at Vavasor In the last twenty years no money had been spent on furniture or embellishments and for the last ten years there had been no painting either inside or out Twenty years ago the Squire had been an embarrassed man and had taken a turn in his life and had lived sparingly It could not be said that he had become a miser His table was kept plentifully and there had never been want in his house In some respects too he had behaved liberally to Kate and to others and he had kept up the timber and fences on the property But the house had become wretched in its dull sombre dirty darkness and the gardens round it were as bad What ought she now to do She believed that her grandfather s last days were coming and she knew that others of the family should be with him besides herself For their sakes for his and for her own it would be proper that she should not be alone there when he died But for whom should she send Her brother was the natural heir and would be the head of the family Her duty to him was clear and the more so as her grandfather was at this moment speaking of changes in his will But it was a question to her whether George s presence at Vavasor even if he would come would not at this moment do more harm than good to his own interests It would make some prejudicial change in the old man s will more probable instead of less so George would not become soft and mild spoken even by a death bed side and it would be likely enough that the Squire would curse his heir with his dying breath She might send for her uncle John but if she did so without telling George she would be treating George unfairly and she knew that it was improbable that her uncle and her brother should act together in anything Her aunt Greenow she thought would come to her and her presence would not influence the Squire in any way with reference to the property So she made up her mind at last that she would ask her aunt to come to Vavasor and that she would tell her brother accurately all that she could tell leaving him to come or stay as he might think Alice would no doubt learn all the facts from him and her uncle John would hear them from Alice Then they could do as they pleased As soon as mister Gogram had been there she would write her letters and they should be sent over to Shap early on the following morning mister Gogram came and was closeted with the Squire and the doctor also came The doctor saw Kate and shaking his head told her that her grandfather was sinking lower and lower every hour It would be infinitely better for him if he would take that port wine at four doses in the day or even at two instead of taking it all together Kate promised to try again but stated her conviction that the trial would be useless The doctor when pressed on the matter said that his patient might probably live a week not improbably a fortnight perhaps a month if he would be obedient and so forth Gogram went away without seeing Kate and Kate who looked upon a will as an awful and somewhat tedious ceremony was in doubt whether her grandfather would live to complete any new operation But in truth the will had been made and signed and witnessed the parish clerk and one of the tenants having been had up into the room as witnesses Kate knew that the men had been there but still did not think that a new will had been perfected That evening when it was dusk the Squire came into the dining room having been shuffling about the grand sweep before the house for a quarter of an hour The day was cold and the wind bleak but still he would go out and Kate had wrapped him up carefully in mufflers and great coats Now he came in to what he called dinner and Kate sat down with him He had drank no wine that day although she had brought it to him twice during the morning Now he attempted to swallow a little soup but failed and after that while Kate was eating her bit of chicken had the decanter put before him I can t eat and I suppose it won t hurt you if I take my wine at once he said It went against the grain with him even yet that he could not wait till the cloth was gone from the table but his impatience for the only sustenance that he could take was too much for him But you should eat something sir will you have a bit of toast to sop in your wine The word sop was badly chosen and made the old Squire angry Sopped toast why am I to spoil the only thing I can enjoy But the wine would do you more good if you would take something with it Good Nothing will do me any good any more As for eating you know I can t eat What s the use of bothering me Then he filled his second glass and paused awhile before he put it to his lips He never exceeded four glasses but the four he was determined that he would have as long as he could lift them to his mouth Kate finished or pretended to finish her dinner within five minutes in order that the table might be made to look comfortable for him Then she poked the fire and brushed up the hearth and closed the old curtains with her own hands moving about silently As she moved his eye followed her and when she came behind his chair and pushed the decanter a little more within his reach he put out his rough hairy hand and laid it upon one of hers which she had rested on the table with a tenderness that was unusual with him You are a good girl Kate I wish you had been a boy that s all If I had I shouldn t perhaps have been here to take care of you she said smiling No you d have been like your brother no doubt Not that I think there could have been two so bad as he is Oh grandfather if he has offended you you should try to forgive him Try to forgive him How often have I forgiven him without any trying Why did he come down here the other day and insult me for the last time Why didn t he keep away as I had bidden him But you gave him leave to see you sir I didn t give him leave to treat me like that Never mind he will find that old as I am I can punish an insult You haven t done anything sir to injure him said Kate I have made another will that s all Do you suppose I had that man here all the way from Penrith for nothing But it isn t done yet I tell you it is done If I left him the whole property it would be gone in two years time What s the use of doing it But for his life sir You had promised him that he should have it for his life How dare you tell me that I never promised him As my heir he would have had it all if he would have behaved himself with common decency Even though I disliked him as I always have done he should have had it And you have taken it from him altogether I shall answer no questions about it Kate Then a fit of coughing came upon him his four glasses of wine having been all taken and there was no further talk about business During the evening Kate read a chapter of the Bible out loud But the Squire was very impatient under the reading and positively refused permission for a second There isn t any good in so much of it all at once he said using almost exactly the same words which Kate had used to him about the port wine There may have been good produced by the small quantity to which he listened as there is good from the physic which children take with wry faces most unwillingly Who can say For many weeks past Kate had begged her uncle to allow the clergyman of Vavasor to come to him but he had positively declined The vicar was a young man to whom the living had lately been given by the Chancellor and he had commenced his career by giving instant offence to the Squire This vicar s predecessor had been an old man almost as old as the Squire himself and had held the living for forty years He had been a Westmoreland man had read the prayers and preached his one Sunday sermon in a Westmoreland dialect getting through the whole operation rather within an hour and a quarter He had troubled none of his parishioners by much advice and had been meek and obedient to the Squire Knowing the country well and being used to its habits he had lived and been charitable too on the proceeds of his living which had never reached two hundred a year But the new comer was a close fisted man with higher ideas of personal comfort who found it necessary to make every penny go as far as possible who made up in preaching for what he could not give away in charity who established an afternoon service and who had rebuked the Squire for saying that the doing so was trash and nonsense Since that the Squire had never been inside the church except on the occasion of Christmas day For this indeed the state of his health gave ample excuse but he had positively refused to see the vicar though that gentleman had assiduously called and had at last desired the servant to tell the clergyman not to come again unless he were sent for Kate s task was therefore difficult both as regarded the temporal and spiritual wants of her grandfather When the reading was finished the old man dozed in his chair for half an hour He would not go up to bed before the enjoyment of that luxury He was daily implored to do so because that sleep in the chair interfered so fatally with his chance of sleeping in bed But sleep in his chair he would and did Then he woke and after a fit of coughing was induced with much ill humour to go up to his room Kate had never seen him so weak He was hardly able even with her assistance and that of the old servant to get up the broad stairs But there was still some power left to him for violence of language after he got to his room and he rated Kate and the old woman loudly because his slippers were not in the proper place Grandfather said Kate would you like me to stay in the room with you to night He rated her again for this proposition and then with assistance from the nurse he was gotten into bed and was left alone Illustration The last of the old squire After that Kate went to her own room and wrote her letters The first she wrote was to her aunt Greenow That was easily enough written To missus Greenow it was not necessary that she should say anything about money She simply stated her belief that her grandfather s last day was near at hand and begged her aunt to come and pay a last visit to the old man It will be a great comfort to me in my distress she said and it will be a satisfaction to you to have seen your father again She knew that her aunt would come and that task was soon done But her letter to her brother was much more difficult What should she tell him and what should she not tell him She began by describing her grandfather s state and by saying to him as she had done to missus Greenow that she believed the old man s hours were well nigh come to a close She told him that she had asked her aunt to come to her not she said that I think her coming will be of material service but I feel the loneliness of the house will be too much for me at such a time I must leave it for you to decide she said whether you had better be here If anything should happen people when writing such letters are always afraid to speak of death by its proper name I will send you a message and no doubt you would come at once Then came the question of the will Had it not occurred to her that her own interests were involved she would have said nothing on the subject but she feared her brother feared even his misconstruction of her motives even though she was willing to sacrifice so much on his behalf and therefore she resolved to tell him all that she knew He might turn upon her hereafter if she did not do so and accuse her of a silence which had been prejudicial to him So she told it all and the letter became long in the telling I write with a heavy heart she said because I know it will be a great blow to you He gave me to understand that in this will he left everything away from you I cannot declare that he said so directly Indeed I cannot remember his words but that was the impression he left on me The day before he had asked me what I should do if he gave me the estate but of course I treated that as a joke I have no idea what he put into his will I have not even attempted to guess But now I have told you all that I know The letter was a very long one and was not finished till late but when it was completed she had the two taken out into the kitchen as the boy was to start with them before daylight Early on the next morning she crept silently into her grandfather s room as was her habit but he was apparently sleeping and then she crept back again The old servant told her that the Squire had been awake at four and at five and at six and had called for her Then he had seemed to go to sleep Four or five times in the course of the morning Kate went into the room but her grandfather did not notice her At last she feared he might already have passed away and she put her hand upon his shoulder and down his arm He then gently touched her hand with his showing her plainly that he was not only alive but conscious She then offered him food the thin porridge which he was wont to take and the medicine She offered him some wine too but he would take nothing At twelve o clock a letter was brought to her which had come by the post She saw that it was from Alice and opening it found that it was very long At that moment she could not read it but she saw words in it that made her wish to know its contents as quickly as possible But she could not leave her grandfather then At two o clock the doctor came to him and remained there till the dusk of the evening had commenced At eight o clock the old man was dead CHAPTER LIV Showing How Alice Was Punished Poor Kate s condition at the old Hall on that night was very sad The presence of death is always a source of sorrow even though the circumstances of the case are of a kind to create no agony of grief The old man who had just passed away up stairs was fully due to go He had lived his span all out and had himself known that to die was the one thing left for him to do Kate also had expected his death and had felt that the time had come in which it would be foolish even to wish that it should be arrested But death close to one is always sad as it is solemn And she was quite alone at Vavasor Hall She had no acquaintance within some miles of her From the young vicar though she herself had not quarrelled with him she could receive no comfort as she hardly knew him nor was she of a temperament which would dispose her to turn to a clergyman at such a time for comfort unless to one who might have been an old friend Her aunt and brother would probably both come to her but they could hardly be with her for a day or two and during that day or two it would be needful that orders should be given which it is disagreeable for a woman to have to give The servants moreover in the house were hardly fit to assist her much There was an old butler or footman who had lived at the Hall for more than fifty years but he was crippled with rheumatism and so laden with maladies that he rarely crept out of his own room He was simply an additional burden on the others There was a boy who had lately done all the work which the other should have done and ever so much more beside There is no knowing how much work such a boy will do when properly drilled and he was now Kate s best minister in her distress There was the old nurse but she had been simply good for nursing and there were two rough Westmoreland girls who called themselves cook and housemaid On that first evening the very day on which her grandfather had died Kate would have been more comfortable had she really found something that she could do But there was in truth nothing She hovered for an hour or two in and out of the room conscious of the letter which she had in her pocket and very desirous in heart of reading it but restrained by a feeling that at such a moment she ought to think only of the dead In this she was wrong Let the living think of the dead when their thoughts will travel that way whether the thinker wish it or no Grief taken up because grief is supposed to be proper is only one degree better than pretended grief When one sees it one cannot but think of the lady who asked her friend in confidence whether hot roast fowl and bread sauce were compatible with the earliest state of weeds or of that other lady a royal lady she who was much comforted in the tedium of her trouble when assured by one of the lords about the Court that piquet was mourning It was late at night near eleven before Kate took out her letter and read it As something of my story hangs upon it I will give it at length though it was a long letter It had been written with great struggles and with many tears and Kate as she read it to the end almost forgot that her grandfather was lying dead in the room above her Queen Anne Street April one hundred eighty six DEAREST KATE I hardly know how to write to you what I have to tell and yet I must tell it I must tell it to you but I shall never repeat the story to any one else I should have written yesterday when it occurred but I was so ill that I felt myself unable to make the exertion Indeed at one time after your brother had left me I almost doubted whether I should ever be able to collect my thoughts again My dismay was at first so great that my reason for a time deserted me and I could only sit and cry like an idiot Dear Kate I hope you will not be angry with me for telling you I have endeavoured to think about it as calmly as I can and I believe that I have no alternative The fact that your brother has quarrelled with me cannot be concealed from you and I must not leave him to tell you of the manner of it He came to me yesterday in great anger His anger then was nothing to what it became afterwards but even when he first came in he was full of wrath He stood up before me and asked me how it had come to pass that I had sent him the money which he had asked of me through the hands of mister Grey Of course I had not done this and so I told him at once I had spoken of the matter to no one but papa and he had managed it for me Even now I know nothing of it and as I have not yet spoken to papa I cannot understand it George at once told me that he disbelieved me and when I sat quiet under this insult he used harsher words and said that I had conspired to lower him before the world He then asked me whether I loved him Oh Kate I must tell it you all though it is dreadful to me that I should have to write it You remember how it came to pass when we were in Westmoreland together at Christmas Do not think that I am blaming you but I was very rash then in the answers which I made to him I thought that I could be useful to him as his wife and I had told myself that it would be good that I should be of use in some way When he asked me that question yesterday I sat silent Indeed how could I have answered it in the affirmative when he had just used such language to me while he was standing opposite to me looking at me in that way which he has when he is enraged Then he spoke again and demanded of me that I should at once send back to mister Grey all presents of his which I had kept and at the same time took up and threw across the table on to the sofa near me a little paper knife which mister Grey once gave me I could not allow myself to be so ordered by him so I said nothing but put the knife back upon the table He then took it again and threw it beneath the grate I have a right to look upon you as my wife he said and as such I will not allow you to keep that man s things about you I think I told him then that I should never become his wife but though I remember many of his words I remember none of my own He swore I know with a great oath that if I went back a second time from my word to him he would leave me no peace that he would punish me for my perfidy with some fearful punishment Oh Kate I cannot tell you what he looked like He had then come quite close to me and I know that I trembled before him as though he were going to strike me Of course I said nothing What could I say to a man who behaved to me in such a manner Then as far as I can remember it he sat down and began to talk about money I forget what he said at first but I know that I assured him that he might take what he wanted so long as enough was left to prevent my being absolutely a burden on papa That madam is a matter of course he said I remember those words so well Then he explained that after what had passed between us I had no right to ruin him by keeping back from him money which had been promised to him and which was essential to his success In this dear Kate I think he was mainly right But he could not have been right in putting it to me in that hard cruel manner especially as I had never refused anything that he had asked of me in respect of money The money he may have while it lasts but then there must be an end of it all between us even though he should have the power of punishing me as he says he will do Punishing me indeed What punishment can be so hard as that which he has already inflicted He then desired me to write a letter to him which he might show to the lawyer to our own lawyer I think he meant in order that money might be raised to pay back what mister Grey had advanced and give him what he now required I think he said it was to be five thousand pounds When he asked this I did not move Indeed I was unable to move Then he spoke very loud and swore at me again and brought me pen and ink demanding that I should write the letter I was so frightened that I thought of running to the door to escape and I would have done so had I not distrusted my own power Had it been to save my life I could not have written the letter I believe I was now crying at any rate I threw myself back and covered my face with my hands Then he came and sat by me and took hold of my arms Oh Kate I cannot tell it you all He put his mouth close to my ear and said words which were terrible though I did not understand them I do not know what it was he said but he was threatening me with his anger if I did not obey him Before he left me I believe I found my voice to tell him that he should certainly have the money which he required And so he shall I will go to mister Round myself and insist on its being done My money is my own and I may do with it as I please But I hope I am obliged to hope that I may never be made to see my cousin again I will not pretend to express any opinion as to the cause of all this It is very possible that you will not believe all I say that you will think that I am mad and have deluded myself Of course your heart will prompt you to accuse me rather than him If it is so and if there must therefore be a division between us my grief will be greatly increased but I do not know that I can help it I cannot keep all this back from you He has cruelly ill used me and insulted me He has treated me as I should have thought no man could have treated a woman As regards money I did all that I could do to show that I trusted him thoroughly and my confidence has only led to suspicion I do not know whether he understands that everything must be over between us but if not I must ask you to tell him so And I must ask you to explain to him that he must not come again to Queen Anne Street If he does nothing shall induce me to see him Tell him also that the money that he wants shall assuredly be sent to him as soon as I can make mister Round get it Dearest Kate good bye I hope you will feel for me If you do not answer me I shall presume that you think yourself bound to support his side and to believe me to have been wrong It will make me very unhappy but I shall remember that you are his sister and I shall not be angry with you Yours always affectionately ALICE VAVASOR Kate as she read her letter through at first quickly and then very slowly came by degrees almost to forget that death was in the house Her mind and heart and brain were filled with thoughts and feelings that had exclusive reference to Alice and her brother and at last she found herself walking the room with quick impetuous steps while her blood was hot with indignation All her sympathies in the matter were with Alice It never occurred to her to disbelieve a word of the statement made to her or to suggest to herself that it had been coloured by any fears or exaggerations on the part of her correspondent She knew that Alice was true And moreover much as she loved her brother willing as she had been and would still be to risk all that she possessed and herself also on his behalf she knew that it would be risking and not trusting She loved her brother such love having come to her by nature and having remained with her from of old and in his intellect she still believed But she had ceased to have belief in his conduct She feared everything that he might do and lived with a consciousness that though she was willing to connect all her own fortunes with his she had much reason to expect that she might encounter ruin in doing so Her sin had been in this that she had been anxious to subject Alice to the same danger that she had intrigued sometimes very meanly to bring about the object which she had at heart that she had used all her craft to separate Alice from mister Grey Perhaps it may be alleged in her excuse that she had thought had hoped rather than thought that the marriage which she contemplated would change much in her brother that was wrong and bring him into a mode of life that would not be dangerous Might not she and Alice together so work upon him that he should cease to stand ever on the brink of some half seen precipice To risk herself for her brother was noble But when she used her cunning in inducing her cousin to share that risk she was ignoble Of this she had herself some consciousness as she walked up and down the old dining room at midnight holding her cousin s letter in her hand Her cheeks became tinged with shame as she thought of the scene which Alice had described the toy thrown beneath the grate the loud curses the whispered threats which had been more terrible than curses the demand for money made with something worse than a cut throat s violence the strong man s hand placed upon the woman s arm in anger and in rage those eyes glaring and the gaping horror of that still raw cicatrice as he pressed his face close to that of his victim Not for a moment did she think of defending him She accused him to herself vehemently of a sin over and above those sins which had filled Alice with dismay He had demanded money from the girl whom he intended to marry According to Kate s idea nothing could excuse or palliate this sin Alice had accounted it as nothing had expressed her opinion that the demand was reasonable even now after the ill usage to which she had been subjected she had declared that the money should be forthcoming and given to the man who had treated her so shamefully It might be well that Alice should so feel and so act but it behoved Kate to feel and act very differently She would tell her brother even in the house of death should he come there that his conduct was mean and unmanly Kate was no coward She declared to herself that she would do this even though he should threaten her with all his fury though he should glare upon her with all the horrors of his countenance One o clock and two o clock still found her in the dark sombre parlour every now and then pacing the floor of the room The fire had gone out and though it was now the middle of April she began to feel the cold But she would not go to bed before she had written a line to Alice To her brother a message by telegraph would of course be sent the next morning as also would she send a message to her aunt But to Alice she would write though it might be but a line Cold as she was she found her pens and paper and wrote her letter that night It was very short Dear Alice to day I received your letter and to day our poor old grandfather died Tell my uncle John with my love of his father s death You will understand that I cannot write much now about that other matter but I must tell you even at such a moment as this that there shall be no quarrel between you and me There shall be none at least on my side I cannot say more till a few days shall have passed by He is lying up stairs a corpse I have telegraphed to George and I suppose he will come down I think my aunt Greenow will come also as I had written to her before seeing that I wanted the comfort of having her here Uncle John will of course come or not as he thinks fitting I don t know whether I am in a position to say that I shall be glad to see him but I should be very glad He and you will know that I can as yet tell you nothing further The lawyer is to see the men about the funeral Nothing I suppose will be done till George comes Your own cousin and friend KATE VAVASOR And then she added a line below My own Alice If you will let me you shall be my sister and be the nearest to me and the dearest Alice when she received this was at the first moment so much struck and indeed surprised by the tidings of her grandfather s death that she was forced in spite of the still existing violence of her own feelings to think and act chiefly with reference to that event Her father had not then left his room She therefore went to him and handed him Kate s letter Papa she said there is news from Westmoreland bad news which you hardly expected yet My father is dead said John Vavasor Whereupon Alice gave him Kate s letter that he might read it Of course I shall go down he said as he came to that part in which Kate had spoken of him Does she think I shall not follow my father to the grave because I dislike her brother What does she mean by saying that there shall be no quarrel between you and her I will explain that at another time said Alice John Vavasor asked no further questions then but declared at first that he should go to Westmoreland on the following day Then he altered his purpose I ll go by the mail train to night he said It will be very disagreeable but I ought to be there when the will is opened There was very little more said in Queen Anne Street on the subject till the evening till a few moments before mister Vavasor left his house He indeed had thought nothing more about that quarrelling or rather that promise that there should be no quarrelling between the girls He still regarded his nephew George as the man who unfortunately was to be his son in law and now during this tedious sad day in which he felt himself compelled to remain at home he busied his mind in thinking of George and Alice as living together at the old Hall At six the father and daughter dined and soon after dinner mister Vavasor went up to his own room to prepare himself for his journey After a while Alice followed him but she did not do so till she knew that if anything was to be told before the journey no further time could be lost Papa she said as soon as she had shut the door behind her I think I ought to tell you before you go that everything is over between me and George Have you quarrelled with him too said her father with uncontrolled surprise I should perhaps say that he has quarrelled with me But dear papa pray do not question me at present I will tell you all when you come back but I thought it right that you should know this before you went It has been his doing then I cannot explain it to you in a hurry like this Papa you may understand something of the shame which I feel and you should not question me now And John Grey There is nothing different in regard to him I ll be shot if I can understand you George you know has had two thousand pounds of your money of yours or somebody else s Well we can t talk about it now as I must be off Thinking as I do of George I m glad of it that s all Then he went and Alice was left alone to comfort herself as best she might by her own reflections George Vavasor had received the message on the day previous to that on which Alice s letter had reached her but it had not come to him till late in the day He might have gone down by the mail train of that night but there were one or two persons his own attorney especially whom he wished to see before the reading of his grandfather s will He remained in town therefore on the following day and went down by the same train as that which took his uncle Walking along the platform looking for a seat he peered into a carriage and met his uncle s eye The two saw each other but did not speak and George passed on to another carriage On the following morning before the break of day they met again in the refreshment room at the station at Lancaster So my father has gone George said the uncle speaking to the nephew They must go to the same house and mister Vavasor felt that it would be better that they should be on speaking terms when they reached it Yes said George he has gone at last I wonder what we shall find to have been his latest act of injustice The reader will remember that he had received Kate s first letter in which she had told him of the Squire s altered will John Vavasor turned away disgusted His finer feelings were perhaps not very strong but he had no thoughts or hopes in reference to the matter which were mean He expected nothing himself and did not begrudge his nephew the inheritance At this moment he was thinking of the old Squire as a father who had ever been kind to him It might be natural that George should have no such old affection at his heart but it was unnatural that he should express himself as he had done at such a moment The uncle turned away but said nothing George followed him with a little proposition of his own We shan t get any conveyance at Shap he said Hadn t we better go over in a chaise from Kendal To this the uncle assented and so they finished their journey together George smoked all the time that they were in the carriage and very few words were spoken As they drove up to the old house they found that another arrival had taken place before them missus Greenow having reached the house in some vehicle from the Shap station She had come across from Norwich to Manchester where she had joined the train which had brought the uncle and nephew from London CHAPTER LV The Will The coming of missus Greenow at this very moment was a great comfort to Kate Without her she would hardly have known how to bear herself with her uncle and her brother As it was they were all restrained by something of the courtesy which strangers are bound to show to each other George had never seen his aunt since he was a child and some sort of introduction was necessary between them So you are George said missus Greenow putting out her hand and smiling Yes I m George said he And a Member of Parliament said missus Greenow It s quite an honour to the family I felt so proud when I heard it She said this pleasantly meaning it to be taken for truth and then turned away to her brother Papa s time was fully come she said though to tell the truth I had no idea that he was so weak as Kate describes him to have been Nor I either said John Vavasor He went to church with us here on Christmas day Did he indeed Dear dear He seems at last to have gone off just like poor Greenow Here she put her handkerchief up to her face I think you didn t know Greenow John I met him once said her brother Ah he wasn t to be known and understood in that way I m aware there was a little prejudice because of his being in trade but we won t talk of that now Where should I have been without him tradesman or no tradesman I ve no doubt he was an excellent man You may say that John Ah well we can t keep everything in this life for ever It may perhaps be as well to explain now that missus Greenow had told Captain Bellfield at their last meeting before she left Norwich that under certain circumstances if he behaved himself well there might possibly be ground of hope Whereupon Captain Bellfield had immediately gone to the best tailor in that city had told the man of his coming marriage and had given an extensive order But the tailor had not as yet supplied the goods waiting for more credible evidence of the Captain s good fortune We re all grass of the field said missus Greenow lightly brushing a tear from her eye and must be cut down and put into the oven in our turns Her brother uttered a slight sympathetic groan shaking his head in testimony of the uncertainty of human affairs and then said that he would go out and look about the place George in the meantime had asked his sister to show him his room and the two were already together up stairs Kate had made up her mind that she would say nothing about Alice at the present moment nothing if it could be avoided till after the funeral She led the way up stairs almost trembling with fear for she knew that that other subject of the will would also give rise to trouble and sorrow perhaps also to determined quarrelling What has brought that woman here was the first question that George asked I asked her to come said Kate And why did you ask her to come here said George angrily Kate immediately felt that he was speaking as though he were master of the house and also as though he intended to be master of her As regarded the former idea she had no objection to it She thoroughly and honestly wished that he might be the master and though she feared that he might find himself mistaken in his assumption she herself was not disposed to deny any appearance of right that he might take upon himself in that respect But she had already begun to tell herself that she must not submit herself to his masterdom She had gradually so taught herself since he had compelled her to write the first letter in which Alice had been asked to give her money I asked her George before my poor grandfather s death when I thought that he would linger perhaps for weeks My life here alone with him without any other woman in the house beside the servants was very melancholy Why did you not ask Alice to come to you Alice could not have come said Kate after a short pause I don t know why she shouldn t have come I won t have that woman about the place She disgraced herself by marrying a blacksmith Why George it was you yourself who advised me to go and stay with her That s a very different thing Now that he s dead and she s got his money it s all very well that you should go to her occasionally but I won t have her here It s natural that she should come to her father s house at her father s death bed I hate to be told that things are natural It always means humbug I don t suppose she cared for the old man any more than I did or than she cared for the other old man who married her People are such intense hypocrites There s my uncle John pulling a long face because he has come into this house and he will pull it as long as the body lies up there and yet for the last twenty years there s nothing on earth he has so much hated as going to see his father When are they going to bury him On Saturday the day after to morrow Why couldn t they do it to morrow so that we could get away before Sunday He only died on Monday George said Kate solemnly Psha Who has got the will mister Gogram He was here yesterday and told me to tell you and uncle John that he would have it with him when he came back from the funeral What has my uncle John to do with it said George sharply I shall go over to Penrith this afternoon and make Gogram give it up to me I don t think he ll do that George What right has he to keep it What right has he to it at all How do I know that he has really got the old man s last will Where did my grandfather keep his papers In that old secretary as he used to call it the one that stands in the dining room It is sealed up Who sealed it mister Gogram did mister Gogram and I together What the deuce made you meddle with it I merely assisted him But I believe he was quite right I think it is usual in such cases Balderdash You are thinking of some old trumpery of former days Till I know to the contrary everything here belongs to me as heir at law and I do not mean to allow of any interference till I know for certain that my rights have been taken from me And I won t accept a death bed will What a man chooses to write when his fingers will hardly hold the pen goes for nothing You can t suppose that I wish to interfere with your rights I hope not Oh George Well I say I hope not But I know there are those who would Do you think my uncle John would not interfere with me if he could By if he does he shall find that he does it to his cost I ll lead him such a life through the courts for the next two or three years that he ll wish that he had remained in Chancery Lane and had never left it A message was now brought up by the nurse saying that missus Greenow and mister Vavasor were going into the room where the old Squire was lying Would Miss Kate and mister George go with them mister Vavasor shouted out George making the old woman jump She did not understand his meaning in the least Yes sir the old Squire she said Will you come George Kate asked No what should I go there for Why should I pretend an interest in the dead body of a man whom I hated and who hated me whose very last act as far as I know as yet was an attempt to rob me I won t go and see him Kate went and was glad of an opportunity of getting away from her brother Every hour the idea was becoming stronger in her mind that she must in some way separate herself from him There had come upon him of late a hard ferocity which made him unendurable And then he carried to such a pitch that hatred as he called it of conventional rules that he allowed himself to be controlled by none of the ordinary bonds of society She had felt this heretofore with a nervous consciousness that she was doing wrong in endeavouring to bring about a marriage between him and Alice but this demeanour and mode of talking had now so grown upon him that Kate began to feel herself thankful that Alice had been saved Kate went up with her uncle and aunt and saw the face of her grandfather for the last time Poor dear old man said missus Greenow as the easy tears ran down her face Do you remember John how he used to scold me and say that I should never come to good He has said the same thing to you Kate I dare say He has been very kind to me said Kate standing at the foot of the bed She was not one of those whose tears stand near their eyes He was a fine old gentleman said John Vavasor belonging to days that are now gone by but by no means the less of a gentleman on that account I don t know that he ever did an unjust or ungenerous act to any one Come Kate we may as well go down missus Greenow lingered to say a word or two to the nurse of the manner in which Greenow s body was treated when Greenow was lying dead and then she followed her brother and niece George did not go into Penrith nor did he see mister Gogram till that worthy attorney came out to Vavasor Hall on the morning of the funeral He said nothing more on the subject nor did he break the seals on the old upright desk that stood in the parlour The two days before the funeral were very wretched for all the party except perhaps for missus Greenow who affected not to understand that her nephew was in a bad humour She called him poor George and treated all his incivility to herself as though it were the effect of his grief She asked him questions about Parliament which of course he didn t answer and told him little stories about poor dear Greenow not heeding his expressions of unmistakable disgust The two days at last went by and the hour of the funeral came There was the doctor and Gogram and the uncle and the nephew to follow the corpse the nephew taking upon himself ostentatiously the foremost place as though he could thereby help to maintain his pretensions as heir The clergyman met them at the little wicket gate of the churchyard having by some reasoning which we hope was satisfactory to himself overcome a resolution which he at first formed that he would not read the burial service over an unrepentant sinner But he did read it having mentioned his scruples to none but one confidential clerical friend in the same diocese I m told that you have got my grandfather s will George said to the attorney as soon as he saw him I have it in my pocket said mister Gogram and purpose to read it as soon as we return from church Is it usual to take a will away from a man s house in that way George asked Quite usual said the attorney and in this case it was done at the express desire of the testator I think it is the common practice said John Vavasor George upon this turned round at his uncle as though about to attack him but he restrained himself and said nothing though he showed his teeth The funeral was very plain and not a word was spoken by George Vavasor during the journey there and back John Vavasor asked a few questions of the doctor as to the last weeks of his father s life and it was incidentally mentioned both by the doctor and by the attorney that the old Squire s intellect had remained unimpaired up to the last moment that he had been seen by either of them When they returned to the hall missus Greenow met them with an invitation to lunch They all went to the dining room and drank each a glass of sherry George took two or three glasses The doctor then withdrew and drove himself back to Penrith where he lived Shall we go into the other room now said the attorney The three gentlemen then rose up and went across to the drawing room George leading the way The attorney followed him and John Vavasor closed the door behind them Had any observer been there to watch them he might have seen by the faces of the two latter that they expected an unpleasant meeting mister Gogram as he had walked across the hall had pulled a document out of his pocket and held it in his hand as he took a chair John Vavasor stood behind one of the chairs which had been placed at the table and leaned upon it looking across the room up at the ceiling George stood on the rug before the fire with his hands in the pockets of his trousers and his coat tails over his arms Gentlemen will you sit down said mister Gogram John Vavasor immediately sat down I prefer to stand here said George mister Gogram then opened the document before him Before that paper is read said George I think it right to say a few words I don t know what it contains but I believe it to have been executed by my grandfather only an hour or two before his death On the day before he died early in the day said the attorney Well the day before he died it is the same thing while he was dying in fact He never got out of bed afterwards He was not in bed at the time mister Vavasor Not that it would have mattered if he had been And he came down to dinner on that day I don t understand however why you make these observations If you ll listen to me you will understand I make them because I deny my grandfather s fitness to make a will in the last moments of his existence and at such an age I saw him a few weeks ago and he was not fit to be trusted with the management of property then I do not think this is the time George to put forward such objections said the uncle I think it is said George I believe that that paper purports to be an instrument by which I should be villanously defrauded if it were allowed to be held as good Therefore I protest against it now and shall question it at law if action be taken on it You can read it now if you please Oh yes I shall read said mister Gogram and I say that it is as valid a will as ever a man signed And I say it s not That s the difference between us The will was read amidst sundry interjections and expressions of anger from George which it is not necessary to repeat Nor need I trouble my readers with the will at length It began by expressing the testator s great desire that his property might descend in his own family and that the house might be held and inhabited by some one bearing the name of Vavasor He then declared that he felt himself obliged to pass over his natural heir believing that the property would not be safe in his hands he therefore left it in trust to his son John Vavasor whom he appointed to be sole executor of his will He devised it to George s eldest son should George ever marry and have a son as soon as he might reach the age of twenty five In the meantime the property should remain in the hands of John Vavasor for his use and benefit with a lien on it of five hundred a year to be paid annually to his granddaughter Kate In the event of George having no son the property was to go to the eldest son of Kate or failing that to the eldest son of his other granddaughter who might take the name of Vavasor All his personal property he left to his son John Vavasor And mister Vavasor said the attorney as he finished his reading you will I fear get very little by that latter clause The estate now owes nothing but I doubt whether the Squire had fifty pounds in his banker s hands when he died and the value of the property about the place is very small He has been unwilling to spend anything during the last ten years but has paid off every shilling that the property owed It is as I supposed said George His voice was very unpleasant and so was the fire of his eyes and the ghastly rage of his scarred face The old man has endeavoured in his anger to rob me of everything because I would not obey him in his wickedness when I was here with him a short while before he died Such a will as that can stand nowhere As to that I have nothing to say at present said the attorney Where is his other will the one he made before that If I remember rightly we executed two before this And where are they It is not my business to know mister Vavasor I believe that I saw him destroy one but I have no absolute knowledge As to the other I can say nothing And what do you mean to do said George turning to his uncle Do I shall carry out the will I have no alternative Your sister is the person chiefly interested under it She gets five hundred a year for her life and if she marries and you don t or if she has a son and you don t her son will have the whole property George stood for a few moments thinking Might it not be possible that by means of Alice and Kate together by marrying the former perhaps he might still obtain possession of the property But that which he wanted was the command of the property at once the power of raising money upon it instantly The will had been so framed as to make that impossible in any way Kate s share in it had not been left to her unconditionally but was to be received even by her through the hands of her uncle John Such a will shut him out from all his hopes It is a piece of d roguery he said What do you mean by that sir said Gogram turning round towards him I mean exactly what I say It is a piece of d roguery Who was in the room when that thing was written The signature was witnessed by I don t ask as to the signature Who was in the room when the thing was written I was here with your grandfather And no one else No one else The presence of any one else at such a time would be very unusual Then I regard the document simply as waste paper After saying this George Vavasor left the room and slammed the door after him I never was insulted in such a way before said the attorney almost with tears in his eyes He is a disappointed and I fear a ruined man said John Vavasor I do not think you need regard what he says But he should not on that account insult me I have only done my duty I did not even advise his grandfather It is mean on his part and unmanly If he comes in my way again I shall tell him so He probably will not put himself in your way again mister Gogram Then the attorney went having suggested to mister Vavasor that he should instruct his attorney in London to take steps in reference to the proving of the will It s as good a will as ever was made said mister Gogram If he can set that aside I ll give up making wills altogether Who was to tell Kate That was John Vavasor s first thought when he was left alone at the hall door after seeing the lawyer start away And how was he to get himself back to London without further quarrelling with his nephew And what was he to do at once with reference to the immediate duties of proprietorship which were entailed upon him as executor It was by no means improbable as he thought that George might assume to himself the position of master of the house that he might demand the keys for instance which no doubt were in Kate s hands at present and that he would take possession with violence What should he do under such circumstances It was clear that he could not run away and get back to his club by the night mail train He had duties there at the Hall and these duties were of a nature to make him almost regret the position in which his father s will had placed him Eventually he would gain some considerable increase to his means but the immediate effect would be terribly troublesome As he looked up at the melancholy pines which were slowly waving their heads in the wind before the door he declared to himself that he would sell his inheritance and his executorship very cheaply if such a sale were possible In the dining room he found his sister alone Well John said she well How is it left Where is Kate he asked She has gone out with her brother Did he take his hat Oh yes He asked her to walk and she went with him at once Then I suppose he will tell her said John Vavasor After that he explained the circumstances of the will to missus Greenow Bravo exclaimed the widow I m delighted I love Kate dearly and now she can marry almost whom she pleases CHAPTER LVI Another Walk on the Fells George when he left the room in which he had insulted the lawyer went immediately across to the parlour in which his aunt and sister were sitting Kate said he put on your hat and come and walk with me That business is over Kate s hat and shawl were in the room and they were out of the house together within a minute They walked down the carriage road through the desolate untenanted grounds to the gate before either of them spoke a word Kate was waiting for George to tell her of the will but did not dare to ask any question George intended to tell her of the will but was not disposed to do so without some preparation It was a thing not to be spoken of open mouthed as a piece of ordinary news Which way shall we go said Kate as soon as they had passed through the old rickety gate which swung at the entrance of the place Up across the fell said George the day is fine and I want to get away from my uncle for a time She turned round therefore outside the hill of firs and led the way back to the beacon wood through which she and Alice had walked across to Haweswater upon a memorable occasion They had reached the top of the beacon hill and were out upon the Fell before George had begun his story Kate was half beside herself with curiosity but still she was afraid to ask Well said George when they paused a moment as they stepped over a plank that crossed the boundary ditch of the wood don t you want to know what that dear old man has done for you Then he looked into her face very steadfastly But perhaps you know already he added He had come out determined not to quarrel with his sister He had resolved in that moment of thought which had been allowed to him that his best hope for the present required that he should keep himself on good terms with her at any rate till he had settled what line of conduct he would pursue But he was in truth so sore with anger and disappointment he had become so nearly mad with that continued unappeased wrath in which he now indulged against all the world that he could not refrain himself from bitter words He was as one driven by the Furies and was no longer able to control them in their driving of him I know nothing of it said Kate Had I known I should have told you Your question is unjust to me I am beginning to doubt said he whether a man can be safe in trusting any one My grandfather has done his best to rob me of the property altogether I told you that I feared he would do so And he has made you his heir Me Yes you He told me distinctly that he would not do that But he has I tell you Then George I shall do that which I told him I should do in the event of his making such a will for he asked me the question I told him I should restore the estate to you and upon that he swore that he would not leave it to me And what a fool you were said he stopping her in the pathway What an ass Why did you tell him that You knew that he would not on that account do justice to me He asked me George Psha now you have ruined me and you might have saved me But I will save you still if he has left the estate to me I do not desire to take it from you As God in heaven sees me I have never ceased to endeavour to protect your interests here at Vavasor I will sign anything necessary to make over my right in the property to you Then they walked on over the Fell for some minutes without speaking They were still on the same path that path which Kate and Alice had taken in the winter and now poor Kate could not but think of all that she had said that day on George s behalf how had she mingled truth and falsehood in her efforts to raise her brother s character in her cousin s eyes It had all been done in vain At this very moment of her own trouble Kate thought of John Grey and repented of what she had done Her hopes in that direction were altogether blasted She knew that her brother had ill treated Alice and that she must tell him so if Alice s name were mentioned between them She could no longer worship her brother and hold herself at his command in all things But as regarded the property to which he was naturally the heir if any act of hers could give it to him that act would be done If the will is as you say George I will make over my right to you You can make over nothing he answered The old robber has been too cunning for that he has left it all in the hands of my uncle John D him D them both George George he is dead now Dead of course he is dead What of that I wish he had been dead ten years ago or twenty Do you suppose I am to forgive him because he is dead I ll heap his grave with curses if that can be of avail to punish him You can only punish the living that way And I will punish them but not by cursing them My uncle John shall have such a life of it for the next year or two that he shall bitterly regret the hour in which he has stepped between me and my rights I do not believe that he has done so Not done so What was he down here for at Christmas Do you pretend to think that that make believe will was concocted without his knowledge I m sure that he knew nothing of it I don t think my grandfather s mind was made up a week before he died You ll have to swear that remember in a court I m not going to let the matter rest I can tell you You ll have to prove that How long is it since he asked you what you would do with the estate if he left it to you Kate thought for a moment before she answered It was only two days before he died if I remember rightly But you must remember rightly You ll have to swear to it And now tell me this honestly do you believe in your heart that he was in a condition fit for making a will I advised him not to make it Why why What reason did you give I told him that I thought no man should alter family arrangements when he was so ill Exactly You told him that And what did he say He was very angry and made me send for mister Gogram Now Kate think a little before you answer me again If ever you are to do me a good turn you must do it now And remember this I don t at all want to take anything away from you Whatever you think is fair you shall have He was a fool not to have known her better than that I want nothing she said stopping and stamping with her foot upon the crushed heather George you don t understand what it is to be honest He smiled with a slight provoking smile that passed very rapidly from his face The meaning of the smile was to be read had Kate been calm enough to read it I can t say that I do That was the meaning of the smile Well never mind about that said he you advised my grandfather not to make his will thinking no doubt that his mind was not clear enough She paused a moment again before she answered him His mind was clear she said but I thought that he should not trust his judgement while he was so weak Look here Kate I do believe that you at any rate have no mind to assist in this robbery That it is a robbery you can t have any doubt I said he had left the estate to you That is not what he has done He has left the estate to my uncle John Why tell me then what was untrue Are you disappointed Of course I am uncle John won t give it you George I don t understand you I don t indeed Never mind about that but listen to me The estate is left in the hands of John Vavasor but he has left you five hundred a year out of it till somebody is twenty five years old who is not yet born and probably never will be born The will itself shows the old fool to have been mad He was no more mad than you are George Listen to me I tell you I don t mean that he was a raging maniac Now you had advised him not to make any new will because you thought he was not in a fit condition Yes I did You can swear to that I hope I may not be called on to do so I hope there may be no swearing about it But if I am asked the question I must swear it Exactly Now listen till you understand what it is I mean That will if it stands gives all the power over the estate to John Vavasor It renders you quite powerless as regards any help or assistance that you might be disposed to give to me But nevertheless your interest under the will is greater than his or than that of any one else for your son would inherit if I have none Do you understand Yes I think so And your testimony as to the invalidity of the will would be conclusive against all the world I would say in a court what I have told you if that will do any good It will not be enough Look here Kate you must be steadfast here everything depends on you How often have you told me that you will stick to me throughout life Now you will be tried Kate felt that her repugnance towards him towards all that he was doing and wished her to do was growing stronger within her at every word he spoke She was becoming gradually aware that he desired from her something which she could not and would not do and she was aware also that in refusing him she would have to encounter him in all his wrath She set her teeth firmly together and clenched her little fist If a fight was necessary she would fight with him As he looked at her closely with his sinister eyes her love towards him was almost turned to hatred But that was what you meant when you advised him not to make the will because you thought his intellect was impaired No not so Stop Kate stop If you will think of it It was so What is the meaning of his judgement being weak I didn t say his judgement was weak But that was what you meant when you advised him not to trust it Look here George I think I know now what you mean If anybody asks me if his mind was gone or his intellect deranged I cannot say that there was anything of the kind You will not Certainly not It would be untrue Then you are determined to throw me over and claim the property for yourself Again he turned towards and looked at her as though he were resolved to frighten her And I am to count you also among my enemies You had better take care Kate They were now upon the fell side more than three miles away from the Hall and Kate as she looked round saw that they were all alone Not a cottage not a sign of humanity was within sight Kate saw that it was so and was aware that the fact pressed itself upon her as being of importance Then she thought again of her resolution to fight with him if any fight were necessary to tell him in so many words that she would separate herself from him and defy him She would not fear him let his words and face be ever so terrible Surely her own brother would do her no bodily harm And even though he should do so though he should take her roughly by the arm as he had done to Alice though he should do worse than that still she would fight him Her blood was the same as his and he should know that her courage was at any rate as high And indeed when she looked at him she had cause to fear He intended that she should fear He intended that she should dread what he might do to her at that moment As to what he would do he had no resolve made Neither had he resolved on anything when he had gone to Alice and had shaken her rudely as she sat beside him He had been guided by no fixed intent when he had attacked John Grey or when he insulted the attorney but a Fury was driving him and he was conscious of being so driven He almost wished to be driven to some act of frenzy Everything in the world had gone against him and he desired to expend his rage on some one Kate said he stopping her we will have this out here if you please So much at any rate shall be settled to day You have made many promises to me and I have believed them You can now keep them all by simply saying what you know to be the truth that that old man was a drivelling idiot when he made this will Are you prepared to do me that justice Think before you answer me for by G if I cannot have justice among you I will have revenge And he put his hand upon her breast up near to her throat Take your hand down George said she I m not such a fool that you can frighten me in that way Answer me he said and shook her having some part of her raiment within his clutch Oh George that I should live to be so ashamed of my brother Answer me he said again and again he shook her I have answered you I will say nothing of the kind that you want me to say My grandfather up to the latest moment that I saw him knew what he was about He was not an idiot He was I believe only carrying out a purpose fixed long before You will not make me change what I say by looking at me like that nor get it by shaking me You don t know me George if you think you can frighten me like a child He heard her to the last word still keeping his hand upon her and holding her by the cloak she wore but the violence of his grasp had relaxed itself and he let her finish her words as though his object had simply been to make her speak out to him what she had to say Oh said he when she had done That s to be it is it That s your idea of honesty The very name of the money being your own has been too much for you I wonder whether you and my uncle had contrived it all between you beforehand You will not dare to ask him because he is a man said Kate her eyes brimming with tears not through fear but in very vexation at the nature of the charge he had brought against her Shall I not You will see what I dare do As for you with all your promises Kate you know that I keep my word Say that you will do as I desire you or I will be the death of you Do you mean that you will murder me said she Murder you yes why not Treated as I have been among you do you suppose that I shall stick at anything Why should I not murder you you and Alice too seeing how you have betrayed me Poor Alice As she spoke the words she looked straight into his eyes as though defying him as far as she herself were concerned Poor Alice indeed D hypocrite There s a pair of you cursed whining false intriguing hypocrites There go down and tell your uncle and that old woman there that I threatened to murder you Tell the judge so when you re brought into court to swear me out of my property You false liar Then he pushed her from him with great violence so that she fell heavily upon the stony ground He did not stop to help her up or even to look at her as she lay but walked away across the heath neither taking the track on towards Haweswater nor returning by the path which had brought them thither He went away northwards across the wild fell and Kate having risen up and seated herself on a small cairn of stones which stood there watched him as he descended the slope of the hill till he was out of sight He did not run but he seemed to move rapidly and he never once turned round to look at her He went away down the hill northwards and presently the curving of the ground hid him from her view When she first seated herself her thoughts had been altogether of him She had feared no personal injury even when she had asked him whether he would murder her Her blood had been hot within her veins and her heart had been full of defiance Even yet she feared nothing but continued to think of him and his misery and his disgrace That he was gone for ever utterly and irretrievably ruined thrown out as it were beyond the pale of men was now certain to her And this was the brother in whom she had believed for whom she had not only been willing to sacrifice herself but for whose purposes she had striven to sacrifice her cousin What would he do now As he passed from out of her sight down the hill it seemed to her as though he were rushing straight into some hell from which there could be no escape Illustration Kate She knew that her arm had been hurt in the fall but for a while she would not move it or feel it being resolved to take no account of what might have happened to herself But when he had been gone some ten minutes she rose to her feet and finding that the movement pained her greatly and that her right arm was powerless she put up her left hand and became aware that the bone of her arm was broken below the elbow Her first thought was given to the telling him of this or the not telling when she should meet him below at the house How should she mention the accident to him Should she lie and say that she had fallen as she came down the hill alone Of course he would not believe her but still some such excuse as that might make the matter easier for them all It did not occur to her that she might not see him again at all that day and that as far as he was concerned there might be need for no lie She started off to walk down home holding her right arm steadily against her body with her left hand Of course she must give some account of herself when she got to the house but it was of the account to be given to him that she thought As to the others she cared little for them Here I am my arm is broken and you had better send for a doctor That would be sufficient for them When she got into the wood the path was very dark The heavens were overcast with clouds and a few drops began to fall Then the rain fell faster and faster and before she had gone a quarter of a mile down the beacon hill the clouds had opened themselves and the shower had become a storm of water Suffering as she was she stood up for a few moments under a large tree taking the excuse of the rain for some minutes of delay that she might make up her mind as to what she would say Then it occurred to her that she might possibly meet him again before she reached the house and as she thought of it she began for the first time to fear him Would he come out upon her from the trees and really kill her Had he made his way round when he got out of her sight that he might fall upon her suddenly and do as he had threatened As the idea came upon her she made a little attempt to run but she found that running was impracticable from the pain the movement caused her Then she walked on through the hard rain steadily holding her arm against her side but still looking every moment through the trees on the side from which George might be expected to reach her But no one came near her on her way homewards Had she been calm enough to think of the nature of the ground she might have known that he could not have returned upon her so quickly He must have come back up the steep hill side which she had seen him descend No he had gone away altogether across the fells towards Bampton and was at this moment vainly buttoning his coat across his breast in his unconscious attempt to keep out the wet The Fury was driving him on and he himself was not aware whither he was driven Dinner at the Hall had been ordered at five the old hour or rather that had been assumed to be the hour for dinner without any ordering It was just five when Kate reached the front door This she opened with her left hand and turning at once into the dining room found her uncle and her aunt standing before the fire Dinner is ready said John Vavasor where is George You are wet Kate said aunt Greenow Yes I am very wet said Kate I must go up stairs Perhaps you ll come with me aunt Come with you of course I will Aunt Greenow had seen at once that something was amiss Where s George said John Vavasor Has he come back with you or are we to wait for him Kate seated herself in her chair I don t quite know where he is she said In the meantime her aunt had hastened up to her side just in time to catch her as she was falling from her chair My arm said Kate very gently my arm Then she slipped down against her aunt and had fainted He has done her a mischief said missus Greenow looking up at her brother This is his doing John Vavasor stood confounded wishing himself back in Queen Anne Street CHAPTER LVII Showing How the Wild Beast Got Himself Back from the Mountains About eleven o clock on that night the night of the day on which Kate Vavasor s arm had been broken there came a gentle knock at Kate s bedroom door There was nothing surprising in this as of all the household Kate only was in bed Her aunt was sitting at this time by her bedside and the doctor who had been summoned from Penrith and who had set her broken arm was still in the house talking over the accident with John Vavasor in the dining room before he proceeded back on his journey home She will do very well said the doctor It s only a simple fracture I ll see her the day after to morrow Is it not odd that such an accident should come from a fall whilst walking asked mister Vavasor The doctor shrugged his shoulders One never can say how anything may occur said he I know a young woman who broke the os femoris by just kicking her cat at least she said she did Indeed I suppose you didn t take any trouble to inquire Not much My business was with the injury not with the way she got it Somebody did make inquiry but she stuck to her story and nothing came of it Good night mister Vavasor Don t trouble her with questions till she has had some hours sleep at any rate Then the doctor went and John Vavasor was left alone standing with his back to the dining room fire There had been so much trouble and confusion in the house since Kate had fainted almost immediately upon her reaching home that mister Vavasor had not yet had time to make up his mind as to the nature of the accident which had occurred missus Greenow had at once ascertained that the bone was broken and the doctor had been sent for Luckily he had been found at home and had reached the Hall a little before ten o clock In the meantime as soon as Kate recovered her senses she volunteered her account of what had occurred Her brother had quarrelled with her about the will she said and had left her abruptly on the mountain She had fallen she went on to say as she turned from him and had at once found that she had hurt herself But she had been too angry with him to let him know it and indeed she had not known the extent herself till he had passed out of her sight This was her story and there was nothing in it that was false by the letter though there was much that was false in the spirit It was certainly true that George had not known that she was injured It was true that she had asked him for no help It was true in one sense that she had fallen and it was true that she had not herself known how severe had been the injury done to her till he had gone beyond the reach of her voice But she repressed all mention of his violence and when she was pressed as to the nature of the quarrel she declined to speak further on that matter Neither her uncle nor her aunt believed her That was a matter of course and she knew that they did not believe her George s absence their recent experience of his moods and the violence by which her arm must have been broken made them certain that Kate had more to tell if she chose to tell it But in her present condition they could not question her missus Greenow did ask as to the probability of her nephew s return I can only tell you said Kate that he went away across the Fell in the direction of Bampton Perhaps he has gone on to Penrith He was very angry with us all and as the house is not his own he has probably resolved that he will not stay another night under the roof But who can say He is not in his senses when he is angered John Vavasor as he stood alone after the doctor s departure endeavoured to ascertain the truth by thinking of it I am sure he said to himself that the doctor suspects that there has been violence I know it from his tone and I can see it in his eye But how to prove it and would there be good in proving it Poor girl Will it not be better for her to let it pass as though we believed her story He made up his mind that it would be better Why should he take upon himself the terrible task of calling this insane relation to account for an act which he could not prove The will itself without that trouble would give him trouble enough Then he began to long that he was back at his club and to think that the signing room in Chancery Lane was not so bad And so he went up to his bed calling at Kate s door to ask after the patient In the meantime there had come a messenger to missus Greenow who had stationed herself with her niece One of the girls of the house brought up a scrap of paper to the door saying that a boy had brought it over with a cart from Shap and that it was intended for Miss Vavasor and it was she who knocked at the sickroom door The note was open and was not addressed indeed the words were written on a scrap of paper that was crumpled up rather than folded and were as follows Send me my clothes by the bearer I shall not return to the house missus Greenow took it in to Kate and then went away to see her nephew s things duly put into his portmanteau This was sent away in the cart and mister Vavasor as he went up stairs was told what had been done Neither on that night or on the following day did missus Greenow ask any further questions but on the morning after that when the doctor had left them with a good account of the broken limb her curiosity would brook no further delay And indeed indignation as well as curiosity urged her on In disposition she was less easy and perhaps less selfish than her brother If it were the case that that man had ill treated his sister she would have sacrificed much to bring him to punishment Kate she said when the doctor was gone I expect that you will tell me the whole truth as to what occurred between you and your brother when you had this accident I have told you the truth But not the whole truth All the truth I mean to tell aunt He has quarrelled with me as I think most unnecessarily but you don t suppose that I am going to give an exact account of the quarrel We were both wrong probably and so let there be an end of it Was he violent to you when he quarrelled with you When he is angry he is always violent in his language But did he strike you Dear aunt don t be angry with me if I say that I won t be cross examined I would rather answer no more questions about it I know that questioning can do no good missus Greenow knew her niece well enough to be aware that nothing more would be told her but she was quite sure now that Kate had not broken her arm by a simple fall She was certain that the injury had come from positive violence Had it not been so Kate would not have contented herself with refusing to answer the last question that had been asked but would also have repelled the charge made against her brother with indignation You must have it your own way said missus Greenow but let me just tell you this that your brother George had better keep out of my way It is probable that he will said Kate Especially if you remain here to nurse me Kate s conduct in answering all the questions made to her was not difficult but she found that there was much difficulty in planning her own future behaviour towards her own brother Must she abandon him altogether from henceforth divide herself from him as it were have perfectly separate interests and interests that were indeed hostile and must she see him ruined and overwhelmed by want of money while she had been made a rich woman by her grandfather s will It will be remembered that her life had hitherto been devoted to him that all her schemes and plans had had his success as their object that she had taught herself to consider it to be her duty to sacrifice everything to his welfare It is very sad to abandon the only object of a life It is very hard to tear out from one s heart and fling away from it the only love that one has cherished What was she to say to Alice about all this to Alice whom she had cheated of a husband worthy of her that she might allure her into the arms of one so utterly unworthy Luckily for Kate her accident was of such a nature that any writing to Alice was now out of the question But a blow What woman can bear a blow from a man and afterwards return to him with love A wife may have to bear it and to return And she may return with that sort of love which is a thing of custom The man is the father of her children and earns the bread which they eat and which she eats Habit and the ways of the world require that she should be careful in his interests and that she should live with him in what amity is possible to them But as for love all that we mean by love when we speak of it and write of it a blow given by the defender to the defenceless crushes it all A woman may forgive deceit treachery desertion even the preference given to a rival She may forgive them and forget them but I do not think that a woman can forget a blow And as for forgiveness it is not the blow that she cannot forgive but the meanness of spirit that made it possible Kate as she thought of it told herself that everything in life was over for her She had long feared her brother s nature had feared that he was hard and heartless but still there had been some hope with her fear Success if he could be made to achieve it would soften him and then all might be right But now all was wrong and she knew that it was so When he had compelled her to write to Alice for money her faith in him had almost succumbed That had been very mean and the meanness had shocked her But now he had asked her to perjure herself that he might have his own way and had threatened to murder her and had raised his hand against her because she had refused to obey him And he had accused her of treachery to himself had accused her of premeditated deceit in obtaining this property for herself But he does not believe it said Kate to herself He said that because he thought it would vex me but I know he does not think it Kate had watched her brother longing for money all his life had thoroughly understood the intensity of his wish for it the agony of his desire But so far removed was she from any such longing on her own account that she could not believe that her brother would in his heart accuse her of it How often had she offered to give him on the instant every shilling that she had in the world At this moment she resolved in her mind that she never wished to see him more but even now had it been practicable she would have made over to him without any drawback all her interest in the Vavasor estate But any such making over was impossible John Vavasor remained in Westmoreland for a week and during that time many discussions were of course held about the property mister Round came down from London and met mister Gogram at Penrith As to the validity of the will mister Round said that there was no shadow of a doubt So an agent was appointed for receiving the rents and it was agreed that the old Hall should be let in six months from that date In the meantime Kate was to remain there till her arm should become strong and she could make her plans for the future Aunt Greenow promised to remain at the Hall for the present and offered indeed indefinite services for the future as though she were quite forgetful of Captain Bellfield Of mister Cheesacre she was not forgetful for she still continued to speak of that gentleman to Kate as though he were Kate s suitor But she did not now press upon her niece the acceptance of mister Cheesacre s hand as an absolute duty Kate was mistress of a considerable fortune and though such a marriage might be comfortable it was no longer necessary missus Greenow called him poor Cheesacre pointing out how easily he might be managed and how indubitable were his possessions but she no longer spoke of Kate s chances in the marriage market as desperate even though she should decline the Cheesacre alliance A young woman with six hundred a year my dear may do pretty nearly what she pleases said aunt Greenow It s better than having ten years grace given you And will last longer certainly said Kate Kate s desire was that Alice should come down to her for a while in Westmoreland before the six months were over and this desire she mentioned to her uncle He promised to carry the message up to Alice but could not be got to say more than that upon the subject Then mister Vavasor went away leaving the aunt and niece together at the Hall What on earth shall we do if that wild beast shows himself suddenly among us women asked missus Greenow of her brother The brother could only say that he hoped the wild beast would keep his distance And the wild beast did keep his distance at any rate as long as missus Greenow remained at the Hall We will now go back to the wild beast and tell how he walked across the mountains in the rain to Bampton a little village at the foot of Haweswater It will be remembered that after he had struck his sister he turned away from her and walked with quick steps down the mountain side never turning back to look at her He had found himself to be without any power of persuasion over her as regarded her evidence to be given if the will were questioned The more he threatened her the steadier she had been in asserting her belief in her grandfather s capacity She had looked into his eye and defied him and he had felt himself to be worsted What was he to do In truth there was nothing for him to do He had told her that he would murder her and in the state of mind to which his fury had driven him murder had suggested itself to him as a resource to which he might apply himself But what could he gain by murdering her or at any rate by murdering her then out on the mountain side Nothing but a hanging There would be no gratification even to his revenge If indeed he had murdered that old man who was now unfortunately gone beyond the reach of murder if he could have poisoned the old man s cup before that last will had been made there might have been something in such a deed But he had merely thought of it letting I dare not wait upon I would as he now told himself with much self reproach Nothing was to be got by killing his sister So he restrained himself in his passion and walked away from her solitary down the mountain The rain soon came on and found him exposed on the hill side He thought little about it but buttoned his coat as I have said before and strode on It was a storm of rain so that he was forced to hold his head to one side as it hit him from the north But with his hand to his hat and his head bent against the wind he went on till he had reached the valley at the foot and found that the track by which he had been led thither had become a road He had never known the mountains round the Hall as Kate had known them and was not aware whither he was going On one thing only had he made up his mind since he had left his sister and that was that he would not return to the house He knew that he could do nothing there to serve his purpose his threats would be vain impotence he had no longer any friend in the house He could hardly tell himself what line of conduct he would pursue but he thought that he would hurry back to London and grasp at whatever money he could get from Alice He was still at this moment a Member of Parliament and as the rain drenched him through and through he endeavoured to get consolation from the remembrance of that fact in his favour As he got near the village he overtook a shepherd boy coming down from the hills and learned his whereabouts from him Baampton said the boy with an accent that was almost Scotch when he was asked the name of the place When Vavasor further asked whether a gig were kept there the boy simply stared at him not knowing a gig by that name At last however he was made to understand the nature of his companion s want and expressed his belief that John Applethwaite up at the Craigs yon had got a mickle cart But the Craigs was a farm house which now came in view about a mile off up across the valley and Vavasor hoping that he might still find a speedier conveyance than John Applethwaite s mickle cart went on to the public house in the village But in truth neither there nor yet from John Applethwaite to whom at last an application was sent could he get any vehicle and between six and seven he started off again through the rain to make his weary way on foot to Shap The distance was about five miles and the little byways lying between walls were sticky and almost glutinous with light coloured chalky mud Before he started he took a glass of hot rum and water but the effect of that soon passed away from him and then he became colder and weaker than he had been before Wearily and wretchedly he plodded on A man may be very weary in such a walk as that and yet be by no means wretched Tired hungry cold wet and nearly penniless I have sat me down and slept among those mountain tracks have slept because nature refused to allow longer wakefulness But my heart has been as light as my purse and there has been something in the air of the hills that made me buoyant and happy in the midst of my weariness But George Vavasor was wretched as well as weary and every step that he took plodding through the mud was a new misfortune to him What are five miles of a walk to a young man even though the rain be falling and the ways be dirty what though they may come after some other ten that he has already traversed on his feet His sister Kate would have thought nothing of the distance But George stopped on his way from time to time leaning on the loose walls and cursing the misfortune that had brought him to such a pass He cursed his grandfather his uncle his sister his cousin and himself He cursed the place in which his forefathers had lived and he cursed the whole county He cursed the rain and the wind and his town made boots which would not keep out the wet slush He cursed the light as it faded and the darkness as it came Over and over again he cursed the will that had robbed him and the attorney that had made it He cursed the mother that had borne him and the father that had left him poor He thought of Scruby and cursed him thinking how that money would be again required of him by that stern agent He cursed the House of Commons which had cost him so much and the greedy electors who would not send him there without his paying for it He cursed John Grey as he thought of those two thousand pounds with double curses He cursed this world and all worlds beyond and thus cursing everything he made his way at last up to the inn at Shap It was nearly nine when he got there He had wasted over an hour at Bampton in his endeavour to get John Applethwaite s cart to carry him on and he had been two hours on his walk from Bampton to Shap two hours amidst his cursing He ordered supper and brandy and water and as we know sent off a Mercury for his clothes But the Mercuries of Westmoreland do not move on quick wings and it was past midnight before he got his possessions During all this time he had by no means ceased from cursing but continued it over his broiled ham and while he swallowed his brandy and water He swore aloud so that the red armed servant at the inn could not but hear him that those thieves at the Hall intended to rob him of his clothes that they would not send him his property He could not restrain himself though he knew that every word he uttered would injure his cause as regarded the property in Westmoreland if ever he could make a cause He knew that he had been mad to strike his sister and cursed himself for his madness Yet he could not restrain himself He told himself that the battle for him was over and he thought of poison for himself He thought of poison and a pistol of the pistols he had ever loaded at home each with six shots good for a life apiece He thought of an express train rushing along at its full career and of the instant annihilation which it would produce But if that was to be the end of him he would not go alone No indeed why should he go alone leaving those pistols ready loaded in his desk Among them they had brought him to ruin and to death Was he a man to pardon his enemies when it was within his power to take them with him down down down What were the last words upon his impious lips as with bloodshot eyes half drunk and driven by the Fury he took himself off to the bed prepared for him cursing aloud the poor red haired girl as he went I may not utter here CHAPTER LVIII The Pallisers at Breakfast Gentle reader do you remember Lady Monk s party and how it ended how it ended at least as regards those special guests with whom we are concerned mister Palliser went away early missus Marsham followed him to his house in Park Lane caught him at home and told her tale He returned to his wife found her sitting with Burgo in the dining room under the Argus eyes of the constant Bott and bore her away home Burgo disappeared utterly from the scene and mister Bott complaining inwardly that virtue was too frequently allowed to be its own reward comforted himself with champagne and then walked off to his lodgings Lady Monk when mister Palliser made his way into her room up stairs seeking his wife s scarf which little incident also the reader may perhaps remember saw that the game was up and thought with regret of the loss of her two hundred pounds Such was the ending of Lady Monk s party Lady Glencora on her journey home in the carriage with her husband had openly suggested that missus Marsham had gone to Park Lane to tell of her doings with Burgo and had declared her resolution never again to see either that lady or mister Bott in her own house This she said with more of defiance in her tone than mister Palliser had ever hitherto heard He was by nature less ready than her and knowing his own deficiency in that respect abstained from all answer on the subject Indeed during that drive home very few further words were spoken between them I will breakfast with you to morrow he said to her as she prepared to go up stairs I have work still to do to night and I will not disturb you by coming to your room You won t want me to be very early said his wife No said he with more of anger in his voice than he had yet shown What hour will suit you I must say something of what has occurred to night before I leave you to morrow I don t know what you can have got to say about to night but I ll be down by half past eleven if that will do mister Palliser said that he would make it do and then they parted Lady Glencora had played her part very well before her husband She had declined to be frightened by him had been the first to mention Burgo s name and had done so with no tremor in her voice and had boldly declared her irreconcilable enmity to the male and female duennas who had dared to take her in charge While she was in the carriage with her husband she felt some triumph in her own strength and as she wished him good night on the staircase and slowly walked up to her room without having once lowered her eyes before his something of this consciousness of triumph still supported her And even while her maid remained with her she held herself up as it were inwardly telling herself that she would not yield that she would not be cowed either by her husband or by his spies But when she was left alone all her triumph departed from her She bade her maid go while she was still sitting in her dressing gown and when the girl was gone she got close over the fire sitting with her slippers on the fender with her elbows on her knees and her face resting on her hands In this position she remained for an hour with her eyes fixed on the altering shapes of the hot coals During this hour her spirit was by no means defiant and her thoughts of herself anything but triumphant mister Bott and missus Marsham she had forgotten altogether After all they were but buzzing flies who annoyed her by their presence Should she choose to leave her husband they could not prevent her leaving him It was of her husband and of Burgo that she was thinking weighing them one against the other and connecting her own existence with theirs not as expecting joy or the comfort of love from either of them but with an assured conviction that on either side there must be misery for her But of that shame before all the world which must be hers for ever should she break her vows and consent to live with a man who was not her husband she thought hardly at all That which in the estimation of Alice was everything to her at this moment was almost nothing For herself she had been sacrificed and as she told herself with bitter denunciations against herself had been sacrificed through her own weakness But that was done Whatever way she might go she was lost They had married her to a man who cared nothing for a wife nothing for any woman so at least she declared to herself but who had wanted a wife that he might have an heir Had it been given to her to have a child she thought that she might have been happy sufficiently happy in sharing her husband s joy in that respect But everything had gone against her There was nothing in her home to give her comfort He looks at me every time he sees me as the cause of his misfortune she said to herself Of her husband s rank of the future possession of his title and his estates she thought much But of her own wealth she thought nothing It did not occur to her that she had given him enough in that respect to make his marriage with her a comfort to him She took it for granted that that marriage was now one distasteful to him as it was to herself and that he would eventually be the gainer if she should so conduct herself that her marriage might be dissolved Illustration Lady Glencora As to Burgo I doubt whether she deceived herself much as to his character She knew well enough that he was a man infinitely less worthy than her husband She knew that he was a spendthrift idle given to bad courses that he drank that he gambled that he lived the life of the loosest man about the town She knew also that whatever chance she might have had to redeem him had she married him honestly before all the world there could be no such chance if she went to him as his mistress abandoning her husband and all her duties and making herself vile in the eyes of all women Burgo Fitzgerald would not be influenced for good by such a woman as she would then be She knew much of the world and its ways and told herself no lies about this But as I have said before she did not count herself for much What though she were ruined What though Burgo were false mean and untrustworthy She loved him and he was the only man she ever had loved Lower and lower she crouched before the fire and then when the coals were no longer red and the shapes altered themselves no more she crept into bed As to what she should say to her husband on the following morning she had not yet begun to think of that Exactly at half past eleven she entered the little breakfast parlour which looked out over the park It was the prettiest room in the house and now at this springtide when the town trees were putting out their earliest greens and were fresh and bright almost as country trees it might be hard to find a prettier chamber mister Palliser was there already sitting with the morning paper in his hand He rose when she entered and coming up to her just touched her with his lips She put her cheek up to him and then took her place at the breakfast table Have you any headache this morning he asked Oh no she said Then he took his tea and his toast spoke some word to her about the fineness of the weather told her some scraps of news and soon returned to the absorbing interest of a speech made by the leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords The speech was very interesting to mister Palliser because in it the noble lord alluded to a break up in the present Cabinet as to which the rumours were he said so rife through the country as to have destroyed all that feeling of security in the existing Government which the country so much valued and desired mister Palliser had as yet heard no official tidings of such a rupture but if such rupture were to take place it must be in his favour He felt himself at this moment to be full of politics to be near the object of his ambition to have affairs upon his hands which required all his attention Was it absolutely incumbent on him to refer again to the incidents of last night The doing so would be odious to him The remembrance of the task now immediately before him destroyed all his political satisfaction He did not believe that his wife was in any serious danger Might it not yet be possible for him to escape from the annoyance and to wash his mind clean of all suspicion He was not jealous he was indeed incapable of jealousy He knew what it would be to be dishonoured and he knew that under certain circumstances the world would expect him to exert himself in a certain way But the thing that he had now to do was a great trouble to him He would rather have to address the House of Commons with ten columns of figures than utter a word of remonstrance to his wife But she had defied him defied him by saying that she would see his friends no more and it was the remembrance of this as he sat behind his newspaper that made him ultimately feel that he could not pass in silence over what had been done Nevertheless he went on reading or pretending to read as long as the continuance of the breakfast made it certain that his wife would remain with him Every now and then he said some word to her of what he was reading endeavouring to use the tone of voice that was customary to him in his domestic teachings of politics But through it all there was a certain hesitation there were the sure signs of an attempt being made of which he was himself conscious and which she understood with the most perfect accuracy He was deferring the evil moment and vainly endeavouring to make himself believe that he was comfortably employed the while She had no newspaper and made no endeavour to deceive herself She therefore was the first to begin the conversation Plantagenet she said you told me last night as I was going to bed that you had something to say about Lady Monk s party He put down the newspaper slowly and turned towards her Yes my dear After what happened I believe that I must say something If you think anything pray say it said Glencora It is not always easy for a man to show what he thinks by what he says he replied My fear is that you should suppose me to think more than I do And it was for that reason that I determined to sleep on it before I spoke to you If anybody is angry with me I d much rather they should have it out with me while their anger is hot I hate cold anger But I am not angry That s what husbands always say when they re going to scold But I am not going to scold I am only going to advise you I d sooner be scolded Advice is to anger just what cold anger is to hot But my dear Glencora surely if I find it necessary to speak I don t want to stop you Plantagenet Pray go on Only it will be so nice to have it over He was now more than ever averse to the task before him Husbands when they give their wives a talking should do it out of hand uttering their words hard sharp and quick and should then go There are some works that won t bear a preface and this work of marital fault finding is one of them mister Palliser was already beginning to find out the truth of this Glencora he said I wish you to be serious with me I am very serious she replied as she settled herself in her chair with an air of mockery while her eyes and mouth were bright and eloquent with a spirit which her husband did not love to see Poor girl There was seriousness enough in store for her before she would be able to leave the room You ought to be serious Do you know why missus Marsham came here from Lady Monk s last night Of course I do She came to tell you that I was waltzing with Burgo Fitzgerald You might as well ask me whether I knew why mister Bott was standing at all the doors glaring at me I don t know anything about mister Bott I know something about him though she said again moving herself in her chair I am speaking now of missus Marsham You should speak of them both together as they hunt in couples Glencora will you listen to me or will you not If you say that you will not I shall know what to do I don t think you would Plantagenet And she nodded her little head at him as she spoke I m sure I don t know what you would do But I will listen to you Only as I said before it will be very nice when it s over missus Marsham came here not simply to tell me that you were waltzing with mister Fitzgerald and I wish that when you mention his name you would call him mister Fitzgerald So I do You generally prefix his Christian name which it would be much better that you should omit I will try she said very gently but it s hard to drop an old habit Before you married me you knew that I had learned to call him Burgo Let me go on said mister Palliser Oh certainly It was not simply to tell me that you were waltzing that missus Marsham came here And it was not simply to see me waltzing that mister Bott stood in the doorways for he followed me about and came down after me to the supper room Glencora will you oblige me by not speaking of mister Bott I wish you would oblige me by not speaking of missus Marsham mister Palliser rose quickly from his chair with a gesture of anger stood upright for half a minute and then sat down again I beg your pardon Plantagenet she said I think I know what you want and I ll hold my tongue till you bid me speak missus Marsham came here because she saw that every one in the room was regarding you with wonder Lady Glencora twisted herself about in her chair but she said nothing She saw that you were not only dancing with mister Fitzgerald but that you were dancing with him what shall I say Upon my word I can t tell you Recklessly Oh recklessly was I What was I reckless of Reckless of what people might say reckless of what I might feel about it reckless of your own position Am I to speak now Perhaps you had better let me go on I think she was right to come to me That s of course What s the good of having spies if they don t run and tell as soon as they see anything especially anything reckless Glencora you are determined to make me angry I am angry now very angry I have employed no spies When rumours have reached me not from spies as you choose to call them but through your dearest friends and mine What do you mean by rumours from my dearest friends Never mind Let me go on No not when you say my dear friends have spread rumours about me Tell me who they are I have no dear friends Do you mean Alice Vavasor It does not signify But when I was warned that you had better not go to any house in which you could meet that man I would not listen to it I said that you were my wife and that as such I could trust you anywhere everywhere with any person Others might distrust you but I would not do so When I wished you to go to Monkshade were there to be any spies there When I left you last night at Lady Monk s do you believe in your heart that I trusted to missus Marsham s eyes rather than to your own truth Do you think that I have lived in fear of mister Fitzgerald No Plantagenet I do not think so Do you believe that I have commissioned mister Bott to watch your conduct Answer me Glencora She paused a moment thinking what actually was her true belief on that subject He does watch me certainly she said That does not answer my question Do you believe that I have commissioned him to do so No I do not Then it is ignoble in you to talk to me of spies I have employed no spies If it were ever to come to that that I thought spies necessary it would be all over with me There was something of feeling in his voice as he said this something that almost approached to passion which touched his wife s heart Whether or not spies would be of any avail she knew that she had in truth done that of which he had declared that he had never suspected her She had listened to words of love from her former lover She had received and now carried about with her a letter from this man in which he asked her to elope with him She had by no means resolved that she would not do this thing She had been false to her husband and as her husband spoke of his confidence in her her own spirit rebelled against the deceit which she herself was practising I know that I have never made you happy she said I know that I never can make you happy He looked at her struck by her altered tone and saw that her whole manner and demeanour were changed I do not understand what you mean he said I have never complained You have not made me unhappy He was one of those men to whom this was enough If his wife caused him no uneasiness what more was he to expect from her No doubt she might have done much more for him She might have given him an heir But he was a just man and knew that the blank he had drawn was his misfortune and not her fault But now her heart was loosed and she spoke out at first slowly but after a while with all the quietness of strong passion No Plantagenet I shall never make you happy You have never loved me nor I you We have never loved each other for a single moment I have been wrong to talk to you about spies I was wrong to go to Lady Monk s I have been wrong in everything that I have done but never so wrong as when I let them persuade me to be your wife Glencora Let me speak now Plantagenet It is better that I should tell you everything and I will I will tell you everything everything I do love Burgo Fitzgerald I do I do I do How can I help loving him Have I not loved him from the first before I had seen you Did you not know that it was so I do love Burgo Fitzgerald and when I went to Lady Monk s last night I had almost made up my mind that I must tell him so and that I must go away with him and hide myself But when he came to speak to me He has asked you to go with him then said the husband in whose bosom the poison was beginning to take effect thereby showing that he was neither above nor below humanity Glencora was immediately reminded that though she might if she pleased tell her own secrets she ought not in accordance with her ideas of honour tell those of her lover What need is there of asking do you think when people have loved each other as we have done You wanted to go with him then Would it not have been the best for you Plantagenet I do not love you not as women love their husbands when they do love them But before God my first wish is to free you from the misfortune that I have brought on you As she made this attestation she started up from her chair and coming close to him took him by the coat He was startled and stepped back a pace but did not speak and then stood looking at her as she went on Illustration Before God my first wish is to free you from the misfortune that I have brought on you What matters it whether I drown myself or throw myself away by going with such a one as him so that you might marry again and have a child I d die I d die willingly How I wish I could die Plantagenet I would kill myself if I dared He was a tall man and she was short of stature so that he stood over her and looked upon her and now she was looking up into his face with all her eyes I would she said I would I would What is there left for me that I should wish to live Softly slowly very gradually as though he were afraid of what he was doing he put his arm round her waist You are wrong in one thing he said I do love you She shook her head touching his breast with her hair as she did so I do love you he repeated If you mean that I am not apt at telling you so it is true I know My mind is running on other things Yes she said your mind is running on other things But I do love you If you cannot love me it is a great misfortune to us both But we need not therefore be disgraced As for that other thing of which you spoke of our having as yet no child and in saying this he pressed her somewhat closer with his arm you allow yourself to think too much of it much more of it than I do I have made no complaints on that head even within my own breast I know what your thoughts are Plantagenet Believe me that you wrong my thoughts Of course I have been anxious and have perhaps shown my anxiety by the struggle I have made to hide it I have never told you what is false Glencora No you are not false I would rather have you for my wife childless if you will try to love me than any other woman though another might give me an heir Will you try to love me She was silent At this moment after the confession that she had made she could not bring herself to say that she would even try Had she said so she would have seemed to have accepted his forgiveness too easily I think dear he said still holding her by her waist that we had better leave England for a while I will give up politics for this season Should you like to go to Switzerland for the summer or perhaps to some of the German baths and then on to Italy when the weather is cold enough Still she was silent Perhaps your friend Miss Vavasor would go with us He was killing her by his goodness She could not speak to him yet but now as he mentioned Alice s name she gently put up her hand and rested it on the back of his At that moment there came a knock at the door a sharp knock which was quickly repeated Come in said mister Palliser dropping his arm from his wife s waist and standing away from her a few yards CHAPTER LIX The Duke of saint Bungay in Search of a Minister It was the butler who had knocked showing that the knock was of more importance than it would have been had it been struck by the knuckles of the footman in livery If you please sir the Duke of saint Bungay is here The Duke of saint Bungay said mister Palliser becoming rather red as he heard the announcement Yes sir his grace is in the library He bade me tell you that he particularly wanted to see you so I told him that you were with my lady Quite right tell his grace that I will be with him in two minutes Then the butler retired and mister Palliser was again alone with his wife I must go now my dear he said and perhaps I shall not see you again till the evening Don t let me put you out in any way she answered Oh no you won t put me out You will be dressing I suppose about nine I did not mean as to that she answered You must not think more of Italy He has come to tell you that you are wanted in the Cabinet Again he turned very red It may be so he answered but though I am wanted I need not go But I must not keep the duke waiting Good bye And he turned to the door She followed him and took hold of him as he went so that he was forced to turn to her once again She managed to get hold of both his hands and pressed them closely looking up into his face with her eyes laden with tears He smiled at her gently returned the pressure of the hands and then left her without kissing her It was not that he was minded not to kiss her He would have kissed her willingly enough had he thought that the occasion required it He says that he loves me said Lady Glencora to herself but he does not know what love means But she was quite aware that he had behaved to her with genuine true nobility As soon as she was alone and certain of her solitude she took out that letter from her pocket and tearing it into very small fragments without reading it threw the pieces on the fire As she did so her mind seemed to be fixed at any rate to one thing that she would think no more of Burgo Fitzgerald as her future master I think however that she had arrived at so much certainty as this at that moment in which she had been parting with Burgo Fitzgerald in Lady Monk s dining room She had had courage enough or shall we rather say sin enough to think of going with him to tell herself that she would do so to put herself in the way of doing it nay she had had enough of both to enable her to tell her husband that she had resolved that it would be good for her to do so But she was neither bold enough nor wicked enough to do the thing As she had said of her own idea of destroying herself she did not dare to take the plunge Therefore knowing now that it was so she tore up the letter that she had carried so long and burnt it in the fire She had in truth told him everything believing that in doing so she was delivering her own death warrant as regarded her future position in his house She had done this not hoping thereby for any escape not with any purpose as regarded herself but simply because deceit had been grievous to her and had become unendurable as soon as his words and manner had in them any feeling of kindness But her confession had no sooner been made than her fault had been forgiven She had told him that she did not love him She had told him even that she had thought of leaving him She had justified by her own words any treatment of his however harsh which he might choose to practise But the result had been the immediate result that he had been more tender to her than she had ever remembered him to be before She knew that he had conquered her However cold and heartless his home might be to her it must be her home now There could be no further thought of leaving him She had gone out into the tiltyard and had tilted with him and he had been the victor mister Palliser himself had not time for much thought before he found himself closeted with the Duke but as he crossed the hall and went up the stairs a thought or two did pass quickly across his mind She had confessed to him and he had forgiven her He did not feel quite sure that he had been right but he did feel quite sure that the thing had been done He recognized it for a fact that as regarded the past no more was to be said There were to be no reproaches and there must be some tacit abandoning of missus Marsham s close attendance As to mister Bott he had begun to hate mister Bott and had felt cruelly ungrateful when that gentleman endeavoured to whisper a word into his ear as he passed through the doorway into Lady Monk s dining room And he had offered to go abroad to go abroad and leave his politics and his ambition and his coming honours He had persisted in his offer even after his wife had suggested to him that the Duke of saint Bungay was now in the house with the object of offering him that very thing for which he had so longed As he thought of this his heart became heavy within him Such chances so he told himself do not come twice in a man s way When returning from a twelvemonth s residence abroad he would be nobody in politics He would have lost everything for which he had been working all his life But he was a man of his word and as he opened the library door he was resolute he thought that he could be resolute in adhering to his promise Duke he said I m afraid I have kept you waiting And the two political allies shook each other by the hand The Duke was in a glow of delight There had been no waiting He was only too glad to find his friend at home He had been prepared to wait even if mister Palliser had been out And I suppose you guess why I m come said the Duke I would rather be told than have to guess said mister Palliser smiling for a moment But the smile quickly passed off his face as he remembered his pledge to his wife He has resigned at last What was said in the Lords last night made it necessary that he should do so or that Lord Brock should declare himself able to support him through thick and thin Of course I can tell you everything now He must have gone or I must have done so You know that I don t like him in the Cabinet I admire his character and his genius but I think him the most dangerous man in England as a statesman He has high principles the very highest but they are so high as to be out of sight to ordinary eyes They are too exalted to be of any use for everyday purposes He is honest as the sun I m sure but it s just like the sun s honesty of a kind which we men below can t quite understand or appreciate He has no instinct in politics but reaches his conclusions by philosophical deduction Now in politics I would a deal sooner trust to instinct than to calculation I think he may probably know how England ought to be governed three centuries hence better than any man living but of the proper way to govern it now I think he knows less Brock half likes him and half fears him He likes the support of his eloquence and he likes the power of the man but he fears his restless activity and thoroughly dislikes his philosophy At any rate he has left us and I am here to ask you to take his place The Duke as he concluded his speech was quite contented and almost jovial He was thoroughly satisfied with the new political arrangement which he was proposing He regarded mister Palliser as a steady practical man of business luckily young and therefore with a deal of work in him belonging to the race from which English ministers ought in his opinion to be taken and as being in some respects his own pupil He had been the first to declare aloud that Plantagenet Palliser was the coming Chancellor of the Exchequer and it had been long known though no such declaration had been made aloud that the Duke did not sit comfortably in the same Cabinet with the gentleman who had now resigned Everything had now gone as the Duke wished and he was prepared to celebrate some little ovation with his young friend before he left the house in Park Lane And who goes out with him asked mister Palliser putting off the evil moment of his own decision but before the Duke could answer him he had reminded himself that under his present circumstances he had no right to ask such a question His own decision could not rest upon that point But it does not matter he said I am afraid I must decline the offer you bring me Decline it said the Duke who could not have been more surprised had his friend talked of declining heaven I fear I must The Duke had now risen from his chair and was standing with both his hands upon the table All his contentment all his joviality had vanished His fine round face had become almost ludicrously long his eyes and mouth were struggling to convey reproach and the reproach was almost drowned in vexation Ever since Parliament had met he had been whispering mister Palliser s name into the Prime Minister s ear and now But he could not and would not believe it Nonsense Palliser he said You must have got some false notion into your head There can be no possible reason why you should not join us Finespun himself will support us at any rate for a time mister Finespun was the gentleman whose retirement from the ministry the Duke of saint Bungay had now announced It is nothing of that kind said mister Palliser who perhaps felt himself quite equal to the duties proposed to him even though mister Finespun should not support him It is nothing of that kind it is no fear of that sort that hinders me Then for mercy s sake what is it My dear Palliser I looked upon you as being as sure in this matter as myself and I had a right to do so You certainly intended to join us a month ago if the opportunity offered You certainly did It is true Duke I must ask you to listen to me now and I must tell you what I would not willingly tell to any man As mister Palliser said this a look of agony came over his face There are men who can talk easily of all their most inmost matters but he was not such a man It went sorely against the grain with him to speak of the sorrow of his home even to such a friend as the Duke but it was essentially necessary to him that he should justify himself Upon my word said the Duke I can t understand that there should be any reason strong enough to make you throw your party over I have promised to take my wife abroad Is that it said the Duke looking at him with surprise but at the same time with something of returning joviality in his face Nobody thinks of going abroad at this time of the year Of course you can get away for a time when Parliament breaks up But I have promised to go at once Then considering your position you have made a promise which it behoves you to break I am sure Lady Glencora will see it in that light You do not quite understand me and I am afraid I must trouble you to listen to matters which under other circumstances it would be impertinent in me to obtrude upon you A certain stiffness of demeanour and measured propriety of voice much at variance with his former manner came upon him as he said this Of course Palliser I don t want to interfere for a moment If you will allow me Duke My wife has told me that this morning which makes me feel that absence from England is requisite for her present comfort I was with her when you came and had just promised her that she should go But Palliser think of it If this were a small matter I would not press you but a man in your position has public duties He owes his services to his country He has no right to go back if it be possible that he should so do When a man has given his word it cannot be right that he should go back from that Of course not But a man may be absolved from a promise Lady Glencora My wife would of course absolve me It is not that Her happiness demands it and it is partly my fault that it is so I cannot explain to you more fully why it is that I must give up the great object for which I have striven with all my strength Oh no said the Duke If you are sure that it is imperative It is imperative I could give you twenty four hours you know mister Palliser did not answer at once and the Duke thought that he saw some sign of hesitation I suppose it would not be possible that I should speak to Lady Glencora It could be of no avail Duke She would only declare at the first word that she would remain in London but it would not be the less my duty on that account to take her abroad Well I can t say Of course I can t say Such an opportunity may not come twice in a man s life And at your age too You are throwing away from you the finest political position that the world can offer to the ambition of any man No one at your time of life has had such a chance within my memory That a man under thirty should be thought fit to be Chancellor of the Exchequer and should refuse it because he wants to take his wife abroad Palliser if she were dying you should remain under such an emergency as this She might go but you should remain mister Palliser remained silent for a moment or two in his chair he then rose and walked towards the window as he spoke There are things worse than death he said when his back was turned His voice was very low and there was a tear in his eye as he spoke them the words were indeed whispered but the Duke heard them and felt that he could not press him any more on the subject of his wife And must this be final said the Duke I think it must But your visit here has come so quickly on my resolution to go abroad which in truth was only made ten minutes before your name was brought to me that I believe I ought to ask for a portion of those twenty four hours which you have offered me A small portion will be enough Will you see me if I come to you this evening say at eight If the House is up in the Lords I will go to you in saint James s Square We shall be sitting after eight I think Then I will see you there And Duke I must ask you to think of me in this matter as a friend should think and not as though we were bound together only by party feeling I will I will I have told you what I shall never whisper to any one else I think you know that you are safe with me I am sure of it And Duke I can tell you that the sacrifice to me will be almost more than I can bear This thing that you have offered me to day is the only thing that I have ever coveted I have thought of it and worked for it have hoped and despaired have for moments been vain enough to think that it was within my strength and have been wretched for weeks together because I have told myself that it was utterly beyond me As to that neither Brock nor I nor any of us have any doubt Finespun himself says that you are the man I am much obliged to them But I say all this simply that you may understand how imperative is the duty which as I think requires me to refuse the offer But you haven t refused as yet said the Duke I shall wait at the House for you whether they are sitting or not And endeavour to join us Do the best you can I will say nothing as to that duty of which you speak but if it can be made compatible with your public service pray pray let it be done Remember how much such a one as you owes to his country Then the Duke went and mister Palliser was alone He had not been alone before since the revelation which had been made to him by his wife and the words she had spoken were still sounding in his ears I do love Burgo Fitzgerald I do I do I do They were not pleasant words for a young husband to hear Men there are no doubt whose nature would make them more miserable under the infliction than it had made Plantagenet Palliser He was calm without strong passion not prone to give to words a stronger significance than they should bear and he was essentially unsuspicious Never for a moment had he thought even while those words were hissing in his ears that his wife had betrayed his honour Nevertheless there was that at his heart as he remembered those words which made him feel that the world was almost too heavy for him For the first quarter of an hour after the Duke s departure he thought more of his wife and of Burgo Fitzgerald than he did of Lord Brock and mister Finespun But of this he was aware that he had forgiven his wife that he had put his arm round her and embraced her after hearing her confession and that she mutely with her eyes had promised him that she would do her best for him Then something of an idea of love came across his heart and he acknowledged to himself that he had married without loving or without requiring love Much of all this had been his own fault Indeed had not the whole of it come from his own wrong doing He acknowledged that it was so But now now he loved her He felt that he could not bear to part with her even if there were no question of public scandal or of disgrace He had been torn inwardly by that assertion that she loved another man She had got at his heart strings at last There are men who may love their wives though they never can have been in love before their marriage When the Duke had been gone about an hour and when under ordinary circumstances it would have been his time to go down to the House he took his hat and walked into the Park He made his way across Hyde Park and into Kensington Gardens and there he remained for an hour walking up and down beneath the elms The quidnuncs of the town who chanced to see him and who had heard something of the political movements of the day thought no doubt that he was meditating his future ministerial career But he had not been there long before he had resolved that no ministerial career was at present open to him It has been my own fault he said as he returned to his house and with God s help I will mend it if it be possible But he was a slow man and he did not go off instantly to the Duke He had given himself to eight o clock and he took the full time He could not go down to the House of Commons because men would make inquiries of him which he would find it difficult to answer So he dined at home alone He had told his wife that he would see her at nine and before that hour he would not go to her He sat alone till it was time for him to get into his brougham and thought it all over That seat in the Cabinet and Chancellorship of the Exchequer which he had so infinitely desired were already done with There was no doubt about that It might have been better for him not to have married but now that he was married and that things had brought him untowardly to this pass he knew that his wife s safety was his first duty We will go through Switzerland he said to himself to Baden and then we will get on to Florence and to Rome She has seen nothing of all these things yet and the new life will make a change in her She shall have her own friend with her Then he went down to the House of Lords and saw the Duke Well Palliser said the Duke when he had listened to him of course I cannot argue it with you any more I can only say that I am very sorry more sorry than perhaps you will believe Indeed it half breaks my heart The Duke s voice was very sad and it might almost have been thought that he was going to shed a tear In truth he disliked mister Finespun with the strongest political feeling of which he was capable and had attached himself to mister Palliser almost as strongly It was a thousand pities How hard had he not worked to bring about this arrangement which was now to be upset because a woman had been foolish I never above half liked her said the Duke to himself thinking perhaps a little of the Duchess s complaints of her I must go to Brock at once he said aloud and tell him God knows what we must do now Goodbye good bye No I m not angry There shall be no quarrel But I am very sorry In this way the two politicians parted We may as well follow this political movement to its end The Duke saw Lord Brock that night and then those two ministers sent for another minister another noble Lord a man of great experience in Cabinets These three discussed the matter together and on the following day Lord Brock got up in the House and made a strong speech in defence of his colleague mister Finespun To the end of the Session at any rate mister Finespun kept his position and held the seals of the Exchequer while all the quidnuncs of the nation shaking their heads spoke of the wonderful power of mister Finespun and declared that Lord Brock did not dare to face the Opposition without him In the meantime mister Palliser had returned to his wife and told her of his resolution with reference to their tour abroad We may as well make up our minds to start at once said he At any rate there is nothing on my side to hinder us CHAPTER LX Alice Vavasor s Name Gets into the Money Market Some ten or twelve days after George Vavasor s return to London from Westmoreland he appeared at mister Scruby s offices with four small slips of paper in his hand mister Scruby as usual was pressing for money The third election was coming on and money was already being spent very freely among the men of the River Bank So at least mister Scruby declared mister Grimes of the Handsome Man had shown signs of returning allegiance But mister Grimes could not afford to be loyal without money He had his little family to protect mister Scruby too had his little family and was not ashamed to use it on this occasion I m a family man mister Vavasor and therefore I never run any risks I never go a yard further than I can see my way back This he had said in answer to a proposition that he should take George s note of hand for the expenses of the next election payable in three months time It is so very hard to realize said George immediately upon a death when all the property left is real property Very hard indeed said mister Scruby who had heard with accuracy all the particulars of the old Squire s will Vavasor understood the lawyer cursed him inwardly and suggested to himself that some day he might murder mister Scruby as well as John Grey and perhaps also a few more of his enemies Two days after the interview in which his own note of hand had been refused he again called in Great Marlborough Street Upon this occasion he tendered to mister Scruby for his approval the four slips of paper which have been mentioned mister Scruby regarded them with attention looking first at one side horizontally and then at the other side perpendicularly But before we learn the judgement pronounced by mister Scruby as to these four slips of paper we must go back to their earlier history As they were still in their infancy we shall not have to go back far One morning at about eleven o clock the parlour maid came up to Alice as she sat alone in the drawing room in Queen Anne Street and told her there was a gentleman in the hall waiting to be seen by her We all know the tone in which servants announce a gentleman when they know that the gentleman is not a gentleman A gentleman wanting to see me What sort of a gentleman Well miss I don t think he s just of our sort but he s decent to look at Alice Vavasor had no desire to deny herself to any person but one She was well aware that the gentleman in the hall could not be her cousin George and therefore she did not refuse to see him Let him come up she said But I think Jane you ought to ask him his name Jane did ask him his name and came back immediately announcing mister Levy This occurred immediately after the return of mister John Vavasor from Westmoreland He had reached home late on the preceding evening and at the moment of mister Levy s call was in his dressing room Alice got up to receive her visitor and at once understood the tone of her maid s voice mister Levy was certainly not a gentleman of the sort to which she had been most accustomed He was a little dark man with sharp eyes set very near to each other in his head with a beaked nose thick at the bridge and a black moustache but no other beard Alice did not at all like the look of mister Levy but she stood up to receive him made him a little bow and asked him to sit down Is papa dressed yet Alice asked the servant Well miss I don t think he is not to say dressed Alice had thought it might be as well that mister Levy should know that there was a gentleman in the house with her I ve called about a little bit of business miss said mister Levy when they were alone Nothing as you need disturb yourself about You ll find it all square I think Then he took a case out of his breast pocket and produced a note which he handed to her Alice took the note and saw immediately that it was addressed to her by her cousin George Yes mister George Vavasor said mister Levy I dare say you never saw me before miss No sir I think not said Alice I am your cousin s clerk Oh you re mister Vavasor s clerk I ll read his letter if you please sir If you please miss George Vavasor s letter to his cousin was as follows DEAR ALICE After what passed between us when I last saw you I thought that on my return from Westmoreland I should learn that you had paid in at my bankers the money that I require But I find that this is not so and of course I excuse you because women so seldom know when or how to do that which business demands of them You have no doubt heard the injustice which my grandfather has done me and will probably feel as indignant as I do I only mention this now because the nature of his will makes it more than ever incumbent on you that you should be true to your pledge to me Till there shall be some ground for a better understanding between us and this I do not doubt will come I think it wiser not to call myself at Queen Anne Street I therefore send my confidential clerk with four bills each of five hundred pounds drawn at fourteen days date across which I will get you to write your name mister Levy will show you the way in which this should be done Your name must come under the word accepted and just above the name of Messrs Drummonds where the money must be lying ready at any rate not later than Monday fortnight Indeed the money must be there some time on the Saturday They know you so well at Drummonds that you will not object to call on the Saturday afternoon and ask if it is all right I have certainly been inconvenienced by not finding the money as I expected on my return to town If these bills are not properly provided for the result will be very disastrous to me I feel however sure that this will be done both for your own sake and for mine Affectionately yours GEORGE VAVASOR The unparalleled impudence of this letter had the effect which the writer had intended It made Alice think immediately of her own remissness if she had been remiss rather than of the enormity of his claim upon her The decision with which he asked for her money without any pretence at an excuse on his part did for the time induce her to believe that she had no alternative but to give it to him and that she had been wrong in delaying it She had told him that he should have it and she ought to have been as good as her word She should not have forced upon him the necessity of demanding it But the idea of signing four bills was terrible to her and she felt sure that she ought not to put her name to orders for so large an amount and then intrust them to such a man as mister Levy Her father was in the house and she might have asked him The thought that she would do so of course occurred to her But then it occurred to her also that were she to speak to her father as to this advancing of money to her cousin to this giving of money for she now well understood that it would be a gift were she to consult her father in any way about it he would hinder her not only from signing the bills for mister Levy but as far as he could do so from keeping the promise made to her cousin She was resolved that George should have the money and she knew that she could give it to him in spite of her father But her father might probably be able to delay the gift and thus rob it of its chief value If she were to sign the bills the money must be made to be forthcoming So much she understood mister Levy had taken out the four bills from the same case and had placed them on the table before him mister Vavasor has explained I believe miss what it is you have to do he said Yes sir my cousin has explained And there is nothing else to trouble you with I believe If you will just write your name across them here I need not detain you by staying any longer mister Levy was very anxious to make his visit as short as possible since he had heard that mister John Vavasor was in the house But Alice hesitated Two thousand pounds is a very serious sum of money She had heard much of sharpers and thought that she ought to be cautious What if this man of whom she had never before heard should steal the bills after she had signed them She looked again at her cousin s letter chiefly with the object of gaining time It s all right miss said mister Levy Could you not leave them with me sir said Alice Well not very well miss No doubt mister Vavasor has explained it all but the fact is he must have them this afternoon He has got a heavy sum to put down on the nail about this here election and if it ain t down to day them on whom he has to depend will be all abroad But sir the money will not be payable to day If I understand it they are not cheques No miss no they are not cheques But your name miss at fourteen days is the same as ready money just the same She paused and while she paused he reached a pen for her from the writing table and then she signed the four bills as he held them before her She was quick enough at doing this when she had once commenced the work Her object then was that the man should be gone from the house before her father could meet him These were the four bits of paper which George Vavasor tendered to mister Scruby s notice on the occasion which we have now in hand In doing so he made use of them after the manner of a grand capitalist who knows that he may assume certain airs as he allows the odours of the sweetness of his wealth to drop from him You insisted on ready money with your d suspicions said he and there it is You re not afraid of fourteen days I dare say Fourteen days is neither here nor there said mister Scruby We can let our payments stand over as long as that without doing any harm I ll send one of my men down to Grimes and tell him I can t see him till let me see and he looked at one of the bills till the fifteenth But this was not exactly what George Vavasor wanted He was desirous that the bills should be immediately turned into money so that the necessity of forcing payments from Alice should due provision for the bills not be made might fall into other hands than his We can wait till the fifteenth said Scruby as he handed the bits of paper back to his customer You will want a thousand you say said George A thousand to begin with Certainly not less Then you had better keep two of them Well no I don t see the use of that You had better collect them through your own banker and let me have a cheque on the fifteenth or sixteenth How cursed suspicious you are Scruby No I ain t I m not a bit suspicious I don t deal in such articles that s all What doubt can there be about such bills as those Everybody knows that my cousin has a considerable fortune altogether at her own disposal The truth is mister Vavasor that bills with ladies names on them ladies who are no way connected with business ain t just the paper that people like Nothing on earth can be surer You take them into the City for discount and see if the bankers don t tell you the same They may be done of course upon your name I say nothing about that I can explain to you the nature of the family arrangement but I can t do that to a stranger However I don t mind Of course not The time is so short that it does not signify Have them collected through your own bankers and then if it don t suit you to call send me a cheque for a thousand pounds when the time is up Then mister Scruby turned to some papers on his right hand as though the interview had been long enough Vavasor looked at him angrily opening his wound at him and cursing him inwardly mister Scruby went on with his paper by no means regarding either the wound or the unspoken curses Thereupon Vavasor got up and went away without any word of farewell As he walked along Great Marlborough Street and through those unalluring streets which surround the Soho district and so on to the Strand and his own lodgings he still continued to think of some wide scheme of revenge of some scheme in which mister Scruby might be included There had appeared something latterly in mister Scruby s manner to him something of mingled impatience and familiarity which made him feel that he had fallen in the attorney s estimation It was not that the lawyer thought him to be less honourable or less clever than he had before thought him but that the man was like a rat and knew a falling house by the instinct that was in him So George Vavasor cursed mister Scruby and calculated some method of murdering him without detection The reader is not to suppose that the Member for the Chelsea Districts had in truth resolved to gratify his revenge by murder by murdering any of those persons whom he hated so vigorously He did not himself think it probable that he would become a murderer But he received some secret satisfaction in allowing his mind to dwell upon the subject and in making those calculations He reflected that it would not do to take off Scruby and John Grey at the same time as it would be known that he was connected with both of them unless indeed he was to take off a third person at the same time a third person as to the expediency of ending whose career he made his calculations quite as often as he did in regard to any of those persons whom he cursed so often It need hardly be explained to the reader that this third person was the sitting Member for the Chelsea Districts As he was himself in want of instant ready money mister Scruby s proposition that he should leave the four bills at his own bankers to be collected when they came to maturity did not suit him He doubted much also whether at the end of the fourteen days the money would be forthcoming Alice would be driven to tell her father in order that the money might be procured and John Vavasor would probably succeed in putting impediments in the way of the payment He must take the bills into the City and do the best there that he could with them He was too late for this to day and therefore he went to his lodgings and then down to the House In the House he sat all the night with his hat over his eyes making those little calculations of which I have spoken You have heard the news haven t you said mister Bott to him whispering in his ear News no I haven t heard any news Finespun has resigned and Palliser is at this moment with the Duke of saint Bungay in the Lords library They may both be at the bottom of the Lords fishpond for what I care said Vavasor That s nonsense you know said Bott Still you know Palliser is Chancellor of the Exchequer at this moment What a lucky fellow you are to have such a chance come to you directly you get in As soon as he takes his seat down there of course we shall go up behind him We shall have another election in a month s time said George I m safe enough said Bott It never hurts a man at elections to be closely connected with the Government George Vavasor was in the City by times the next morning but he found that the City did not look with favourable eyes on his four bills The City took them up first horizontally and then with a twist of its hand perpendicularly and looked at them with distrustful eyes The City repeated the name Alice Vavasor as though it were not esteemed a good name on Change The City suggested that as the time was so short the holder of the bills would be wise to hold them till he could collect the amount It was very clear that the City suspected something wrong in the transaction The City by one of its mouths asserted plainly that ladies bills never meant business George Vavasor cursed the City and made his calculation about murdering it Might not a river of strychnine be turned on round the Exchange about luncheon time Three of the bills he left at last with his own bankers for collection and retained the fourth in his breast pocket intending on the morrow to descend with it into those lower depths of the money market which he had not as yet visited Again on the next day he went to work and succeeded to some extent Among those lower depths he found a capitalist who was willing to advance him two hundred pounds keeping that fourth bill in his possession as security The capitalist was to have forty pounds for the transaction and George cursed him as he took his cheque George Vavasor knew quite enough of the commercial world to enable him to understand that a man must be in a very bad condition when he consents to pay forty pounds for the use of two hundred for fourteen days He cursed the City He cursed the House of Commons He cursed his cousin Alice and his sister Kate He cursed the memory of his grandfather And he cursed himself mister Levy had hardly left the house in Queen Anne Street before Alice had told her father what she had done The money must be forthcoming said Alice To this her father made no immediate reply but turning himself in his chair away from her with a sudden start sat looking at the fire and shaking his head The money must be made to be forthcoming said Alice Papa will you see that it is done This was very hard upon poor John Vavasor and so he felt it to be Papa if you will not promise I must go to mister Round about it myself and must find out a broker to sell out for me You would not wish that my name should be dishonoured You will be ruined said he and for such a rascal as that Never mind whether he is a rascal or not papa You must acknowledge that he has been treated harshly by his grandfather I think that will was the wisest thing my father ever did Had he left the estate to George there wouldn t have been an acre of it left in the family in six months time But the life interest papa He would have raised all he could upon that and it would have done him no good At any rate papa he must have this two thousand pounds You must promise me that And then he will want more No I do not think he will ask for more At any rate I do not think that I am bound to give him all that I have I should think not I should like to know how you can be bound to give him anything Because I promised it I have signed the bills now and it must be done Still mister Vavasor made no promise Papa if you will not say that you will do it I must go down to mister Round at once I don t know that I can do it I don t know that mister Round can do it Your money is chiefly on mortgage Then there was a pause for a moment in the conversation Upon my word I never heard of such a thing in my life said mister Vavasor I never did Four thousand pounds given away to such a man as that in three months Four thousand pounds And you say you do not intend to marry him Certainly not all that is over And does he know that it is over I suppose he does You suppose so Things of that sort are so often over with you This was very cruel Perhaps she had deserved the reproach but still it was very cruel The blow struck her with such force that she staggered under it Tears came into her eyes and she could hardly speak lest she should betray herself by sobbing I know that I have behaved badly she said at last but I am punished and you might spare me now I didn t want to punish you he said getting up from his chair and walking about the room I don t want to punish you But I don t want to see you ruined I must go to mister Round then myself mister Vavasor went on walking about the room jingling the money in his trousers pockets and pushing the chairs about as he chanced to meet them At last he made a compromise with her He would take a day to think whether he would assist her in getting the money and communicate his decision to her on the following morning CHAPTER LXI The Bills Are Made All Right mister Vavasor was at his wits end about his daughter She had put her name to four bills for five hundred pounds each and had demanded from him almost without an apology his aid in obtaining money to meet them And she might put her name to any other number of bills and for any amount There was no knowing how a man ought to behave to such a daughter I don t want her money the father said to himself and if she had got none of her own I would make her as comfortable as I could with my own income But to see her throw her money away in such a fashion as this is enough to break a man s heart mister Vavasor went to his office in Chancery Lane but he did not go to the chambers of mister Round the lawyer Instead of calling on mister Round he sent a note by a messenger to Suffolk Street and the answer to the note came in the person of mister Grey John Grey was living in town in these days and was in the habit of seeing mister Vavasor frequently Indeed he had not left London since the memorable occasion on which he had pitched his rival down the tailor s stairs at his lodgings He had made himself pretty well conversant with George Vavasor s career and had often shuddered as he thought what might be the fate of any girl who might trust herself to marry such a man as that He had been at home when mister Vavasor s note had reached his lodgings and had instantly walked off towards Chancery Lane He knew his way to mister Vavasor s signing office very accurately for he had acquired a habit of calling there and of talking to the father about his daughter He was a patient persevering man confident in himself and apt to trust that he would accomplish those things which he attempted though he was hardly himself aware of any such aptitude He had never despaired as to Alice And though he had openly acknowledged to himself that she had been very foolish or rather that her judgement had failed her he had never in truth been angry with her He had looked upon her rejection of himself and her subsequent promise to her cousin as the effects of a mental hallucination very much to be lamented to be wept for perhaps through a whole life as a source of terrible sorrow to himself and to her But he regarded it all as a disease of which the cure was yet possible as a disease which though it might never leave the patient as strong as she was before might still leave her altogether And as he would still have clung to his love had she been attacked by any of those illnesses for which doctors have well known names so would he cling to her now that she was attacked by a malady for which no name was known He had already heard from mister Vavasor that Alice had discovered how impossible it was that she should marry her cousin and in his quiet patient enduring way was beginning to feel confident that he would at last carry his mistress off with him to Nethercoats It was certainly a melancholy place that signing office in which mister John Vavasor was doomed to spend twelve hours a week during every term time of his existence Whether any man could really pass an existence of work in such a workshop and not have gone mad could have endured to work there for seven hours a day every week day of his life I am not prepared to say I doubt much whether any victims are so doomed I have so often wandered through those gloomy passages without finding a sign of humanity there without hearing any slightest tick of the hammer of labour that I am disposed to think that Lord Chancellors have been anxious to save their subordinates from suicide and have mercifully decreed that the whole staff of labourers down to the very message boys of the office should be sent away to green fields or palatial clubs during at any rate a moiety of their existence The dismal set of chambers in which the most dismal room had been assigned to mister Vavasor was not actually in Chancery Lane Opening off from Chancery Lane are various other small lanes quiet dingy nooks some of them in the guise of streets going no whither some being thoroughfares to other dingy streets beyond in which sponging houses abound and others existing as the entrances to so called Inns of Court inns of which all knowledge has for years been lost to the outer world of the laity and as I believe lost almost equally to the inner world of the legal profession Who has ever heard of Symonds Inn But an ancestral Symonds celebrated no doubt in his time did found an inn and there it is to this day Of Staples Inn who knows the purposes or use Who are its members and what do they do as such And Staples Inn is an inn with pretensions having a chapel of its own or at any rate a building which in its external dimensions is ecclesiastical having a garden and architectural proportions and a facade towards Holborn somewhat dingy but respectable with an old gateway and with a decided character of its own The building in which mister John Vavasor had a room and a desk was located in one of these side streets and had in its infantine days been regarded with complacency by its founder It was stone faced and strong and though very ugly had about it that air of importance which justifies a building in assuming a special name of itself This building was called the Accountant General s Record Office and very probably in the gloom of its dark cellars may lie to this day the records of the expenditure of many a fair property which has gotten itself into Chancery and has never gotten itself out again It was entered by a dark hall the door of which was never closed and which having another door at its further end leading into another lane had become itself a thoroughfare But the passers through it were few in number Now and then a boy might be seen there carrying on his head or shoulders a huge mass of papers which you would presume to be accounts or some clerk employed in the purlieus of Chancery Lane who would know the shortest possible way from the chambers of some one attorney to those of some other But this hall though open at both ends was as dark as Erebus and any who lingered in it would soon find themselves to be growing damp and would smell mildew and would become naturally affected by the exhalations arising from those Chancery records beneath their feet Up the stone stairs from this hall John Grey passed to mister Vavasor s signing room The stairs were broad and almost of noble proportions but the darkness and gloom which hung about the hall hung also about them a melancholy set of stairs up and down which no man can walk with cheerful feet Here he came upon a long broad passage in which no sound was at first to be heard There was no busy noise of doors slamming no rapid sound of shoes no passing to and fro of men intent on their daily bread Pausing for a moment that he might look round about him and realize the deathlike stillness of the whole John Grey could just distinguish the heavy breathing of a man thereby learning that there was a captive in at any rate one of those prisons on each side of him As he drew near to the door of mister Vavasor s chamber he knew that the breathing came from thence On the door there were words inscribed which were just legible in the gloom Signing Room mister Vavasor How John Vavasor did hate those words It seemed to him that they had been placed there with the express object of declaring his degradation aloud to the world Since his grandfather s will had been read to him he had almost made up his mind to go down those melancholy stairs for the last time to shake the dust off his feet as he left the Accountant General s Record Office for ever and content himself with half his official income But how could he give up so many hundreds a year while his daughter was persisting in throwing away thousands as fast as or faster than she could lay her hands on them John Grey entered the room and found mister Vavasor sitting all alone in an arm chair over the fire I rather think that that breathing had been the breathing of a man asleep He was resting himself amidst the labours of his signing It was a large dull room which could not have been painted I should think within the memory of man looking out backwards into some court The black wall of another building seemed to stand up close to the window so close that no direct ray of the sun ever interrupted the signing clerk at his work In the middle of the room there was a large mahogany table on which lay a pile of huge papers Across the top of them there was placed a bit of blotting paper with a quill pen the two only tools which were necessary to the performance of the signing clerk s work On the table there stood a row of official books placed lengthways on their edges the Post Office Directory the Court Circular a Directory to the Inns of Court a dusty volume of Acts of Parliament which had reference to Chancery accounts a volume which mister Vavasor never opened and there were some others but there was no book there in which any Christian man or woman could take delight either for amusement or for recreation There were three or four chairs round the wall and there was the one arm chair which the occupant of the chamber had dragged away from its sacred place to the hearth rug There was also an old Turkey carpet on the floor Other furniture there was none Can it be a matter of surprise to any one that mister Vavasor preferred his club to his place of business He was not left quite alone in this deathlike dungeon Attached to his own large room there was a small closet in which sat the signing clerk s clerk a lad of perhaps seventeen years of age who spent the greatest part of his time playing tit tat to by himself upon official blotting paper Had I been mister Vavasor I should have sworn a bosom friendship with that lad have told him all my secrets and joined his youthful games Come in mister Vavasor had cried when John Grey disturbed his slumber by knocking at the door I m glad to see you very Sit down won t you Did you ever see such a wretched fire The coals they give you in this place are the worst in all London Did you ever see such coals And he gave a wicked poke at the fire It was now the first of May and Grey who had walked from Suffolk Street was quite warm One hardly wants a fire at all such weather as this he said Oh don t you said the signing clerk If you had to sit here all day you d see if you didn t want a fire It s the coldest building I ever put my foot in Sometimes in winter I have to sit here the whole day in a great coat I only wish I could shut old Sugden up here for a week or two after Christmas The great lawyer whom he had named was the man whom he supposed to have inflicted on him the terrible injury of his life and he was continually invoking small misfortunes on the head of that tyrant How is Alice said Grey desiring to turn the subject from the ten times told tale of his friend s wrongs mister Vavasor sighed She is well enough I believe he said Is anything the matter in Queen Anne Street You ll hardly believe it when I tell you and indeed I hardly know whether I ought to tell you or not As you and I have gone so far together I think that you ought to tell me anything that concerns her nearly That s just it It s about her money Do you know Grey I m beginning to think that I ve been wrong in allowing you to advance what you have done on her account Why wrong Because I foresee there ll be a difficulty about it How are we to manage about the repayment If she becomes my wife there will be no management wanted But how if she never becomes your wife I m beginning to think she ll never do anything like any other woman I m not quite sure that you understand her said Grey though of course you ought to do so better than any one else Nobody can understand her said the angry father She told me the other day as you know that she was going to have nothing more to do with her cousin Has she has she become friends with him again said Grey As he asked the question there came a red spot on each cheek showing the strong mental anxiety which had prompted it No I believe not that is certainly not in the way you mean I think that she is beginning to know that he is a rascal It is a great blessing that she has learned the truth before it was too late But would you believe it she has given him her name to bills for two thousand pounds payable at two weeks sight He sent to her only this morning a fellow that he called his clerk and she has been fool enough to accept them Two thousand pounds That comes of leaving money at a young woman s own disposal But we expected that you know said Grey who seemed to take the news with much composure Expected it Of course we did You yourself did not suppose that what he had before would have been the last But after she had quarrelled with him That would make no difference with her She had promised him her money and as it seems that he will be content with that let her keep her promise And give him everything Not if I can help it I ll expose him I will indeed Such a pitiful rascal as he is You will do nothing mister Vavasor that will injure your daughter I m very sure of that But by heavens Such sheer robbery as that Two thousand pounds more in fourteen days The shortness of the date at which the bills were drawn seemed to afflict mister Vavasor almost as keenly as the amount Then he described the whole transaction as accurately as he could do so and also told how Alice had declared her purpose of going to mister Round the lawyer if her father would not undertake to procure the money for her by the time the bills should become due mister Round you know has heard nothing about it he continued He doesn t dream of any such thing If she would take my advice she would leave the bills and let them be dishonoured As it is I think I shall call at Drummonds and explain the whole transaction You must not do that said Grey I will call at Drummonds instead and see that the money is all right for the bills As far as they go let him have his plunder And if she won t take you at last Grey Upon my word I don t think she ever will My belief is she ll never get married She ll never do anything like any other woman The money won t be missed by me if I never get married said Grey with a smile If she does marry me of course I shall make her pay me No by George that won t do said Vavasor If she were your daughter you d know that she could not take a man s money in that way And I know it now though she is not my daughter I was only joking As soon as I am certain finally certain that she can never become my wife I will take back my money You need not be afraid The nature of the arrangement we have made shall then be explained to her In this way it was settled and on the following morning the father informed the daughter that he had done her bidding and that the money would be placed to her credit at the bankers before the bills came due On that Saturday the day which her cousin had named in his letter she trudged down to Drummonds and was informed by a very courteous senior clerk in that establishment that due preparation for the bills had been made So far I think we may say that mister George Vavasor was not unfortunate CHAPTER LXII Going Abroad One morning early in May a full week before Alice s visit to the bankers at Charing Cross a servant in grand livery six feet high got out of a cab at the door in Queen Anne Street and sent up a note for Miss Vavasor declaring that he would wait in the cab for her answer He had come from Lady Glencora and had been specially ordered to go in a cab and come back in a cab and make himself as like a Mercury with wings to his feet as may be possible to a London footman mister Palliser had arranged his plans with his wife that morning or I should more correctly say had given her his orders and she in consequence had sent away her Mercury in hot pressing haste to Queen Anne Street Do come instantly if you can the note said I have so much to tell you and so much to ask of you If you can t come when shall I find you and where Alice sent back a note saying that she would be in Park Lane as soon as she could put on her bonnet and walk down and then the Mercury went home in his cab Alice found her friend in the small breakfast room up stairs sitting close by the window They had not as yet met since the evening of Lady Monk s party nor had Lady Glencora seen Alice in the mourning which she now wore for her grandfather Oh dear what a change it makes in you she said I never thought of your being in black I don t know what it is you want but shan t I do in mourning as well as I would in colours You ll do in anything dear But I have so much to tell you and I don t know how to begin And I ve so much to ask of you and I m so afraid you won t do it You generally find me very complaisant No I don t dear It is very seldom you will do anything for me But I must tell you everything first Do take your bonnet off for I shall be hours in doing it Hours in telling me Yes and in getting your consent to what I want you to do But I think I ll tell you that first I m to be taken abroad immediately Who is to take you Ah you may well ask that If you could know what questions I have asked myself on that head I sometimes say things to myself as though they were the most proper and reasonable things in the world and then within an hour or two I hate myself for having thought of them But why don t you answer me Who is going abroad with you Well you are to be one of the party I Yes you When I have named so very respectable a chaperon for my youth of course you will understand that my husband is to take us But mister Palliser can t leave London at this time of the year That s just it He is to leave London at this time of the year Don t look in that way for it s all settled Whether you go with me or not I ve got to go To day is Tuesday We are to be off next Tuesday night if you can make yourself ready We shall breakfast in Paris on Wednesday morning and then it will be to us all just as if we were in a new world mister Palliser will walk up and down the new court of the Louvre and you will be on his left arm and I shall be on his right just like English people and it will be the most proper thing that ever was seen in life Then we shall go on to Basle Alice shuddered as Basle was mentioned thinking of the balcony over the river and so to Lucerne But no that was the first plan and mister Palliser altered it He spent a whole day up here with maps and Bradshaw s and Murray s guide books and he scolded me so because I didn t care whether we went first to Baden or to some other place How could I care I told him I would go anywhere he chose to take me Then he told me I was heartless and I acknowledged that I was heartless I am heartless I said Tell me something I don t know Oh Cora why did you say that I didn t choose to contradict my husband Besides it s true Then he threw the Bradshaw away and all the maps flew about So I picked them up again and said we d go to Switzerland first I knew that would settle it and of course he decided on stopping at Baden If he had said Jericho it would have been the same thing to me Wouldn t you like to go to Jericho I should have no special objection to Jericho But you are to go to Baden instead I ve said nothing about that yet But you have not told me half your story Why is mister Palliser going abroad in the middle of Parliament in this way Ah now I must go back to the beginning And indeed Alice I hardly know how to tell you not that I mind you knowing it only there are some things that won t get themselves told You can hardly guess what it is that he is giving up You must swear that you won t repeat what I m going to tell you now I m not a person apt to tell secrets but I shan t swear anything What a woman you are for discretion it is you that ought to be Chancellor of the Exchequer you are so wise Only you haven t brought your own pigs to the best market after all Never mind my own pigs now Cora I do mind them very much But the secret is this They have asked mister Palliser to be Chancellor of the Exchequer and he has refused Think of that But why Because of me of me and my folly and wickedness and abominations Because he has been fool enough to plague himself with a wife he who of all men ought to have kept himself free from such troubles Oh he has been so good It is almost impossible to make any one understand it If you could know how he has longed for this office how he has worked for it day and night wearing his eyes out with figures when everybody else has been asleep shutting himself up with such creatures as mister Bott when other men have been shooting and hunting and flirting and spending their money He has been a slave to it for years all his life I believe in order that he might sit in the Cabinet and be a minister and a Chancellor of the Exchequer He has hoped and feared and has been I believe sometimes half mad with expectation This has been his excitement what racing and gambling are to other men At last the place was there ready for him and they offered it to him They begged him to take it almost on their knees The Duke of saint Bungay was here all one morning about it but mister Palliser sent him away and refused the place It s all over now and the other man whom they all hate so much is to remain in But why did he refuse it I keep on telling you because of me He found that I wanted looking after and that missus Marsham and mister Bott between them couldn t do it Oh Cora how can you talk in that way If you knew all you might well ask how I could You remember about Lady Monk s ball that you would not go to as you ought to have done If you had gone mister Palliser would have been Chancellor of the Exchequer at this minute he would indeed Only think of that But though you did not go other people did who ought to have remained at home I went for one and you know who was there for another What difference could that make to you said Alice angrily It might have made a great deal of difference And for the matter of that so it did mister Palliser was there too but of course he went away immediately I can t tell you all the trouble there had been about missus Marsham whether I was to take her with me or not However I wouldn t take her and didn t take her The carriage went for her first and there she was when we got there and mister Bott was there too I wonder whether I shall ever make you understand it all There are some things I don t want to understand There they both were watching me looking at me the whole evening and of course I resolved that I would not be put down by them I think if I had been you I would not have allowed their presence to make any difference to me That is very easily said my dear but by no means so easily done You can t make yourself unconscious of eyes that are always looking at you I dared them at any rate to do their worst for I stood up to dance with Burgo Fitzgerald Oh Cora Why shouldn t I At any rate I did and I waltzed with him for half an hour Alice I never will waltz again never I have done with dancing now I don t think even in my maddest days I ever kept it up so long as I did then And I knew that everybody was looking at me It was not only missus Marsham and mister Bott but everybody there I felt myself to be desperate mad like a wild woman There I was going round and round and round with the only man for whom I ever cared two straws It seemed as though everything had been a dream since the old days Ah how well I remember the first time I danced with him at his aunt s house in Cavendish Square They had only just brought me out in London then and I thought that he was a god Cora I cannot bear to hear you talk like that I know well enough that he is no god now some people say that he is a devil but he was like Apollo to me then Did you ever see anyone so beautiful as he is I never saw him at all I wish you could have seen him but you will some day I don t know whether you care for men being handsome Alice thought of John Grey who was the handsomest man that she knew but she made no answer I do or rather I used to do continued Lady Glencora I don t think I care much about anything now but I don t see why handsome men should not be run after as much as handsome women But you wouldn t have a girl run after any man would you whether handsome or ugly But they do you know When I saw him the other night he was just as handsome as ever the same look half wild and half tame like an animal you cannot catch but which you think would love you so if you could catch him In a little while it was just like the old time and I had made up my mind to care nothing for the people looking at me And you think that was right No I don t Yes I do that is It wasn t right to care about dancing with him but it was right to disregard all the people gaping round What was it to them Why should they care who I danced with That is nonsense dear and you must know that it is so If you were to see a woman misbehaving herself in public would not you look on and make your comments Could you help doing so if you were to try You are very severe Alice Misbehaving in public Yes Cora I am only taking your own story According to that you were misbehaving in public Lady Glencora got up from her chair near the window on which she had been crouching close to Alice s knees and walked away towards the fireplace What am I to say to you or how am I to talk to you said Alice You would not have me tell you a lie Of all things in the world I hate a prude the most said Lady Glencora Cora look here If you consider it prudery on my part to disapprove of your waltzing with mister Fitzgerald in the manner you have described or indeed in any other manner you and I must differ so totally about the meaning of words and the nature of things that we had better part Alice you are the unkindest creature that ever lived You are as cold as stone I sometimes think that you can have no heart I don t mind your saying that Whether I have a heart or not I will leave you to find out for yourself but I won t be called a prude by you You know you were wrong to dance with that man What has come of it What have you told me yourself this morning In order to preserve you from misery and destruction mister Palliser has given up all his dearest hopes He has had to sacrifice himself that he might save you That I take it is about the truth of it and yet you tell me that you have done no wrong I never said so Now she had come back to her chair by the window and was again sitting in that crouching form I never said that I was not wrong Of course I was wrong I have been so wrong throughout that I have never been right yet Let me tell it on to the end and then you can go away if you like and tell me that I am too wicked for your friendship Have I ever said anything like that Cora But you will I dare say when I have done Well what do you think my senior duenna did the female one I mean She took my own carriage and posted off after mister Palliser as hard as ever she could leaving the male duenna on the watch I was dancing as hard as I could but I knew what was going on all the time as well as though I had heard them talking Of course mister Palliser came after me I don t know what else he could do unless indeed he had left me to my fate He came there and behaved so well so much like a perfect gentleman Of course I went home and I was prepared to tell him everything if he spoke a word to me that I intended to leave him and that cart ropes should not hold me To leave him Cora Yes and go with that other man whose name you won t let me mention I had a letter from him in my pocket asking me to go He asked me a dozen times that night I cannot think how it was that I did not consent That you did not consent to your own ruin and disgrace That I did not consent to go off with him anywhere Of course it would have been my own destruction I m not such a fool as not to know that Do you suppose I have never thought of it what it would be to be a man s mistress instead of his wife If I had not I should be a thing to be hated and despised When once I had done it I should hate and despise myself I should feel myself to be loathsome and as it were a beast among women But why did they not let me marry him instead of driving me to this And though I might have destroyed myself I should have saved the man who is still my husband Do you know I told him all that told him that if I had gone away with Burgo Fitzgerald he would have another wife and would have children and would You told your husband that you had thought of leaving him Yes I told him everything I told him that I dearly loved that poor fellow for whom as I believe nobody else on earth cares a single straw And what did he say I cannot tell you what he said only that we are all to go to Baden together and then to Italy But he did not seem a bit angry he very seldom is angry unless at some trumpery thing as when he threw the book away And when I told him that he might have another wife and a child he put his arm round me and whispered to me that he did not care so much about it as I had imagined I felt more like loving him at that moment than I had ever done before He must be fit to be an angel He s fit to be a cabinet minister which I m quite sure he d like much better And now you know everything but no there is one thing you don t know yet When I tell you that you ll want to make him an archangel or a prime minister We ll go abroad he said and remember this was his own proposition made long before I was able to speak a word We ll go abroad and you shall get your cousin Alice to go with us That touched me more than anything Only think if he had proposed missus Marsham But yet he does not like me You re wrong there Alice There has been no question of liking or of disliking He thought you would be a kind of missus Marsham and when you were not but went out flirting among the ruins with Jeffrey Palliser instead I never went out flirting with Jeffrey Palliser He did with you which is all the same thing And when Plantagenet knew of that for of course mister Bott told him mister Bott can t see everything Those men do The worst is they see more than everything But at any rate mister Palliser has got over all that now Come Alice the fact of the offer having come from himself should disarm you of any such objection as that As he has held out his hand to you you have no alternative but to take it I will take his hand willingly And for my sake you will go with us He understands himself that I am not fit to be his companion and to have no companion but him Now there is a spirit of wisdom about you that will do for him and a spirit of folly that will suit me I can manage to put myself on a par with a girl who has played such a wild game with her lovers as you have done Alice would give no promise then Her first objection was that she had undertaken to go down to Westmoreland and comfort Kate in the affliction of her broken arm And I must go said Alice remembering how necessary it was that she should plead her own cause with George Vavasor s sister But she acknowledged that she had not intended to stay long in Westmoreland probably not more than a week and it was at last decided that the Pallisers should postpone their journey for four or five days and that Alice should go with them immediately upon her return from Vavasor Hall I have no objection said her father speaking with that voice of resignation which men use when they are resolved to consider themselves injured whatever may be done I can get along in lodgings I suppose we had better leave the house as you have given away so much of your own fortune Alice did not think it worth her while to point out to him in answer to this that her contribution to their joint housekeeping should still remain the same as ever Such however she knew would be the fact and she knew also that she would find her father in the old house when she returned from her travels To her in her own great troubles the absence from London would be as serviceable as it could be to Lady Glencora Indeed she had already begun to feel the impossibility of staying quietly at home She could lecture her cousin whose faults were open easy to be defined and almost loud in their nature but she was not on that account the less aware of her own She knew that she too had cause to be ashamed of herself She was half afraid to show her face among her friends and wept grievously over her own follies Those cruel words of her father rang in her ears constantly Things of that sort are so often over with you The reproach though cruel was true and what reproach more galling could be uttered to an unmarried girl such as was Alice Vavasor She had felt from the first moment in which the proposition was made to her that it would be well that she should for a while leave her home and especially that drawing room in Queen Anne Street which told her so many tales that she would fain forget if it were possible mister Palliser would not allow his wife to remain in London for the ten or twelve days which must yet elapse before they started nor could he send her into the country alone He took her down to Matching Priory having obtained leave to be absent from the House for the remainder of the Session and remained with her there till within two days of their departure That week down at Matching as she afterwards told Alice was very terrible He never spoke a word to rebuke her He never hinted that there had been aught in her conduct of which he had cause to complain He treated her with a respect that was perfect and indeed with more outward signs of affection than had ever been customary with him But as Lady Glencora afterwards expressed it he was always looking after me I believe he thought that Burgo Fitzgerald had hidden himself among the ruins she said once to Alice He never suspected me I am sure of that but he thought that he ought to look after me And Lady Glencora in this had very nearly hit the truth mister Palliser had resolved from that hour in which he had walked out among the elms in Kensington Gardens that he would neither suspect his wife nor treat her as though he suspected her The blame had been his perhaps more than it had been hers So much he had acknowledged to himself thinking of the confession she had made to him before their marriage But it was manifestly his imperative duty his duty of duties to save her from that pitfall into which as she herself had told him she had been so ready to fall For her sake and for his this must be done It was a duty so imperative that in its performance he had found himself forced to abandon his ambition To have his wife taken from him would be terrible but the having it said all over the world that such a misfortune had come upon him would be almost more terrible even than that So he went with his wife hither and thither down at Matching allowing himself to be driven about behind Dandy and Flirt He himself proposed these little excursions They were tedious to him but doubly tedious to his wife who now found it more difficult than ever to talk to him She struggled to talk and he struggled to talk but the very struggles themselves made the thing impossible He sat with her in the mornings and he sat with her in the evenings he breakfasted with her lunched with her and dined with her He went to bed early having no figures which now claimed his attention And so the week at last wore itself away I saw him yawning sometimes Lady Glencora said afterwards as though he would fall in pieces CHAPTER LXIII mister John Grey in Queen Anne Street Alice was resolved that she would keep her promise to Kate and pay her visit to Westmoreland before she started with the Pallisers Kate had written to her three lines with her left hand begging her to come and those three lines had been more eloquent than anything she could have written had her right arm been uninjured Alice had learned something of the truth as to the accident from her father or rather had heard her father s surmises on the subject She had heard too how her cousin George had borne himself when the will was read and how he had afterwards disappeared never showing himself again at the hall After all that had passed she felt that she owed Kate some sympathy Sympathy may no doubt be conveyed by letter but there are things on which it is almost impossible for any writer to express himself with adequate feeling and there are things too which can be spoken but which cannot be written Therefore though the journey must be a hurried one Alice sent word down to Westmoreland that she was to be expected there in a day or two On her return she was to go at once to Park Lane and sleep there for the two nights which would intervene before the departure of the Pallisers On the day before she started for Westmoreland her father came to her in the middle of the day and told her that John Grey was going to dine with him in Queen Anne Street on that evening To day papa she asked Yes to day Why not No man is less particular as to what he eats than Grey I was not thinking of that papa she said To this mister Vavasor made no reply but stood for some minutes looking out of the window Then he prepared to leave the room getting himself first as far as the table where he lifted a book and then on half way to the door before Alice arrested him Perhaps papa you and mister Grey had better dine alone What do you mean by alone I meant without me as two men generally like to do If I wanted that I should have asked him to dine at the club said mister Vavasor and then he again attempted to go But papa Well my dear If you mean to say that because of what has passed you object to meet mister Grey I can only tell you it s nonsense confounded nonsense If he chooses to come there can be no reason why you shouldn t receive him It will look as though Look what As though he were asked as my guest That s nonsense I saw him yesterday and I asked him to come I saw him again to day and he said he would come He s not such a fool as to suppose after that that you asked him No not that I asked him And if you run away you ll only make more of the thing than it s worth Of course I can t make you dine with me if you don t like Alice did not like it but after some consideration she thought that she might be open to the imputation of having made more of the thing than it was worth if she ran away as her father called it She was going to leave the country for some six or eight months perhaps for a longer time than that and it might be as well that she should have an opportunity of telling her plans to mister Grey She could do it she thought in such a way as to make him understand that her last quarrel with George Vavasor was not supposed to alter the footing on which she stood with him She did not doubt that her father had told everything to mister Grey She knew well enough what her father s wishes still were It was not odd that he should be asking John Grey to his house though such exercises of domestic hospitality were very unusual with him But so she declared to herself such little attempts on his part would be altogether thrown away It was a pity that he had not yet learned to know her better She would receive mister Grey as the mistress of her father s house now for the last time and then on her return in the following year he would be at Nethercoats and the whole thing would be over She dressed herself very plainly simply changing one black frock for another and then sat herself in her drawing room awaiting the two gentlemen It was already past the hour of dinner before her father came up stairs She knew that he was in the house and in her heart she accused him of keeping out of the way in order that John Grey might be alone with her Whether or no she were right in her suspicions John Grey did not take advantage of the opportunity offered to him Her father came up first and had seated himself silently in his arm chair before the visitor was announced As mister Grey entered the room Alice knew that she was flurried but still she managed to carry herself with some dignity His bearing was perfect But then as she declared to herself afterwards no possible position in life would put him beside himself He came up to her with his usual quiet smile a smile that was genial even in its quietness and took her hand He took it fairly and fully into his but there was no squeezing no special pressure no love making And when he spoke to her he called her Alice as though his doing so was of all things the most simply a matter of course There was no tell tale hesitation in his voice When did he ever hesitate at anything I hear you are going abroad he said with your cousin Lady Glencora Palliser Illustration She managed to carry herself with some dignity Yes said Alice I am going with them for a long tour We shall not return I fancy till the end of next winter Plans of that sort are as easily broken as they are made said her father You won t be your own mistress and I advise you not to count too surely upon getting further than Baden If mister Palliser changes his mind of course I shall come home said Alice with a little attempt at a smile I should think him a man not prone to changes said Grey But all London is talking about his change of mind at this moment They say at the clubs that he might have been in the Cabinet if he would but that he has taken up this idea of going abroad at the moment when he was wanted It s his wife s doing I take it said mister Vavasor That s the worst of being in Parliament said Grey A man can t do anything without giving a reason for it There must be men for public life of course but upon my word I think we ought to be very much obliged to them Alice as she took her old lover s arm and walked down with him to dinner thought of all her former quarrels with him on this very subject On this very point she had left him He had never argued the matter with her He had never asked her to argue with him He had not condescended so far as that Had he done so she thought that she would have brought herself to think as he thought She would have striven at any rate to do so But she could not become unambitious tranquil fond of retirement and philosophic without an argument on the matter without being allowed even the poor grace of owning herself to be convinced If a man takes a dog with him from the country up to town the dog must live a town life without knowing the reason why must live a town life or die a town death But a woman should not be treated like a dog Had he deigned to discuss it with me Alice had so often said But no he will read his books and I am to go there to fetch him his slippers and make his tea for him All this came upon her again as she walked down stairs by his side and with it there came a consciousness that she had been driven by this usage into the terrible engagement which she had made with her cousin That no doubt was now over There was no longer to her any question of her marrying George Vavasor But the fact that she had been mad enough to think and talk of such a marriage had of itself been enough to ruin her Things of that sort are so often over with you After such a speech as that to her from her father Alice told herself that there could be no more things of that sort for her But all her misery had been brought about by this scornful superiority to the ordinary pursuits of the world this looking down upon humanity It seems to me she said very quietly while her hand was yet upon his arm that your pity is hardly needed I should think that no persons can be happier than those whom you call our public men Ah said he that is our old quarrel He said it as though the quarrel had simply been an argument between them or a dozen arguments as arguments do come up between friends not as though it had served to separate for life two persons who had loved each other dearly It s the old story of the town mouse and the country mouse as old as the hills Mice may be civil for a while and compliment each other but when they come to speak their minds freely each likes his own life best She said nothing more at the moment and the three sat down to their small dinner table It was astonishing to Alice that he should be able to talk in this way to hint at such things to allude to their former hopes and present condition without a quiver in his voice or as far as she could perceive without any feeling in his heart Alice said her father I can t compliment your cook upon her soup You don t encourage her papa by eating it often enough And then you only told me at two o clock to day If a cook can t make soup between two and seven she can t make it in a week I hope mister Grey will excuse it said Alice Isn t it good said he I won t say that it is because I should be pretending to have an opinion but I should not have found out anything against it of myself Where do you dine usually now you are in London mister Vavasor asked At the old club at the corner of Suffolk Street It s the oldest club in London I believe I never belonged to any other and therefore can t compare them but I can t imagine anything much nicer They give you better soup than ours said Alice You ve an excellent cook said mister Vavasor with great gravity one of the best second class cooks in London We were very nearly getting him but you nicked him just in time I know him well It s a great deal more than I do or hope to do There s another branch of public life for which I m quite unfitted I d as soon be called on to choose a Prime Minister for the country as I would a cook for a club Of course you would said mister Vavasor There may be as many as a dozen cooks about London to be looked up but there are never more than two possible Prime Ministers about And as one of them must be going out when the other is coming in I don t see that there can be any difficulty Moreover now a days people do their politics for themselves but they expect to have their dinners cooked for them The little dinner went on quietly and very easily mister Vavasor found fault with nearly everything But as on this occasion the meat and the drink with the manner of the eating and drinking did not constitute the difficulty Alice was indifferent to her father s censures The thing needed was that she and mister Grey should be able to sit together at the same table without apparent consciousness of their former ties Alice felt that she was succeeding indifferently well while she was putting in little mock defences for the cook And as for John Grey he succeeded so well that his success almost made Alice angry with him It required no effort with him at all to be successful in this matter If he can forget all that has passed so much the better said Alice to herself when she got up into the drawing room Then she sat herself down on the sofa and cried Oh what had she not lost Had any woman ever been so mad so reckless so heartless as she had been And she had done it knowing that she loved him She cried bitterly and then went away to wash her eyes that she might be ready to give him his coffee when he should come up stairs She does not look well said Grey as soon as she had left the room Well no how can she look well after what she has gone through I sometimes think that of all the people I ever knew she has been the most foolish But of course it is not for me to say anything against my own child and of all people not to you Nothing that you could say against her would make any difference to me I sometimes fancy that I know her better than you do And you think that she ll still come round again I cannot say that I think so No one can venture to say whether or not such wounds as hers may be cured There are hearts and bodies so organized that in them severe wounds are incurable whereas in others no injury seems to be fatal But I can say that if she be not cured it shall not be from want of perseverance on my part Upon my word Grey I don t know how to thank you enough I don t indeed It doesn t seem to me to be a case for thanking Of course it isn t I know that well enough And in the ordinary way of the world no father would think of thanking a man for wanting to marry his daughter But things have come to such a pass with us that by George I don t feel like any other father I don t mind saying anything to you you know That claret isn t very good but you might as well take another glass Thank you I will I should have said that that was rather good wine now It s not just the thing What s the use of my having good wine here when nobody comes to drink it But as I was saying about Alice of course I ve felt all this thing very much I feel as though I were responsible and yet what could I do She s her own mistress through it all When she told me she was going to marry that horrible miscreant my nephew what could I do That s over now and we need not talk about it It s very kind of you to say so very I believe she s a good girl I do indeed in spite of it all I ve no doubt of her being what you call a good girl none in the least What she has done to me does not impair her goodness I don t think you have ever understood how much all this has been a matter of conscience with her Conscience said the angry father I hate such conscience I like the conscience that makes a girl keep her word and not bring disgrace upon those she belongs to I shall not think that I am disgraced said Grey quietly if she will come and be my wife She has meant to do right and has endeavoured to take care of the happiness of other people rather than her own She has taken very little care of mine said mister Vavasor I shall not be at all afraid to trust mine to her if she will let me do so But she has been wounded sorely and it must take time And in the meantime what are we to do when she tells us that mister George Vavasor wants another remittance Two thousand pounds a quarter comes heavy you know Let us hope that he has had enough Enough Did such a man ever have enough Let us hope then that she thinks he has had enough Come may I go up stairs Oh yes I ll follow you She ll think that I mean something if I leave you together From all this it will be seen that Alice s father and her lover still stood together on confidential terms Not easily had mister Vavasor brought himself to speak of his daughter to John Grey in such language as he had now used but he had been forced by adverse circumstances to pass the Rubicon of parental delicacy he had been driven to tell his wished for son in law that he did wish to have him as a son in law he had been compelled to lay aside those little airs of reserve with which a father generally speaks of his daughter and now all was open between them And you really start to morrow said Grey as he stood close over Alice s work table mister Vavasor had followed him into the drawing room but had seated himself in an easy chair on the other side of the fire There was no tone of whispering in Grey s voice but yet he spoke in a manner which showed that he did not intend to be audible on the other side of the room I start for Westmoreland to morrow We do not leave London for the continent till the latter end of next week But you will not be here again No I shall not come back to Queen Anne Street And you will be away for many months mister Palliser talked of next Easter as the term of his return He mentioned Easter to Lady Glencora I have not seen him myself since I agreed to go with him What should you say if you met me somewhere in your travels He had now gently seated himself on the sofa beside her not so close to her as to give her just cause to move away but yet so near as to make his conversation with her quite private I don t think that will be very likely she replied not knowing what to say I think it is very likely For myself I hate surprises I could not bring myself to fall in upon your track unawares I shall go abroad but it will not be till the late autumn when the summer heats are gone and I shall endeavour to find you To find me mister Grey There was a quivering in her voice as she spoke which she could not prevent though she would have given worlds to prevent it I do not think that will be quite fair It will not be unfair I think if I give you notice of my approach I will not fall upon you and your friends unawares I was not thinking of them They would be glad to know you of course And equally of course or rather much more of course you will not be glad to see me That s what you mean I mean that we had better not meet more than we can help I think differently Alice quite differently The more we meet the better that is what I think But I will not stop to trouble you now Good night Then he got up and went away and her father went with him mister Vavasor as he rose from his chair declared that he would just walk through a couple of streets but Alice knew that he was gone to his club CHAPTER LXIV The Rocks and Valleys During these days missus Greenow was mistress of the old Hall down in Westmoreland and was nursing Kate assiduously through the calamity of her broken arm There had come to be a considerable amount of confidence between the aunt and the niece Kate had acknowledged to her aunt that her brother had behaved badly very badly and the aunt had confessed to the niece that she regarded Captain Bellfield as a fit subject for compassion And he was violent to you and broke your arm I always knew it was so missus Greenow had said speaking with reference to her nephew But this Kate had denied No said she that was an accident When he went away and left me he knew nothing about it And if he had broken both my arms I should not have cared much I could have forgiven him that But that which Kate could not forgive him was the fault which she had herself committed For his sake she had done her best to separate Alice and John Grey and George had shown himself to be unworthy of the kindness of her treachery I would give all I have in the world to bring them together again Kate said They ll come together fast enough if they like each other said missus Greenow Alice is young still and they tell me she s as good looking as ever A girl with her money won t have far to seek for a husband even if this paragon from Cambridgeshire should not turn up again You don t know Alice aunt No I don t But I know what young women are and I know what young men are All this nonsense about her cousin George what difference will it make A man like mister Grey won t care about that especially not if she tells him all about it My belief is that a girl can have anything forgiven her if she ll only tell it herself But Kate preferred the other subject and so I think did missus Greenow herself Of course my dear she would say marriage with me if I should marry again would be a very different thing to your marriage or that of any other young person As for love that has been all over for me since poor Greenow died I have known nothing of the softness of affection since I laid him in his cold grave and never can again Captain Bellfield I said to him if you were to kneel at my feet for years it would not make me care for you in the way of love And what did he say to that How am I to tell you what he said He talked nonsense about my beauty as all the men do If a woman were hump backed and had only one eye they wouldn t be ashamed to tell her she was a Venus But aunt you are a handsome woman you know Laws my dear as if I didn t understand all about it as if I didn t know what makes a woman run after It isn t beauty and it isn t money altogether I ve seen women who had plenty of both and not a man would come nigh them They didn t dare There are some of them a man would as soon think of putting his arm round a poplar tree they are so hard and so stiff You know you re a little that way yourself Kate and I ve always told you it won t do I m afraid I m too old to mend aunt Not at all if you ll only set your wits to work and try You ve plenty of money now and you re good looking enough too when you take the trouble to get yourself up But as I said before it isn t that that s wanted There s a stand off about some women what the men call a nollimy tangere that a man must be quite a furious Orlando to attempt to get the better of it They look as though matrimony itself were improper and as if they believed that little babies were found about in the hedges and ditches They talk of women being forward There are some of them a deal too backward according to my way of thinking Yours is a comfortable doctrine aunt That s just what I want it to be I want things to be comfortable Why shouldn t things be nice about one when one s got the means Nobody can say it s a pleasant thing to live alone I always thought that man in the song hit it off properly You remember what he says The poker and tongs to each other belongs So they do and that should be the way with men and women But the poker and tongs have but a bad life of it sometimes Not so often as the people say my dear Men and women ain t like lumps of sugar They don t melt because the water is sometimes warm Now if I do take Bellfield and I really think I shall but if I do he ll give me a deal of trouble I know he will He ll always be wanting my money and of course he ll get more than he ought I m not a Solomon nor yet a Queen of Sheba no more than anybody else And he ll smoke too many cigars and perhaps drink more brandy and water than he ought And he ll be making eyes too at some of the girls who ll be fools enough to let him Dear me aunt if I thought all that ill of him I m sure I wouldn t marry him especially as you say you don t love him As for love my dear that s gone clear gone Whereupon missus Greenow put up her handkerchief to her eyes Some women can love twice but I am not one of them I wish I could I wish I could These last words were spoken in a tone of solemn regret which however she contrived to change as quickly as she had adopted it But my dear marriage is a comfortable thing And then though the Captain may be a little free I don t doubt but what I shall get the upper hand with him at last I shan t stop his cigars and brandy and water you know Why shouldn t a man smoke and have a glass if he don t make a beast of himself I like to see a man enjoy himself And then she added speaking tenderly of her absent lover I do think he s fond of me I do indeed So is mister Cheesacre for the matter of that Poor Cheesy I believe he was though he did talk so much about money I always like to believe the best I can of them But then there was no poetry about Cheesy I don t care about saying it now as you ve quite made up your mind not to have him Quite aunt Your grandfather s will does make a difference you know But as I was saying I do like a little romance about them just a sniff as I call it of the rocks and valleys One knows that it doesn t mean much but it s like artificial flowers it gives a little colour and takes off the dowdiness Of course bread and cheese is the real thing The rocks and valleys are no good at all if you haven t got that But enough is as good as a feast Thanks to dear Greenow here the handkerchief was again used Thanks to dear Greenow I shall never want Of course I shan t let any of the money go into his hands the Captain s I mean I know a trick worth two of that my dear But lord love you I ve enough for him and me What s the good of a woman s wanting to keep it all to herself Illustration A sniff of the rocks and valleys And you think you ll really take him aunt and pay his washerwoman s bills for him You remember what you told me when I first saw him Oh yes I remember And if he can t pay his own washerwoman isn t that so much more of a reason that I should do it for him Well yes I think I will take him That is if he lets me take him just as I choose Beggars mustn t be choosers my dear In this way the aunt and niece became very confidential and missus Greenow whispered into Kate s ears her belief that Captain Bellfield might possibly make his way across the country to Westmoreland There would be no harm in offering him a bed would there missus Greenow asked You see the inn at Shap is a long way off for morning calls Kate could not take upon herself to say that there would be any harm but she did not like the idea of having Captain Bellfield as a visitor After all perhaps he mayn t come said the widow I don t see where he is to raise the money for such a journey now that he has quarrelled with mister Cheesacre If Captain Bellfield must come to Vavasor Hall at any rate let him not come till Alice s visit had been completed That was Kate s present wish and so much she ventured to confide to her aunt But there seemed to be no way of stopping him I don t in the least know where he is my dear and as for writing to him I never did such a thing in my life and I shouldn t know how to begin missus Greenow declared that she had not positively invited the Captain but on this point Kate hardly gave full credit to her aunt s statement Alice arrived and for a day or two the three ladies lived very pleasantly together Kate still wore her arm in a sling but she was able to walk out and would take long walks in spite of the doctor s prohibition Of course they went up on the mountains Indeed all the walks from Vavasor Hall led to the mountains unless one chose to take the road to Shap But they went up across the beacon hill as though by mutual consent There were no questions asked between them as to the route to be taken and though they did not reach the stone on which they had once sat looking over upon Haweswater they did reach the spot upon which Kate had encountered her accident It was here I fell she said and the last I saw of him was his back as he made his way down into the valley there When I got upon my legs I could still see him It was one of those evenings when the clouds are dark but you can see all objects with a peculiar clearness through the air I stood here ever so long holding my arm and watching him but he never once turned to look back at me Do you know Alice I fancy that I shall never see him again Do you suppose that he means to quarrel with you altogether I can hardly tell you what I mean He seemed to me to be going away from me as though he went into another world His figure against the light was quite clear and he walked quickly and on he went till the slope of the hill hid him from me Of course I thought that he would return to the Hall At one time I almost feared that he would come upon me through the woods as I went back myself But yet I had a feeling what people call a presentiment that I should never see him again He has never written No not a word You must remember that he did not know that I had hurt myself I am sure he will not write and I am sure also that I shall not If he wanted money I would send it to him but I would not write to him I fear he will always want money Kate I fear he will If you could know what I suffered when he made me write that letter to you But of course I was a beast Of course I ought not to have written it I thought it a very proper letter It was a mean letter The whole thing was mean He should have starved in the street before he had taken your money He should have given up Parliament and everything else I had doubted much about him before but it was that which first turned my heart against him I had begun to fear that he was not such a man as I had always thought him as I had spoken of him to you I had judged of him for myself said Alice Of course you did But I had endeavoured to make you judge kindly Alice dear we have both suffered for him you more than I perhaps but I too have given up everything for him My whole life has been at his service I have been his creature to do his bidding just as he might tell me He made me do things that I knew to be wrong things that were foreign to my own nature and yet I almost worshipped him Even now if he were to come back I believe that I should forgive him everything I should forgive him but I could never do more But he will never come back He will never ask us to forgive him or even wish it He has no heart He has longed for money till the Devil has hardened his heart said Alice And yet how tender he could be in his manner when he chose it how soft he could make his words and his looks Do you remember how he behaved to us in Switzerland Do you remember that balcony at Basle and the night we sat there when the boys were swimming down the river Yes I remember So do I So do I Alice I would give all I have in the world if I could recall that journey to Switzerland If you mean for my sake Kate I do mean for your sake It made no difference to me Whether I stayed in Westmoreland or went abroad I must have found out that my god was made of bricks and clay instead of gold But there was no need for you to be crushed in the ruins I am not crushed Kate Of course you are too proud to own it If you mean about mister Grey that would have happened just the same whether I had gone abroad or remained at home Would it dear Just the same There was nothing more than this said between them about mister Grey Even to her cousin Alice could not bring herself to talk freely on that subject She would never allow herself to think for a moment that she had been persuaded by others to treat him as she had treated him She was sure that she had acted on her own convictions of what was right and wrong and now though she had begun to feel that she had been wrong she would hardly confess as much even to herself They walked back down the hill to the Hall in silence for the greater part of the way Once or twice Kate repeated her conviction that she should never again see her brother I do not know what may happen to him she said in answer to her cousin s questions but when he was passing out of my sight into the valley I felt that I was looking at him for the last time That is simply what people call a presentiment Alice replied Exactly so and presentiments of course mean nothing said Kate Then they walked on towards the house without further speech but when they reached the end of the little path which led out of the wood on to the gravelled sweep before the front door they were both arrested by a sight that met their eyes There was a man standing with a cigar in his mouth before them swinging a little cane and looking about him up at the wood He had on his head a jaunty little straw hat and he wore a jacket with brass buttons and white trousers It was now nearly the middle of May but the summer does not come to Westmoreland so early as that and the man as he stood there looking about him seemed to be cold and almost uncomfortable He had not as yet seen the two girls who stood at the end of the walk arrested by the sight of him Who is it asked Alice in a whisper Captain Bellfield said Kate speaking with something very like dismay in her voice What aunt Greenow s Captain Yes aunt Greenow s Captain I have been fearing this and now what on earth are we to do with him Look at him That s what aunt Greenow calls a sniff of the rocks and valleys The Captain began to move just to move as though it were necessary to do something to keep the life in his limbs He had finished his cigar and looked at the end of it with manifest regret As he threw it away among a tuft of shrubs his eye fell upon the two ladies and he uttered a little exclamation Then he came forward waving his little straw hat in his hand and made his salutation Miss Vavasor I am delighted he said Miss Alice Vavasor if I am not mistaken I have been commissioned by my dear friend missus Greenow to go out and seek you but upon my word the woods looked so black that I did not dare to venture and then of course I shouldn t have found you Kate put out her left hand and then introduced her cousin to the Captain Again he waved his little straw hat and strove to bear himself as though he were at home and comfortable But he failed and it was manifest that he failed He was not the Bellfield who had conquered mister Cheesacre on the sands at Yarmouth though he wore the same jacket and waistcoat and must now have enjoyed the internal satisfaction of feeling that his future maintenance in life was assured to him But he was not at his ease His courage had sufficed to enable him to follow his quarry into Westmoreland but it did not suffice to make him comfortable while he was there Kate instantly perceived his condition and wickedly resolved that she would make no effort to assist him She went through some ceremony of introduction and then expressed her surprise at seeing him so far north Well said he I am a little surprised myself I am indeed But I had nothing to do in Norwich literally nothing and your aunt had so often talked to me of the beauties of this place and he waved his hand round at the old house and the dark trees that I thought I d take the liberty of paying you a flying visit I didn t mean to intrude in the way of sleeping I didn t indeed Miss Vavasor only missus Greenow has been so kind as to say We are so very far out of the world Captain Bellfield that we always give our visitors beds I didn t intend it I didn t indeed miss Poor Captain Bellfield was becoming very uneasy in his agitation I did just put my bag with a change of things into the gig which brought me over not knowing quite where I might go on to We won t send you any further to day at any rate said Kate missus Greenow has been very kind very kind indeed She has asked me to stay till Saturday Kate bit her lips in a momentary fit of anger The house was her house and not her aunt s But she remembered that her aunt had been kind to her at Norwich and at Yarmouth and she allowed this feeling to die away We shall be very glad to see you she said We are three women together here and I m afraid you will find us rather dull Oh dear no dull with you That would be impossible And how have you left your friend mister Cheesacre Quite well very well thank you That is to say I haven t seen him much lately He and I did have a bit of a breeze you know I can t say that I did know Captain Bellfield I thought perhaps you had heard He seemed to think that I was too particular in a certain quarter Ha ha ha ha That s only my joke you know ladies They then went into the house and the Captain straggled in after them missus Greenow was in neither of the two sitting rooms which they usually occupied She too had been driven somewhat out of the ordinary composure of her manner by the arrival of her lover even though she had expected it and had retired to her room thinking that she had better see Kate in private before they met in the presence of the Captain I suppose you have seen my aunt since you have been here said Kate Oh dear yes I saw her and she suggested that I had better walk out and find you I did find you you know though I didn t walk very far And have you seen your room Yes yes She was kind enough to show me my room Very nice indeed thank you looking out into the front and all that kind of thing The poor fellow was no doubt thinking how much better was his lot at Vavasor Hall than it had been at Oileymead I shan t stay long Miss Vavasor only just a night or so but I did want to see your aunt again and you too upon my word My aunt is the attraction Captain Bellfield We all know that He actually simpered simpered like a young girl who is half elated and half ashamed when her lover is thrown in her teeth He fidgeted with the things on the table and moved himself about uneasily from one leg to the other Perhaps he was remembering that though he had contrived to bring himself to Vavasor Hall he had not money enough left to take him back to Norwich The two girls left him and went to their rooms I will go to my aunt at once said Kate and find out what is to be done I suppose she means to marry him Oh yes she means to marry him and the sooner the better now I knew this was coming but I did so hope it would not be while you were here It makes me feel so ashamed of myself that you should see it Kate boldly knocked at her aunt s door and her aunt received her with a conscious smile I was waiting for you to come said missus Greenow Here I am aunt and what is more to the purpose there is Captain Bellfield in the drawing room Stupid man I told him to take himself away about the place till dinner time I ve half a mind to send him back to Shap at once upon my word I have Don t do that aunt it would be inhospitable But he is such an oaf I hope you understand my dear that I couldn t help it But you do mean to to marry him aunt don t you Well Kate I really think I do Why shouldn t I It s a lonely sort of life being by myself and upon my word I don t think there s very much harm in him I am not saying anything against him only in that case you can t very well turn him out of the house Could not I though I could in a minute and if you wish it you shall see if I can t do it The rocks and valleys would not allow that aunt It s all very well for you to laugh my dear If laughing would break my bones I shouldn t be as whole as I am now I might have had Cheesacre if I liked who is a substantial man and could have kept a carriage for me but it was the rocks and valleys that prevented that and perhaps a little feeling that I might do some good to a poor fellow who has nobody in the world to look after him missus Greenow as she said this put her handkerchief up to her eyes and wiped away the springing moisture Tears were always easy with her but on this occasion Kate almost respected her tears I m sure I hope you ll be happy aunt If he makes me unhappy he shall pay for it and missus Greenow having done with the tears shook her head as though upon this occasion she quite meant all that she said At dinner they were not very comfortable Either the gloomy air of the place and the neighbourhood of the black pines had depressed the Captain or else the glorious richness of the prospects before him had made him thoughtful He had laid aside the jacket with the brass buttons and had dressed himself for dinner very soberly And he behaved himself at dinner and after dinner with a wonderful sobriety being very unlike the Captain who had sat at the head of the table at missus Greenow s picnic When left to himself after dinner he barely swallowed two glasses of the old Squire s port wine before he sauntered out into the garden to join the ladies whom he had seen there and when pressed by Kate to light a cigar he positively declined On the following morning missus Greenow had recovered her composure but Captain Bellfield was still in a rather disturbed state of mind He knew that his efforts were to be crowned with success and that he was sure of his wife but he did not know how the preliminary difficulties were to be overcome and he did not know what to do with himself at the Hall After breakfast he fidgeted about in the parlour being unable to contrive for himself a mode of escape and was absolutely thrown upon his beam ends when the widow asked him what he meant to do with himself between that and dinner I suppose I d better take a walk he said and perhaps the young ladies If you mean my two nieces said missus Greenow I m afraid you ll find they are engaged But if I m not too old to walk with The Captain assured her that she was just of the proper age for a walking companion as far as his taste went and then attempted some apology for the awkwardness of his expression at which the three women laughed heartily Never mind Captain said missus Greenow We ll have our walk all the same and won t mind those young girls Come along They started not up towards the mountains as Kate always did when she walked in Westmoreland but mildly and at a gentle pace as beseemed their years along the road towards Shap The Captain politely opened the old gate for the widow and then carefully closed it again not allowing it to swing as he would have done at Yarmouth Then he tripped up to his place beside her suggested his arm which she declined and walked on for some paces in silence What on earth was he to say to her He had done his love making successfully and what was he to do next Well Captain Bellfield said she They were walking very slowly and he was cutting the weeds by the roadside with his cane He knew by her voice that something special was coming so he left the weeds and ranged himself close up alongside of her Well Captain Bellfield so I suppose I m to be good natured am I Arabella you ll make me the happiest man in the world That s all fudge She would have said all rocks and valleys only he would not have understood her Upon my word you will I hope I shall make you respectable Oh yes certainly I quite intend that It is the great thing that you should intend Of course I am going to make a fool of myself No no don t say that If I don t say it all my friends will say it for me It s lucky for you that I don t much care what people say It is lucky I know that I m lucky The very first day I saw you I thought what a happy fellow I was to meet you Then of course I was only thinking of your beauty Get along with you Upon my word yes Come Arabella as we are to be man and wife you might as well At this moment he had got very close to her and had recovered something of his usual elasticity but she would not allow him even to put his arm round her waist Out in the high road she said How can you be so impertinent and so foolish You might as well you know just once Captain Bellfield I brought you out here not for such fooling as that but in order that we might have a little chat about business If we are to be man and wife as you say we ought to understand on what footing we are to begin together I m afraid your own private means are not considerable Well no they are not missus Greenow Have you anything The Captain hesitated and poked the ground with his cane Come Captain Bellfield let us have the truth at once and then we shall understand each other The Captain still hesitated and said nothing You must have had something to live upon I suppose suggested the widow Then the Captain by degrees told his story He had a married sister by whom a guinea a week was allowed to him That was all He had been obliged to sell out of the army because he was unable to live on his pay as a lieutenant The price of his commission had gone to pay his debts and now yes it was too true now he was in debt again He owed ninety pounds to Cheesacre thirty two pounds ten to a tailor at Yarmouth over seventeen pounds at his lodgings in Norwich At the present moment he had something under thirty shillings in his pocket The tailor at Yarmouth had lent him three pounds in order that he might make his journey into Westmoreland and perhaps be enabled to pay his debts by getting a rich wife In the course of the cross examination missus Greenow got much information out of him and then when she was satisfied that she had learned not exactly all the truth but certain indications of the truth she forgave him all his offences And now you will give a fellow a kiss just one kiss said the ecstatic Captain in the height of his bliss Hush said the widow there s a carriage coming on the road close to us CHAPTER LXV The First Kiss
2053_138901_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Hush said the widow there s a carriage coming on the road close to us missus Greenow as she spoke these words drew back from the Captain s arms before the first kiss of permitted ante nuptial love had been exchanged 
2053_138901_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The scene was on the high road from Shap to Vavasor and as she was still dressed in all the sombre habiliments of early widowhood and as neither he nor his sweetheart were under forty perhaps it was as well that they were not caught toying together in so very public a place 
2053_138901_000004_000002	train-clean-360	But they were only just in time to escape the vigilant eyes of a new visitor 
2053_138901_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Round the corner of the road at a sharp trot came the Shap post horse with the Shap gig behind him the same gig which had brought Bellfield to Vavasor on the previous day and seated in the gig looming large with his eyes wide awake to everything round him was mister 
none	none	Cheesacre It was a sight terrible to the eyes of Captain Bellfield and by no means welcome to those of missus Greenow 
2053_138901_000005_000001	train-clean-360	As regarded her her annoyance had chiefly reference to her two nieces and especially to Alice How was she to account for this second lover 
none	none	Kate of course knew all about it but how could Alice be made to understand that she missus Greenow was not to blame that she had in sober truth told this ardent gentleman that there was no hope for him And even as to Kate Kate whom her aunt had absurdly chosen to regard as the object of mister Cheesacre s pursuit what sort of a welcome would she extend to the owner of Oileymead 
2053_138901_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Before the wheels had stopped missus Greenow had begun to reflect whether it might be possible that she should send mister Cheesacre back without letting him go on to the Hall but if missus Greenow was dismayed what were the feelings of the Captain 
none	none	For he was aware that Cheesacre knew that of him which he had not told How ardently did he now wish that he had sailed nearer to the truth in giving in the schedule of his debts to missus Greenow
2053_138901_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 That man s wanted by the police said Cheesacre speaking while the gig was still in motion 
2053_138901_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 He s wanted by the police missus Greenow and in his ardour he stood up in the gig and pointed at Bellfield Then the gig stopped suddenly and he fell back into his seat in his effort to prevent his falling forward 
2053_138901_000006_000002	train-clean-360	 He s wanted by the police he shouted out again as soon as he was able to recover his voice 
2053_138901_000007_000000	train-clean-360	missus Greenow turned pale beneath the widow s veil which she had dropped 
2053_138901_000007_000001	train-clean-360	What might not her Captain have done 
none	none	He might have procured things to be sent to him out of shops on false pretences or urged on by want and famine he might have committed forgery
2053_138901_000007_000003	train-clean-360	 Oh my she said and dropped her hand from his arm which she had taken 
2053_138901_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 It s false said Bellfield 
2053_138901_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 It s true said Cheesacre 
2053_138901_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll indict you for slander my friend said Bellfield 
2053_138901_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Pay me the money you owe me said Cheesacre 
2053_138901_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 You re a swindler 
2053_138901_000012_000000	train-clean-360	missus Greenow cared little as to her lover being a swindler in mister Cheesacre s estimation 
2053_138901_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Such accusations from him she had heard before 
2053_138901_000012_000002	train-clean-360	But she did care very much as to this mission of the police against her Captain 
2053_138901_000012_000003	train-clean-360	If that were true the Captain could be her Captain no longer 
2053_138901_000012_000004	train-clean-360	 What is this I hear Captain Bellfield she said 
2053_138901_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a lie and a slander 
none	none	He merely wants to make a quarrel between us 
2053_138901_000013_000002	train-clean-360	What police are after me mister Cheesacre 
2053_138901_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 It s the police or the sheriff s officer or something of the kind said Cheesacre 
none	none	Oh the sheriff s officers exclaimed missus Greenow in a tone of voice which showed how great had been her relief mister Cheesacre you shouldn t come and say such things you shouldn t indeed 
2053_138901_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Sheriff s officers can be paid and there s an end of them 
2053_138901_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll indict him for the libel I will as sure as I m alive said Bellfield 
2053_138901_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense said the widow 
2053_138901_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t you make a fool of yourself 
2053_138901_000017_000002	train-clean-360	When men can t pay their way they must put up with having things like that said of them 
2053_138901_000017_000003	train-clean-360	mister Cheesacre where were you going 
2053_138901_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I was going to Vavasor Hall on purpose to caution you 
2053_138901_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 It s too late said missus Greenow sinking behind her veil 
2053_138901_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Why you haven t been and married him since yesterday 
none	none	He only had twenty four hours start of me I know Or perhaps you had it done clandestine in Norwich Oh missus Greenow He got out of the gig and the three walked back towards the Hall together while the boy drove on with mister Cheesacre s carpetbag I hardly know said missus Greenow whether we can welcome you There are other visitors and the house is full
2053_138901_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I m not one to intrude where I m not wanted 
2053_138901_000022_000001	train-clean-360	You may be sure of that 
none	none	If I can t get my supper for love I can get at for money That s more than some people can say I wonder when you re going to pay me what you owe me Lieutenant Bellfield Illustration I wonder when you re going to pay me what you owe me Lieutenant Bellfield 
2053_138901_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Nevertheless the widow had contrived to reconcile the two men before she reached the Hall 
2053_138901_000024_000001	train-clean-360	They had actually shaken hands and the lamb Cheesacre had agreed to lie down with the wolf Bellfield 
2053_138901_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Cheesacre moreover had contrived to whisper into the widow s ears the true extent of his errand into Westmoreland 
2053_138901_000024_000003	train-clean-360	This however he did not do altogether in Bellfield s hearing 
none	none	When missus Greenow ascertained that there was something to be said she made no scruple in sending her betrothed away from her You won t throw a fellow over will you now whispered Bellfield into her ear as he went 
2053_138901_000024_000005	train-clean-360	She merely frowned at him and bade him begone so that the walk which missus Greenow began with one lover she ended in company with the other 
2053_138901_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Bellfield who was sent on to the house found Alice and Kate surveying the newly arrived carpet bag 
none	none	He knows un said the boy who had driven the gig pointing to the Captain
2053_138901_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 It belongs to your old friend mister Cheesacre said Bellfield to Kate 
none	none	And has he come too said Kate The Captain shrugged his shoulders and admitted that it was hard And it s not the slightest use said he not the least in the world 
2053_138901_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He never had a chance in that quarter 
2053_138901_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Not enough of the rocks and valleys about him was there Captain Bellfield said Kate 
none	none	But Captain Bellfield understood nothing about the rocks and valleys though he was regarded by certain eyes as being both a rock and a valley himself 
2053_138901_000030_000000	train-clean-360	In the meantime Cheesacre was telling his story 
2053_138901_000030_000001	train-clean-360	He first asked in a melancholy tone whether it was really necessary that he must abandon all his hopes 
2053_138901_000030_000002	train-clean-360	 He wasn t going to say anything against the Captain he said if things were really fixed 
2053_138901_000030_000003	train-clean-360	He never begrudged any man his chance 
2053_138901_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Things are really fixed said missus Greenow 
2053_138901_000032_000000	train-clean-360	He could however not keep himself from hinting that Oileymead was a substantial home and that Bellfield had not as much as a straw mattress to lie upon 
2053_138901_000032_000001	train-clean-360	In answer to this missus Greenow told him that there was so much more reason why some one should provide the poor man with a mattress 
2053_138901_000032_000002	train-clean-360	 If you look at it in that light of course it s true said Cheesacre 
2053_138901_000032_000003	train-clean-360	missus Greenow told him that she did look at it in that light 
none	none	Then I ve done about that said Cheesacre and as to the little bit of money he owes me I must give him his time about it I suppose missus Greenow assured him that it should be paid as soon as possible after the nuptial benediction had been said over them She offered indeed to pay it at once if he was in distress for it but he answered contemptuously that he never was in distress for money 
2053_138901_000032_000006	train-clean-360	He liked to have his own that was all 
none	none	After this he did not get away to his next subject quite so easily as he wished and it must be admitted that there was a difficulty As he could not have missus Greenow he would be content to put up with Kate for his wife 
2053_138901_000033_000001	train-clean-360	That was his next subject 
2053_138901_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Rumours as to the old Squire s will had no doubt reached him and he was now willing to take advantage of that assistance which missus Greenow had before offered him in this matter 
2053_138901_000033_000003	train-clean-360	The time had come in which he ought to marry of that he was aware 
2053_138901_000033_000004	train-clean-360	He had told many of his friends in Norfolk that Kate Vavasor had thrown herself at his head and very probably he had thought it true 
none	none	In answer to all his love speeches to herself the aunt had always told him what an excellent wife her niece would make him So now he had come to Westmoreland with this second string to his bow
2053_138901_000033_000007	train-clean-360	 You know you put it into my head your own self pleaded mister Cheesacre 
none	none	Didn t you now
2053_138901_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 But things are so different since that said the widow 
2053_138901_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 How different 
2053_138901_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I ain t different 
none	none	There s Oileymead just where it always was and the owner of it don t owe a shilling to any man 
2053_138901_000035_000003	train-clean-360	How are things different 
2053_138901_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 My niece has inherited property 
2053_138901_000037_000003	train-clean-360	inherited property 
2053_138901_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 And is that to make a change 
none	none	Oh 
2053_138901_000037_000002	train-clean-360	missus Greenow who would have thought to find you mercenary like that 
none	none	Inherited property 
2053_138901_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Is she going to fling a man over because of that 
none	none	missus Greenow endeavoured to explain to him that her niece could hardly be said to have flung him over and at last pretended to become angry when he attempted to assert his position
2053_138901_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 Why mister Cheesacre I am quite sure she never gave you a word of encouragement in her life 
2053_138901_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 But you always told me I might have her for the asking 
2053_138901_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 And now I tell you that you mayn t 
2053_138901_000040_000001	train-clean-360	It s of no use your going on there to ask her for she will only send you away with an answer you won t like 
2053_138901_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Look here mister Cheesacre you want to get married and it s quite time you should 
2053_138901_000040_000003	train-clean-360	There s my dear friend Charlie Fairstairs 
2053_138901_000040_000004	train-clean-360	How could you get a better wife than Charlie 
none	none	Charlie Fairstairs said Cheesacre turning up his nose in disgust She hasn t got a penny nor any one belonging to her 
2053_138901_000041_000001	train-clean-360	The man who marries her will have to find the money for the smock she stands up in 
2053_138901_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Who s mercenary now mister Cheesacre 
2053_138901_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Do you go home and think of it and if you ll marry Charlie I ll go to your wedding 
2053_138901_000042_000002	train-clean-360	You shan t be ashamed of her clothing 
2053_138901_000042_000003	train-clean-360	I ll see to that 
2053_138901_000043_000000	train-clean-360	They were now close to the gate and Cheesacre paused before he entered 
none	none	Do you think there s no chance at all for me then said he
2053_138901_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I know there s none 
2053_138901_000044_000001	train-clean-360	I ve heard her speak about it 
2053_138901_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Somebody else perhaps is the happy man 
2053_138901_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t say anything about that but I know that she wouldn t take you 
2053_138901_000046_000001	train-clean-360	I like farming you know but she doesn t 
2053_138901_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I might give that up said Cheesacre readily at any rate for a time 
none	none	No no no it would do no good Believe me my friend that it is of no use 
2053_138901_000049_000000	train-clean-360	He still paused at the gate 
none	none	I don t see what s the use of my going in said he 
2053_138901_000049_000002	train-clean-360	To this she made him no answer 
2053_138901_000049_000003	train-clean-360	 There s a pride about me he continued that I don t choose to go where I m not wanted 
2053_138901_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t tell you mister Cheesacre that you are wanted in that light certainly 
2053_138901_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I ll go 
2053_138901_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps you ll be so good as to tell the boy with the gig to come after me 
none	none	That s six pound ten it will have cost me to come here and go back 
2053_138901_000051_000003	train-clean-360	Bellfield did it cheaper of course he travelled second class 
2053_138901_000051_000004	train-clean-360	I heard of him as I came along 
2053_138901_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 The expense does not matter to you mister Cheesacre 
none	none	To this he assented and then took his leave at first offering his hand to missus Greenow with an air of offended dignity but falling back almost into humility during the performance of his adieu Before he was gone he had invited her to bring the Captain to Oileymead when she was married and had begged her to tell Miss Vavasor how happy he should be to receive her And mister Cheesacre said the widow as he walked back along the road don t forget dear Charlie Fairstairs They were all standing at the front door of the house when missus Greenow re appeared Alice Kate Captain Bellfield the Shap boy and the Shap horse and gig
2053_138901_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 Where is he Kate asked in a low voice and everyone there felt how important was the question 
2053_138901_000054_000002	train-clean-360	 He has gone said the widow 
none	none	Bellfield was so relieved that he could not restrain his joy but took off his little straw hat and threw it up into the air 
2053_138901_000054_000004	train-clean-360	Kate s satisfaction was almost as intense 
none	none	I am so glad said she
2053_138901_000054_000006	train-clean-360	 What on earth should we have done with him 
none	none	I never was so disappointed in my life said Alice
2053_138901_000054_000008	train-clean-360	 I have heard so much of mister Cheesacre but have never seen him Kate suggested that she should get into the gig and drive after him 
2053_138901_000054_000009	train-clean-360	 He ain t a been and took hisself off suggested the boy whose face became very dismal as the terrible idea struck him 
2053_138901_000054_000010	train-clean-360	But with juvenile craft he put his hand on the carpet bag and finding that it did not contain stones was comforted 
2053_138901_000054_000011	train-clean-360	 You drive after him young gentleman and you ll find him on the road to Shap said missus Greenow 
none	none	Mind you give him my love said the Captain in his glee and say I hope he ll get his turnips in well This little episode went far to break the day and did more than anything else could have done to put Captain Bellfield at his ease It created a little joint stock fund of merriment between the whole party which was very much needed 
2053_138901_000055_000001	train-clean-360	The absence of such joint stock fund is always felt when a small party is thrown together without such assistance 
none	none	Some bond is necessary on these occasions and no other bond is so easy or so pleasant Now when the Captain found himself alone for a quarter of an hour with Alice he had plenty of subjects for small talk Yes indeed 
2053_138901_000055_000005	train-clean-360	Old Cheesacre in spite of his absurdities is not a bad sort of fellow at bottom awfully fond of his money you know Miss Vavasor and always boasting about it That s not pleasant said Alice 
2053_138901_000055_000006	train-clean-360	 No the most unpleasant thing in the world 
2053_138901_000055_000007	train-clean-360	There s nothing I hate so much Miss Vavasor as that kind of talking 
2053_138901_000055_000008	train-clean-360	My idea is this when a man has lots of money let him make the best use he can of it and say nothing about it 
2053_138901_000055_000009	train-clean-360	Nobody ever heard me talking about my money He knew that Alice knew that he was a pauper but nevertheless he had the satisfaction of speaking of himself as though he were not a pauper 
2053_138901_000056_000000	train-clean-360	In this way the afternoon went very pleasantly 
none	none	For an hour before dinner Captain Bellfield was had into the drawing room and was talked to by his widow on matters of business but he had of course known that this was necessary She scolded him soundly about those sheriff s officers 
2053_138901_000056_000003	train-clean-360	Why had he not told her 
none	none	As long as there s anything kept back I won t have you said she I won t become your wife till I m quite sure there s not a penny owing that is not shown in the list Then I think he did tell her all or nearly all When all was counted it was not so very much Three or four hundred pounds would make him a new man and what was such a sum as that to his wealthy widow Indeed for a woman wanting a husband of that sort Captain Bellfield was a safer venture than would be a man of a higher standing among his creditors It is true Bellfield might have been a forger or a thief or a returned convict but then his debts could not be large Let him have done his best he could not have obtained credit for a thousand pounds whereas no one could tell the liabilities of a gentleman of high standing 
2053_138901_000056_000011	train-clean-360	Burgo Fitzgerald was a gentleman of high standing and his creditors would have swallowed up every shilling that missus Greenow possessed but with Captain Bellfield she was comparatively safe 
2053_138901_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Upon the whole I think that she was lucky in her choice or perhaps I might more truly say that she had chosen with prudence 
2053_138901_000057_000001	train-clean-360	He was no forger or thief in the ordinary sense of the word nor was he a returned convict 
none	none	He was simply an idle scamp who had hung about the world for forty years doing nothing without principle shameless accustomed to eat dirty puddings and to be kicked morally kicked by such men as Cheesacre But he was moderate in his greediness and possessed of a certain appreciation of the comfort of a daily dinner which might possibly suffice to keep him from straying very wide as long as his intended wife should be able to keep the purse strings altogether in her own hands 
2053_138901_000057_000004	train-clean-360	Therefore I say that missus Greenow had been lucky in her choice and not altogether without prudence 
2053_138901_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I think of taking this house said she and of living here 
2053_138901_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 What in Westmoreland said the Captain with something of dismay in his tone 
2053_138901_000059_000001	train-clean-360	What on earth would he do with himself all his life in that gloomy place 
2053_138901_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes in Westmoreland 
none	none	Why not in Westmoreland as well as anywhere else If you don t like Westmoreland it s not too late yet you know In answer to this the poor Captain was obliged to declare that he had no objection whatever to Westmoreland
2053_138901_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve been talking to my niece about it continued missus Greenow and I find that such an arrangement can be made very conveniently 
2053_138901_000061_000001	train-clean-360	The property is left between her and her uncle the father of my other niece and neither of them want to live here 
2053_138901_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 But won t you be rather dull my dear 
2053_138901_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 We could go to Yarmouth you know in the autumn Then the Captain s visage became somewhat bright again 
2053_138901_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 And perhaps if you are not extravagant we could manage a month or so in London during the winter just to see the plays and do a little shopping Then the Captain s face became very bright 
none	none	That will be delightful said he
2053_138901_000063_000003	train-clean-360	 And as for being dull said the widow when people grow old they must be dull 
2053_138901_000063_000004	train-clean-360	Dancing can t go on for ever In answer to this the widow s Captain assured the widow that she was not at all old and now on this occasion that ceremony came off successfully which had been interrupted on the Shap road by the noise of mister Cheesacre s wheels 
none	none	There goes my cap said she

none	none	It don t sound badly he said to himself as he travelled away on his first journey to Penrith CHAPTER LXVI Lady Monk s Plan On the night of Lady Monk s party Burgo Fitzgerald disappeared and when the guests were gone and the rooms were empty his aunt inquired for him in vain The old butler and factotum of the house who was employed by Sir Cosmo to put out the lamps and to see that he was not robbed beyond a certain point on these occasions of his wife s triumphs was interrogated by his mistress and said that he thought mister Burgo had left the house Lady Monk herself knocked at her nephew s door when she went up stairs ascending an additional flight of stairs with her weary old limbs in order that she might do so she even opened the door and saw the careless debris of his toilet about the room But he was gone Perhaps after all he has arranged it she said to herself as she went down to her own room But Burgo as we know had not arranged it It may be remembered that when mister Palliser came back to his wife in the supper room at Lady Monk s bringing with him the scarf which Lady Glencora had left up stairs Burgo was no longer with her He had become well aware that he had no chance left at any rate for that night The poor fool acting upon his aunt s implied advice rather than his own hopes had secured a post chaise and stationed it in Bruton Street some five minutes walk from his aunt s house And he had purchased feminine wrappings cloaks c things that he thought might be necessary for his companion He had too ordered rooms at the new hotel near the Dover Station the London Bridge Station from whence was to start on the following morning a train to catch the tidal boat for Boulogne There was a dressing bag there for which he had paid twenty five guineas out of his aunt s money not having been able to induce the tradesman to grant it to him on credit and there were other things slippers collars stockings handkerchiefs and what else might as he thought under such circumstances be most necessary Poor thoughtful thoughtless fool The butler was right He did leave the house He saw Lady Glencora taken to her carriage from some back hiding place in the hall and then slipped out unmindful of his shining boots and dress coat and jewelled studs He took a Gibus hat his own or that of some other unfortunate and slowly made his way down to the place in Bruton Street There was the carriage and pair of horses all in readiness and the driver when he had placed himself by the door of the vehicle was not long in emerging from the neighbouring public house All ready your honour said the man I shan t want you to night said Burgo hoarsely go away And about the things your honour Take them to the devil No stop Take them back with you and ask somebody to keep them till I send for them I shall want them and another carriage in a day or two Then he gave the man half a sovereign and went away not looking at the little treasures which he had spent so much of his money in selecting for his love When he was gone the waterman and the driver turned them over with careful hands and gloating eyes It s a eiress I ll go bail said the waterman Pretty dear I suppose her parints was too many for her said the driver But neither of them imagined the enormity which the hirer of the chaise had in truth contemplated Burgo from thence took his way back into Grosvenor Square and from thence down Park Street and through a narrow passage and a mews which there are in those parts into Park Lane He had now passed the position of mister Palliser s house having come out on Park Lane at a spot nearer to Piccadilly but he retraced his steps walking along by the rails of the Park till he found himself opposite to the house Then he stood there leaning back upon the railings and looking up at Lady Glencora s windows What did he expect to see Or was he in truth moved by love of that kind which can take joy in watching the slightest shadow that is made by the one loved object that may be made by her or by some violent conjecture of the mind may be supposed to have been so made Such love as that is I think always innocent Burgo Fitzgerald did not love like that I almost doubt whether he can be said to have loved at all There was in his breast a mixed feverish desire which he took no trouble to analyse He wanted money He wanted the thing of which this Palliser had robbed him He wanted revenge though his desire for that was not a burning desire And among other things he wanted the woman s beauty of the woman whom he coveted He wanted to kiss her again as he had once kissed her and to feel that she was soft and lovely and loving for him But as for seeing her shadow unless its movement indicated some purpose in his favour I do not think that he cared much about that And why then was he there Because in his unreasoning folly he did not know what step to take or what step not to take There are men whose energies hardly ever carry them beyond looking for the thing they want She might see him from the window and come to him I do not say that he thought that it would be so I fancy that he never thought at all about that or about anything If you lie under a tree and open your mouth a plum may fall into it It was probably an undefined idea of some such chance as this which brought him against the railings in the front of mister Palliser s house that and a feeling made up partly of despair and partly of lingering romance that he was better there out in the night air under the gas lamps than he could be elsewhere There he stood and looked and cursed his ill luck But his curses had none of the bitterness of those which George Vavasor was always uttering Through it all there remained about Burgo one honest feeling one conviction that was true a feeling that it all served him right and that he had better perhaps go to the devil at once and give nobody any more trouble If he loved no one sincerely neither did he hate any one and whenever he made any self inquiry into his own circumstances he always told himself that it was all his own fault When he cursed his fate he only did so because cursing is so easy George Vavasor would have ground his victims up to powder if he knew how but Burgo Fitzgerald desired to hurt no one There he stood till he was cold and then as the plum did not drop into his mouth he moved on He went up into Oxford Street and walked along it the whole distance to the corner of Bond Street passing by Grosvenor Square to which he intended to return At the corner of Bond Street a girl took hold of him and looked up into his face Ah she said I saw you once before Then you saw the most miserable devil alive said Burgo You can t be miserable said the girl What makes you miserable You ve plenty of money I wish I had said Burgo And plenty to eat and drink exclaimed the girl and you are so handsome I remember you You gave me supper one night when I was starving I ain t hungry now Will you give me a kiss I ll give you a shilling and that s better said Burgo But give me a kiss too said the girl He gave her first the kiss and then the shilling and after that he left her and passed on I m d d if I wouldn t change with her he said to himself I wonder whether anything really ails him thought the girl He said he was wretched before Shouldn t I like to be good to such a one as him Burgo went on and made his way into the house in Grosvenor Square by some means probably unknown to his aunt and certainly unknown to his uncle He emptied his pockets as he got into bed and counted a roll of notes which he had kept in one of them There were still a hundred and thirty pounds left Lady Glencora had promised that she would see him again She had said as much as that quite distinctly But what use would there be in that if all his money should then be gone He knew that the keeping of money in his pocket was to him quite an impossibility Then he thought of his aunt What should he say to his aunt if he saw her in the course of the coming day Might it not be as well for him to avoid his aunt altogether He breakfasted up stairs in his bedroom in the bed indeed eating a small pate de foie gras from the supper table as he read a French novel There he was still reading his French novel in bed when his aunt s maid came to him saying that his aunt wished to see him before she went out Tell me Lucy said he how is the old girl She s as cross as cross mister Burgo Indeed I shan t not a minute longer Don t now will you I tell you she s waiting for me From which it may be seen that Lucy shared the general feminine feeling in favour of poor Burgo Thus summoned Burgo applied himself to his toilet but as he did so he recruited his energies from time to time by a few pages of the French novel and also by small doses from a bottle of curacoa which he had in his bedroom He was utterly a pauper There was no pauper poorer than he in London that day But nevertheless he breakfasted on pate de foie gras and curacoa and regarded those dainties very much as other men regard bread and cheese and beer But though he was dressing at the summons of his aunt he had by no means made up his mind that he would go to her Why should he go to her What good would it do him She would not give him more money She would only scold him for his misconduct She might perhaps turn him out of the house if he did not obey her or attempt to do so but she would be much more likely to do this when he had made her angry by contradicting her In neither case would he leave the house even though its further use were positively forbidden him because his remaining there was convenient but as he could gain nothing by seeing the old girl as he had called her he resolved to escape to his club without attending to her summons But his aunt who was a better general than he out manoeuvred him He crept down the back stairs but as he could not quite condescend to escape through the area he was forced to emerge upon the hall and here his aunt pounced upon him coming out of the breakfast parlour Did not Lucy tell you that I wanted to see you Lady Monk asked with severity in her voice Burgo replied with perfect ease that he was going out just to have his hair washed and brushed He would have been back in twenty minutes There was no energy about the poor fellow unless perhaps when he was hunting but he possessed a readiness which enabled him to lie at a moment s notice with the most perfect ease Lady Monk did not believe him but she could not confute him and therefore she let the lie pass Never mind your hair now she said I want to speak to you Come in here for a few minutes As there was no way of escape left to him he followed his aunt into the breakfast parlour Burgo she said when she had seated herself and had made him sit in a chair opposite to her I don t think you will ever do any good I don t much think I shall aunt What do you mean then to do with yourself Oh I don t know I haven t thought much about it You can t stay here in this house Sir Cosmo was speaking to me about you only yesterday morning I shall be quite willing to go down to Monkshade if Sir Cosmo likes it better that is when the season is a little more through He won t have you at Monkshade He won t let you go there again And he won t have you here You know that you are turning what I say into joke No indeed aunt Yes you are you know you are You are the most ungrateful heartless creature I ever met You must make up your mind to leave this house at once Where does Sir Cosmo mean that I should go then To the workhouse if you like He doesn t care I don t suppose he does the least in the world said Burgo opening his eyes and stretching his nostrils and looking into his aunt s face as though he had great ground for indignation But the turning of Burgo out of the house was not Lady Monk s immediate purpose She knew that he would hang on there till the season was over After that he must not be allowed to return again unless he should have succeeded in a certain enterprise She had now caught him in order that she might learn whether there was any possible remaining chance of success as to that enterprise So she received his indignation in silence and began upon another subject What a fool you made of yourself last night Burgo Did I more of a fool than usual I believe that you will never be serious about anything Why did you go on waltzing in that way when every pair of eyes in the room was watching you I couldn t help going on if she liked it Oh yes say it was her fault That s so like a man Look here aunt I m not going to sit here and be abused I couldn t take her in my arms and fly away with her out of a crowd Who wants you to fly away with her For the matter of that I suppose that you do No I don t Well then I do You you haven t spirit to do that or anything else You are like a child that is just able to amuse itself for the moment and never can think of anything further You simply disgraced yourself last night and me too and her but of course you care nothing about that I had a plan all ready only he came back Of course he came back Of course he came back when they sent him word how you and she were going on And now he will have forgiven her and after that of course the thing will be all over I tell you what aunt she would go if she knew how When I was forced to leave her last night she promised to see me again And as for being idle and not doing anything why I was out in Park Lane last night after you were in bed What good did that do It didn t do any good as it happened But a fellow can only try I believe after all it would be easier down in the country especially now that he has taken it into his head to look after her Lady Monk sat silent for a few moments and then she said in a low voice What did she say to you when you were parting What were her exact words She at any rate was not deficient in energy She was anxious enough to see her purpose accomplished She would have conducted the matter with discretion if the running away with mister Palliser s wife could in very fact have been done by herself She said she would see me again She promised it twice And was that all What could she say more when she was forced to go away Had she said that she would go with you I had asked her half a dozen times and she did not once refuse I know she means it if she knew how to get away She hates him I m sure of it A woman you know wouldn t absolutely say that she would go till she was gone If she really meant it she would tell you I don t think she could have told me plainer She said she would see me again She said that twice over Again Lady Monk sat silent She had a plan in her head a plan that might as she thought give to her nephew one more chance But she hesitated before she could bring herself to explain it in detail At first she had lent a little aid to this desired abduction of mister Palliser s wife but in lending it had said no word upon the subject During the last season she had succeeded in getting Lady Glencora to her house in London and had taken care that Burgo should meet her there Then a hint or two had been spoken and Lady Glencora had been asked to Monkshade Lady Glencora as we know did not go to Monkshade and Lady Monk had then been baffled But she did not therefore give up the game Having now thought of it so much she began to speak of it more boldly and had procured money for her nephew that he might thereby be enabled to carry off the woman But though this had been well understood between them though words had been spoken which were sufficiently explicit the plan had not been openly discussed Lady Monk had known nothing of the mode in which Lady Glencora was to have been carried off after her party nor whither she was to have been taken But now now she must arrange it herself and have a scheme of her own or else the thing must fail absolutely Even she was almost reluctant to speak out plainly to her nephew on such a subject What if he should be false to her and tell of her But when a woman has made such schemes nothing distresses her so sadly as their failure She would risk all rather than that mister Palliser should keep his wife I will try and help you she said at last speaking hoarsely almost in a whisper if you have courage to make an attempt yourself Courage said he What is it you think I am afraid of mister Palliser I d fight him or all the Pallisers one after another if it would do any good Fighting There s no fighting wanted as you know well enough Men don t fight nowadays Look here If you can get her to call here some day say on Thursday at three o clock I will be here to receive her and instead of going back into her carriage you can have a cab for her somewhere near She can come as it were to make a morning call A cab Yes a cab won t kill her and it is less easily followed than a carriage And where shall we go There is a train to Southampton at four and the boat sails for Jersey at half past six you will be in Jersey the next morning and there is a boat goes on to saint Malo almost at once You can go direct from one boat to the other that is if she has strength and courage After that who will say that Lady Monk was not a devoted aunt That would do excellently well said the enraptured Burgo She will have difficulty in getting away from me out of the house Of course I shall say nothing about it and shall know nothing about it She had better tell her coachman to drive somewhere to pick some one up and to return out somewhere to Tyburnia or down to Pimlico Then she can leave me and go out on foot to where you have the cab She can tell the hall porter that she will walk to her carriage Do you understand Burgo declared that he did understand You must call on her and make your way in and see her and arrange all this It must be a Thursday because of the boats Then she made inquiry about his money and took from him the notes which he had promising to return them with something added on the Thursday morning but he asked with a little whine for a five pound note and got it Burgo then told her about the travelling bags and the stockings and they were quite pleasant and confidential Bid her come in a stout travelling dress said Lady Monk She can wear some lace or something over it so that the servants won t observe it I will take no notice of it Was there ever such an aunt After this Burgo left his aunt and went away to his club in a state of most happy excitement CHAPTER LXVII The Last Kiss Alice on her return from Westmoreland went direct to Park Lane whither Lady Glencora and mister Palliser had also returned before her She was to remain with them in London one entire day and on the morning after that they were to start for Paris She found mister Palliser in close attendance upon his wife Not that there was anything in his manner which at all implied that he was keeping watch over her or that he was more with her or closer to her than a loving husband might wish to be with a young wife but the mode of life was very different from that which Alice had seen at Matching Priory On her arrival mister Palliser himself received her in the hall and took her up to his wife before she had taken off her travelling hat We are so much obliged to you Miss Vavasor he said I feel it quite as deeply as Glencora Oh no she said it is I that am under obligation to you for taking me He merely smiled and shook his head and then took her up stairs On the stairs he said one other word to her You must forgive me if I was cross to you that night she went out among the ruins Alice muttered something some little fib of courtesy as to the matter having been forgotten or never borne in mind and then they went on to Lady Glencora s room It seemed to Alice that he was not so big or so much to be dreaded as when she had seen him at Matching His descent from an expectant or more than an expectant Chancellor of the Exchequer down to a simple attentive husband seemed to affect his gait his voice and all his demeanour When he received Alice at the Priory he certainly loomed before her as something great whereas now his greatness seemed to have fallen from him We must own that this was hard upon him seeing that the deed by which he had divested himself of his greatness had been so pure and good Dear Alice this is so good of you I am all in the midst of packing and Plantagenet is helping me Plantagenet winced a little under this as the hero of old must have winced when he was found with the distaff mister Palliser had relinquished his sword of state for the distaff which he had assumed and could take no glory in the change There was too in his wife s voice the slightest hint of mockery which slight as it was he perhaps thought she might have spared You have nothing left to pack continued Glencora and I don t know what you can do to amuse yourself I will help you said Alice But we have so very nearly done I think we shall have to pull all the things out and put them up again or we shall never get through to morrow We couldn t start to morrow could we Plantagenet Not very well as your rooms are ordered in Paris for the next day As if we couldn t find rooms at every inn on the road Men are so particular Now in travelling I should like never to order rooms never to know where I was going or when I was going and to carry everything I wanted in a market basket Alice who by this time had followed her friend along the passage to her bedroom and had seen how widely the packages were spread about bethought herself that the market basket should be a large one And I would never travel among Christians Christians are so slow and they wear chimney pot hats everywhere The further one goes from London among Christians the more they wear chimney pot hats I want Plantagenet to take us to see the Kurds but he won t I don t think that would be fair to Miss Vavasor said mister Palliser who had followed them Don t put the blame on her head said Lady Glencora Women have always pluck for anything Wouldn t you like to see a live Kurd Alice I don t exactly know where they live said Alice Nor I I have not the remotest idea of the way to the Kurds You see my joke don t you though Plantagenet doesn t But one knows that they are Eastern and the East is such a grand idea I think we ll content ourselves with Rome or perhaps Naples on this occasion said mister Palliser The notion of Lady Glencora packing anything for herself was as good a joke as that other one of the Kurds and whey But she went flitting about from room to room declaring that this thing must be taken and that other till the market basket would have become very large indeed Alice was astonished at the extent of the preparations and the sort of equipage with which they were about to travel Lady Glencora was taking her own carriage Not that I shall ever use it she said to Alice but he insists upon it to show that I am not supposed to be taken away in disgrace He is so good isn t he Very good said Alice I know no one better And so dull said Lady Glencora But I fancy that all husbands are dull from the nature of their position If I were a young woman s husband I shouldn t know what to say to her that wasn t dull Two women and two men servants were to be taken Alice had received permission to bring her own maid or a dozen if you want them Lady Glencora had said mister Palliser in his present mood would think nothing too much to do for you If you were to ask him to go among the Kurds he d go at once or on to Crim Tartary if you made a point of it But as both Lady Glencora s servants spoke French and as her own did not Alice trusted herself in that respect to her cousin You shall have one all to yourself said Lady Glencora I only take two for the same reason that I take the carriage just as you let a child go out in her best frock for a treat after you ve scolded her When Alice asked why it was supposed that mister Palliser was so specially devoted to her the thing was explained to her You see my dear I have told him everything I always do tell everything Nobody can say I am not candid He knows about your not letting me come to your house in the old days Oh Alice you were wrong then I shall always say that But it s done and gone and things that are done and gone shall be done and gone for me And I told him all that you said about you know what I have had nothing else to do but make confessions for the last ten days and when a woman once begins the more she confesses the better And I told him that you refused Jeffrey You didn t I did indeed and he likes you the better for that I think he d let Jeffrey marry you now if you both wished it and then oh dear supposing that you had a son and that we adopted it Cora if you go on in that way I will not remain with you But you must my dear You can t escape now At any rate you can t when we once get to Paris Oh dear you shouldn t grudge me my little naughtinesses I have been so proper for the last ten days Do you know I got into a way of driving Dandy and Flirt at the rate of six miles an hour till I m sure the poor beasts thought they were always going to a funeral Poor Dandy and poor Flirt I shan t see them now for another year On the following morning they breakfasted early because mister Palliser had got into an early habit He had said that early hours would be good for them But he never tells me why said Lady Glencora I think it is pleasant when people are travelling said Alice It isn t that her cousin answered but we are all to be such particularly good children It s hardly fair because he went to sleep last night after dinner while you and I kept ourselves awake but we needn t do that another night to be sure After breakfast they all three went to work to do nothing It was ludicrous and almost painful to see mister Palliser wandering about and counting the boxes as though he could do any good by that At this special crisis of his life he hated his papers and figures and statistics and could not apply himself to them He whose application had been so unremitting could apply himself now to nothing His world had been brought to an abrupt end and he was awkward at making a new beginning I believe that they all three were reading novels before one o clock Lady Glencora and Alice had determined that they would not leave the house throughout the day Nothing has been said about it but I regard it as part of the bond that I m not to go out anywhere Who knows but what I might be found in Gloucester Square There was however no absolute necessity that mister Palliser should remain with them and at about three he prepared himself for a solitary walk He would not go down to the House All interest in the House was over with him for the present He had the Speaker s leave to absent himself for the season Nor would he call on anyone All his friends knew or believed they knew that he had left town His death and burial had been already chronicled and were he now to reappear he could reappear only as a ghost He was being talked of as the departed one or rather such talk on all sides had now come nearly to an end The poor Duke of saint Bungay still thought of him with regret when more than ordinarily annoyed by some special grievance coming to him from mister Finespun but even the Duke had become almost reconciled to the present order of things mister Palliser knew better than to disturb all this by showing himself again in public and prepared himself therefore to take another walk under the elms in Kensington Gardens He had his hat on his head in the hall and was in the act of putting on his gloves when there came a knock at the front door The hall porter was there a stout plethoric personage not given to many words who was at this moment standing with his master s umbrella in his hand looking as though he would fain be of some use to somebody if any such utility were compatible with the purposes of his existence Now had come this knock at the door while the umbrella was still in his hand and the nature of his visage changed and it was easy to see that he was oppressed by the temporary multiplicity of his duties Give me the umbrella John said mister Palliser John gave up the umbrella and opening the door disclosed Burgo Fitzgerald standing upon the door step Is Lady Glencora at home asked Burgo before he had seen the husband John turned a dismayed face upon his master as though he knew that the comer ought not to be making a morning call at that house as no doubt he did know very well and made no instant reply I am not sure said mister Palliser making his way out as he had originally purposed The servant will find out for you Then he went on his way across Park Lane and into the Park never once turning back his face to see whether Burgo had effected an entrance into the house Nor did he return a minute earlier than he would otherwise have done After all there was something chivalrous about the man Yes Lady Glencora was at home said the porter not stirring to make any further inquiry It was no business of his if mister Palliser chose to receive such a guest He had not been desired to say that her ladyship was not at home Burgo was therefore admitted and shown direct up into the room in which Lady Glencora was sitting As chance would have it she was alone Alice had left her and was in her own chamber and Lady Glencora was sitting at the window of the small room up stairs that overlooked the Park She was seated on a footstool with her face between her hands when Burgo was admitted thinking of him and of what the world might have been to her had they left her alone as she was in the habit of saying to Alice and to herself She rose quickly so that he saw her only as she was rising Ask Miss Vavasor to come to me she said as the servant left the room and then she came forward to greet her lover Cora he said dashing at once into his subject hopelessly but still with a resolve to do as he had said that he would do Cora I have come to you to ask you to go with me I will not go with you said she Do not answer me in that way without a moment s thought Everything is arranged Yes everything is arranged she said mister Fitzgerald let me ask you to leave me alone and to behave to me with generosity Everything is arranged You can see that my boxes are all prepared for going mister Palliser and I and my friend are starting to morrow Wish me God speed and go and be generous And is this to be the end of everything He was standing close to her but hitherto he had only touched her hand at greeting her Give me your hand Cora he said No I will never give you my hand again You should be generous to me and go This is to be the end of everything of everything that is common to you and to me Go when I ask you Cora did you ever love me Yes I did love you But we were separated and there was no room for love left between us You are as dear to me now dearer than ever you were Do not look at me like that Did you not tell me when we last parted that I might come to you again Are we children that others should come between us and separate us like that Yes Burgo we are children Here is my cousin coming You must leave me now As she spoke the door was opened and Alice entered the room Miss Vavasor mister Fitzgerald said Lady Glencora I have told him to go and leave me Now that you have come Alice he will perhaps obey me Alice was dumbfounded and knew not how to speak either to him or to her but she stood with her eyes riveted on the face of the man of whom she had heard so much Yes certainly he was very beautiful She had never before seen man s beauty such as that She found it quite impossible to speak a word to him then at the spur of the moment but she acknowledged the introduction with a slight inclination of the head and then stood silent as though she were waiting for him to go mister Fitzgerald why do you not leave me and go said Lady Glencora Poor Burgo also found it difficult enough to speak What could he say His cause was one which certainly did not admit of being pleaded in the presence of a strange lady and he might have known from the moment in which he heard Glencora s request that a third person should be summoned to their meeting and probably did know that there was no longer any hope for him It was not on the cards that he should win But there remained one thing that he must do He must get himself out of that room and how was he to effect that I had hoped said he looking at Alice though he addressed Lady Glencora I had hoped to be allowed to speak to you alone for a few minutes No mister Fitzgerald it cannot be so Alice do not go I sent for my cousin when I saw you because I did not choose to be alone with you I have asked you to go You perhaps have not understood me I understand you well enough Then mister Fitzgerald said Alice why do you not do as Lady Glencora has asked you You know you must know that you ought not to be here I know nothing of the kind said he still standing his ground Alice said Lady Glencora we will leave mister Fitzgerald here since he drives us from the room In such contests a woman has ever the best of it at all points The man plays with a button to his foil while the woman uses a weapon that can really wound Burgo knew that he must go felt that he must skulk away as best he might and perhaps hear a low titter of half suppressed laughter as he went Even that might be possible No Lady Glencora he said I will not drive you from the room As one must be driven out it shall be I I own I did think that you would at any rate have been less hard to me He then turned to go bowing again very slightly to Miss Vavasor He was on the threshold of the door before Glencora s voice recalled him Oh my God she said I am hard harder than flint I am cruel Burgo And he was back with her in a moment and had taken her by the hand Glencora said Alice pray pray let him go mister Fitzgerald if you are a man do not take advantage of her folly I will speak to him said Lady Glencora I will speak to him and then he shall leave me She was holding him by the hand now and turning to him away from Alice who had taken her by the arm Burgo she said repeating his name twice again with all the passion that she could throw into the word Burgo no good can come of this Now you must leave me You must go I shall stay with my husband as I am bound to do Because I have wronged you I will not wrong him also I loved you you know I loved you She still held him by the hand and was now gazing up into his face while the tears were streaming from her eyes Sir said Alice you have heard from her all that you can care to hear If you have any feeling of honour in you you will leave her I will never leave her while she tells me that she loves me Yes Burgo you will you must I shall never tell you that again never Do as she bids you Go and leave us but I could not bear that you should tell me that I was hard You are hard hard and cruel as you said yourself Am I May God forgive you for saying that of me Then why do you send me away Because I am a man s wife and because I care for his honour if not for my own Alice let us go He still held her but she would have been gone from him had he not stooped over her and put his arm round her waist In doing this I doubt whether he was quicker than she would have been had she chosen to resist him As it was he pressed her to his bosom and stooping over her kissed her lips Then he left her and making his way out of the room and down the stairs got himself out into the street Thank God that he is gone said Alice You may say so said Lady Glencora for you have lost nothing And you have gained everything Have I I did not know that I had ever gained anything as yet The only human being to whom I have ever yet given my whole heart the only thing that I have ever really loved has just gone from me for ever and you bid me thank God that I have lost him There is no room for thankfulness in any of it either in the love or in the loss It is all wretchedness from first to last At any rate he understands now that you meant it when you told him to leave you Of course I meant it I am beginning to know myself by degrees As for running away with him I have not the courage to do it I can think of it scheme for it wish for it but as for doing it that is beyond me mister Palliser is quite safe He need not try to coax me to remain Alice knew that it was useless to argue with her so she came and sat over her for Lady Glencora had again placed herself on the stool by the window and tried to sooth her by smoothing her hair and nursing her like a child Of course I know that I ought to stay where I am she said breaking out almost with rage and speaking with quick eager voice I am not such a fool as to mistake what I should be if I left my husband and went to live with that man as his mistress You don t suppose that I should think that sort of life very blessed But why have I been brought to such a pass as this And as for female purity Ah What was their idea of purity when they forced me like ogres to marry a man for whom they knew I never cared Had I gone with him had I now eloped with that man who ought to have been my husband whom would a just God have punished worst me or those two old women and my uncle who tortured me into this marriage Come Cora be silent I won t be silent You have had the making of your own lot You have done what you liked and no one has interfered with you You have suffered too but you at any rate can respect yourself And so can you Cora thoroughly now How when he kissed me and I could hardly restrain myself from giving him back his kiss tenfold could I respect myself But it is all sin I sin towards my husband feigning that I love him and I sin in loving that other man who should have been my husband There I hear mister Palliser at the door Come away with me or rather stay for he will come up here and you can keep him in talk while I try to recover myself mister Palliser did at once as his wife had said and came up stairs to the little front room as soon as he had deposited his hat in the hall Alice was in fact in doubt what she should do as to mentioning or omitting to mention mister Fitzgerald s name In an ordinary way it would be natural that she should name any visitor who had called and she specially disliked the idea of remaining silent because that visitor had come as the lover of her host s wife But on the other hand she owed much to Lady Glencora and there was no imperative reason as things had gone why she should make mischief There was no further danger to be apprehended But mister Palliser at once put an end to her doubts You have had a visitor here said he Yes said Alice I saw him as I went out said mister Palliser Indeed I met him at the hall door He of course was wrong to come here so wrong that he deserves punishment if there were any punishment for such offences He has been punished I think said Alice But as for Glencora continued mister Palliser without any apparent notice of what Alice had said I thought it better that she should see him or not as she should herself decide She had no choice in the matter As it turned out he was shown up here at once She sent for me and I think she was right to do that Glencora was alone when he came in For a minute or two till I could get to her I have no questions to ask about it said mister Palliser after waiting for a few moments He had probably thought that Alice would say something further I am very glad that you were within reach of her as otherwise her position might have been painful For her and for me perhaps it may be as well that he has been here As for him I can only say that I am forced to suppose him to be a villain What a man does when driven by passion I can forgive but that he should deliberately plan schemes to ruin both her and me is what I can hardly understand As he made this little speech I wonder whether his conscience said anything to him about Lady Dumbello and a certain evening in his own life on which he had ventured to call that lady Griselda The little party of three dined together very quietly and after dinner they all went to work with their novels Before long Alice saw that mister Palliser was yawning and she began to understand how much he had given up in order that his wife might be secure It was then when he had left the room for a few minutes in order that he might wake himself by walking about the house that Glencora told Alice of his yawning down at Matching I used to think that he would fall in pieces What are we to do about it Don t seem to notice it said Alice That s all very well said the other but he ll set us off yawning as bad as himself and then he ll notice it He has given himself up to politics till nothing else has any salt in it left for him I cannot think why such a man as that wanted a wife at all You are very hard upon him Cora I wish you were his wife with all my heart But of course I know why he got married And I ought to feel for him as he has been so grievously disappointed Then mister Palliser having walked off his sleep returned to the room and the remainder of the evening was passed in absolute tranquillity Burgo Fitzgerald when he left the house turned back into Grosvenor Square not knowing at first whither he was going He took himself as far as his uncle s door and then having paused there for a moment hurried on For half an hour or thereabouts something like true feeling was at work within his heart He had once more pressed to his bosom the woman he had at any rate thought that he had loved He had had his arm round her and had kissed her and the tone with which she had called him by his name was still ringing in his ears Burgo He repeated his own name audibly to himself as though in this way he could recall her voice He comforted himself for a minute with the conviction that she loved him He felt for a moment that he could live on such consolation as that But among mortals there could in truth hardly be one with whom such consolation would go a shorter way He was a man who required to have such comfort backed by pates and curacoa to a very large extent and now it might be doubted whether the amount of pates and curacoa at his command would last him much longer He would not go in and tell his aunt at once of his failure as he could gain nothing by doing so Indeed he thought that he would not tell his aunt at all So he turned back from Grosvenor Square and went down to his club in saint James s Street feeling that billiards and brandy and water might for the present be the best restorative But as he went back he blamed himself very greatly in the matter of those bank notes which he had allowed Lady Monk to take from him How had it come to pass that he had been such a dupe in her hands When he entered his club in saint James s Street his mind had left Lady Glencora and was hard at work considering how he might best contrive to get that spoil out of his aunt s possession CHAPTER LXVIII From London to Baden On the following morning everybody was stirring by times at mister Palliser s house in Park Lane and the master of that house yawned no more There is some life in starting for a long journey and the life is the stronger and the fuller if the things and people to be carried are numerous and troublesome Lady Glencora was a little troublesome and would not come down to breakfast in time When rebuked on account of this manifest breach of engagement she asserted that the next train would do just as well and when mister Palliser proved to her with much trouble that the next train could not enable them to reach Paris on that day she declared that it would be much more comfortable to take a week in going than to hurry over the ground in one day There was nothing she wanted so much as to see Folkestone If that is the case why did not you tell me so before said mister Palliser in his gravest voice Richard and the carriage went down yesterday and are already on board the packet If Richard and the carriage are already on board the packet said Lady Glencora of course we must follow them and we must put off the glories of Folkestone till we come back Alice haven t you observed that in travelling you are always driven on by some Richard or some carriage till you feel that you are a slave All this was trying to mister Palliser but I think that he enjoyed it nevertheless and that he was happy when he found that he did get his freight off from the Pimlico Station in the proper train Of course Lady Glencora and Alice were very ill crossing the Channel of course the two maids were worse than their mistresses of course the men kept out of their master s way when they were wanted and drank brandy and water with the steward down stairs and of course Lady Glencora declared that she would not allow herself to be carried beyond Boulogne that day but nevertheless they did get on to Paris Had mister Palliser become Chancellor of the Exchequer as he had once hoped he could hardly have worked harder than he did work It was he who found out which carriage had been taken for them and who put with his own hands the ladies dressing cases and cloaks on to the seats who laid out the novels which of course were not read by the road and made preparations as though this stage of their journey was to take them a week instead of five hours and a half Oh dear how I have slept said Lady Glencora as they came near to Paris I think you ve been tolerably comfortable said mister Palliser joyfully Since we got out of that horrid boat I have done pretty well Why do they make the boats so nasty I m sure they do it on purpose It would be difficult to make them nice I suppose said Alice It is the sea that makes them uncomfortable said mister Palliser Never mind we shan t have any more of it for twelve months at any rate We can get to the Kurds Alice without getting into a packet again That to my way of thinking is the great comfort of the Continent One can go everywhere without being seasick mister Palliser said nothing but he sighed as he thought of being absent for a whole year He had said that such was his intention and would not at once go back from what he himself had said But how was he to live for twelve months out of the House of Commons What was he to do with himself with his intellect and his energy during all these coming dreary days And then he might have been Chancellor of the Exchequer He might even now at this very moment have been upon his legs making a financial statement of six hours duration to the delight of one half of the House and bewilderment of the other instead of dragging cloaks across that dingy dull dirty waiting room at the Paris Station in which British subjects are kept in prison while their boxes are being tumbled out of the carriages But we are not to stop here are we said Lady Glencora mournfully No dear I have given the keys to Richard We will go on at once But can t we have our things In about half an hour pleaded mister Palliser I suppose we must bear it Alice said Lady Glencora as she got into the carriage that was waiting for her Alice thought of the last time in which she had been in that room when George and Kate had been with her and the two girls had been quite content to wait patiently while their trunks were being examined But Alice was now travelling with great people with people who never spoke of their wealth or seemed ever to think of it but who showed their consciousness of it at every turn of their lives After all Alice had said to herself more than once I doubt whether the burden is not greater than the pleasure They stayed in Paris for a week and during that time Alice found that she became very intimate with mister Palliser At Matching she had in truth seen but little of him and had known nothing Now she began to understand his character and learned how to talk to him She allowed him to tell her of things in which Lady Glencora resolutely persisted in taking no interest She delighted him by writing down in a little pocket book the number of eggs that were consumed in Paris every day whereas Glencora protested that the information was worth nothing unless her husband could tell her how many of the eggs were good and how many bad And Alice was glad to find that a hundred and fifty thousand female operatives were employed in Paris while Lady Glencora said it was a great shame and that they ought all to have husbands When mister Palliser explained that that was impossible because of the redundancy of the female population she angered him very much by asserting that she saw a great many men walking about who she was quite sure had not wives of their own I do so wish you had married him Glencora said to Alice that evening You would always have had a pocket book ready to write down the figures and you would have pretended to care about the eggs and the bottles of wine and the rest of it As for me I can t do it If I see an hungry woman I can give her my money or if she be a sick woman I can nurse her or if I hear of a very wicked man I can hate him but I cannot take up poverty and crime in the lump I never believe it all My mind isn t big enough They went into no society at Paris and at the end of a week were all glad to leave it I don t know that Baden will be any better Lady Glencora said but you know we can leave that again after a bit and so we shall go on getting nearer to the Kurds To this mister Palliser demurred I think we had better make up our mind to stay a month at Baden But why should we make up our minds at all his wife pleaded I like to have a plan said mister Palliser And so do I said his wife if only for the sake of not keeping it There s nothing I hate so much as not carrying out my intentions said mister Palliser Upon this Lady Glencora shrugged her shoulders and made a mock grimace to her cousin All this her husband bore for a while meekly and it must be acknowledged that he behaved very well But then he had his own way in everything Lady Glencora did not behave very well contradicting her husband and not considering as perhaps she ought to have done the sacrifice he was making on her behalf But then she had her own way in nothing She had her own way in almost nothing but on one point she did conquer her husband He was minded to go from Paris back to Cologne and so down the Rhine to Baden Lady Glencora declared that she hated the Rhine that of all rivers it was the most distasteful to her that of all scenery the scenery of the Rhine was the most over praised and that she would be wretched all the time if she were carried that way Upon this mister Palliser referred the matter to Alice and she who had last been upon the Rhine with her cousins Kate and George Vavasor voted for going to Baden by way of Strasbourg We will go by Strasbourg then said mister Palliser gallantly Not that I want to see that horrid church again said Glencora Everything is alike horrid to you I think said her husband You are determined not to be contented so that it matters very little which way we go That s the truth said his wife It does matter very little They got on to Baden with very little delay at Strasbourg and found half an hotel prepared for their reception Here the carriage was brought into use for the first time and the mistress of the carriage talked of sending home for Dandy and Flirt mister Palliser when he heard the proposition calmly assured his wife that the horses would not bear the journey They would be so out of condition he said as not to be worth anything for two or three months I only meant to ask for them if they could come in a balloon said Lady Glencora This angered mister Palliser who had really for a few minutes thought of pacifying his wife by sending for the horses Alice she asked one morning how many eggs are eaten in Baden every morning before ten o clock mister Palliser who at the moment was in the act of eating one threw down his spoon and pushed his plate from him What s the matter Plantagenet she asked The matter he said But never mind I am a fool to care for it I declare I didn t know that I had done anything wrong said Lady Glencora Alice do you understand what it is Alice said that she did understand very well Of course she understands said mister Palliser How can she help it And indeed Miss Vavasor I am more unhappy than I can express myself to think that your comfort should be disturbed in this way Upon my word I think Alice is doing very well said Lady Glencora What is there to hurt her comfort Nobody scolds her Nobody tells her that she is a fool She never jokes or does anything wicked and of course she isn t punished mister Palliser as he wandered that day alone through the gambling rooms at the great Assembly House thought that after all it might have been better for him to have remained in London to have become Chancellor of the Exchequer and to have run all risks I wonder whether it would be any harm if I were to put a few pieces of money on the table just once Lady Glencora said to her cousin on the evening of the same day in one of those gambling salons There had been some music on that evening in one side of the building and the Pallisers had gone to the rooms But as neither of the two ladies would dance they had strayed away into the other apartments The greatest harm in the world said Alice and what on earth could you gain by it You don t really want any of those horrid people s money I ll tell you what I want something to live for some excitement Is it not a shame that I see around me so many people getting amusement and that I can get none I d go and sit out there and drink beer and hear the music only Plantagenet wouldn t let me I think I ll throw one piece on to the table to see what becomes of it I shall leave you if you do said Alice You are such a prude It seems to me as if it must have been my special fate my good fate I mean that has thrown me so much with you You look after me quite as carefully as mister Bott and missus Marsham ever did but as I chose you myself I can t very well complain and I can t very well get rid of you Do you want to get rid of me Cora Sometimes Do you know there are moments when I almost make up my mind to go headlong to the devil when I think it is the best thing to be done It s a hard thing for a woman to do because she has to undergo so much obloquy before she gets used to it A man can take to drinking and gambling and all the rest of it and nobody despises him a bit The domestic old fogies give him lectures if they can catch him but he isn t fool enough for that All he wants is money and he goes away and has his fling Now I have plenty of money or at any rate I had and I never got my fling yet I do feel so tempted to rebel and go ahead and care for nothing Throwing one piece on to the table wouldn t satisfy that longing You think I should be like the wild beast that has tasted blood and can t be controlled Look at all these people here There are husbands gambling and their wives don t know it and wives gambling and their husbands don t know it I wonder whether Plantagenet ever has a fling What a joke it would be to come and catch him I don t think you need be afraid Afraid I should like him all the better for it If he came to me some morning and told me that he had lost a hundred thousand pounds I should be so much more at my ease with him You have no chance in that direction I m quite sure None the least He d make a calculation that the chances were nine to seven against him and then the speculation would seem to him to be madness I don t suppose he d wish to try even though he were sure of winning Of course not It would be a very vulgar kind of thing then Look there s an opening there I ll just put on one napoleon You shall not If you do I ll leave you at once Look at the women who are playing Is there one there whom it would not disgrace you to touch Look what they are Look at their cheeks and their eyes and their hands Those men who rake about the money are bad enough but the women look like fiends You re not going to frighten me in that hobgoblin sort of way you know I don t see anything the matter with any of the people What do you think of that young woman who has just got a handful of money from the man next to her I think she is very happy I never get money given to me by handfuls and the man to whom I belong gives me no encouragement when I want to amuse myself They were now standing near to one end of the table and suddenly there came to be an opening through the crowd up to the table itself Lady Glencora leaving Alice s side at once stepped up and deposited a piece of gold on one of the marked compartments As soon as she placed it she retreated again with flushed face and took hold of Alice s arm There she said I have done it Alice in her dismay did not know what step to take She could not scold her friend now as the eyes of many were turned upon them nor could she of course leave her as she had threatened Lady Glencora laughed with her peculiar little low laughter and stood her ground I was determined you shouldn t frighten me out of it she said Illustration Lady Glencora at Baden One of the ministers at the table had in the meantime gone on with the cards and had called the game and another minister had gently pushed three or four more pieces of gold up to that which Lady Glencora had flung down and had then cunningly caught her eye and with all the courtesy of which he was master had pushed them further on towards her She had supposed herself to be unknown there in the salon but no doubt all the croupiers and half the company knew well enough who was the new customer at the table There was still the space open near to which she stood and then someone motioned to her to come and take up the money which she had won She hesitated and then the croupier asked her in that low indifferent voice which these men always use whether she desired that her money should remain She nodded her head to him and he at once drew the money back again to the spot on which she had placed the first napoleon Again the cards were turned up softly again the game was called and again she won The money was dealt out to her on this occasion with a full hand There were lying there between twenty and thirty napoleons of which she was the mistress Her face had flushed before but now it became very red She caught hold of Alice who was literally trembling beside her and tried to laugh again But there was that in her eye which told Alice that she was really frightened Some one then placed a chair for her at the table and in her confusion not knowing what she was to do she seated herself Come away said Alice taking hold of her and disregarding everything but her own purpose in the agony of the moment You must come away You shall not sit there I must get rid of that money said Glencora trying to whisper her words and then I will come away The croupier again asked her if the money was to remain and she again nodded her head Everybody at the table was now looking at her The women especially were staring at her those horrid women with vermilion cheeks and loud bonnets half off their heads and hard shameless eyes and white gloves which when taken off in the ardour of the game disclosed dirty hands They stared at her with that fixed stare which such women have and Alice saw it all and trembled Again she won Leave it said Alice and come away I can t leave it said Glencora If I do there ll be a fuss I ll go the next time What she said was of course in English and was probably understood by no one near her but it was easy to be seen that she was troubled and of course those around her looked at her the more because of her trouble Again that little question and answer went on between her and the croupier and on this occasion the money was piled up on the compartment a heap of gold which made envious the hearts of many who stood around there Alice had now both her hands on the back of the chair needing support If the devil should persist and increase that stock of gold again she must go and seek for mister Palliser She knew not what else to do She understood nothing of the table or of its laws but she supposed all those ministers of the game to be thieves and believed that all villainous contrivances were within their capacity She thought that they might go on adding to that heap so long as Lady Glencora would sit there presuming that they might thus get her into their clutches Of course she did not sift her suspicions Who does at such moments Come away at once and leave it she said or I shall go At that moment the croupier raked it all up and carried it all away but Alice did not see that this had been done A hand had been placed on her shoulder and as she turned round her face her eyes met those of mister Palliser It is all gone said Glencora laughing And now she turning round also saw her husband I am so glad that you are come said Alice Why did you bring her here said mister Palliser There was anger in his tone and anger in his eye He took his wife s arm upon his own and walked away quickly while Alice followed them alone He went off at once down the front steps of the building towards the hotel What he said to his wife Alice did not hear but her heart was swelling with the ill usage to which she herself was subjected Though she might have to go back alone to England she would tell him that he was ill treating her She followed him on up into their drawing room and there he stood with the door open in his hand for her while Lady Glencora threw herself upon a sofa and burst out into affected laughter Here s a piece of work she said about a little accident An accident said mister Palliser Yes an accident You don t suppose that I sat down there meaning to win all that money Whereupon he looked at her with scorn mister Palliser said Alice you have treated me this evening in a manner I did not expect from you It is clear that you blame me I have not said a word Miss Vavasor No you have not said a word You know well how to show your anger without speaking As I do not choose to undergo your displeasure I will return to England by myself Alice Alice said Glencora jumping up that is nonsense What is all this trumpery thing about Leave me because he chooses to be angry about nothing Is it nothing that I find my wife playing at a common gambling table surrounded by all that is wretched and vile established there seated with heaps of gold before her You wrong me Plantagenet said Glencora There was only one heap and that did not remain long Did it Alice It is impossible to make you ashamed of anything he said I certainly don t like being ashamed she answered and don t feel any necessity on this occasion If you don t object mister Palliser said Alice I will go to bed You can think over all this at night and so can I Good night Glencora Then Alice took her candle and marched off to her own room with all the dignity of which she was mistress CHAPTER LXIX From Baden to Lucerne The second week in July saw mister Palliser s party carriage and all established at Lucerne in Switzerland safe beyond the reach of the German gambling tables Alice Vavasor was still with them and the reader will therefore understand that that quarrel about Lady Glencora s wickedness had been settled without any rupture It had been settled amicably and by the time that they had reached Lucerne Alice was inclined to acknowledge that the whole thing was not worth notice but for many days her anger against mister Palliser had not been removed and her intimacy with him had been much checked It was now a month since the occurrence of that little scene in the salon at Baden which was described in the last chapter since mister Palliser had marched off with his wife leaving Alice to follow as she best could by herself After that as the reader may remember he had almost told her that she was to be blamed because of his wife s indiscretion and when she had declared her intention of leaving him and making her way home to England by herself he had answered her not at all and had allowed her to go off to her own room under the full ban of his displeasure Since that he had made no apology to her he had not in so many words acknowledged that he had wronged her but Alice had become aware that he intended to apologize by his conduct and she had been content so far to indulge his obstinacy as to accept this conduct on his part in lieu of any outspoken petition for pardon The acknowledgement of a mistake and the asking for grace is almost too much for any woman to expect from such a man as mister Palliser Early on the morning after the scene in question Lady Glencora had gone into Alice s bedroom and had found her cousin in her dressing gown packing up her things or looking as though she intended to do so You are not such a fool she said as to think anything of what occurred yesterday Alice assured her that whether fool or not she did think a great deal of it In point of fact said Alice I can t stand it He expects me to take care of you and chooses to show himself offended if you don t do just what he thinks proper whereas as you know well enough I have not the slightest influence over you All these positions Lady Glencora contradicted vigorously Of course mister Palliser had been wrong in walking out of the Assembly Rooms as he had done leaving Alice behind him So much Lady Glencora admitted But this had come of his intense anxiety And you know what a man he is said his wife how stiff and hard and unpleasant he can be without meaning it There is no reason why I should bear his unpleasantness said Alice Yes there is great reason You are to do it for the sake of friendship And as for my not doing what you tell me you know that s not true Did I not beg you to keep away from the table Of course you did and of course I was naughty but that was only once Alice I want you more than I ever wanted you before I cannot tell you more now but you must stay with me Alice consented to come down to breakfast without any immediate continuance of her active preparations for going and at last of course she stayed When she entered the breakfast room mister Palliser came up to her and offered her his hand She had no alternative but to take it and then seated herself That there was an intended apology in the manner in which he offered her toast and butter she was convinced and the special courtesy with which he handed her to the carriage when she and Lady Glencora went out for their drive after dinner was almost as good as a petition for pardon So the thing went on and by degrees mister Palliser and Miss Vavasor were again friends But Alice never knew in what way the matter was settled between mister Palliser and his wife or whether there was any such settling Probably there was none Of course he understands that it didn t mean anything Lady Glencora had said He knows that I don t want to gamble But let that be as it might their sojourn at Baden was curtailed and none of the party went up again to the Assembly Rooms before their departure Before establishing themselves at Lucerne they made a little tour round by the Falls of the Rhine and Zurich In their preparations for this journey Alice made a struggle but a struggle in vain to avoid a passage through Basle It was only too clear to her that mister Palliser was determined to go by Basle She could not bring herself to say that she had recollections connected with that place which would make a return to it unpleasant to her If she could have said as much even to Glencora mister Palliser would no doubt have gone round round by any more distant route that might have been necessary to avoid that eternal gateway into Switzerland But she could not say it She was very averse to talking about herself and her own affairs even with her cousin Of course Lady Glencora knew the whole story of mister John Grey and his rejection and knew much also of that other story of mister George Vavasor And of course like all Alice s friends she hated George Vavasor and was prepared to receive mister John Grey with open arms if there were any possibility that her cousin would open her arms to him also But Alice was so stubborn about her own affairs that her friend found it almost impossible to speak of them It is not that you trouble me Alice once said but that you trouble yourself about that which is of no use It is all done and over and though I know that I have behaved badly very badly yet I believe that everything has been done for the best I am inclined to think that I can live alone or perhaps with my cousin Kate more happily than I could with any husband That is such nonsense Perhaps so but at any rate I mean to try We Vavasors don t seem to be good at marrying You want some one to break your heart for you that s what you want said Lady Glencora In saying this she knew but little of the state of her friend s heart and perhaps was hardly capable of understanding it With all the fuss that Lady Glencora made to herself with all the tears that she had shed about her lost lover and was so often shedding with all her continual thinking of the matter she had never loved Burgo Fitzgerald as Alice Vavasor had loved mister Grey But her nature was altogether different to that of Alice Love with her had in it a gleam of poetry a spice of fun a touch of self devotion something even of hero worship but with it all there was a dash of devilry and an aptitude almost for wickedness She knew Burgo Fitzgerald to be a scapegrace and she liked him the better on that account She despised her husband because he had no vices She would have given everything she had to Burgo pouring her wealth upon him with a total disregard of herself had she been allowed to do so She would have forgiven him sin after sin and might perhaps have brought him round at last to some life not absolutely reckless and wretched But in all that she might have done there would have been no thoughtfulness no true care either for him or for herself And now that she was married there was no thoughtfulness or care either for herself or for her husband She was ready to sacrifice herself for him if any sacrifice might be required of her She believed herself to be unfit for him and would have submitted to be divorced or smothered out of the way for the matter of that if the laws of the land would have permitted it But she had never for a moment given to herself the task of thinking what conduct on her part might be the best for his welfare But Alice s love had been altogether of another kind and I am by no means sure that it was better suited for the work of this work a day world than that of her cousin It was too thoughtful I will not say that there was no poetry in it but I will say that it lacked romance Its poetry was too hard for romance There was certainly in it neither fun nor wickedness nor was there I fear so large a proportion of hero worship as there always should be in a girl s heart when she gives it away But there was in it an amount of self devotion which none of those near to her had hitherto understood unless it were that one to whom the understanding of it was of the most importance In all the troubles of her love of her engagements and her broken promises she had thought more of others than of herself and indeed those troubles had chiefly come from that self devotion She had left John Grey because she feared that she would do him no good as his wife that she would not make him happy and she had afterwards betrothed herself for a second time to her cousin because she believed that she could serve him by marrying him Of course she had been wrong She had been very wrong to give up the man she did love and more wrong again in suggesting to herself the possibility of marrying the man she did not love She knew that she had been wrong in both and was undergoing repentance with very bitter inward sackcloth But she said little of all this even to her cousin They went to Lucerne by Basle and put up at the big hotel with the balcony over the Rhine which Alice remembered so well On the first evening of her arrival she found herself again looking down upon the river as though it might have been from the same spot which she had occupied together with George and Kate But in truth that house is very large and has many bedrooms over the water Who has ever been through Basle and not stood in one of them looking down upon the father of waters Here on this very spot in one of these balconies was brought to her a letter from her cousin Kate which was filled with tidings respecting her cousin George mister Palliser brought it to her with his own hands and she had no other alternative but to read it in his presence George has lost his election the letter began For one moment Alice thought of her money and the vain struggle in which it had been wasted For one moment something like regret for the futility of the effort she had made came upon her But it passed away at once It was worth our while to try it she said to herself and then went on with her letter I and Aunt Greenow are up in London the letter went on to say and have just heard the news Though I have been here for three days and have twice sent word to him to say so he has not been near me Perhaps it is best that he should stay away as I do not know how any words could pass between us that would be pleasant The poll was finished this afternoon and he lost his election by a large majority There were five candidates altogether for the two seats three Liberals and two Conservatives The other two Liberals were seated and he was the last of the five I continue to hear tidings about him from day to day or rather my aunt hears them and tells them to me which fill me full of fears as to his future career I believe that he has abandoned his business and that he has now no source of income I would willingly share what I have with him or I would do more than that After keeping back enough to repay you gradually what he owes you I would give him all my share of the income out of the estate But I cannot do this while we are presumed to be enemies I am up here to see a lawyer as to some steps which he is taking to upset grandpapa s will The lawyer says that it is all nonsense and that George s lawyer is not really in earnest but I cannot do anything till the matter is settled Dear Alice though so much of your money is for a time gone I am bound to congratulate you on your safety on what I may more truly call your escape You will understand what my own feelings must be in writing this after all that I did to bring you and him together after all my hopes and ambition respecting him As for the money it shall be repaid I do not think I shall ever dare to indulge in any strong desire again I think you will forgive me the injury I have done you and I know that you will pity me I am here to see the London lawyer but not only for that Aunt Greenow is buying her wedding clothes and Captain Bellfield is in lodgings near to us also buying his trousseau or as I should more properly say having it bought for him I am hardly in a mood for much mirth but it is impossible not to laugh inwardly when she discusses before me the state of his wardrobe and proposes economical arrangements greatly to his disgust At present she holds him very tightly in hand and makes him account for all his hours as well as all his money Of course he ll run wild directly he s married she said to me yesterday and of course there ll always be a fight about it but the more I do to tame him now the less wild he ll be by and by And though I dare say I shall scold him sometimes I shall never quarrel with him I have no doubt all that is true but what a fool she is to trouble herself with such a man She says she does it for an occupation I took courage to tell her once that a caged tiger would give her as much to do and be less dangerous She was angry at this and answered me very sharply I had tried my hand on a tiger she said and had felt his claws She chose to sacrifice herself if a sacrifice it were to be when some good result might be possible I had nothing further to say and from that time to this we have been on the pleasantest terms possible as to the Captain They have settled with your father to take Vavasor Hall for three years and I suppose I shall stay with them till your return What I may do then will depend entirely upon your doings I feel myself to be a desolate solitary being without any tie to any person or to any place I never thought that I should feel the death of my grandfather to be such a loss to me as it has been Except you I have nothing left to me and as regards you I have the unpleasant feeling that I have for years been endeavouring to do you the worst possible injury and that you must regard me as an enemy from whom you have escaped indeed but not without terrible wounds Alice was always angered by any assumption that her conduct to mister Grey had been affected by the advice or influence of her cousin Kate But this very feeling seemed to preserve Kate from the worse anger which might have been aroused against her had Alice acknowledged the injury which her cousin had in truth done to her It was undoubtedly true that had Alice neither seen nor heard from Kate during the progress of John Grey s courtship John Grey would not have lost his wife But against this truth Alice was always protesting within her own breast She had been weak foolish irresolute and had finally acted with false judgement So much she now admitted to herself But she would not admit that any other woman had persuaded her to such weakness She mistakes me Alice thought as she put up her letter She is not the enemy who has wounded me mister Palliser who had brought her the letter was seated in the same balcony and while Alice had been reading had almost buried himself in newspapers which conveyed intelligence as to the general elections then in progress He was now seated with a sheet of The Times in his hand opened to its full extent for he had been too impatient to cut the paper and as he held it up in his hands before his eyes was completely hidden beneath it Five or six other open papers were around him and he had not spoken a word since he had commenced his present occupation Lady Glencora was standing on the other side of him and she also had received letters Sophy tells me that you are returned for Silverbridge she said at last Who I yes I m returned said mister Palliser speaking with something like disdain in his voice as to the possibility of anybody having stood with a chance of success against him in his own family borough For a full appreciation of the advantages of a private seat in the House of Commons let us always go to those great Whig families who were mainly instrumental in carrying the Reform Bill The house of Omnium had been very great on that occasion It had given up much and had retained for family use simply the single seat at Silverbridge But that that seat should be seriously disputed hardly suggested itself as possible to the mind of any Palliser The Pallisers and the other great Whig families have been right in this They have kept in their hands as rewards for their own services to the country no more than the country is manifestly willing to give them Yes I have been returned said mister Palliser I m sorry to see Miss Vavasor that your cousin has not been so fortunate So I find said Alice It will be a great misfortune to him Ah I suppose so Those Metropolitan elections cost so much trouble and so much money and under the most favourable circumstances are so doubtful A man is never sure there till he has fought for his seat three or four times This has been the third time with him said Alice and he is a poor man Dear dear said mister Palliser who himself knew nothing of such misfortunes I have always thought that those seats should be left to rich commercial men who can afford to spend money upon them Instead of that they are generally contested by men of moderate means Another of my friends in the House has been thrown out Who is that unfortunate asked Lady Glencora mister Bott said the unthinking husband mister Bott out exclaimed Lady Glencora mister Bott thrown out I am so glad Alice are you not glad The red haired man that used to stand about you know at Matching he has lost his seat in Parliament I suppose he ll go and stand about somewhere in Lancashire now A very indiscreet woman was poor Lady Glencora mister Palliser s face became black beneath The Times newspaper I did not know said he that my friend mister Bott and Miss Vavasor were enemies Enemies I don t suppose they were enemies said Glencora But he was a man whom no one could help observing and disliking He was a man I specially disliked said Alice with great courage He may be very well in Parliament but I never met a man who could make himself so disagreeable in society I really did feel myself constrained to be his enemy Bravo Alice said Lady Glencora I hope he did nothing at Matching to to to began mister Palliser apologetically Nothing especially to offend me mister Palliser except that he had a way that I especially dislike of trying to make little secret confidences And then he was so ugly said Lady Glencora I felt certain that he endeavoured to do mischief said Alice Of course he did said Lady Glencora and he had a habit of rubbing his head against the papers in the rooms and leaving a mark behind him that was quite unpardonable mister Palliser was effectually talked down and felt himself constrained to abandon his political ally Perhaps he did this the easier as the loss which mister Bott had just suffered would materially interfere with his political utility I suppose he will remain now among his own people said mister Palliser Let us hope he will said Lady Glencora and that his own people will appreciate the advantage of his presence Then there was nothing more said about mister Bott It was evening and while they were still sitting among their letters and newspapers there came a shout along the water and the noise of many voices from the bridge Suddenly there shot down before them in the swift running stream the heads of many swimmers in the river and with the swimmers came boats carrying their clothes They went by almost like a glance of light upon the waters so rapid was the course of the current There was the shout of voices the quick passage of the boats the uprising some half a dozen times of the men s hands above the surface and then they were gone down the river out of sight like morsels of wood thrown into a cataract which are borne away instantly Oh how I wish I could do that said Lady Glencora It seems to be very dangerous said mister Palliser I don t know how they can stop themselves Why should they want to stop themselves said Lady Glencora Think how cool the water must be and how beautiful to be carried along so quickly and to go on and on and on I suppose we couldn t try it As no encouragement was given to this proposition Lady Glencora did not repeat it but stood leaning on the rail of the balcony and looking enviously down upon the water Alice was of course thinking of that other evening when perhaps the same swimmers had come down under the bridge and before the balcony and where George Vavasor was sitting in her presence It was I think on that evening that she made up her mind to separate herself from mister Grey On the day after that mister Palliser and his party went on to Lucerne making that journey as I have said by slow stages taking Schaffhausen and Zurich in their way At Lucerne they established themselves for some time occupying nearly a dozen rooms in the great hotel which overlooks the lake Here there came to them a visitor of whose arrival I will speak in the next chapter CHAPTER LXX At Lucerne I am inclined to think that mister Palliser did not much enjoy this part of his tour abroad When he first reached Lucerne there was no one there with whom he could associate pleasantly nor had he any occupation capable of making his time run easily He did not care for scenery Close at his elbow was the finest to be had in Europe but it was nothing to him Had he been simply journeying through Lucerne at the proper time of the year for such a journey when the business of the Session was over and a little change of air needed he could have enjoyed the thing in a moderate way looking about him passing on and knowing that it was good for him to be there at that moment But he had none of that passion for mountains and lakes none of that positive joy in the heather which would have compensated many another man for the loss of all that mister Palliser was losing His mind was ever at home in the House of Commons or in that august assembly which men call the Cabinet and of the meetings of which he read from week to week the simple records Therein were mentioned the names of those heroes to whom Fortune had been so much kinder than she had been to him and he envied them He took short solitary walks about the town over the bridges and along the rivers making to himself the speeches which he would have made to full houses had not his wife brought ruin upon all his hopes And as he pictured to himself the glorious successes which probably never would have been his had he remained in London so did he prophesy to himself an absolute and irremediable downfall from all political power as the result of his absence having in truth no sufficient cause for such despair As yet he was barely thirty and had he been able to judge his own case as keenly as he could have judged the case of another he would have known that a short absence might probably raise his value in the estimation of others rather than lower it But his personal annoyance was too great to allow of his making such calculations aright So he became fretful and unhappy and though he spoke no word of rebuke to his wife though he never hinted that she had robbed him of his glories he made her conscious by his manner that she had brought him to this miserable condition Lady Glencora herself had a love for the mountains and lakes but it was a love of that kind which requires to be stimulated by society and which is keenest among cold chickens picnic pies and the flying of champagne corks When they first entered Switzerland she was very enthusiastic and declared her intention of climbing up all the mountains and going through all the passes She endeavoured to induce her husband to promise that she should be taken up Mont Blanc And I think she would have carried this on and would have been taken up Mont Blanc had mister Palliser s aspirations been congenial But they were not congenial and Lady Glencora soon lost all her enthusiasm By the time that they were settled at Lucerne she had voted the mountains to be bores and had almost learned to hate the lake which she declared always made her wet through when she got into a small boat and sea sick when she put her foot in a large one At Lucerne they made no acquaintances mister Palliser being a man not apt to new friendships They did not even dine at the public table though Lady Glencora had expressed a wish to do so mister Palliser did not like it and of course Lady Glencora gave way There were moreover some marital passages which were not pleasant to a third person They did not scold each other but Lady Glencora would make little speeches of which her husband disapproved She would purposely irritate him by continuing her tone of badinage and then mister Palliser would become fretful and would look as though the cares of the world were too many for him I cannot therefore say that Alice had much to make the first period of her sojourn at Lucerne a period of enjoyment But when they had been there about a fortnight a stranger arrived whose coming at any rate lent the grace of some excitement to their lives Their custom was to breakfast at nine or as near nine as Lady Glencora could be induced to appear and then mister Palliser would read till three At that hour he would walk forth by himself after having handed the two ladies into their carriage and they would be driven about for two hours How I do hate this carriage Lady Glencora said one day I do so wish it would come to grief and be broken to pieces I wonder whether the Swiss people think that we are going to be driven about here for ever There were moments however which seemed to indicate that Lady Glencora had something to tell her cousin which if told would alter the monotony of their lives Alice however would not press her for her secret If you have anything to tell why don t you tell it Alice once said You are so hard said Lady Glencora So you tell me very often Alice replied and it is not complimentary But hard or soft I won t make a petition for your confidence Then Lady Glencora said something savage and the subject was dropped for a while But we must go back to the stranger mister Palliser had put the ladies into their carriage and was standing between the front door of the hotel and the lake on a certain day doubting whether he would walk up the hill to the left or turn into the town on the right when he was accosted by an English gentleman who raising his hat said that he believed that he spoke to mister Palliser I am mister Palliser said our friend very courteously returning the salute and smiling as he spoke But though he smiled and though he was courteous and though he raised his hat there was something in his look and voice which would not have encouraged any ordinary stranger to persevere mister Palliser was not a man with whom it was easy to open an acquaintance My name is John Grey said the stranger Then the smile was dropped the look of extreme courtesy disappeared the tone of mister Palliser s voice was altered and he put out his hand He knew enough of mister John Grey s history to be aware that mister John Grey was a man with whom he might permit himself to become acquainted After the interchange of a very few words the two men started off for a walk together Perhaps you don t wish to meet the carriage said mister Palliser If so we had better go through the town and up the river They went through the town and up the river and when mister Palliser on his return was seen by Alice and Lady Glencora he was alone They dined together and nothing was said Together they sauntered out in the evening and together came in and drank their tea but still nothing was said At last Alice and her cousin took their candles from mister Palliser s hands and left the sitting room for the night Alice said Lady Glencora as soon as they were in the passage together I have been dying for this time to come I could not speak before or I should have made blunders and so would you Let us go into your room at once Who do you think is here at Lucerne in this house at this very moment Alice knew at once who it was She knew immediately that mister Grey had followed her though no word had been written to her or spoken to her on the subject since that day on which he himself had told her that they would meet abroad But though she was quite sure she did not mention his name Who is it Glencora she asked very calmly Whom in all the world would you best like to see said Glencora My cousin Kate certainly said Alice Then it is not your cousin Kate And I don t believe you or else you re a fool Alice was accustomed to Lady Glencora s mode of talking and therefore did not think much of this Perhaps I am a fool she said Only I know you are not But I am not at all so sure as to your being no hypocrite The person I mean is a gentleman of course Why don t you show a little excitement at any rate When Plantagenet told me just before dinner I almost jumped out of my shoes He was going to tell you himself after dinner in the politest way in the world no doubt and just as the servants were carrying away the apples I thought it best to save you from that but I declare I believe I might have left him to do it it would have had no effect upon you Who is it that has come do you suppose Of course I know now said Alice very calmly that mister John Grey has come Yes mister John Grey has come He is here in this house at this minute or more probably waiting outside by the lake till he shall see a light in your bedroom Then Lady Glencora paused for a moment waiting that Alice might say something But Alice said nothing Well said Lady Glencora rising up from her chair Well Well said Alice Have you nothing to say Is it the same to you as though mister Smith had come No not exactly the same I am quite alive to the importance of mister Grey s arrival and shall probably lie awake all night thinking about it if it will do you any good to know that but I don t feel that I have much to say about it I wish I had let mister Palliser tell you in an ordinary way before all the servants I do indeed It would not have made much difference Not the least I believe I wonder whether you ever did care for anybody in your life for him or for that other one or for anybody For nobody I believe except your cousin Kate Still waters they say run deep and sometimes I think your waters run too deep for me to fathom I suppose I may go now if you have got nothing more to say What do you want me to say Of course I know why he has come here He told me he should come And you have never said a word about it He told me he should come and I thought it better not to say a word about it He might change his mind or anything might happen I told him not to come and it would have been much better that he should have remained away Why why why would it be better Because his being here will do no good to any one No good It seems to me impossible but that it should do all the good in the world Look here Alice If you do not altogether make it up with him before to morrow evening I shall believe you to be utterly heartless Had I been you I should have been in his arms before this I ll go now and leave you to lie awake as you say you will Then she left the room but returned in a moment to ask another question What is Plantagenet to say to him about seeing you to morrow Of course he has asked permission to come and call He may come if he pleases You don t think I have quarrelled with him or would refuse to see him And may we ask him to dine with us Oh yes And make up a picnic and all the rest of it In fact he is to be regarded as only an ordinary person Well good night I don t understand you that s all It may be doubted whether Alice understood herself As soon as her friend was gone she put out her candle and seated herself at the open window of her room looking out upon the moonlight as it played upon the lake Would he be there thinking of her looking up perhaps as Glencora had hinted to see if he could distinguish her light among the hundred that would be flickering across the long front of the house If it were so at any rate he should not see her so she drew the curtain and sat there watching the lake It was a pity that he should have come and yet she loved him dearly for coming It was a pity that he should have come as his coming could lead to no good result Of this she assured herself over and over again and yet she hardly knew why she was so sure of it Glencora had called her hard but her conviction on that matter had not come from hardness Now that she was alone her heart was full of love of the soft romance of love towards this man and yet she felt that she ought not to marry him even though he might still be willing to take her That he was still willing to take her that he desired to have her for his wife in spite of all the injury she had done him there could be no doubt Why else had he followed her to Switzerland And she remembered now at this moment how he had told her at Cheltenham that he would never consider her to be lost to him unless she should in truth become the wife of another man Why then should it not be as he wished it Illustration Alice She asked herself the question and did not answer it but still she felt that it might not be so She had no right to such happiness after the evil that she had done She had been driven by a frenzy to do that which she herself could not pardon and having done it she could not bring herself to accept the position which should have been the reward of good conduct She could not analyse the causes which made her feel that she must still refuse the love that was proffered to her she could not clearly read her own thoughts but the causes were as I have said and such was the true reading of her thoughts Had she simply refused his hand after she had once accepted it had she refused it and then again changed her mind she could have brought herself to ask him to forgive her But she had done so much more than this and so much worse She had affianced herself to another man since she had belonged to him since she had been his as his future wife What must he not think of her and what not suspect Then she remembered those interviews which she had had with her cousin since she had written to him accepting his offer When he had been with her in Queen Anne Street she had shrunk from all outward signs of a love which she did not feel There had been no caress between them She had not allowed him to touch her with his lips But it was impossible that the nature of that mad engagement between her and her cousin George should ever be made known to mister Grey She sat there wiping the tears from her eyes as she looked for his figure among the figures by the lake side but as she sat there she promised herself no happiness from his coming Oh reader can you forgive her in that she had sinned against the softness of her feminine nature I think that she may be forgiven in that she had never brought herself to think lightly of her own fault If he were there by the lake side she did not see him I think we may say that John Grey was not a man to console himself in his love by looking up at his lady s candle He was one who was capable of doing as much as most men in the pursuit of his love as he proved to be the case when he followed Alice to Cheltenham and again to London and now again to Lucerne but I doubt whether a glimmer from her bedroom window had it been unmistakably her own glimmer and not that of some ugly old French woman who might chance to sleep next to her would have done him much good He had come to Lucerne with a purpose which purpose if it might be possible he meant to carry out but I think he was already in bed being tired with long travel before Lady Glencora had left Alice s room At breakfast the next morning nothing was said for a while about the new arrival At last mister Palliser ventured to speak Glencora has told you I think that mister Grey is here mister Grey is an old friend of yours I believe Alice keeping her countenance as well as she was able said mister Grey had been and indeed was a very dear friend of hers mister Palliser knew the whole story and what was the use of any little attempt at dissimulation I shall be glad to see him if you will allow me she went on to say Glencora suggests that we should ask him to dinner said mister Palliser and then that matter was settled But mister Grey did not wait till dinner time to see Alice Early in the morning his card was brought up and Lady Glencora as soon as she saw the name immediately ran away Indeed you need not go said Alice Indeed I shall go said her ladyship I know what s proper on these occasions if you don t So she went whisking herself along the passages with a little run and mister Grey as he was shown into her ladyship s usual sitting room saw the skirt of her ladyship s dress as she whisked herself off towards her husband I told you I should come he said with his ordinary sweet smile I told you that I should follow you and here I am He took her hand and held it pressing it warmly She hardly knew with what words first to address him or how to get her hand back from him I am very glad to see you as an old friend she said but I hope Well you hope what I hope you have had some better cause for travelling than a desire to see me No dearest no I have had no better cause and indeed none other I have come on purpose to see you and had mister Palliser taken you off to Asia or Africa I think I should have felt myself compelled to follow him You know why I follow you Hardly said she not finding at the moment any other word that she could say Because I love you You see what a plain spoken John Bull I am and how I come to the point at once I want you to be my wife and they say that perseverance is the best way when a man has such a want as that You ought not to want it she said whispering the words as though she were unable to speak them out loud But I do you see And why should I not want it I am not fit to be your wife I am the best judge of that Alice You have to make up your mind whether I am fit to be your husband You would be disgraced if you were to take me after all that has passed after what I have done What would other men say of you when they knew the story Other men I hope would be just enough to say that when I had made up my mind I was tolerably constant in keeping to it I do not think they could say much worse of me than that They would say that you had been jilted and had forgiven the jilt As far as the forgiveness goes they would tell the truth But indeed Alice I don t very much care what men do say of me But I care mister Grey and though you may forgive me I cannot forgive myself Indeed I know now as I have known all along that I am not fit to be your wife I am not good enough And I have done that which makes me feel that I have no right to marry anyone These words she said jerking out the different sentences almost in convulsions and when she had come to the end of them the tears were streaming down her cheeks I have thought about it and I will not I will not After what has passed I know that it will be better more seemly that I should remain as I am Soon after that she left him not however till she had told him that she would meet him again at dinner and had begged him to treat her simply as a friend In spite of everything I hope that we may always be friends dear friends she said I hope we may he answered the very dearest And then he left her In the afternoon he again encountered mister Palliser and having thought over the matter since his interview with Alice he resolved to tell his whole story to his new acquaintance not in order that he might ask for counsel from him for in this matter he wanted no man s advice but that he might get some assistance So the two men walked off together up the banks of the clear flowing Reuss and mister Palliser felt the comfort of having a companion I have always liked her said mister Palliser though to tell the truth I have twice been very angry with her I have never been angry with her said the lover And my anger was in both instances unjust You may imagine how great is my confidence in her when I have thought she was the best companion my wife could have for a long journey taken under circumstances that were that were but I need not trouble you with that So great had been the desolation of mister Palliser s life since his banishment from London that he almost felt tempted to tell the story of his troubles to this absolute stranger But he bethought himself of the blood of the Pallisers and refrained There are comforts which royalty may never enjoy and luxuries in which such men as Plantagenet Palliser may not permit themselves to indulge About her and her character I have no doubt in the world said Grey In all that she has done I think that I have seen her motives and though I have not approved of them I have always known them to be pure and unselfish She has done nothing that I did not forgive as soon as it was done Had she married that man I should have forgiven her even that though I should have known that all her future life was destroyed and much of mine also I think I can make her happy if she will marry me but she must first be taught to forgive herself Living as she is with you and with your wife she may perhaps just now be more under your influence and your wife s than she can possibly be under mine Whereupon mister Palliser promised that he would do what he could I think she loves me said mister Grey mister Palliser said that he was sure she did though what ground he had for such assurance I am quite unable to surmise He was probably desirous of saying the most civil thing which occurred to him The little dinner party that evening was pleasant enough and nothing more was said about love Lady Glencora talked nonsense to mister Grey and mister Palliser contradicted all the nonsense which his wife talked But this was all done in such a way that the evening passed away pleasantly It was tacitly admitted among them that mister Grey was to be allowed to come among them as a friend and Lady Glencora managed to say one word to him aside in which she promised to give him her most cordial cooperation CHAPTER LXXI Showing How George Vavasor Received a Visit We must go back for a few pages to scenes which happened in London during this summer so that the reader may understand mister Grey s position when he reached Lucerne He had undergone another quarrel with George Vavasor and something of the circumstances of that quarrel must be told It has been already said that George Vavasor lost his election for the Chelsea Districts after all the money which he had spent money which he had been so ill able to spend and on which he had laid his hands in a manner so disreputable He had received two thousand pounds from the bills which Alice had executed on his behalf or rather had received the full value of three out of the four bills and a part of the value of the fourth on which he had been driven to raise what immediate money he had wanted by means of a Jew bill discounter One thousand pounds he had paid over at once into the hands of mister Scruby his Parliamentary election agent towards the expenses of his election and when the day of polling arrived had exactly in his hands the sum of five hundred pounds Where he was to get more when this was gone he did not know If he were successful if the enlightened constituents of the Chelsea Districts contented with his efforts on behalf of the River Bank should again send him to Parliament he thought that he might still carry on the war A sum of ready money he would have in hand and as to his debts he would be grandly indifferent to any consideration of them Then there might be pickings in the way of a Member of Parliament of his calibre Companies mercantile companies would be glad to have him as a director paying him a guinea a day or perhaps more for his hour s attendance Railways in want of vice chairmen might bid for his services and in the City he might turn that M P which belonged to him to good account in various ways With such a knowledge of the City world as he possessed he thought that he could pick up a living in London if only he could retain his seat in Parliament But what was he to do if he could not retain it No sooner had mister Scruby got the thousand pounds into his clutches than he pressed for still more money George Vavasor with some show of justice on his side pointed out to this all devouring agent that the sum demanded had already been paid This mister Scruby admitted declaring that he was quite prepared to go on without any further immediate remittance although by doing so might subject himself to considerable risk But another five hundred pounds paid at once would add greatly to the safety of the seat whereas eight hundred judiciously thrown in at the present moment would make the thing quite secure But Vavasor swore to himself that he would not part with another shilling Never had he felt such love for money as he did for that five hundred pounds which he now held in his pocket It s no use he said to mister Scruby I have done what you asked and would have done more had you asked for more at that time As it is I cannot make another payment before the election mister Scruby shrugged his shoulders and said that he would do his best But George Vavasor soon knew that the man was not doing his best that the man had in truth abandoned his cause The landlord of the Handsome Man jeered him when he went there canvassing Laws mister Vavasor said the landlord of the Handsome Man you re not at all the fellow for us chaps along the river you ain t You re afraid to come down with the stumpy that s what you are George put his hand upon his purse and acknowledged to himself that he had been afraid to come down with the stumpy For the last five days of the affair George Vavasor knew that his chance was gone mister Scruby s face manner and words told the result of the election as plainly as any subsequent figures could do He would be absent when Vavasor called or the clerk would say that he was absent He would answer in very few words constantly shrugging his shoulders He would even go away and leave the anxious candidate while he was in the middle of some discussion as to his plans It was easy to see that mister Scruby no longer regarded him as a successful man and the day of the poll showed very plainly how right mister Scruby had been George Vavasor was rejected but he still had his five hundred pounds in his pocket Of course he was subject to that mortification which a man feels when he reflects that some little additional outlay would have secured his object Whether it might have been so or not who can say But there he was with the gateway between the lamps barred against him ex Member of Parliament for the Chelsea Districts with five hundred pounds in his pocket and little or nothing else that he could call his own What was he to do with himself After trying to make himself heard upon the hustings when he was rejected and pledging himself to stand again at the next election he went home to his lodgings in Cecil Street and endeavoured to consider calmly his position in the world He had lost his inheritance He had abandoned one profession after another and was now beyond the pale of another chance in that direction His ambition had betrayed him and there were no longer possible to him any hopes of political activity He had estranged from himself every friend that he had ever possessed He had driven from him with violence the devotion even of his sister He had robbed the girl whom he intended to marry of her money and had so insulted her that no feeling of amity between them was any longer possible He had nothing now but himself and that five hundred pounds which he still held in his pocket What should he do with himself and his money He thought over it all with outer calmness for awhile as he sat there in his arm chair From the moment in which he had first become convinced that the election would go against him and that he was therefore ruined on all sides he had resolved that he would be calm amidst his ruin Sometimes he assumed a little smile as though he were laughing at his own position mister Bott s day of rejection had come before his own and he had written to mister Bott a drolling note of consolation and mock sympathy He had shaken hands with mister Scruby and had poked his fun at the agent bidding him be sure to send in his little bill soon To all who accosted him he replied in a subrisive tone and he bantered Calder Jones whose seat was quite sure till Calder Jones began to have fears that were quite unnecessary And now as he sat himself down intending to come to some final decision as to what he would do he maintained the same calmness He smiled in the same way though there was no one there to see the smile He laughed even audibly once or twice as he vainly endeavoured to persuade himself that he was able to regard the world and all that belonged to it as a bubble There came to him a moment in which he laughed out very audibly Ha ha he shouted rising up from his chair and he walked about the room holding a large paper knife in his hand Ha ha Then he threw the knife away from him and thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets laughed again Ha ha He stood still in the centre of the room and the laughter was very plainly visible on his face had there been anybody there to see it But suddenly there was a change upon his face as he stood there all alone and his eyes became fierce and the cicatrice that marred his countenance grew to be red and ghastly and he grinned with his teeth and he clenched his fists as he still held them within his pockets Curse him he said out loud Curse him now and for ever He had broken down in his calmness when he thought of that old man who had opposed him during his life and had ruined him at his death May all the evils which the dead can feel cling to him for ever and ever His laughter was all gone and his assumed tranquillity had deserted him Walking across the room he struck his foot against a chair upon this he took the chair in his hands and threw it across the room But he hardly arrested the torrent of his maledictions as he did so What good was it that he should lie to himself by that mock tranquillity or that false laughter He lied to himself no longer but uttered a song of despair that was true enough What should he do Where should he go From what fountain should he attempt to draw such small draughts of the water of comfort as might support him at the present moment Unless a man have some such fountain to which he can turn the burden of life cannot be borne For the moment Vavasor tried to find such fountain in a bottle of brandy which stood near him He half filled a tumbler and then dashing some water on it swallowed it greedily By he said I believe it is the best thing a man can do But where was he to go to whom was he to turn himself He went to a high desk which stood in one corner of the room and unlocking it took out a revolving pistol and for a while carried it about with him in his hand He turned it up and looked at it and tried the lock and snapped it without caps to see that the barrel went round fairly It s a beggarly thing to do he said and then he turned the pistol down again and if I do do it I ll use it first for another purpose Then he poured out for himself more brandy and water and having drunk it he threw himself upon the sofa and seemed to sleep But he did not sleep and by and by there came a slight single knock at the door which he instantly answered But he did not answer it in the usual way by bidding the comer to come in Who s there he said Then the comer attempted to enter turning the handle of the door But the door had been locked and the key was on Vavasor s side Who s there he asked again speaking out loudly but in an angry voice It is I said a woman s voice D ation said George Vavasor The woman heard him but she made no sign of having heard him She simply remained standing where she was till something further should be done within She knew the man well and knew that she must bide his time She was very patient and for the time was meek though it might be that there would come an end to her meekness Vavasor when he had heard her voice and knew who was there had again thrown himself on the sofa There flashed across his mind another thought or two as to his future career another idea about the pistol which still lay upon the table Why should he let the intruder in and undergo the nuisance of a disagreeable interview if the end of all things might come in time to save him from such trouble There he lay for ten minutes thinking and then the low single knock was heard again He jumped upon his feet and his eyes were full of fire He knew that it was useless to bid her go and leave him She would sit there if it were through the whole night Should he open the door and strangle her and pass out over her with the pistol in his hand so that he might make that other reckoning which he desired to accomplish and then never come back any more He took a turn through the room and then walked gently up to the door and undid the lock He did not open the door nor did he bid his visitor enter but having made the way easy for her if she chose to come in he walked back to the sofa and threw himself on it again As he did so he passed his hand across the table so as to bring the pistol near to himself at the place where he would be lying She paused a moment after she had heard the sound of the key and then she made her way into the room He did not at first speak to her She closed the door very gently and then looking around came up to the foot of the sofa She paused a moment waiting for him to address her but as he said nothing but lay there looking at her she was the first to speak George she said what am I to do She was a woman of about thirty years of age dressed poorly in old garments but still with decency and with some attempt at feminine prettiness There were flowers in the bonnet on her head though the bonnet had that unmistakable look of age which is quite as distressing to bonnets as it is to women and the flowers themselves were battered and faded She had long black ringlets on each cheek hanging down much below her face and brought forward so as to hide in some degree the hollowness of her jaws Her eyes had a peculiar brightness but now they left on those who looked at her cursorily no special impression as to their colour They had been blue that dark violet blue which is so rare but is sometimes so lovely Her forehead was narrow her mouth was small and her lips were thin but her nose was perfect in its shape and by the delicacy of its modelling had given a peculiar grace to her face in the days when things had gone well with her when her cheeks had been full with youth and good living and had been dimpled by the softness of love and mirth There were no dimples there now and all the softness which still remained was that softness which sorrow and continual melancholy give to suffering women On her shoulders she wore a light shawl which was fastened to her bosom with a large clasp brooch Her faded dress was supported by a wide crinoline but the under garment had lost all the grace of its ancient shape and now told that woman s tale of poverty and taste for dress which is to be read in the outward garb of so many of Eve s daughters The whole story was told so that those who ran might read it When she had left her home this afternoon she had struggled hard to dress herself so that something of the charm of apparel might be left to her but she had known of her own failure at every twist that she had given to her gown and at every jerk with which she had settled her shawl She had despaired at every push she had given to her old flowers vainly striving to bring them back to their old forms but still she had persevered With long tedious care she had mended the old gloves which would hardly hold her fingers She had carefully hidden the rags of her sleeves She had washed her little shrivelled collar and had smoothed it out painfully It had been a separate grief to her that she could find no cuffs to put round her wrists and yet she knew that no cuffs could have availed her anything Nothing could avail her now She expected nothing from her visit yet she had come forth anxiously and would have waited there throughout the whole night had access to his room been debarred to her George she said standing at the bottom of the sofa what am I to do As he lay there with his face turned towards her the windows were at her back and he could see her very plainly He saw and appreciated the little struggles she had made to create by her appearance some reminiscence of her former self He saw the shining coarseness of the long ringlets which had once been softer than silk He saw the sixpenny brooch on her bosom where he had once placed a jewel the price of which would now have been important to him He saw it all and lay there for a while silently reading it Don t let me stand here she said without speaking a word to me I don t want you to stand there he said That s all very well George I know you don t want me to stand here I know you don t want to see me ever again Never I know it Of course I know it But what am I to do Where am I to go for money Even you would not wish that I should starve That s true too I certainly would not wish it I should be delighted to hear that you had plenty to eat and plenty to drink and plenty of clothes to wear I believe that s what you care for the most after all It was only for your sake because you liked it Well I did like it but that has come to an end as have all my other likings You know very well that I can do nothing more for you What good do you do yourself by coming here to annoy me Have I not told you over and over again that you were never to look for me here Is it likely that I should give you money now simply because you have disobeyed me Where else was I to find you Why should you have found me at all I don t want you to find me I shall give you nothing not a penny You know very well that we ve had all that out before When I put you into business I told you that we were to see no more of each other Business she said I never could make enough out of the shop to feed a bird That wasn t my fault Putting you there cost me over a hundred pounds and you consented to take the place I didn t consent I was obliged to go there because you took my other home away from me Have it as you like my dear That was all I could do for you and more than most men would have done when all things are considered Then he got up from the sofa and stood himself on the hearthrug with his back to the fireplace At any rate you may be sure of this Jane that I shall do nothing more You have come here to torment me but you shall get nothing by it I have come here because I am starving I have nothing for you Now go and he pointed to the door Nevertheless for more than three years of his life this woman had been his closest companion his nearest friend the being with whom he was most familiar He had loved her according to his fashion of loving and certainly she had loved him Go he said repeating the word very angrily Do as I bid you or it will be the worse for you Will you give me a sovereign No I will give you nothing I have desired you not to come to me here and I will not pay for you coming Then I will not go and the woman sat down upon a chair at the foot of the table I will not go till you have given me something to buy food You may put me out of the room if you can but I will lie at the door of the stairs And if you get me out of the house I will sit upon the door step If you play that game my poor girl the police will take you Let them It has come to that with me that I care for nothing Out of this I will not go till you give me money unless I am put out And for this she had dressed herself with so much care mending her gloves and darning her little fragments of finery He stood looking at her with his hands thrust deep into his pockets looking at her and thinking what he had better do to rid himself of her presence If he even quite resolved to take that little final journey of which we have spoken with the pistol in his hand why should he not go and leave her there Or for the matter of that why should he not make her his heir to all remainder of his wealth What he still had left was sufficient to place her in a seventh heaven of the earth He cared but little for her and was at this moment angry with her but there was no one for whom he cared more and no friend with whom he was less angry But then his mind was not quite made up as to that final journey Therefore he desired to rid himself and his room of the nuisance of her presence Jane he said looking at her again with that assumed tranquillity of which I have spoken you talk of starving and of being ruined I am starving I have not a shilling in the world Perhaps it may be a comfort to you in your troubles to know that I am at any rate as badly off as you are I won t say that I am starving because I could get food to eat at this moment if I wanted it but I am utterly ruined My property what should have been mine has been left away from me I have lost the trumpery seat in Parliament for which I have paid so much All my relations have turned their backs upon me Are you not going to be married she said rising quickly from her chair and coming close to him Married No but I am going to blow my brains out Look at that pistol my girl Of course you won t think that I am in earnest but I am She looked up into his face piteously Oh George she said you won t do that Illustration Oh George she said you won t do that But I shall do that There is nothing else left for me to do You talk to me about starving I tell you that I should have no objection to be starved and so be put an end to in that way It s not so bad as some other ways when it comes gradually You and I Jane have not played our cards very well We have staked all that we had and we ve been beaten It s no good whimpering after what s lost We d better go somewhere else and begin a new game Go where said she Ah that s just what I can t tell you George she said I ll go anywhere with you If what you say is true if you re not going to be married and will let me come to you I will work for you like a slave I will indeed I know I m poorly looking now My girl where I m going I shall not want any slave and as for your looks when you go there too they ll be of no matter as far as I am able to judge But George where are you going Wherever people do go when their brains are knocked out of them or rather when they have knocked out their own brains if that makes any difference George she came up to him now and took hold of him by the front of his coat and for the moment he allowed her to do so George you frighten me Do not do that Say that you will not do that But I am just saying that I shall Are you not afraid of God s anger You and I have been very wicked I have my poor girl I don t know much about your wickedness I ve been like Topsy indeed I am a kind of second Topsy myself But what s the good of whimpering when it s over It isn t over it isn t over at any rate for you I wish I knew how I could begin again But all this is nonsense Jane and you must go You must tell me first that you are not going to kill yourself I don t suppose I shall do it to night or perhaps not to morrow Very probably I may allow myself a week so that your staying here can do no good I merely wanted to make you understand that you are not the only person who has come to grief And you are not going to be married No I m not going to be married certainly And I must go now Yes I think you d better go now Then she rose and went and he let her leave the room without giving her a shilling His bantering tone in speaking of his own position had been successful It had caused her to take herself off quietly She knew enough of his usual manner to be aware that his threats of self destruction were probably unreal but nevertheless what he had said had created some feeling in her heart which had induced her to yield to him and go away in peace CHAPTER LXXII Showing How George Vavasor Paid a Visit It was nearly seven o clock in the evening a hot July evening when the woman went from Vavasor s room and left him there alone It was necessary that he should immediately do something In the first place he must dine unless he meant to carry out his threat and shoot himself at once But he had no such intention as that although he stood for some minutes with the pistol in his hand He was thinking then of shooting some one else But he resolved that if he did so at all he would not do it on that evening and he locked up the pistol again in the standing desk After that he took up some papers referring to steam packets which were lying on his table They contained the programmes of different companies and showed how one vessel went on one day to New York and another on another day would take out a load of emigrants for New Zealand and Australia That s a good line said he as he read a certain prospectus They generally go to the bottom and save a man from any further trouble on his own account Then he dressed himself putting on his boots and coat and went out to his club for his dinner London was still fairly full that is to say the West End was not deserted although Parliament had been broken up two months earlier than usual in preparation for the new elections Many men who had gone down into the country were now back again in town and the dining room at the club was crowded Men came up to him condoling with him telling him that he was well rid of a great nuisance that the present Members for the Chelsea Districts would not sit long or that there would be another general election in a year or two To all these little speeches he made cheerful replies and was declared by his acquaintance to bear his disappointment well Calder Jones came to him and talked hunting talk and Vavasor expressed his intention of being at Roebury in November You had better join our club said Calder Jones In answer to which Vavasor said that he thought he would join the club He remained in the smoking room till nearly eleven then he took himself home and remained up half the night destroying papers Every written document on which he could lay his hands he destroyed All the pigeon holes of his desk were emptied out and their contents thrown into the flames At first he looked at the papers before he burned them but the trouble of doing so soon tired him and he condemned them all as he came to them without examination Then he selected a considerable amount of his clothes and packed up two portmanteaus folding his coats with care and inspecting his boots narrowly so that he might see which out of the large number before him it might be best worth his while to take with him When that was done he took from his desk a bag of sovereigns and pouring them out upon the table he counted them out into parcels of twenty five each and made them up carefully into rouleaus with paper These when complete he divided among the two portmanteaus and a dressing bag which he also packed and a travelling desk which he filled with papers pens and the like But he put into it no written document He carefully looked through his linen and anything that had been marked with more than his initials he rejected Then he took out a bundle of printed cards and furnished a card case with them On these cards was inscribed the name of Gregory Vance When all was finished he stood for awhile with his back to the fireplace contemplating his work After all he said to himself I know that I shall never start and if I do nobody can hinder me and my own name would be as good as any other As for a man with such a face as mine not being known that is out of the question But still he liked the arrangements which he had made and when he had looked at them for awhile he went to bed He was up early the next morning and had some coffee brought to him by the servant of the house and as he drank it he had an interview with his landlady He was going he said going that very day It might be possible that he would change his mind but as he would desire to start without delay if he did go he would pay her then what he owed her and what would be due for her lodgings under a week s notice The woman stared and curtseyed and took her money Vavasor though he had lately been much pressed for money had never been so foolish as to owe debts where he lived There will be some things left about missus Bunsby he said and I will get you to keep them till I call or send missus Bunsby said that she would and then looked her last at him After that interview she never saw him again When he was left alone he put on a rough morning coat and taking up the pistol placed it carefully in his pocket and sallied forth It was manifest enough that he had some decided scheme in his head for he turned quickly towards the West when he reached the Strand went across Trafalgar Square to Pall Mall East and then turned up Suffolk Street Just as he reached the club house at the corner he paused and looked back facing first one way and then the other The chances are that I shall never see anything of it again he said to himself Then he laughed in his own silent way shook his head slightly and turning again quickly on his heel walked up the street till he reached the house of mister Jones the pugilistic tailor The reader no doubt has forgotten all he ever knew of mister Jones the pugilistic tailor It can soon be told again At mister Jones s house John Grey lodged when he was in London and he was in London at this moment Vavasor rang the bell and as soon as the servant came he went quickly into the house and passed her in the passage mister Grey is at home he said I will go up to him The girl said that mister Grey was at home but suggested that she had better announce the gentleman But Vavasor was already halfway up the stairs and before the girl had reached the first landing place he had entered mister Grey s room and closed the door behind him Grey was sitting near the open window in a dressing gown and was reading The breakfast things were on the table but he had not as yet breakfasted As soon as he saw George Vavasor he rose from his chair quickly and put down his book mister Vavasor he said I hardly expected to see you in my lodgings again I dare say not said Vavasor but nevertheless here I am He kept his right hand in the pocket which held the pistol and held his left hand under his waistcoat May I ask why you have come said Grey I intend to tell you at any rate whether you ask me or not I have come to declare in your own hearing as I am in the habit of doing occasionally behind your back that you are a blackguard to spit in your face and defy you As he said this he suited his action to his words but without any serious result I have come here to see if you are man enough to resent any insult that I can offer you but I doubt whether you are Nothing that you can say to me mister Vavasor will have any effect upon me except that you can of course annoy me And I mean to annoy you too before I have done with you Will you fight me Fight a duel with you with pistols Certainly not Then you are a coward as I supposed I should be a fool if I were to do such a thing as that Look here mister Grey You managed to worm yourself into an intimacy with my cousin Miss Vavasor and to become engaged to her When she found out what you were how paltry and mean and vile she changed her mind and bade you leave her Are you here at her request I am here as her representative Self appointed I think Then sir you think wrong I am at this moment her affianced husband and I find that in spite of all that she has said to you which was enough I should have thought to keep any man of spirit out of her presence you still persecute her by going to her house and forcing yourself upon her presence Now I give you two alternatives You shall either give me your written promise never to go near her again or you shall fight me I shall do neither one nor the other as you know very well yourself Stop till I have done sir If you have courage enough to fight me I will meet you in any country I will fight you here in London or if you are afraid of that I will go over to France or to America if that will suit you better Nothing of the kind will suit me at all I don t want to have anything to do with you Then you are a coward Perhaps I am but your saying so will not make me one You are a coward and a liar and a blackguard I have given you the option of behaving like a gentleman and you have refused it Now look here I have come here with arms and I do not intend to leave this room without using them unless you will promise to give me the meeting that I have proposed And he took the pistol out of his pocket Do you mean that you are going to murder me Grey asked There were two windows in the room and he had been sitting near to that which was furthest removed from the fireplace and consequently furthest removed from the bell and his visitor was now standing immediately between him and the door He had to think what steps he might best take and to act upon his decision instantly He was by no means a timid man and was one moreover very little prone to believe in extravagant action He did not think even now that this disappointed ruined man had come there with any intention of killing him But he knew that a pistol in the hands of an angry man is dangerous and that it behoved him to do his best to rid himself of the nuisance which now encumbered him Do you mean that you are going to murder me he had said I mean that you shall not leave this room alive unless you promise to meet me and fight it out Upon hearing this Grey turned himself towards the bell If you move a step I will fire at you said Vavasor Grey paused a moment and looked him full in the face I will said Vavasor again That would be murder said Grey Don t think that you will frighten me by ugly words said Vavasor I am beyond that Grey had stopped for a moment to fix his eyes on the other man s face but it was only for a moment and then he went on to the bell He had seen that the pistol was pointed at himself and had once thought of rushing across the room at his adversary calculating that a shot fired at him as he did so might miss him and that he would then have a fair chance of disarming the madman But his chief object was to avoid any personal conflict to escape the indignity of a scramble for the pistol and especially to escape the necessity of a consequent appearance at some police office where he would have to justify himself and answer the questions of a lawyer hired to cross question him He made therefore towards the bell trusting that Vavasor would not fire at him but having some little thought also as to the danger of the moment It might be that everything was over for him now that the fatal hour had come and that eternity was close upon him Something of the spirit of a prayer flashed across his mind as he moved Then he heard the click of the pistol s hammer as it fell and was aware that his eyes were dazzled though he was unconscious of seeing any flame He felt something in the air and knew that the pistol had been fired but he did not know whether the shot had struck him or had missed him His hand was out for the bell handle and he had pulled it before he was sure that he was unhurt D ation exclaimed the murderer But he did not pull the trigger again Though the weapon had of late been so often in his hands he forgot in the agitation of the moment that his missing once was but of small matter if he chose to go on with his purpose Were there not five other barrels for him each making itself ready by the discharge of the other But he had paused forgetting in his excitement the use of his weapon and before he had bethought himself that the man was still in his power he heard the sound of the bell D ation he exclaimed Then he turned round left the room hurried down the stairs and made his way out into the street having again passed the girl on his way Grey when he perceived that his enemy was gone turned round to look for the bullet or its mark He soon found the little hole in the window shutter and probing it with the point of his pencil came upon the morsel of lead which might now just as readily have been within his own brain There he left it for the time and then made some not inaccurate calculation as to the narrowness of his own escape He had been standing directly between Vavasor and the shutter and he found from the height of the hole that the shot must have passed close beneath his ear He remembered to have heard the click of the hammer but he could not remember the sound of the report and when the girl entered the room he perceived at once from her manner that she was unaware that firearms had been used Has that gentleman left the house Grey asked The girl said that he had left the house Don t admit him again said he that is if you can avoid it I believe he is not in his right senses Then he asked for mister Jones his landlord and in a few minutes the pugilistic tailor was with him During those few minutes he had been called upon to resolve what he would do now Would he put the police at once upon the track of the murderer who was as he remembered too well the first cousin of the woman whom he still desired to make his wife That cross examination which he would have to undergo at the police office and again probably in an assize court in which all his relations with the Vavasor family would be made public was very vivid to his imagination That he was called upon by duty to do something he felt almost assured The man who had been allowed to make such an attempt once with impunity might probably make it again But he resolved that he need not now say anything about the pistol to the pugilistic tailor unless the tailor said something to him mister Jones he said that man whom I had to put out of the room once before has been here again Has there been another tussle sir No nothing of that kind But we must take some steps to prevent his getting in again if we can help it Jones promised his aid and offered to go at once to the police To this however mister Grey demurred saying that he should himself seek assistance from some magistrate Jones promised to be very vigilant as to watching the door and then John Grey sat down to his breakfast Of course he thought much of what had occurred It was impossible that he should not think much of so narrow an escape He had probably been as near death as a man may well be without receiving any injury and the more he thought of it the more strongly he was convinced that he could not allow the thing to pass by without some notice or some precaution as to the future At eleven o clock he went to Scotland Yard and saw some officer great in power over policemen and told him all the circumstances confidentially The powerful officer recommended an equally confidential reference to a magistrate and towards evening a very confidential policeman in plain clothes paid a visit to Vavasor s lodgings in Cecil Street But Vavasor lodged there no longer missus Bunsby who was also very confidential and at her wits end because she could not learn the special business of the stranger who called stated that mister George Vavasor left her house in a cab at ten o clock that morning having taken with him such luggage as he had packed and having gone she was afraid for good as missus Bunsby expressed it He had gone for good and at the moment in which the policeman was making the inquiry in Cecil Street was leaning over the side of an American steamer which had just got up her steam and weighed her anchor in the Mersey He was on board at six o clock and it was not till the next day that the cabman was traced who had carried him to Euston Square Station Of course it was soon known that he had gone to America but it was not thought worth while to take any further steps towards arresting him mister Grey himself was decidedly opposed to any such attempt declaring his opinion that his own evidence would be insufficient to obtain a conviction The big men in Scotland Yard were loth to let the matter drop Their mouths watered after the job and they had very numerous and very confidential interviews with John Grey But it was decided that nothing should be done Pity said one enterprising superintendent in answer to the condolings of a brother superintendent Pity s no name for it It s the greatest shame as ever I knew since I joined the force A man as was a Member of Parliament only last Session as belongs to no end of swell clubs a gent as well known in London as any gent about the town And I d have had him back in three months as sure as my name s Walker And that superintendent felt that his profession and his country were alike disgraced And now George Vavasor vanishes from our pages and will be heard of no more Roebury knew him no longer nor Pall Mall nor the Chelsea Districts His disappearance was a nine days wonder but the world at large knew nothing of the circumstances of that attempt in Suffolk Street mister Grey himself told the story to no one till he told it to mister Palliser at Lucerne mister Scruby complained bitterly of the way in which Vavasor had robbed him but I doubt whether Scruby in truth lost much by the transaction To Kate down in Westmoreland no tidings came of her brother and her sojourn in London with her aunt had nearly come to an end before she knew that he was gone Even then the rumour reached her through Captain Bellfield and she learned what few facts she knew from missus Bunsby in Cecil Street He was always mysterious said missus Greenow and now he has vanished I hate mysteries and as for myself I think it will be much better that he should not come back again Perhaps Kate was of the same opinion but if so she kept it to herself CHAPTER LXXIII In Which Come Tidings of Great Moment to All Pallisers It was not till they had been for a day or two together at Lucerne that mister Grey told mister Palliser the story of George Vavasor s visit to him in Suffolk Street Having begun the history of his connection with Alice he found himself obliged to go with it to the end and as he described the way in which the man had vanished from the sight of all who had known him that he had in truth gone so as no longer to be a cause of dread he could not without dissimulation keep back the story of that last scene And he tried to murder you said mister Palliser He should be caught and and mister Palliser hesitated not liking to say boldly that the first cousin of the lady who was now living with him ought to be hung It is better as it is said Grey He actually walked into your rooms in the day time and fired a pistol at you as you were sitting at your breakfast He did that in London and then walked off and went abroad as though he had nothing to fear That was just it said Grey mister Palliser began to think that something ought to be done to make life more secure in the metropolis of the world Had he not known mister Grey or been accustomed to see the other man in Parliament he would not have thought so much about it But it was almost too much for him when he reflected that one man whom he now called his friend had been nearly murdered in daylight in the heart of his own part of London by another man whom he had reckoned among his Parliamentary supporters And he has got your money too said Palliser putting all the circumstances of the case together In answer to this mister Grey said that he hoped the loss might eventually be his own but that he was bound to regard the money which had been taken as part of Miss Vavasor s fortune He is simply the greatest miscreant of whom I ever heard in my life said mister Palliser The wonder is that Miss Vavasor should ever have brought herself to to like him Then mister Grey apologized for Alice explaining that her love for her cousin had come from her early years that the man himself was clever and capable of assuming pleasant ways and that he had not been wholly bad till ruin had come upon him He attempted public life and made himself miserable by failing as most men do who make that attempt said Grey This was a statement which mister Palliser could not allow to pass without notice Whereupon the two men got away from George Vavasor and their own individual interests and went on seriously discussing the merits and demerits of public life The end of it all is said Grey at last that public men in England should be rich like you and not poor like that miserable wretch who has now lost everything that the Fates had given him They continued to live at Lucerne in this way for a fortnight mister Grey though he was not unfrequently alone with Alice did not plead his suit in direct words but continued to live with her on terms of close and easy friendship He had told her that her cousin had left England that he had gone to America immediately after his disappointment in regard to the seat in Parliament and that he would probably not return Poor George Alice had said he is a man very much to be pitied He is a man very much to be pitied Grey had replied After that nothing more was said between them about George Vavasor From Lady Glencora Alice did hear something but Lady Glencora herself had not heard the whole story I believe he misbehaved himself my dear Lady Glencora said but then you know he always does that I believe that he saw mister Grey and insulted him Perhaps you had better not ask anything about it till by and by You ll be able to get anything out of him then In answer to this Alice made her usual protest and Lady Glencora as was customary told her that she was a fool I am inclined to think that mister Grey knew what he was about Lady Glencora once scolded him very vehemently for not bringing the affair to an end We shall be going on to Italy before it s settled she said and I don t suppose you can go with us unless it is settled mister Grey protested that he had no intention of going to Italy in either case Then it will be put off for another year or two and you are both of you as old as Adam and Eve already We ancient people are never impatient said Grey laughing If I were you I would go to her and tell her roundly that she should marry me and then I would shake her If you were to scold her till she did not know whether she stood on her head or her heels she would come to reason Suppose you try that Lady Glencora I can t It s she that always scolds me as you will her when she s your wife You and mister Palliser are very much alike You re both of you so very virtuous that no woman would have a chance of picking a hole in your coats But Lady Glencora was wrong Alice would no doubt have submitted herself patiently to her lover s rebukes and would have confessed her own sins towards him with any amount of self accusation that he might have required but she would not on that account have been more willing to obey him in that one point as to which he now required present obedience He understood that she must be taught to forgive herself for the evil she had done to forgive herself at any rate in part before she could be induced to return to her old allegiance to him Thus they went on together at Lucerne passing quiet idle days with some pretence of reading with a considerable amount of letter writing with boat excursions and pony excursions till the pony excursions came to a sudden end by means of a violent edict as to which and the cause of it a word or two must be said just now During these days of the boats and the ponies the carriage which Lady Glencora hated so vehemently was shut up in limbo and things went very pleasantly with her mister Palliser received political letters from England which made his mouth water sadly and was often very fidgety Parliament was not now sitting and the Government would of course remain intact till next February Might it not be possible that when the rent came in the Cabinet he might yet be present at the darning He was a constant man and had once declared his intention of being absent for a year He continued to speak to Grey of his coming travels as though it was impossible that they should be over until after the next Easter But he was sighing for Westminster and regretting the blue books which were accumulating themselves at Matching till on a sudden there came to him tidings which upset all his plans which routed the ponies which made everything impossible which made the Alps impassable and the railways dangerous which drove Burgo Fitzgerald out of mister Palliser s head and so confused him that he could no longer calculate the blunders of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer All the Palliser world was about to be moved from its lowest depths to the summits of its highest mountains Lady Glencora had whispered into her husband s ear that she thought it probable she wasn t sure she didn t know And then she burst out into tears on his bosom as he sat by her on her bedside He was beside himself when he left her which he did with the primary intention of telegraphing to London for half a dozen leading physicians He went out by the lake side and walked there alone for ten minutes in a state of almost unconscious exaltation He did not quite remember where he was or what he was doing The one thing in the world which he had lacked the one joy which he had wanted so much and which is so common among men was coming to him also In a few minutes it was to him as though each hand already rested on the fair head of a little male Palliser of whom one should rule in the halls at Gatherum and the other be eloquent among the Commons of England Hitherto for the last eight or nine months since his first hopes had begun to fade he had been a man degraded in his own sight amidst all his honours What good was all the world to him if he had nothing of his own to come after him We must give him his due too when we speak of this He had not had wit enough to hide his grief from his wife his knowledge of women and of men in social life had not been sufficient to teach him how this should be done but he had wished to do it He had never willingly rebuked her for his disappointment either by a glance of his eye or a tone of his voice and now he had already forgiven everything Burgo Fitzgerald was a myth missus Marsham should never again come near her mister Bott was of course a thing abolished he had not even had the sense to keep his seat in Parliament Dandy and Flirt should feed on gilded corn and there should be an artificial moon always ready in the ruins If only those d able saddle ponies of Lucerne had not come across his wife s path He went at once into the yard and ordered that the ponies should be abolished sent away one and all to the furthest confines of the canton and then he himself inspected the cushions of the carriage Were they dry As it was August in those days and August in Lucerne is a warm month it may be presumed that they were dry He then remembered that he had promised to send Alice up to his wife and he hurried back into the house She was alone in the breakfast room waiting for him and for his wife In these days mister Grey would usually join them at dinner but he seldom saw them before eleven or twelve o clock in the day Then he would saunter in and join mister Palliser and they would all be together till the evening When the expectant father of embryo dukes entered the room Alice perceived at once that some matter was astir His manner was altogether changed and he showed by his eye that he was eager and moved beyond his wont Alice he said would you mind going up to Glencora s room She wishes to speak to you He had never called her Alice before and as soon as the word was spoken he remembered himself and blushed She isn t ill I hope said Alice No she isn t ill At least I think she had better not get up quite yet Don t let her excite herself if you can help it I ll go to her at once said Alice rising I m so much obliged to you but Miss Vavasor You called me Alice just now mister Palliser and I took it as a great compliment He blushed again Did I Very well Then I ll do it again if you ll let me But if you please do be as calm with her as you can She is so easily excited you know Of course if there s anything she fancies we ll take care to get it for her but she must be kept quiet Upon this Alice left him having had no moment of time to guess what had happened or was about to happen and he was again alone contemplating the future glories of his house Had he a thought for his poor cousin Jeffrey whose nose was now so terribly out of joint No indeed His thoughts were all of himself and the good things that were coming to him of the new world of interest that was being opened for him It would be better to him this than being Chancellor of the Exchequer He would rather have it in store for him to be father of the next Duke of Omnium than make half a dozen consecutive annual speeches in Parliament as to the ways and means and expenditure of the British nation Could it be possible that this foreign tour had produced for him this good fortune If so how luckily had things turned out He would remember even that ball at Lady Monk s with gratitude Perhaps a residence abroad would be best for Lady Glencora at this particular period of her life If so abroad she should certainly live Before resolving however on anything permanently on this head he thought that he might judiciously consult those six first rate London physicians whom in the first moment of his excitement he had been desirous of summoning to Lucerne In the meantime Alice had gone up to the bedroom of the lady who was now to be the subject of so much anxious thought When she entered the room her friend was up and in her dressing gown lying on a sofa which stood at the foot of the bed Oh Alice I m so glad you ve come said Lady Glencora I do so want to hear your voice Then Alice knelt beside her and asked her if she were ill He hasn t told you But of course he wouldn t How could he But Alice how did he look Did you observe anything about him Was he pleased I did observe something and I think he was pleased But what is it He called me Alice And seemed to be quite unlike himself But what is it He told me that I was to come to you instantly Oh Alice can t you guess Then suddenly Alice did guess the secret and whispered her guess into Lady Glencora s ear I suppose it is so said Lady Glencora I know what they ll do They ll kill me by fussing over me If I could go about my work like a washerwoman I should be all right I am so happy she said some two or three hours afterwards I won t deny that I am very happy It seemed as though I were destined to bring nothing but misery to everybody and I used to wish myself dead so often I shan t wish myself dead now We shall all have to go home I suppose said Alice He says so but he seems to think that I oughtn t to travel above a mile and a half a day When I talked of going down the Rhine in one of the steamers I thought he would have gone into a fit When I asked him why he gave me such a look I know he ll make a goose of himself and he ll make geese of us too which is worse On that afternoon as they were walking together mister Palliser told the important secret to his new friend mister Grey He could not deny himself the pleasure of talking about this great event It is a matter you see of such immense importance to me mister Palliser said Indeed it is said Grey Every man feels that when a child is about to be born to him But this did not at all satisfy mister Palliser Yes said he That s of course It is an important thing to everybody very important no doubt But when a man You see Grey I don t think a man is a bit better because he is rich or because he has a title nor do I think he is likely to be in any degree the happier I am quite sure that he has no right to be in the slightest degree proud of that which he has had no hand in doing for himself Men usually are very proud of such advantages said Grey I don t think that I am I don t indeed I am proud of some things Whenever I can manage to carry a point in the House I feel very proud of it I don t think I ever knocked under to any one and I am proud of that Perhaps mister Palliser was thinking of a certain time when his uncle the Duke had threatened him and he had not given way to the Duke s threats But I don t think I m proud because chance has made me my uncle s heir Not in the least I should say But I do feel that a son to me is of more importance than it is to most men A strong anxiety on the subject is I think more excusable in me than it might be in another I don t know whether I quite make myself understood Oh yes When there s a dukedom and heaven knows how many thousands a year to be disposed of the question of their future ownership does become important This property is so much more interesting to one if one feels that all one does to it is done for one s own son And yet said Grey of all the great plunderers of property throughout Europe the Popes have been the most greedy Perhaps it s different when a man can t have a wife said mister Palliser From all this it may be seen that mister Palliser and mister Grey had become very intimate Had chance brought them together in London they might have met a score of times before mister Palliser would have thought of doing more than bowing to such an acquaintance mister Grey might have spent weeks at Matching without having achieved anything like intimacy with its noble owner But things of that kind progress more quickly abroad than they do at home The deck of an ocean steamer is perhaps the most prolific hotbed of the growth of sudden friendships but an hotel by the side of a Swiss lake does almost as well For some time after this Lady Glencora s conduct was frequently so indiscreet as to drive her husband almost to frenzy On the very day after the news had been communicated to him she proposed a picnic and made the proposition not only in the presence of Alice but in that of mister Grey also mister Palliser on such an occasion could not express all that he thought but he looked it What is the matter now Plantagenet said his wife Nothing said he nothing Never mind And shall we make this party up to the chapel The chapel in question was Tell s chapel ever so far up the lake A journey in a steam boat would have been necessary No said he shouting out his refusal at her We will not You needn t be angry about it said she as though he could have failed to be stirred by such a proposition at such a time On another occasion she returned from an evening walk showing on her face some sign of the exercise she had taken Good G Glencora said he do you mean to kill yourself He wanted her to eat six or seven times a day and always told her that she was eating too much remembering some ancient proverb about little and often He watched her now as closely as missus Marsham and mister Bott had watched her before and she always knew that he was doing so She made the matter worse by continually proposing to do things which she knew he would not permit in order that she might enjoy the fun of seeing his agony and amazement But this though it was fun to her at the moment produced anything but fun as its general result Upon my word Alice I think this will kill me she said I am not to stir out of the house now unless I go in the carriage or he is with me It won t last long I don t know what you call long As for walking with him it s out of the question He goes about a mile an hour And then he makes me look so much like a fool I had no idea that he would be such an old coddle The coddling will all be given to some one else very soon No baby could possibly live through it if you mean that If there is a baby I suppose there will be one by and by said Alice Don t be a fool But if there is I shall take that matter into my own hands He can do what he pleases with me and I can t help myself but I shan t let him or anybody do what they please with my baby I know what I m about in such matters a great deal better than he does I ve no doubt he s a very clever man in Parliament but he doesn t seem to me to understand anything else Alice was making some very wise speech in answer to this when Lady Glencora interrupted her mister Grey wouldn t make himself so troublesome I m quite sure Then Alice held her tongue When the first consternation arising from the news had somewhat subsided say in a fortnight from the day in which mister Palliser was made so triumphant and when tidings had been duly sent to the Duke and an answer from his Grace had come arrangements were made for the return of the party to England The Duke s reply was very short MY DEAR PLANTAGENET Give my kind love to Glencora If it s a boy of course I will be one of the godfathers The Prince who is very kind will perhaps oblige me by being the other I should advise you to return as soon as convenient Your affectionate uncle OMNIUM That was the letter and short as it was it was probably the longest that mister Palliser had ever received from the Duke There was great trouble about the mode of their return Oh what nonsense said Glencora Let us get into an express train and go right through to London mister Palliser looked at her with a countenance full of rebuke and sorrow He was always so looking at her now If you mean Plantagenet that we are to be dragged all across the Continent in that horrible carriage and be a thousand days on the road I for one won t submit to it I wish I had never told him a word about it she said afterwards to Alice He would never have found it out himself till this thing was all over mister Palliser did at last consent to take the joint opinion of a Swiss doctor and an English one who was settled at Berne and who on the occasion was summoned to Lucerne They suggested the railway and as letters arrived for mister Palliser medical letters in which the same opinion was broached it was agreed at last that they should return by railway but they were to make various halts on the road stopping at each halting place for a day The first was of course Basle and from Basle they were to go on to Baden I particularly want to see Baden again Lady Glencora said and perhaps I may be able to get back my napoleon CHAPTER LXXIV Showing What Happened in the Churchyard These arrangements as to the return of mister Palliser s party to London did not of course include mister Grey They were generally discussed in mister Grey s absence and communicated to him by mister Palliser I suppose we shall see you in England before long said mister Palliser I shall be able to tell you that before you go said Grey Not but that in any event I shall return to England before the winter Then come to us at Matching said mister Palliser We shall be most happy to have you Say that you ll come for the first fortnight in December After that we always go to the Duke in Barsetshire Though by the by I don t suppose we shall go anywhere this year mister Palliser added interrupting the warmth of his invitation and reflecting that under the present circumstances perhaps it might be improper to have any guests at Matching in December But he had become very fond of mister Grey and on this occasion as he had done on some others pressed him warmly to make an attempt at Parliament It isn t nearly so difficult as you think said he when Grey declared that he would not know where to look for a seat See the men that get in There was mister Vavasor Even he got a seat But he had to pay for it very dearly You might easily find some quiet little borough Quiet little boroughs have usually got their own quiet little Members said Grey They re fond of change and if you like to spend a thousand pounds the thing isn t difficult I ll put you in the way of it But mister Grey still declined He was not a man prone to be talked out of his own way of life and the very fact that George Vavasor had been in Parliament would of itself have gone far towards preventing any attempt on his part in that direction Alice had also wanted him to go into public life but he had put aside her request as though the thing were quite out of the question never giving a moment to its consideration Had she asked him to settle himself and her in Central Africa his manner and mode of refusal would have been the same It was this immobility on his part this absolute want of any of the weakness of indecision which had frightened her and driven her away from him He was partly aware of this but that which he had declined to do at her solicitation he certainly would not do at the advice of any one else So it was that he argued the matter with himself Had he now allowed himself to be so counselled with what terrible acknowledgements of his own faults must he not have presented himself before Alice I suppose books then will be your object in life said mister Palliser I hope they will be my aids Grey answered I almost doubt whether any object such as that you mean is necessary for life or even expedient It seems to me that if a man can so train himself that he may live honestly and die fearlessly he has done about as much as is necessary He has done a great deal certainly said mister Palliser who was not ready enough to carry on the argument as he might have done had more time been given to him to consider it He knew very well that he himself was working for others and not for himself and he was aware though he had not analysed his own convictions on the matter that good men struggle as they do in order that others besides themselves may live honestly and if possible die fearlessly The recluse of Nethercoats had thought much more about all this than the rising star of the House of Commons but the philosophy of the rising star was the better philosophy of the two though he was by far the less brilliant man I don t see why a man should not live honestly and be a Member of Parliament as well continued mister Palliser when he had been silent for a few minutes Nor I either said Grey I am sure that there are such men and that the country is under great obligation to them But they are subject to temptations which a prudent man like myself may perhaps do well to avoid But though he spoke with an assured tone he was shaken and almost regretted that he did not accept the aid which was offered to him It is astonishing how strong a man may be to those around him how impregnable may be his exterior while within he feels himself to be as weak as water and as unstable as chaff But the object which he had now in view was a renewal of his engagement with Alice and he felt that he must obtain an answer from her before they left Lucerne If she still persisted in refusing to give him her hand it would not be consistent with his dignity as a man to continue his immediate pursuit of her any longer In such case he must leave her and see what future time might bring forth He believed himself to be aware that he would never offer his love to another woman and if Alice were to remain single he might try again after the lapse of a year or two But if he failed now then for that year or two he would see her no more Having so resolved and being averse to anything like a surprise he asked her as he left her one evening whether she would walk with him on the following morning That morning would be the morning of her last day at Lucerne and as she assented she knew well what was to come She said nothing to Lady Glencora on the subject but allowed the coming prospects of the Palliser family to form the sole subject of their conversation that night as it had done on every night since the great news had become known They were always together for an hour every evening before Alice was allowed to go to bed and during this hour the anxieties of the future father and mother were always discussed till Alice Vavasor was almost tired of them But she was patient with her friend and on this special night she was patient as ever But when she was released and was alone she made a great endeavour to come to some fixed resolution as to what she would do on the morrow some resolution which should be absolutely resolute and from which no eloquence on the part of any one should move her But such resolutions are not easily reached and Alice laboured through half the night almost in vain She knew that she loved the man She knew that he was as true to her as the sun is true to the earth She knew that she would be in all respects safe in his hands She knew that Lady Glencora would be delighted and her father gratified She knew that the countesses would open their arms to her though I doubt whether this knowledge was in itself very persuasive She knew that by such a marriage she would gain all that women generally look to gain when they give themselves away But nevertheless as far as she could decide at all she decided against her lover She had no right of her own to be taken back after the evil that she had done and she did not choose to be taken back as an object of pity and forgiveness Where are you going said her cousin when she came in with her hat on soon after breakfast I am going to walk with mister Grey By appointment Yes by appointment He asked me yesterday Then it s all settled and you haven t told me All that is settled I have told you very often He asked me yesterday to walk with him this morning and I could not well refuse him Why should you have wished to refuse him I haven t said that I did wish it But I hate scenes and I think it would have been pleasanter for us to have parted without any occasion for special words Alice you are such a fool So you tell me very often Of course he is now going to say the very thing that he has come all this way for the purpose of saying He has been wonderfully slow about it but then slow as he is you are slower If you don t make it up with him now I really shall think you are very wicked I am becoming like Lady Midlothian I can t understand it I know you want to be his wife and I know he wants to be your husband and the only thing that keeps you apart is your obstinacy just because you have said you wouldn t have him My belief is that if Lady Midlothian and the rest of us were to pat you on the back and tell you how right you were you d ask him to take you out of defiance You may be sure of this Alice if you refuse him now it ll be for the last time This and much more of the same kind she bore before mister Grey came to take her and she answered to it all as little as she could You are making me very unhappy Glencora she said once I wish I could break you down with unhappiness Lady Glencora answered so that he might find you less stiff and hard and unmanageable Directly upon that he came in looking as though he had no business on hand more exciting than his ordinary morning s tranquil employments Alice at once got up to start with him So you and Alice are going to make your adieux said Lady Glencora It must be done sooner or later said mister Grey and then they went off Those who know Lucerne and almost everybody now does know Lucerne will remember the big hotel which has been built close to the landing pier of the steamers and will remember also the church that stands upon a little hill or rising ground to the left of you as you come out of the inn upon the lake The church is immediately over the lake and round the church there is a burying ground and skirting the burying ground there are cloisters through the arches and apertures of which they who walk and sit there look down immediately upon the blue water and across the water upon the frowning menaces of Mount Pilate It is one of the prettiest spots in that land of beauty and its charm is to my feeling enhanced by the sepulchral monuments over which I walk and by which I am surrounded as I stand there Up here into these cloisters Alice and John Grey went together I doubt whether he had formed any purpose of doing so She certainly would have gone without question in any direction that he might have led her The distance from the inn up to the church gate did not take them ten minutes and when they were there their walk was over But the place was solitary and they were alone and it might be as well for mister Grey to speak what words he had to say there as elsewhere They had often been together in those cloisters before but on such occasions either mister Palliser or Lady Glencora had been with them On their slow passage up the hill very little was spoken and that little was of no moment We will go in here for a few minutes he said It is the prettiest spot about Lucerne and we don t know when we may see it again So they went in and sat down on one of the embrasures that open from the cloisters over the lake Probably never again said Alice And yet I have been here now two years running She shuddered as she remembered that in that former year George Vavasor had been with her As she thought of it all she hated herself Over and over again she had told herself that she had so mismanaged the latter years of her life that it was impossible for her not to hate herself No woman had a clearer idea of feminine constancy than she had and no woman had sinned against that idea more deeply He gave her time to think of all this as he sat there looking down upon the water And yet I would sooner live in Cambridgeshire were the first words he spoke Why so Partly because all beauty is best enjoyed when it is sought for with some trouble and difficulty and partly because such beauty and the romance which is attached to it should not make up the staple of one s life Romance if it is to come at all should always come by fits and starts I should like to live in a pretty country And would like to live a romantic life no doubt but all those things lose their charm if they are made common When a man has to go to Vienna or saint Petersburg two or three times a month you don t suppose he enjoys travelling All the same I should like to live in a pretty country said Alice And I want you to come and live in a very ugly country Then he paused for a minute or two not looking at her but gazing still on the mountain opposite She did not speak a word but looked as he was looking She knew that the request was coming and had been thinking about it all night but now that it had come she did not know how to bear herself I don t think he went on to say that you would let that consideration stand in your way if on other grounds you were willing to become my wife What consideration Because Nethercoats is not so pretty as Lucerne It would have nothing to do with it said Alice It should have nothing to do with it Nothing nothing at all repeated Alice Will you come then Will you come and be my wife and help me to be happy amidst all that ugliness Will you come and be my one beautiful thing my treasure my joy my comfort my counsellor You want no counsellor mister Grey No man ever wanted one more Alice this has been a bad year to me and I do not think that it has been a happy one for you Indeed no Let us forget it or rather let us treat it as though it were forgotten Twelve months ago you were mine You were at any rate so much mine that I had a right to boast of my possession among my friends It was a poor boast They did not seem to think so I had but one or two to whom I could speak of you but they told me that I was going to be a happy man As to myself I was sure that I was to be so No man was ever better contented with his bargain than I was with mine Let us go back to it and the last twelve months shall be as though they had never been That cannot be mister Grey If it could I should be worse even than I am Why cannot it be Because I cannot forgive myself what I have done and because you ought not to forgive me But I do There has never been an hour with me in which there has been an offence of yours rankling in my bosom unforgiven I think you have been foolish misguided led away by a vain ambition and that in the difficulty to which these things brought you you endeavoured to constrain yourself to do an act which when it came near to you when the doing of it had to be more closely considered you found to be contrary to your nature Now as he spoke thus she turned her eyes upon him and looked at him wondering that he should have had power to read her heart so accurately I never believed that you would marry your cousin When I was told of it I knew that trouble had blinded you for awhile You had driven yourself to revolt against me and upon that your heart misgave you and you said to yourself that it did not matter then how you might throw away all your sweetness You see that I speak of your old love for me with the frank conceit of a happy lover No no no she ejaculated But the storm passes over the tree and does not tear it up by the roots or spoil it of all its symmetry When we hear the winds blowing and see how the poor thing is shaken we think that its days are numbered and its destruction at hand Alice when the winds were shaking you and you were torn and buffeted I never thought so There may be some who will forgive you slowly Your own self forgiveness will be slow But I who have known you better than any one yes better than any one I have forgiven you everything have forgiven you instantly Come to me Alice and comfort me Come to me for I want you sorely She sat quite still looking at the lake and the mountain beyond but she said nothing What could she say to him My need of you is much greater now he went on to say than when I first asked you to share the world with me Then I could have borne to lose you as I had never boasted to myself that you were my own had never pictured to myself the life that might be mine if you were always to be with me But since that day I have had no other hope no other hope but this for which I plead now Am I to plead in vain You do not know me she said how vile I have been You do not think what it is for a woman to have promised herself to one man while she loved another But it was me you loved Ah Alice I can forgive that Do I not tell you that I did forgive it the moment that I heard it Do you not hear me say that I never for a moment thought that you would marry him Alice you should scold me for my vanity for I have believed all through that you loved me and me only Come to me dear and tell me that it is so and the past shall be only as a dream I am dreaming it always said Alice They will cease to be bitter dreams if your head be upon my shoulder You will cease to reproach yourself when you know that you have made me happy I shall never cease to reproach myself I have done that which no woman can do and honour herself afterwards I have been a jilt The noblest jilt that ever yet halted between two minds There has been no touch of selfishness in your fickleness I think I could be hard enough upon a woman who had left me for greater wealth for a higher rank who had left me even that she might be gay and merry It has not been so with you Yes it has I thought you were too firm in your own will and And you think so still Is that it It does not matter what I think now I am a fallen creature and have no longer a right to such thoughts It will be better for us both that you should leave me and forget me There are things which if a woman does them should never be forgotten which she should never permit herself to forget And am I to be punished then because of your fault Is that your sense of justice He got up and standing before her looked down upon her Alice if you will tell me that you do not love me I will believe you and will trouble you no more I know that you will say nothing to me that is false Through it all you have spoken no word of falsehood If you love me after what has passed I have a right to demand your hand My happiness requires it and I have a right to expect your compliance I do demand it If you love me Alice I tell you that you dare not refuse me If you do so you will fail hereafter to reconcile it to your conscience before God Then he stopped his speech and waited for a reply but Alice sat silent beneath his gaze with her eyes turned upon the tombstones beneath her feet Of course she had no choice but to yield He possessed of power and force infinitely greater than hers had left her no alternative but to be happy But there still clung to her what I fear we must call a perverseness of obstinacy a desire to maintain the resolution she had made a wish that she might be allowed to undergo the punishment she had deserved She was as a prisoner who would fain cling to his prison after pardon has reached him because he is conscious that the pardon is undeserved And it may be that there was still left within her bosom some remnant of that feeling of rebellion which his masterful spirit had ever produced in her He was so imperious in his tranquillity he argued his question of love with such a manifest preponderance of right on his side that she had always felt that to yield to him would be to confess the omnipotence of his power She knew now that she must yield to him that his power over her was omnipotent She was pressed by him as in some countries the prisoner is pressed by the judge so pressed that she acknowledged to herself silently that any further antagonism to him was impossible Nevertheless the word which she had to speak still remained unspoken and he stood over her waiting for her answer Then slowly he sat down beside her and gradually he put his arm round her waist She shrank from him back against the stonework of the embrasure but she could not shrink away from his grasp She put up her hand to impede his but his hand like his character and his words was full of power It would not be impeded Alice he said as he pressed her close with his arm the battle is over now and I have won it You win everything always she said whispering to him as she still shrank from his embrace In winning you I have won everything Then he put his face over her and pressed his lips to hers I wonder whether he was made happier when he knew that no other touch had profaned those lips since last he had pressed them CHAPTER LXXV Rouge et Noir

2100-138911-0002	train-other-500	and was preparing for their departure He was going about the house with a nervous solicitude to do something and was flattering himself that he was of use As he could not be Chancellor of the Exchequer and as
2100-138911-0003	train-other-500	by the nature of his disposition some employment was necessary to him he was looking to the cording of the boxes Good morning good morning he said to Grey hardly looking at him as though time were too precious with him to allow of his turning his eyes upon his friend
none	none	 I am going up to the station to see after a carriage for to morrow 
2100-138911-0004	train-other-500	Perhaps you ll come with me To this proposition mister Grey assented Sometimes you know continued mister Palliser the springs of the carriages are so very rough Then in a very few words
2100-138911-0005	train-other-500	mister Grey told him what had been his own morning s work He hated secrets and secrecy and as the Pallisers knew well what had brought him upon their track it was he thought well that they should know that he had been successful
2100-138911-0006	train-other-500	mister Palliser congratulated him very cordially and then running up stairs for his gloves or his stick or more probably that he might give his wife one other caution as to her care of herself
2100-138911-0007	train-other-500	he told her also that Alice had yielded at last Of course she has said Lady Glencora I really didn t think she would said he That s because you don t understand things of that sort said his wife
2100-138911-0008	train-other-500	Then the caution was repeated the mother of the future duke was kissed and mister Palliser went off on his mission about the carriage its cushions and its springs In the course of their walk mister Palliser suggested that
2100-138911-0009	train-other-500	as things were settled so pleasantly mister Grey might as well return with them to England and to this suggestion mister Grey assented Alice remained alone for nearly an hour
none	none	 looking out upon the rough sides and gloomy top of Mount Pilate 
2100-138911-0010	train-other-500	No one disturbed her in the churchyard no steps were heard along the tombstones no voice sounded through the cloisters She was left in perfect solitude to think of the past and form her plans of the future Was she happy
2100-138911-0011	train-other-500	now that the manner of her life to come was thus settled for her that all further question as to the disposal of herself was taken out of her hands and that her marriage with a man she loved was so firmly arranged that no further folly of her own could disarrange it
2100-138911-0012	train-other-500	She was happy though she was slow to confess her happiness to herself She was happy and she was resolute in this that she would now do all she could to make him happy also And there must now she acknowledged
2100-138911-0013	train-other-500	be an end to her pride to that pride which had hitherto taught her to think that she could more wisely follow her own guidance than that of any other who might claim to guide her She knew now that she must follow his guidance
2100-138911-0014	train-other-500	She had found her master as we sometimes say and laughed to herself with a little inward laughter as she confessed that it was so She was from henceforth altogether in his hands
2100-138911-0015	train-other-500	If he chose to tell her that they were to be married at Michaelmas or at Christmas or on Lady Day they would of course be married accordingly She had taken her fling at having her own will
2100-138911-0016	train-other-500	and she and all her friends had seen what had come of it She had assumed the command of the ship and had thrown it upon the rocks and she felt that she never ought to take the captain s place again
2100-138911-0017	train-other-500	It was well for her that he who was to be captain was one whom she respected as thoroughly as she loved him She would write to her father at once to her father and Lady Macleod and would confess everything
2100-138911-0018	train-other-500	She felt that she owed it to them that they should be told by herself that they had been right and that she had been wrong Hitherto she had not mentioned to either of them the fact that mister Grey was with them in Switzerland And then
2100-138911-0019	train-other-500	what must she do as to Lady Midlothian As to Lady Midlothian she would do nothing Lady Midlothian of course would triumph would jump upon her as Lady Glencora had once expressed it
2100-138911-0020	train-other-500	with very triumphant heels would try to patronize her or which would be almost worse would make a parade of her forgiveness But she would have nothing to do with Lady Midlothian unless indeed
2100-138911-0021	train-other-500	mister Grey should order it Then she laughed at herself again with that inward laughter and rising from her seat proceeded to walk down the hill to the hotel Vanquished at last said Lady Glencora as Alice entered the room
2100-138911-0022	train-other-500	Yes vanquished if you like to call it so said Alice It is not what I call it but what you feel it said the other Do you think that I don t know you well enough to be sure that you regard yourself now
2100-138911-0023	train-other-500	as an unfortunate prisoner as a captive taken in war to be led away in triumph without any hope of a ransom I know that it is quite a misery to you that you should be made a happy woman of at last
none	none	 I understand it all my dear and my heart bleeds for you 
2100-138911-0024	train-other-500	Of course I knew that was the way you would treat me In what way would you have me treat you If I were to hug you with joy and tell you how good he is and how fortunate you are if I were to praise him
2100-138911-0025	train-other-500	and bid you triumph in your success as might be expected on such an occasion you would put on a long face at once and tell me that though the thing is to be
none	none	 it would be much better that the thing shouldn t be 
2100-138911-0026	train-other-500	Don t I know you Alice I shouldn t have said that not now I believe in my heart you would that or something like it But I do wish you joy all the same and you may say what you please
none	none	 He has got you in his power now and I don t think even you can go back 
2100-138911-0027	train-other-500	No I shall not go back again I would join with Lady Midlothian in putting you into a madhouse if you did But I am so glad I am indeed I was afraid to the last terribly afraid
2100-138911-0028	train-other-500	you are so hard and so proud I don t mean hard to me dear
none	none	 You have never been half hard enough to me 
2100-138911-0029	train-other-500	But you are hard to yourself and upon my word you have been hard to him What a deal you will have to make up to him I feel that I ought to stand before him always as a penitent in a white sheet
2100-138911-0030	train-other-500	He will like it better I dare say if you will sit upon his knee Some penitents do you know And how happy you will be He ll never explain the sugar duties to you and there ll be no mister Bott at Nethercoats
2100-138911-0031	train-other-500	They sat together the whole morning while mister Palliser was seeing to the springs and cushions
none	none	 and by degrees Alice began to enjoy her happiness 
2100-138911-0032	train-other-500	As she did so her friend enjoyed it with her and at last they had something of the comfort and excitement which such an occasion should give I ll tell you what Alice you shall come and be married at Matching in August or perhaps September
2100-138911-0033	train-other-500	That s the only way in which I can be present and if we can bespeak some sun we ll have the breakfast out in the ruins On the following morning they all started together a first class compartment having been taken for the Palliser family
2100-138911-0034	train-other-500	and a second class compartment close to them for the Palliser servants mister Palliser as he slowly handed his wife in was a triumphant man as was also mister Grey as he handed in his lady love
2100-138911-0035	train-other-500	though in a manner much less manifest We may say that both the gentlemen had been very fortunate while at Lucerne mister Palliser had come abroad with a feeling that all the world had been cut from under his feet
2100-138911-0036	train-other-500	A great change was needed for his wife and he had acknowledged at once that everything must be made to yield to that necessity He certainly had his reward now in his triumphant return
2100-138911-0037	train-other-500	Terrible troubles had afflicted him as he went which seemed now to have dissipated themselves altogether When he thought of Burgo Fitzgerald he remembered him only as a poor unfortunate fellow
2100-138911-0038	train-other-500	for whom he should be glad to do something if the doing of anything were only in his power and he had in his pocket a letter which he had that morning received from the Duke of saint Bungay marked private and confidential
2100-138911-0039	train-other-500	which was in its nature very private and confidential and in which he was told that Lord Brock and mister Finespun were totally at variance about French wines mister Finespun wanted to do something now in the recess
2100-138911-0040	train-other-500	to send some political agent over to France to which Lord Brock would not agree and no one knew what would be the consequence of this disagreement Here might be another chance if only mister Palliser could give up his winter in Italy
2100-138911-0041	train-other-500	mister Palliser as he took his place opposite his wife was very triumphant And mister Grey was triumphant as he placed himself gently in his seat opposite to Alice
2100-138911-0042	train-other-500	He seemed to assume no right as he took that position apparently because it was the one which came naturally to his lot
none	none	 No one would have been made aware that Alice was his own 
2100-138911-0043	train-other-500	simply by seeing his arrangements for her comfort He made no loud assertion as to his property and his rights as some men do He was quiet and subdued in his joy but not the less was he triumphant
2100-138911-0044	train-other-500	From the day on which Alice had accepted his first offer nay from an earlier day than that from the day on which he had first resolved to make it down to the present hour he had never been stirred from his purpose
2100-138911-0045	train-other-500	By every word that he had said and by every act that he had done he had shown himself to be unmoved by that episode in their joint lives which Alice s other friends had regarded as so fatal
2100-138911-0046	train-other-500	When she first rejected him he would not take his rejection When she told him that she intended to marry her cousin he silently declined to believe that such marriage would ever take place He had never given her up for a day
2100-138911-0047	train-other-500	and now the event proved that he had been right
none	none	 Alice was happy very happy but she was still disposed to regard her lover as Fate and her happiness as an enforced necessity They stopped a night at Basle and again she stood upon the balcony 
2100-138911-0048	train-other-500	He was close to her as she stood there so close that putting out her hand for his she was able to take it and press it closely You are thinking of something Alice he said What is it It was here
2100-138911-0049	train-other-500	she said here on this very balcony that I first rebelled against you
none	none	 and now you have brought me here that I should confess and submit on the same spot I do confess How am I to thank you for forgiving me Illustration How am I to thank you for forgiving me On the following morning they went on to Baden Baden and there they stopped for a couple of days Lady Glencora had positively refused to stop a day at Basle making so many objections to the place that her husband had at last yielded 
2100-138911-0050	train-other-500	I could go from Vienna to London without feeling it she said with indignation
none	none	 and to tell me that I can t do two easy days journey running 
2100-138911-0051	train-other-500	mister Palliser had been afraid to be imperious and therefore immediately on his arrival at one of the stations in Basle he had posted across the town in the heat and the dust
none	none	 to look after the cushions and the springs at the other 
2100-138911-0052	train-other-500	I ve a particular favour to ask of you Lady Glencora said to her husband as soon as they were alone together
none	none	 in their rooms at Baden 
2100-138911-0053	train-other-500	mister Palliser declared that he would grant her any particular favour only premising that he was not to be supposed to have thereby committed himself to any engagement under which his wife should have authority to take any exertion upon herself
2100-138911-0054	train-other-500	I wish I were a milkmaid said Lady Glencora But you are not a milkmaid my dear You haven t been brought up like a milkmaid But what was the favour If she would only ask for jewels
2100-138911-0055	train-other-500	though they were the Grand Duchess s diamond eardrops he would endeavour to get them for her If she would have quaffed molten pearls like Cleopatra he would have procured the beverage
2100-138911-0056	train-other-500	having first fortified himself with a medical opinion as to the fitness of the drink for a lady in her condition There was no expenditure that he would not willingly incur for her nothing costly that he would grudge
2100-138911-0057	train-other-500	But when she asked for a favour he was always afraid of an imprudence
none	none	 Very possibly she might want to drink beer in an open garden 
2100-138911-0058	train-other-500	And her request was at last of this nature I want you to take me up to the gambling rooms
none	none	 said she The gambling rooms 
2100-138911-0059	train-other-500	said mister Palliser in dismay Yes Plantagenet the gambling rooms If you had been with me before I should not have made a fool of myself by putting my piece of money on the table I want to see the place but then I saw nothing
2100-138911-0060	train-other-500	because I was so frightened when I found that I was winning mister Palliser was aware that all the world of Baden or rather the world of the strangers at Baden assembles itself in those salons
2100-138911-0061	train-other-500	It may be also that he himself was curious to see how men looked when they lost their own money or won that of others He knew how a Minister looked when he lost or gained a tax
2100-138911-0062	train-other-500	He was familiar with millions and tens of millions in a committee of the whole House He knew the excitement of a near division upon the estimates But he had never yet seen a poor man stake his last napoleon
2100-138911-0063	train-other-500	and rake back from off the table a small hatful of gold A little exercise after an early dinner was he had been told good for his wife and he agreed therefore that on their second evening at Baden
2100-138911-0064	train-other-500	they would all walk up and see the play Perhaps I shall get back my napoleon said Glencora to Alice And perhaps I shall be forgiven when somebody sees how difficult it is to manage you said Alice looking at mister Palliser
2100-138911-0065	train-other-500	She isn t in earnest said mister Palliser almost fearing the result of the experiment I don t know that said Lady Glencora They started together mister Palliser with his wife
2100-138911-0066	train-other-500	and mister Grey with Alice on his arm and found all the tables at work They at first walked through the different rooms whispering to each other their comments on the people that they saw
2100-138911-0067	train-other-500	and listening to the quick low monotonous words of the croupiers as they arranged and presided over the games Each table was closely surrounded by its own crowd made up of players embryo players and simple lookers on
none	none	 so that they could not see much as they walked 
2100-138911-0068	train-other-500	But this was not enough for Lady Glencora She was anxious to know what these men and women were doing to see whether the croupiers wore horns on their heads and were devils indeed
none	none	 to behold the faces of those who were wretched 
2100-138911-0069	train-other-500	and of those who were triumphant to know how the thing was done and to learn something of that lesson in life Let us stand here a moment she said to her husband arresting him at one corner of the table which had the greatest crowd
2100-138911-0070	train-other-500	We shall be able to see in a few minutes So he stood with her there giving way to Alice who went in front with his wife and in a minute or two an aperture was made so that they could all see the marked cloth and the money lying about
2100-138911-0071	train-other-500	and the rakes on the table and the croupier skilfully dealing his cards and more interesting than all the rest the faces of those who were playing Grey looked on over Alice s shoulder very attentively
none	none	 as did Palliser also 
2100-138911-0072	train-other-500	but both of them kept their eyes upon the ministers of the work Alice and Glencora did the same at first but as they gained courage they glanced round upon the gamblers It was a long table having of course
2100-138911-0073	train-other-500	four corners and at the corner appropriated by them they were partly opposite to the man who dealt the cards The corner answering to theirs at the other end was the part of the table most removed from their sight
2100-138911-0074	train-other-500	and that on which their eyes fell last As Lady Glencora stood she could hardly see indeed at first she could not see
none	none	 one or two who were congregated at this spot 
2100-138911-0075	train-other-500	mister Palliser who was behind her could not see them at all But to Alice and to mister Grey had he cared about it every face at the table was visible except the faces of those who were immediately close to them
2100-138911-0076	train-other-500	Before long Alice s attention was riveted on the action and countenance of one young man who sat at that other corner He was leaning at first listlessly over the table dressed in a velveteen jacket
2100-138911-0077	train-other-500	and with his round topped hat brought far over his eyes so that she could not fully see his face But she had hardly begun to observe him before he threw back his hat and taking some pieces of gold from under his left hand
2100-138911-0078	train-other-500	which lay upon the table pushed three or four of them on to one of the divisions marked on the cloth He seemed to show no care as others did as to the special spot which they should occupy Many were very particular in this respect
2100-138911-0079	train-other-500	placing their ventures on the lines so as to share the fortunes of two compartments or sometimes of four or they divided their coins taking three or four numbers selecting the numbers with almost grotesque attention to some imagined rule of their own
2100-138911-0080	train-other-500	But this man let his gold go all together and left it where his half stretched rake deposited it by chance Alice could not but look at his face His eyes she could see were bloodshot and his hair
2100-138911-0081	train-other-500	when he pushed back his hat was rough and dishevelled but still there was that in his face which no woman could see and not regard It was a face which at once prepossessed her in his favour as it had always prepossessed all others
2100-138911-0082	train-other-500	On this occasion he had won his money and Alice saw him drag it in as lazily as he had pushed it out Do you see that little Frenchman said Lady Glencora He has just made half a napoleon and has walked off with it Isn t it interesting
2100-138911-0083	train-other-500	I could stay here all the night Then she turned round to whisper something to her husband and Alice s eyes again fell on the face of the man at the other end of the table After he had won his money he had allowed the game to go on for a turn
2100-138911-0084	train-other-500	without any action on his part The gold again went under his hand and he lounged forward with his hat over his eyes One of the croupiers had said a word as though calling his attention to the game but he had merely shaken his head
2100-138911-0085	train-other-500	But when the fate of the next turn had been decided he again roused himself and on this occasion as far as Alice could see pushed his whole stock forward with the rake There was a little mass of gold and from his manner of placing it
2100-138911-0086	train-other-500	all might see that he left its position to chance One piece had got beyond its boundary and the croupier pushed it back with some half expressed inquiry as to his correctness All right
none	none	 said a voice in English 
2100-138911-0087	train-other-500	Then Lady Glencora started and clutched Alice s arm with her hand mister Palliser was explaining to mister Grey behind them something about German finance as connected with gambling tables and did not hear the voice or see his wife s motion
2100-138911-0088	train-other-500	I need hardly tell the reader that the gambler was Burgo Fitzgerald But Lady Glencora said not a word not as yet She looked forward very gently but still with eager eyes
2100-138911-0089	train-other-500	till she could just see the face she knew so well His hat was now pushed back and his countenance had lost its listlessness He watched narrowly the face of the man as he told out the amount of the cards as they were dealt
2100-138911-0090	train-other-500	He did not try to hide his anxiety and when after the telling of some six or seven cards he heard a certain number named and a certain colour called he made some exclamation which even Glencora could not hear
2100-138911-0091	train-other-500	And then another croupier put down close to Burgo s money certain rolls of gold done up in paper and also certain loose napoleons Why doesn t he take it said Lady Glencora He is taking it said Alice
2100-138911-0092	train-other-500	not at all knowing the cause of her cousin s anxiety Burgo had paused a moment and then prepared to rake the money to him but as he did so he changed his mind and pushed it all back again now on this occasion
2100-138911-0093	train-other-500	being very careful to place it on its former spot Both Alice and Glencora could see that a man at his elbow was dissuading him had even attempted to stop the arm which held the rake
2100-138911-0094	train-other-500	But Burgo shook him off speaking to him some word roughly and then again he steadied the rolls upon their appointed place The croupier who had paused for a moment now went on quickly with his cards
2100-138911-0095	train-other-500	and in two minutes the fate of Burgo s wealth was decided It was all drawn back by the croupier s unimpassioned rake and the rolls of gold were restored to the tray from whence they had been taken
2100-138911-0096	train-other-500	Burgo looked up and smiled at them all round the table By this time most of those who stood around were looking at him He was a man who gathered eyes upon him wherever he might be
none	none	 or whatever he was doing and it had been clear that he was very intent upon his fortune 
2100-138911-0097	train-other-500	and on the last occasion the amount staked had been considerable He knew that men and women were looking at him and therefore he smiled faintly as he turned his eyes round the table Then he got up and putting his hands in his trousers pockets
2100-138911-0098	train-other-500	whistled as he walked away His companion followed him and laid a hand upon his shoulder but Burgo shook him off and would not turn round He shook him off and walked on whistling the length of the whole salon
2100-138911-0099	train-other-500	Alice said Lady Glencora it is Burgo Fitzgerald mister Palliser had gone so deep into that question of German finance that he had not at all noticed the gambler Alice what can we do for him
2100-138911-0100	train-other-500	It is Burgo said Lady Glencora Many eyes were now watching him Used as he was to the world and to misfortune he was not successful in his attempt to bear his loss with a show of indifference
2100-138911-0101	train-other-500	The motion of his head the position of his hands the tone of his whistling all told the tale Even the unimpassioned croupiers furtively cast an eye after him
2100-138911-0102	train-other-500	and a very big Guard in a cocked hat and uniform and sword who hitherto had hardly been awake seemed evidently to be interested by his movements If there is to be a tragedy at these places and tragedies will sometimes occur
2100-138911-0103	train-other-500	it is always as well that the tragic scene should be as far removed as possible from the salons in order that the public eye should not suffer Lady Glencora and Alice had left their places and had shrunk back almost behind a pillar
2100-138911-0104	train-other-500	Is it he in truth Alice asked In very truth said Glencora What can I do Can I do anything Look at him Alice
none	none	 If he were to destroy himself what should I do then 
2100-138911-0105	train-other-500	Burgo conscious that he was the regarded of all eyes turned round upon his heel and again walked the length of the salon He knew well that he had not a franc left in his possession
none	none	 but still he laughed and still he whistled 
2100-138911-0106	train-other-500	His companion whoever he might be had slunk away from him not caring to share the notoriety which now attended him What shall I do Alice said Lady Glencora with her eyes still fixed on him who had been her lover
2100-138911-0107	train-other-500	Tell mister Palliser whispered Alice
none	none	 Lady Glencora immediately ran up to her husband 
2100-138911-0108	train-other-500	and took him away from mister Grey Rapidly she told her story with such rapidity that mister Palliser could hardly get in a word Do something for him do do Unless I know that something is done I shall die You needn t be afraid
2100-138911-0109	train-other-500	I m not afraid said mister Palliser Lady Glencora as she went on quickly got hold of her husband s hand and caressed it You are so good said she
none	none	 Don t let him out of your sight There he is going 
2100-138911-0110	train-other-500	I will go home with mister Grey I will be ever so good I will indeed You know what he ll want and for my sake you ll let him have it But don t let him gamble If you could only get him home to England and then do something
2100-138911-0111	train-other-500	You owe him something Plantagenet do you not If money can do anything he shall have it God bless you dearest I shall never see him again but if you could save him
none	none	 There he is going now 
2100-138911-0112	train-other-500	Go go She pushed him forward and then retreating put her arm within mister Grey s still keeping her eye upon her husband Burgo when he first got to the door leading out of the salon had paused a moment and turning round
2100-138911-0113	train-other-500	had encountered the big gendarme close to him Well old Buffer what do you want said he accosting the man in English The big gendarme simply walked on through the door and said nothing Then Burgo also passed out
2100-138911-0114	train-other-500	and mister Palliser quickly went after him They were now in the large front salon from whence the chief door of the building opened out upon the steps Through this door Burgo went without pausing and mister Palliser went after him
2100-138911-0115	train-other-500	They both walked to the end of the row of buildings and then Burgo leaving the broad way turned into a little path which led up through the trees to the hills That hillside among the trees is a popular resort at Baden during the day
2100-138911-0116	train-other-500	but now at nine in the evening it was deserted Palliser did not press on the other man but followed him and did not accost Burgo till he had thrown himself on the grass beneath a tree
none	none	 You are in trouble I fear mister Fitzgerald said mister Palliser as soon as he was close at Burgo s feet 
2100-138911-0117	train-other-500	We will go home mister Palliser has something to do said Lady Glencora to mister Grey as soon as the two men had disappeared from her sight Is that a friend of mister Palliser said mister Grey Yes
2100-138911-0118	train-other-500	that is he knows him and is interested about him
none	none	 Alice shall we go home 
2100-138911-0119	train-other-500	Oh mister Grey you must not ask any questions He mister Palliser will tell you everything when he sees you that is if there is anything to be told Then they all went home and soon separated for the night
2100-138911-0120	train-other-500	Of course I shall sit up for him said Lady Glencora to Alice but I will do it in my own room You can tell mister Grey if you like But Alice told nothing to mister Grey
none	none	 nor did mister Grey ask any questions CHAPTER LXXVI The Landlord s Bill You are in trouble mister Fitzgerald I fear said mister Palliser standing over Burgo as he lay upon the ground They were now altogether beyond the gas lights and the evening was dark Burgo too was lying with his face to the ground expecting that the footsteps which he had heard would pass by him Who is that said he turning round suddenly but still he was not at once able to recognize mister Palliser whose voice was hardly known to him Perhaps I have been wrong in following you said mister Palliser but I thought you were in distress and that probably I might help you My name is Palliser Plantagenet Palliser said Burgo jumping up on to his legs and looking close into the other s face By heavens it is Plantagenet Palliser Well mister Palliser what do you want of me I want to be of some use to you if I can I and my wife saw you leave the gaming table just now Is she here too Yes she is here We are going home but chance brought us up to the salon She seemed to think that you are in distress and that I could help you I will if you will let me mister Palliser during the whole interview felt that he could afford to be generous He knew that he had no further cause for fear He had no lingering dread of this poor creature who stood before him All that feeling was over though it was as yet hardly four months since he had been sent back by missus Marsham to Lady Monk s house to save his wife if saving her were yet possible So she is here is she and saw me there when I staked my last chance I should have had over twenty thousand francs now if the cards had stood to me The cards never do stand to any one mister Fitzgerald Never never never said Burgo At any rate they never did to me Nothing ever does stand to me If you want twenty thousand francs that s eight hundred pounds I think I can let you have it without any trouble The devil you can Oh yes As I am travelling with my family I wonder whether mister Palliser considered himself to be better entitled to talk of his family than he had been some three or four weeks back As I am travelling with my family I have been obliged to carry large bills with me and I can accommodate you without any trouble There was something pleasant in this which made Burgo Fitzgerald laugh mister Palliser the husband of Lady Glencora M Cluskie and the heir of the Duke of Omnium happening to have money with him As if mister Palliser could not bring down showers of money in any quarter of the globe by simply holding up his hand And then to talk of accommodating him Burgo Fitzgerald as though it were simply a little matter of convenience as though mister Palliser would of course find the money at his bankers when he next examined his book Burgo could not but laugh I was not in the least doubting your ability to raise the money said he but how would you propose to get it back again That would be at your convenience said mister Palliser who hardly knew how to put himself on a proper footing with his companion so that he might offer to do something effectual for the man s aid I never have any such convenience said Burgo Who were those women whose tubs always had holes at the bottom of them My tub always has such a hole You mean the daughters of Danaus said mister Palliser I don t know whose daughters they were but you might just as well lend them all eight hundred pounds apiece There were so many of them said mister Palliser trying a little joke But as you are only one I shall be most happy as I said before to be of service They were now walking slowly together up towards the hills and near to them they heard a step Upon this Burgo turned round Do you see that fellow said he mister Palliser who was somewhat short sighted said that he did not see him I do though I don t know his name but they have sent him out from the hotel with me to see what I do with myself I owe them six or seven hundred francs and they want to turn me out of the house and not let me take my things with me That would be very uncomfortable said mister Palliser It would be uncomfortable but I shall be too many for them If they keep my traps they shall keep me They think I m going to blow my brains out That s what they think The man lets me go far enough off to do that so long as it s nowhere about the house I hope you re not thinking of such a thing As long as I can help it mister Palliser I never think of anything The stranger was now standing near to them almost so near that he might hear their words Burgo perceiving this walked up to him and speaking in bad French desired him to leave them Don t you see that I have a friend with me Oh a friend said the man answering in bad English Perhaps de friend can advance moneys Never mind what he can do said Burgo You do as you are bid and leave me Then the gentleman from the hotel retreated down the hill but mister Palliser during the rest of the interview frequently fancied that he heard the man s footfall at no great distance They continued to walk on up the hill very slowly and it was some time before mister Palliser knew how to repeat his offer So Lady Glencora is here Burgo said again Yes she is here It was she who asked me to come to you mister Palliser answered Then they both walked on a few steps in silence for neither of them knew how to address the other By George isn t it odd said Burgo at last that you and I of all men in the world should be walking together here at Baden It s not only that you re the richest man in London and that I m the poorest but there are other things you know which make it so funny There have been things which make me and my wife very anxious to give you aid And have you considered mister Palliser that those things make you the very man in the world indeed for the matter of that the only man in the world from whom I can t take aid I would have taken it all if I could have got it and I tried hard I know you have been disappointed mister Fitzgerald Disappointed By G yes Did you ever know any man who had so much right to be disappointed as I have I did love her mister Palliser Nay by heavens I do love her Out here I will dare to say as much even to you I shall never try to see her again All that is over of course I ve been a fool about her as I have been about everything But I did love her I believe it mister Fitzgerald It was not altogether her money But think what it would have been to me mister Palliser Think what a chance I had and what a chance I lost I should have been at the top of everything as now I am at the bottom I should not have spent that There would have been enough of it to have saved me And then I might have done something good instead of crawling about almost in fear of that beast who is watching us It has been ordered otherwise said mister Palliser not knowing what to say Yes it has been ordered with a vengeance It seems to have been ordered that I m to go to the devil but I don t know who gave the orders and I don t know why mister Palliser had not time to explain to his friend that the orders had been given in a very peremptory way by himself as he was anxious to bring back the conversation to his own point He wished to give some serviceable and if possible permanent aid to the poor ne er do well but he did not wish to talk more than could be helped about his own wife There is an old saying which you will remember well said he that the way to good manners is never too late That s nonsense said Burgo It s too late when the man feels the knot round his neck at the Old Bailey Perhaps not even then Indeed we may say certainly not if the man be still able to take the right way But I don t want to preach to you It wouldn t do any good you know But I do want to be of service to you There is something of truth in what you say You have been disappointed and I perhaps of all men am the most bound to come to your assistance now that you are in need How can I take it from you said Burgo almost crying You shall take it from her No that would be worse twenty times worse What take her money when she would not give me herself I do not see why you should not borrow her money or mine You shall call it which you will No I won t have it And what will you do then What will I do Ah That s the question I don t know what I will do I have the key of my bedroom in my pocket and I will go to bed to night It s not very often that I look forward much beyond that Will you let me call on you to morrow I don t see what good it will do I shan t get up till late for fear they should shut the room against me I might as well have as much out of them as I can I think I shall say I m ill and keep my bed Will you take a few napoleons No not a rap Not from you You are the first man from whom I ever refused to borrow money and I should say that you ll be about the last to offer to lend it me I don t know what else I can offer said mister Palliser You can offer nothing If you will say to your wife from me that I bade her adieu that is all you can do for me Good night mister Palliser good night Illustration Good night mister Palliser mister Palliser left him and went his way feeling that he had no further eloquence at his command He shook Burgo s hand and then walked quickly down the hill As he did so he passed or would have passed the man who had been dodging them Misther Misther said the man in a whisper What do you want of me asked mister Palliser in French Then the man spoke in French also Has he got any money Have you given him any money I have not given him any money said mister Palliser not quite knowing what he had better do or say under such circumstances Then he will have a bad time with it said the man And he might have carried away two thousand francs just now Dear dear dear Has he got any friends sir Yes he has friends I do not know that I can assist him or you Fitzgerald his name is Fitzgerald Yes said mister Palliser his name is Fitzgerald Ah There are so many Fitzgeralds in England mister Fitzgerald London he has no other address If he had and I knew it I should not give it you without his sanction But what shall we do How shall we act Perhaps with his own hand he will himself kill For five weeks his pension he owes yes for five weeks And for wine oh so much There came through Baden a my lord and then I think he got money But he went and played That was of course But oh my G he might have carried away this night two thousand francs yes two thousand francs Are you the hotelkeeper His friend sir only his friend That is I am the head Commissionaire I look after the gentlemen who sometimes are not all not all exactly what they should be the commissioner intended to explain and mister Palliser understood him although the words were not quite spoken The interview was ended by mister Palliser taking the name of the hotel and promising to call before mister Fitzgerald should be up in the morning a purposed visit which we need not regard as requiring any very early energy on mister Palliser s part when we remember Burgo s own programme for the following day Lady Glencora received her husband that night with infinite anxiety and was by no means satisfied with what had been done He described to her as accurately as he could the nature of his interview with Burgo and he described to her also his other interview with the head commissioner He will he will said Lady Glencora when she heard from her husband the man s surmise that perhaps he might destroy himself He will he will and if he does how can you expect that I shall bear it mister Palliser tried to soothe her by telling her of his promised visit to the landlord and Lady Glencora accepting this as something strove to instigate her husband to some lavish expenditure on Burgo s behalf There can be no reason why he should not take it said Glencora None the least Had it not been promised to him Had he not a right to it The subject was one which mister Palliser found it very hard to discuss He could not tell his wife that Fitzgerald ought to accept his bounty but he assured her that his money should be forthcoming almost to any extent if it could be made available On the following morning he went down to the hotel and saw the real landlord He found him to be a reasonable tranquil and very good natured man who was possessed by a not irrational desire that his customers bills should be paid but who seemed to be much less eager on the subject than are English landlords in general His chief anxiety seemed to arise from the great difficulty of doing anything with the gentleman who was now lying in his bed up stairs Has he had any breakfast mister Palliser asked Breakfast Oh yes and the landlord laughed He had been very particular in the orders he had given He had desired his cutlets to be dressed in a particular way with a great deal of cayenne pepper and they had been so dressed He had ordered a bottle of Sauterne but the landlord had thought or the head waiter acting for him had thought that a bottle of ordinary wine of the country would do as well The bottle of ordinary wine of the country had just that moment been sent up stairs Then mister Palliser sat down in the landlord s little room and had Burgo Fitzgerald s bill brought to him I think I might venture to pay it said mister Palliser That was as monsieur pleased said the landlord with something like a sparkle in his eye What was mister Palliser to do He did not know whether in accordance with the rules of the world in which he lived he ought to pay it or ought to leave it and certainly the landlord could not tell him Then he thought of his wife He could not go back to his wife without having done something so as a first measure he paid the bill The landlord s eyes glittered and he receipted it in the most becoming manner Should he now send up the bottle of Sauterne but to this mister Palliser demurred And to whom should the receipted bill be given mister Palliser thought that the landlord had better keep it himself for a while Perhaps there is some little difficulty suggested the landlord mister Palliser acknowledged that there was a little difficulty He knew that he must do something more He could not simply pay the bill and go away That would not satisfy his wife He knew that he must do something more but how was he to do it So at last he let the landlord into his confidence He did not tell the whole of Burgo s past history He did not tell that little episode in Burgo s life which referred to Lady Glencora But he did make the landlord understand that he was willing to administer money to mister Fitzgerald if only it could only be administered judiciously You can t keep him out of the gambling salon you know sir that is not if he has a franc in his pocket As to that the landlord was very confident It was at last arranged that the landlord was to tell Burgo that his bill did not signify at present and that the use of the hotel was to be at Burgo s command for the next three months At the end of that time he was to have notice to quit No money was to be advanced to him but the landlord even in this respect had a discretion When I get home I will see what can be done with his relations there said mister Palliser Then he went home and told his wife But he ll have no clothes said Lady Glencora mister Palliser said that the judicious landlord would manage that also and in that way Lady Glencora was appeased appeased till something final could be done for the young man on mister Palliser s return home Poor Burgo He must now be made to end his career as far as these pages are concerned He soon found that something had been done for him at the hotel and no doubt he must have made some guess near the truth The discreet landlord told him nothing would tell him nothing but that his bill did not signify as yet Burgo thinking about it resolved to write about it in an indignant strain to mister Palliser but the letter did not get itself written When in England mister Palliser saw Sir Cosmo Monk and with many apologies told him what he had done I regret it said Sir Cosmo in anger I regret it not for the money s sake but I regret it The amount expended was however repaid to mister Palliser and an arrangement was made for remitting a weekly sum of fifteen pounds to Burgo through a member of the diplomatic corps as long as he should remain at a certain small German town which was indicated and in which there was no public gambling table Lady Glencora expressed herself satisfied for the present but I must doubt whether poor Burgo lived long in comfort on the allowance made to him Here we must say farewell to Burgo Fitzgerald CHAPTER LXXVII The Travellers Return Home mister Palliser did not remain long in Baden after the payment of Burgo s bill Perhaps I shall not throw any undeserved discredit on his courage if I say that he was afraid to do so What would he have said what would he have been able to say if that young man had come to him demanding an explanation So he hurried away to Strasbourg the same day much to his wife s satisfaction The journey home from thence was not marked by any incidents Gradually mister Palliser became a little more lenient to his wife and slightly less oppressive in his caution If he still inquired about the springs of the carriages he did so in silence and he ceased to enjoin the necessity of a day s rest after each day s journey By the time that they reached Dover he had become so used to his wife s condition that he made but little fluttering as she walked out of the boat by that narrow gangway which is so contrived as to make an arrival there a serious inconvenience to a lady and a nuisance even to a man He was somewhat staggered when a big man in the middle of the night insisted on opening the little basket which his wife carried and was uncomfortable when obliged to stop her on the plank while he gave up the tickets which he thought had been already surrendered but he was becoming used to his position and bore himself like a man During their journey home mister Palliser had by no means kept his seat opposite to Lady Glencora with constancy He had soon found that it was easier to talk to mister Grey than to his wife and consequently the two ladies had been much together as had also the two gentlemen What the ladies discussed may be imagined One was about to become a wife and the other a mother and that was to be their fate after each had made up her mind that no such lot was to be hers It may however be presumed that for every one word that Alice spoke Lady Glencora spoke ten The two men throughout these days of close intimacy were intent upon politics mister Palliser who may be regarded as the fox who had lost his tail the tail being in this instance the comfort of domestic privacy was eager in recommending his new friend to cut off his tail also Your argument would be very well said he if men were to be contented to live for themselves only Your argument would be very well said the other if it were used to a man who felt that he could do good to others by going into public life But it is wholly inefficacious if it recommends public life simply or chiefly because a man may gratify his own ambition by public services Of course there is personal gratification and of course there is good done said mister Palliser Is or should be said mister Grey Exactly and the two things must go together The chief gratification comes from the feeling that you are of use But if you feel that you would not be of use We need not follow the argument any further We all know its nature and what between two such men would be said on both sides We all know that neither of them would put the matter altogether in a true light Men never can do so in words let the light within themselves be ever so clear I do not think that any man yet ever had such a gift of words as to make them a perfect exponent of all the wisdom within him But the effect was partly that which the weaker man of the two desired the weaker in the gifts of nature though art had in some respects made him stronger mister Grey was shaken in his quiescent philosophy and startled Alice startled her as much as he delighted her by a word or two he said as he walked with her in the courts of the Louvre It s all hollow here he said speaking of French politics Very hollow said Alice who had no love for the French mode of carrying on public affairs Of all modes of governing this seems to me to be the surest of coming to a downfall Men are told that they are wise enough to talk but not wise enough to have any power of action It is as though men were cautioned that they were walking through gunpowder and that no fire could be allowed them but were at the same time enjoined to carry lucifer matches in their pockets I don t believe in the gunpowder and I think there should be fire and plenty of it but if I didn t want the fire I wouldn t have the matches It s so odd to hear you talk politics said Alice laughing After this he dropped the subject for a while as though he were ashamed of it but in a very few minutes he returned to it manfully mister Palliser wants me to go into Parliament Upon hearing this Alice said nothing She was afraid to speak After all that had passed she felt that it would not become her to show much outward joy on hearing such a proposition so spoken by him and yet she could say nothing without some sign of exultation in her voice So she walked on without speaking and was conscious that her fingers trembled on his arm What do you say about it he asked What do I say Oh John what right can I have to say anything No one else can have so much right putting aside of course myself who must be responsible for my own actions He asked me whether I could afford it and he seems to think that a smaller income suffices for such work now than it did a few years since I believe that I could afford it if I could get a seat that was not very expensive at the first outset He could help me there On that point of course I can have no opinion No not on that point I believe we may take that for granted Living in London for four or five months in the year might be managed But as to the mode of life Then Alice was unable to hold her tongue longer and spoke out her thoughts with more vehemence than discretion No doubt he combated them with some amount of opposition He seldom allowed out spoken enthusiasm to pass by him without some amount of hostility But he was not so perverse as to be driven from his new views by the fact that Alice approved them and she as she drew near home was able to think that the only flaw in his character was in process of being cured When they reached London they all separated It was mister Palliser s purpose to take his wife down to Matching with as little delay as possible London was at this time nearly empty and all the doings of the season were over It was now the first week of August and as Parliament had not been sitting for nearly two months the town looked as it usually looks in September Lady Glencora was to stay but one day in Park Lane and it had been understood between her and Alice that they were not to see each other How odd it is parting in this way when people have been together so long said Lady Glencora It always seems as though there had been a separate little life of its own which was now to be brought to a close I suppose mister Grey you and I when we next meet will be far too distant to fight with each other I hope that may never be the case said mister Grey I suppose nothing would prevent his fighting would it Alice But remember there must be no fighting when we do meet next and that must be in September With all my heart said mister Grey But Alice said nothing Then mister Palliser made his little speech Alice he said as he gave his hand to Miss Vavasor give my compliments to your father and tell him that I shall take the liberty of asking him to come down to Matching for the early shooting in September and that I shall expect him to bring you with him You may tell him also that he will have to stay to see you off but that he will not be allowed to take you away Lady Glencora thought that this was very pretty as coming from her husband and so she told him on their way home Alice insisted on going to Queen Anne Street in a cab by herself mister Palliser had offered a carriage and mister Grey of course offered himself as a protector but she would have neither the one nor the other If he had gone with her he might by chance have met her father and she was most anxious that she should not be encumbered by her lover s presence when she first received her father s congratulations They had slept at Dover and had come up by a mid day train When she reached Queen Anne Street the house was desolate and she might therefore have allowed mister Grey to attend her But she found a letter waiting for her which made her for the moment forget both him and her father Lady Macleod at Cheltenham was very ill and wished to see her niece as she said before she died I have got your letter said the kind old woman and am now quite happy It only wanted that to reconcile me to my departure I thought through it all that my girl would be happy at last Will she forgive me if I say that I have forgiven her The letter then went on to beg Alice to come to Cheltenham at once It is not that I am dying now said Lady Macleod though you will find me much altered and keeping my bed But the doctor says he fears the first cold weather I know what that means my dear and if I don t see you now before your marriage I shall never see you again Pray get married as soon as you can I want to know that you are missus Grey before I go If I were to hear that it was postponed because of my illness I think it would kill me at once There was another letter for her from Kate full of course of congratulations and promising to be at the wedding that is said Kate unless it takes place at the house of some one of your very grand friends and telling her that aunt Greenow was to be married in a fortnight telling her of this and begging her to attend that wedding You should stand by your family said Kate And only think what my condition will be if I have no one here to support me Do come Journeys are nothing nowadays Don t you know I would go seven times the distance for you mister Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield are friends after all and mister Cheesacre is to be best man Is it not beautiful As for poor me I m told I haven t a chance left of becoming mistress of Oileymead and all its wealth Alice began to think that her hands were almost too full If she herself were to be married in September even by the end of September her hands were very full indeed Yet she did not know how to refuse any of the requests made to her As to Lady Macleod her visit to her was a duty which must of course be performed at once She would stay but one day in London and then go down to Cheltenham Having resolved upon this she at once wrote to her aunt to that effect As to that other affair down in Westmoreland she sighed as she thought of it but she feared that she must go there also Kate had suffered too much on her behalf to allow of her feeling indifferent to such a request Then her father came in I didn t in the least know when you might arrive said he beginning with an apology for his absence How could I my dear Alice scorned to remind him that she herself had named the precise hour of the train by which they had arrived It s all right papa said she I was very glad to have an hour to write a letter or two Poor Lady Macleod is very ill I must go to her the day after to morrow Dear dear dear I had heard that she was poorly She is very old you know So Alice you ve made it all square with mister Grey at last Yes papa if you call that square Well I do call it square It has all come round to the proper thing I hope he thinks so What do you think yourself my dear I ve no doubt it s the proper thing for me papa Of course not of course not and I can tell you this Alice he is a man in a thousand You ve heard about the money What money papa The money that George had As the reader is aware Alice had heard nothing special about this money She only knew or supposed she knew that she had given three thousand pounds to her cousin But now her father explained to her the whole transaction We couldn t have realized your money for months perhaps said he but Grey knew that some men must have rope enough before they can hang themselves Alice was unable to say anything on this subject to her father but to herself she did declare that not in that way or with that hope had John Grey produced his money He must be paid papa she said Paid he answered he can pay himself now It may make some difference in the settlements perhaps but he and the lawyers may arrange that I shan t think of interfering with such a man as Grey If you could only know my dear what I ve suffered Alice in a penitential tone expressed her sorrow and then he too assured her that he had forgiven her Bless you my child he said and make you happy and good and and and very comfortable After that he went back to his club Alice made her journey down to Cheltenham without any adventure and was received by Lady Macleod with open arms Dearest Alice it is so good of you Good said Alice would I not have gone a thousand miles to you Lady Macleod was very eager to know all about the coming marriage I can tell you now my dear though I couldn t do it before that I knew he d persist for ever He told me so himself in confidence He has persisted aunt that is certain And I hope you ll reward him A beautiful woman without discretion is like a pearl in a swine s snout but a good wife is a crown of glory to her husband Remember that my dear and choose your part for his sake I won t be that unfortunate pearl if I can help it aunt We can all help it if we set about it in the right way And Alice you must be careful to find out all his likes and his dislikes Dear me I remember how hard I found it but then I don t think I was so clever as you are Sometimes I think nobody has ever been so stupid as I have Not stupid my dear if I must say the word it is self willed But dear all that is forgiven now Is it not There is a forgiveness which it is rather hard to get said Alice There was something said then as to the necessity of looking for pardon beyond this world which I need not here repeat To all her old friend s little sermons Alice was infinitely more attentive than had been her wont so that Lady Macleod was comforted and took heart of grace and at last brought forth from under her pillow a letter from the Countess of Midlothian which she had received a day or two since and which bore upon Alice s case I was not quite sure whether I d show it you said Lady Macleod because you wouldn t answer her when she wrote to you But when I m gone as I shall be soon she will be the nearest relative you have on your mother s side and from her great position you know Alice But here Alice became impatient for the letter Her aunt handed it to her and she read as follows Castle Reekie July one hundred eighty six DEAR LADY MACLEOD I am sorry to hear of the symptoms you speak about I strongly advise you to depend chiefly on beef tea They should be very careful to send it up quite free from grease and it should not be too strong of the meat There should be no vegetables in it Not soup you know but beef tea If any thing acts upon your strength that will I need not tell one who has lived as you have done where to look for that other strength which alone can support you at such a time as this I would go to you if I thought that my presence would be any comfort to you but I know how sensitive you are and the shock might be too much for you If you see Alice Vavasor on her return to England as you probably will pray tell her from me that I give her my warmest congratulations and that I am heartily glad that matters are arranged I think she treated my attempts to heal the wound in a manner that they did not deserve but all that shall be forgiven as shall also her original bad behaviour to poor mister Grey Alice was becoming weary of so much forgiveness and told herself as she was reading the letter that that of Lady Midlothian was at any rate unnecessary I trust that we may yet meet and be friends continued Lady Midlothian I am extremely gratified at finding that she has been thought so much of by mister Palliser I m told that mister Palliser and mister Grey have become great friends and if this is so Alice must be happy to feel that she has had it in her power to confer so great a benefit on her future husband as he will receive from this introduction I ain t a bit happy and I have conferred no benefit on mister Grey exclaimed Alice who was unable to repress the anger occasioned by the last paragraph But it is a great benefit my dear mister Palliser has every bit as much cause to be gratified for that as mister Grey and perhaps more Poor Lady Macleod could not argue the matter in her present state She merely sighed and moved her shrivelled old hand up and down upon the counterpane Alice finished the letter without further remarks It merely went on to say how happy the writer would be to know something of her cousin as missus Grey as also to know something of mister Grey and then gave a general invitation to both mister and missus Grey asking them to come to Castle Reekie whenever they might be able The Marchioness with whom Lady Midlothian was staying had expressly desired her to give this message Alice however could not but observe that Lady Midlothian s invitation applied only to another person s house I m sure she means well said Alice Indeed she does said Lady Macleod and then you know you ll probably have children and think what a thing it will be for them to know the Midlothian family You shouldn t rob them of their natural advantages Alice remained a week with her aunt and went from thence direct to Westmoreland Some order as to bridal preparations we must presume she gave on that single day which she passed in London Much advice she had received on this head from Lady Glencora and no inconsiderable amount of assistance was to be rendered to her at Matching during the fortnight she would remain there before her marriage Something also let us hope she might do at Cheltenham Something no doubt she did do Something also might probably be achieved among the wilds in Westmoreland but that something would necessarily be of a nature not requiring fashionable tradespeople While at Cheltenham she determined that she would not again return to London before her marriage This resolve was caused by a very urgent letter from mister Grey and by another almost equally urgent from Lady Glencora If the marriage did not take place in September she would not be present at it The gods of the world of Lady Glencora s world had met together and come to a great decision Lady Glencora was to be removed in October to Gatherum Castle and remain there till the following spring so that the heir might in truth be born in the purple It is such a bore said Lady Glencora and I know it will be a girl But the Duke isn t to be there except for the Christmas week An invitation for the ceremony at Matching had been sent from mister Palliser to mister Vavasor and another from Lady Glencora to Kate whom I long to know said her ladyship and with whom I should like to pick a crow if I dared as I m sure she did all the mischief CHAPTER LXXVIII mister Cheesacre s Fate It must be acknowledged that missus Greenow was a woman of great resources and that she would be very prudent for others though I fear the verdict of those who know her must go against her in regard to prudence in herself Her marriage with Captain Bellfield was a rash act certainly a rash act although she did take so much care in securing the payment of her own income into her own hands but the manner in which she made him live discreetly for some months previous to his marriage the tact with which she renewed the friendship which had existed between him and mister Cheesacre and the skill she used in at last providing mister Cheesacre with a wife oblige us all to admit that as a general she had great powers When Alice reached Vavasor Hall she found Charlie Fairstairs established there on a long visit Charlie and Kate were to be the two bridesmaids and as Kate told her cousin in their first confidential intercourse on the evening of Alice s arrival there were already great hopes in the household that the master of Oileymead might be brought to surrender It was true that Charlie had not a shilling and that mister Cheesacre had set his heart on marrying an heiress It was true that Miss Fairstairs had always stood low in the gentleman s estimation as being connected with people who were as much without rank and fashion as they were without money and that the gentleman loved rank and fashion dearly It was true that Charlie was no beauty and that Cheesacre had an eye for feminine charms It was true that he had despised Charlie and had spoken his contempt openly that he had seen the girl on the sands at Yarmouth every summer for the last ten years and about the streets of Norwich every winter and had learned to regard her as a thing poor and despicable because she was common in his eyes It is thus that the Cheesacres judge of people But in spite of all these difficulties missus Greenow had taken up poor Charlie s case and Kate Vavasor expressed a strong opinion that her aunt would win What has she done to the man Alice asked Coaxed him simply that She has made herself so much his master that he doesn t know how to say no to her Sometimes I have thought that he might possibly run away but I have abandoned that fear now She has little confidences with him from day to day which are so alluring to him that he cannot tear himself off In the middle of one of them he will find himself engaged But the unfortunate girl Won t it be a wretched marriage for her Not at all She ll make him a very good wife He s one of those men to whom any woman after a little time will come to be the same He ll be rough with her once a month or so and perhaps tell her that she brought no money with her but that won t break any bones and Charlie will know how to fight her own battles She ll save his money if she brings none and in a few years time they will quite understand each other mister Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield were at this time living in lodgings together at Penrith but came over and spent every other day at Vavasor returning always to their lodgings in the evening It wanted but eight days to the marriage when Alice arrived and preparations for that event were in progress It s to be very quiet Alice said her aunt as quiet as such a thing can be made I owe that to the memory of the departed one I know that he is looking down upon me and that he approves all that I do Indeed he told me once that he did not want me to live desolate for his sake If I didn t feel that he was looking down and approving it I should be wretched indeed She took Alice up to see her trousseau and gave the other expectant bride some little hints which under present circumstances might be useful Yes indeed only three and sixpence a piece and they re quite real Feel them You wouldn t get them in the shops under six Alice did feel them and wondered whether her aunt could have saved the half crown honestly I had my eyes about me when I was up in town my dear And look here these are quite new have never been on yet and I had them when I was married before There is nothing like being careful my dear I hate meanness as everybody knows who knows me but there is nothing like being careful You have a lot of rich people about you just now and will have ever so many things given you which you won t want Do you put them all by and be careful They may turn out useful you know Saying this missus Greenow folded up among her present bridal belongings sundries of the wealth which had accrued to her in an earlier stage of her career And then missus Greenow opened her mind to Alice about the Captain He s as good as gold my dear he is indeed in his own way Of course I know that he has faults and I should like to know who hasn t Although poor dear Greenow certainly was more without them than anybody else I ever knew As this remembrance came upon missus Greenow she put her handkerchief to her eyes and Alice observed that that which she held still bore the deepest hem of widowhood They would be used no doubt till the last day and then put by in lavender for future possible occasions Bellfield may have been a little extravagant I dare say he has But how can a man help being extravagant when he hasn t got any regular income He has been ill treated in his profession very It makes my blood curdle when I think of it After fighting his country s battles through blood and dust and wounds but I ll tell you about that another time I suppose a man seldom does make a fortune aunt by being a soldier Never my dear much better be a tailor Don t you ever marry a soldier But as I was saying he is the best tempered creature alive and the staunchest friend I ever met You should hear what mister Cheesacre says of him But you don t know mister Cheesacre No aunt not yet If you remember he went away before I saw him when he came here before Yes I know poor fellow Between you and me Kate might have had him if she liked but perhaps Kate was right I don t think he would have suited Kate at all Because of the farmyard you mean Kate shouldn t give herself airs Money s never dirty you know But perhaps it s all for the best There s a sweet girl here to whom he is violently attached and who I hope will become missus Cheesacre But as I was saying the friendship between these two men is quite wonderful and I have always observed that when a man can create that kind of affection in the bosom of another man he invariably is the sort of man the man in fact who makes a good husband Alice knew the story of Charlie Fairstairs and her hopes knew of the quarrels between Bellfield and Cheesacre knew almost as much of Bellfield s past life as missus Greenow did herself and missus Greenow was no doubt aware that such was the case Nevertheless she had a pleasure in telling her own story and told it as though she believed every word that she spoke On the following day the two gentlemen came over according to custom and Alice observed that Miss Fairstairs hardly spoke to mister Cheesacre Indeed her manner of avoiding that gentleman was so very marked that it was impossible not to observe it They drank tea out of doors and when mister Cheesacre on one occasion sauntered across towards the end of the bench on which Charlie was sitting Charlie got up and walked away And in strolling about the place afterwards and in going up through the wood she was at great pains to attach herself to some other person so that there should be no such attaching between her and the owner of Oileymead At one time mister Cheesacre did get close up to her and spoke some word some very indifferent word He knew that he was being cut and he wanted to avoid the appearance of a scene I don t know sir said Charlie again moving away with excellent dignity and she at once attached herself to Alice who was close by I know you have just come home from Switzerland said Charlie Beautiful Switzerland My heart pants for Switzerland Do tell me something about Switzerland mister Cheesacre had heard that Alice was the dear friend of a lady who would probably some day become a duchess He therefore naturally held her in awe and slunk away On this occasion missus Greenow clung lovingly to her future husband and the effect was that mister Cheesacre found himself to be very much alone and unhappy He had generally enjoyed these days at Vavasor Hall having found himself or fancied himself to be the dominant spirit there That missus Greenow was always in truth the dominant spirit I need hardly say but she knew how to make a companion happy and well also how to make him wretched On the whole of this day poor Cheesacre was very wretched I don t think I shall go there any more he said to Bellfield as he drove the gig back to Penrith that evening Not go there any more Cheesy said Bellfield why we are to have the dinner out in the field on Friday It s your own bespeak Well yes I ll go on Friday but not after that You ll stop and see me turned off old fellow What s the use You ll get your wife and that s enough for you The truth is that since that girl came down from London with her d d airs the girl from London with the airs was poor Alice the place is quite changed I m blessed if the whole thing isn t as dark as ditch water I m a plain man I am and I do hate your swells Against this view of the case Captain Bellfield argued stoutly but Cheesacre had been offended and throughout the next day he was cross and touchy He wouldn t play billiards and on one occasion hinted that he hoped he should get that money soon You did it admirably my dear said missus Greenow that night to Charlie Fairstairs The widow was now on terms almost more confidential with Miss Fairstairs than with her own niece Kate Vavasor She loved a little bit of intrigue and though Kate could intrigue as we have seen in this story Kate would not join her aunt s intrigues You did it admirably I really did not think you had so much in you Oh I don t know said Charlie blushing at the praise And it s the only way my dear the only way I mean for you with such a one as him And if he does come round you ll find him an excellent husband I don t think he cares for me a bit said Charlie whimpering Pooh nonsense Girls never know whether men care for them or not If he asks you to marry him won t that be a sign that he cares for you and if he don t why there ll be no harm done If he thinks it s his money began Charlie Now don t talk nonsense Charlie said missus Greenow or you ll make me sick Of course it s his money more or less You don t mean to tell me you d go and fall in love with him if he was like Bellfield and hadn t got a rap I can afford that sort of thing you can t I don t mean to say you ain t to love him Of course you re to love him and I ve no doubt you will and make him a very good wife I always think that worldliness and sentimentality are like brandy and water I don t like either of them separately but taken together they make a very nice drink I like them warm with as the gentlemen say To this little lecture Miss Fairstairs listened with dutiful patience and when it was over she said nothing more of her outraged affections or of her disregard for money And now my dear mind you look your best on Friday I ll get him away immediately after dinner and when he s done with me you can contrive to be in his way you know The next day was what Kate called the blank day at the Hall The ladies were all alone and devoted themselves as was always the case on the blank days to millinery and household cares missus Greenow as has before been stated had taken a lease of the place and her troubles extended beyond her mere bridal wardrobe Large trunks of household linen had arrived and all this linen was marked with the name of Greenow Greenow five point fifty eight Greenow seven point fifty two and a good deal had to be done before this ancient wealth of housewifery could probably be converted to Bellfield purposes We must cut out the pieces Jeannette and work em in again ever so carefully said the widow after some painful consideration It will always show said Jeannette shaking her head But the other would show worse said the widow and if you finedraw it not one person in ten will notice it We d always put them on with the name to the feet you know It was not quite true that Cheesacre had bespoke the dinner out in the field although no doubt he thought he had done so The little treat if treat it was had all been arranged by missus Greenow who was ever ready to create festivities There was not much scope for a picnic here Besides their own party which of course included the Captain and mister Cheesacre no guest could be caught except the clergyman that low church clergyman who was so anxious about his income and with whom the old Squire had quarrelled missus Greenow had quickly obtained the advantage of his alliance and he who was soon to perform on her behalf the marriage ceremony had promised to grace this little festival The affair simply amounted to this that they were to eat their dinner uncomfortably in the field instead of comfortably in the dining room But missus Greenow knew that Charlie s charms would be much strengthened by a dinner out of doors Nothing she said to Kate nothing makes a man come forward so well as putting him altogether out of his usual tack A man who wouldn t think of such a thing in the drawing room would be sure to make an offer if he spent an evening with a young lady down stairs in the kitchen At two o clock the gig from Penrith arrived at the Hall and for the next hour both Cheesacre and the Captain were engaged in preparing the tables and carrying out the viands The Captain and Charlie Fairstairs were going to lay the cloth Let me do it said Cheesacre taking it out of the Captain s hands Oh certainly said the Captain giving up his prize Captain Bellfield would do it much better said Charlie with a little toss of her head he s as good as a married man and they always do these things best The day was fine and although the shade was not perfect and the midges were troublesome the dinner went off very nicely It was beautiful to see how well missus Greenow remembered herself about the grace seeing that the clergyman was there She was just in time and would have been very angry with herself and have thought herself awkward had she forgotten it mister Cheesacre sat on her right hand and the clergyman on her left and she hardly spoke a word to Bellfield Her sweetest smiles were all given to Cheesacre She was specially anxious to keep her neighbour the parson in good humour and therefore illuminated him once in every five minutes with a passing ray but the full splendour of her light was poured out upon Cheesacre as it never had before been poured How she did flatter him and with what a capacious gullet did he swallow her flatteries Oileymead was the only paradise she had ever seen Ah me when I think of it sometimes but never mind A moment came to him when he thought that even yet he might win the race and send Bellfield away howling into outer darkness A moment came to him and the widow saw the moment well I know I have done for the best said she and therefore I shall never regret it at any rate it s done now Not done yet said he plaintively Yes done and done and done Besides a man in your position in the county should always marry a wife younger than yourself a good deal younger Cheesacre did not understand the argument but he liked the allusion to his position in the county and he perceived that it was too late for any changes in the present arrangements But he was happy and all that feeling of animosity to Alice had vanished from his breast Poor Alice she at any rate was innocent With so much of her own to fill her mind she had been but little able to take her share in the Greenow festivities and we may safely say that if mister Cheesacre s supremacy was on any occasion attacked it was not attacked by her His supremacy on this occasion was paramount and during the dinner and after the dinner he was allowed to give his orders to Bellfield in a manner that must have gratified him much You must have another glass of champagne with me my friend said missus Greenow and mister Cheesacre drank the other glass of champagne It was not the second nor the third that he had taken After dinner they started off for a ramble through the fields and missus Greenow and mister Cheesacre were together I think that Charlie Fairstairs did not go with them at all I think she went into the house and washed her face and brushed her hair and settled her muslin I should not wonder if she took off her frock and ironed it again Captain Bellfield I know went with Alice and created some astonishment by assuring her that he fully meant to correct the error of his ways I know what it is he said to be connected with such a family as yours Miss Vavasor He too had heard about the future duchess and wished to be on his best behaviour Kate fell to the lot of the parson This is the last time we shall ever be together in this way said the widow to her friend Oh no said Cheesacre I hope not The last time On Wednesday I become missus Bellfield and I need hardly say that I have many things to think of before that but mister Cheesacre I hope we are not to be strangers hereafter mister Cheesacre said that he hoped not Oileymead would always be open to Captain and missus Bellfield We all know your hospitality said she it is not to day nor to morrow that I or my husband that is to be will have to learn that He always declares that you are the very beau ideal of an English country gentleman Merely a poor Norfolk farmer said Cheesacre I never want to put myself beyond my own place There has been some talk about the Commission of the Peace but I don t think anything of it It has been the greatest blessing in the world for him that he has ever known you said missus Greenow still talking about her future husband I ve tried to be good natured that s all D me missus Greenow what s the use of living if one doesn t try to be good natured There isn t a better fellow than Bellfield living He and I ran for the same plate and he has won it He s a lucky fellow and I don t begrudge him his luck That s so manly of you mister Cheesacre But indeed the plate you speak of was not worth your running for I may have my own opinion about that you know It was not Nobody knows that as well as I do or could have thought over the whole matter so often I know very well what my mission is in life The mistress of your house mister Cheesacre should not be any man s widow She wouldn t be a widow then you know A virgin heart should be yours and a virgin heart may be yours if you choose to accept it Oh bother If you choose to take my solicitude on your behalf in that way of course I have done You were good enough to say just now that you wished to see me and my husband in your hospitable halls After all that has passed do you think that I could be a visitor at your house unless there is a mistress there Upon my word I think you might No mister Cheesacre certainly not For all our sakes I should decline But if you were married You are always wanting to marry me missus Greenow I do I do It is the only way in which there can be any friendship between us and not for worlds would I lose that advantage for my husband let alone what I may feel for myself Why didn t you take me yourself missus Greenow If you can t understand it is not for me to say anything more mister Cheesacre If you value the warm affection of a virgin heart Why missus Greenow all yesterday she wouldn t say a word to me Not say a word to you Is that all you know about it Are you so ignorant that you cannot see when a girl s heart is breaking beneath her stays This almost improper allusion had quite an effect on mister Cheesacre s sensitive bosom Did you say a word to her yesterday And if not why have you said so many words before Oh missus Greenow come It is oh missus Greenow But it is time that we should go back to them They had been sitting all this time on a bank under a hedge We will have our tea and you shall have your pipe and brandy and water and Charlie shall bring it to you Shall she mister Cheesacre If she likes she shall of course Do you ask her and she ll like it it quick enough But remember mister Cheesacre I m quite serious in what I say about your having a mistress for your house Only think what an age you ll be when your children grow up if you don t marry soon now They returned to the field in which they had dined and found Charlie under the trees with her muslin looking very fresh What all a mort said missus Greenow Charlie did not quite understand this but replied that she preferred being alone I have told him that you should fill his pipe for him said missus Greenow He doesn t care for ladies to fill his pipe for him said Charlie Do you try said the widow while I go indoors and order the tea It had been necessary to put the bait very close before Cheesacre s eyes or there would have been no hope that he might take it The bait had been put so very close that we must feel sure that he saw the hook But there are fish so silly that they will take the bait although they know the hook is there Cheesacre understood it all Many things he could not see but he could see that missus Greenow was trying to catch him as a husband for Charlie Fairstairs and he knew also that he had always despised Charlie and that no worldly advantage whatever would accrue to him by a marriage with such a girl But there she was and he didn t quite know how to avoid it She did look rather nice in her clear starched muslin frock and he felt that he should like to kiss her He needn t marry her because he kissed her The champagne which had created the desire also gave him the audacity He gave one glance around him to see that he was not observed and then he did kiss Charlie Fairstairs under the trees Oh mister Cheesacre said Charlie Oh mister Cheesacre echoed a laughing voice and poor Cheesacre looking round saw that missus Greenow who ought to have been inside the house looking after the boiling water was moving about for some unknown reason within sight of the spot which he had chosen for his dalliance mister Cheesacre said Charlie sobbing how dare you do that and where all the world could see you It was only missus Greenow said Cheesacre And what will she think of me Lord bless you she won t think anything about it But I do I think a great deal about it I don t know what to do I don t I don t Whereupon Charlie got up from her seat under the trees and began to move away slowly Cheesacre thought about it for a moment or two Should he follow her or should he not He knew that he had better not follow her He knew that she was bait with a very visible hook He knew that he was a big fish for whom these two women were angling But after all perhaps it wouldn t do him much harm to be caught So he got up and followed her I don t suppose she meant to take the way towards the woods towards the little path leading to the old summer house up in the trees She was too much beside herself to know where she was going no doubt But that was the path she did take and before long she and Cheesacre were in the summerhouse together Don t Sam don t Somebody really will be coming Well then there Now I won t do it again Twas thus she spoke when the last kiss was given on this occasion unless there may have been one or two later in the evening to which it is not necessary more especially to allude here But on the occasion of that last kiss in the summer house Miss Fairstairs was perfectly justified by circumstances for she was then the promised bride of mister Cheesacre But how was he to get down again among his friends That consideration troubled mister Cheesacre as he rose from his happy seat after that last embrace He had promised Charlie and perhaps he would keep his promise but it might be as well not to make it all too public at once But Charlie wasn t going to be thrown over not if she knew it as she said to herself She returned therefore triumphantly among them all blushing indeed and with her eyes turned away and her hand now remained upon her lover s arm but still so close to him that there could be no mistake Goodness gracious Charlie where have you and mister Cheesacre been said missus Greenow We got up into the woods and lost ourselves said Charlie Oh indeed said missus Greenow It would be too long to tell now in these last pages of our story how Cheesacre strove to escape and with what skill missus Greenow kept him to his bargain I hope that Charlie Fairstairs was duly grateful Before that evening was over under the comfortable influence of a glass of hot brandy and water the widow had I think herself mixed the second glass for mister Cheesacre before the influence became sufficiently comfortable he was forced to own that he had made himself the happy possessor of Charlie Fairstairs heart and hand And you are a lucky man said the widow with enthusiasm and I congratulate you with all my heart Don t let there be any delay now because a good thing can t be done too soon And indeed before that night was over missus Greenow had the pair together in her own presence and then fixed the day A fellow ought to be allowed to turn himself Cheesacre said to her pleading for himself in a whisper But no missus Greenow would give him no such mercy She knew to what a man turning himself might probably lead She was a woman who was quite in earnest when she went to work and I hope that Miss Fairstairs was grateful Then in that presence was in truth the last kiss given on that eventful evening Come Charlie be good natured to him He s as good as your own now said the widow And Charlie was good natured It s to be as soon as ever we come back from our trip said missus Greenow to Kate the next day and I m lending her money to get all her things at once He shall come to the scratch though I go all the way to Norfolk by myself and fetch him by his ears He shall come as sure as my name s Greenow or Bellfield as it will be then you know And I shouldn t wonder if she did have to go to Norfolk said Kate to her cousin That event however cannot be absolutely concluded in these pages I can only say that when I think of missus Greenow s force of character and warmth of friendship I feel that Miss Fairstairs prospects stand on good ground missus Greenow s own marriage was completed with perfect success She took Captain Bellfield for better or for worse with a thorough determination to make the best of his worst and to put him on his legs if any such putting might be possible He at any rate had been in luck If any possible stroke of fortune could do him good he had found that stroke He had found a wife who could forgive all his past offences and also if necessary some future offences who had money enough for all his wants and kindness enough to gratify them and who had moreover which for the Captain was the most important strength enough to keep from him the power of ruining them both Reader let us wish a happy married life to Captain and missus Bellfield The day after the ceremony Alice Vavasor and Kate Vavasor started for Matching Priory CHAPTER LXXIX Diamonds Are Diamonds Kate and Alice as they drew near to their journey s end were both a little flurried and I cannot but own that there was cause for nervousness Kate Vavasor was to meet mister Grey for the first time mister Grey was now staying at Matching and was to remain there until a week of his marriage He was then to return to Cambridgeshire for a day or two and after that was to become a guest at the rector s house at Matching the evening before the ceremony Why not let him come here at once Lady Glencora had said to her husband It is such nonsense you know But mister Palliser would not hear of it mister Palliser though a Radical in public life would not for worlds transgress the social laws of his ancestors and so the matter was settled Kate on this very day of her arrival at Matching would thus see mister Grey for the first time and she could not but feel that she had been the means of doing mister Grey much injury She had moreover something not much indeed but still something of that feeling which made the Pallisers terrible to the imagination because of their rank and wealth She was a little afraid of the Pallisers but of mister Grey she was very much afraid And Alice also was not at her ease She would fain have prevented so very quick a marriage had she not felt that now after all the trouble that she had caused there was nothing left for her but to do as others wished When a day had been named she had hardly dared to demur and had allowed Lady Glencora to settle everything as she had wished But it was not only the suddenness of her marriage which dismayed her Its nature and attributes were terrible to her Both Lady Midlothian and the Marchioness of Auld Reekie were coming When this was told to her by letter she had no means of escape Lady Macleod is right in nearly all that she says Lady Glencora had written to her At any rate you needn t be such a fool as to run away from your cousins simply because they have handles to their names You must take the thing as it comes Lady Glencora moreover had settled for her the list of bridesmaids Alice had made a petition that she might be allowed to go through the ceremony with only one with none but Kate to back her But she ought to have known that when she consented to be married at Matching and indeed she had had very little power of resisting that proposition all such questions would be decided for her Two daughters therefore of Lady Midlothian were to act Lady Jane and Lady Mary and the one daughter of the Marchioness who was also a Lady Jane and there were to be two Miss Howards down from London girls who were known both to Alice and to Lady Glencora and who were in some distant way connected with them both A great attempt was made to induce the two Miss Pallisers to join the bevy but they had frankly pleaded their age No woman should stand up as a bridesmaid said the strong minded Sophy who doesn t mean to get married if she can Now I don t mean to get married and I won t put myself among the young people Lady Glencora was therefore obliged to submit to do the work with only six But she swore that they should be very smart She was to give all the dresses and mister Palliser was to give a brooch and an armlet to each She is the only person in the world I want to pet except yourself Lady Glencora had said to her husband and he had answered by giving her carte blanche as regards expense Illustration Alice and her bridesmaids All this was very terrible to Kate who had not much feminine taste for finery Of the dress she had heard of the dress which was waiting at Matching to be made up after her arrival though as yet she knew nothing of the trinkets There are many girls who could submit themselves at a moment to the kindness of such a woman as Lady Glencora Perhaps most girls would do so for of all such women in the world Lady Glencora was the least inclined to patronize or to be condescending in her kindnesses But Kate Vavasor was one to whom such submission would not come easily I wish I was out of this boat she said to Alice in the train So that I might be shipwrecked alone No there can be no shipwreck to you When the day of action comes you will be taken away up to heaven upon the clouds But what are they to do with me You ll find that Glencora will not desert you You can t conceive what taste she has I d sooner be bridesmaid to Charlie Fairstairs I would indeed My place in the world is not among Cabinet Ministers and old countesses Nor mine Yes it seems that yours is to be there They are your cousins and you have made at any rate one great friend among them one who is to be the biggest of them all And you are going to throw me over Kate To tell the truth Alice I sometimes think you had better throw me over I know it would be sad sad for both but perhaps it would be better I have done you much harm and no good and now where I am going I shall disgrace you She talked even of getting out at some station and returning and would have done so had not Alice made it impossible As it was the evening found her and Alice together entering the park gate at Matching in Lady Glencora s carriage Lady Glencora had sent a note to the station She could not come herself she said because mister Palliser was a little fussy You ll understand dear but don t say a word Alice didn t say a word having been very anxious not to lower mister Palliser in her cousin s respect None of the Lady Janes and Lady Marys were at Matching when they arrived Indeed there was no guest there but mister Grey for which Kate felt herself to be extremely grateful mister Grey came into the hall standing behind mister Palliser who stood behind his wife Alice passed by them both and was at once in her lover s arms Then I must introduce myself said Lady Glencora to Kate and my husband also This she did and no woman in England could have excelled her in the manner of doing it I have heard so much about you said she still keeping Kate s hand and I know how good you ve been and how wicked you have been she added in a whisper Then mister Grey was brought up to her and they were introduced It was not till some days had passed over them that she felt herself at all at her ease with mister Grey and I doubt whether she ever reached that point with mister Palliser but Lady Glencora she knew and liked and almost loved from the first moment of their meeting Have you heard the news said Lady Glencora to Alice the first minute that they were alone Alice of course had not heard the news mister Bott is going to marry missus Marsham There is such a row about it Plantagenet is nearly mad I never knew him so disgusted in my life Of course I don t dare to tell him so but I am so heartily rejoiced You know how I love them both and I could not possibly wish any better reward for either Alice who had personally known more of mister Bott than of missus Marsham said that she couldn t but be sorry for the lady She s old enough to be his mother said Lady Glencora otherwise I really don t know any people better suited to each other The best is that mister Bott is doing it to regain his footing with mister Palliser I am sure of that and Plantagenet will never speak to him again But Alice there is other news What other news It is hardly news yet and of course I am very wicked to tell you But I feel sure mister Grey knows all about it and if I didn t tell he would He hasn t told me anything yet He hasn t had time and when he does you mustn t pretend to know I believe mister Palliser will certainly be Chancellor of the Exchequer before next month and if so he ll never come in for Silverbridge again But he ll be in Parliament will he not Oh yes he ll be in Parliament I don t understand all about it There is a man going out for the county for Barsetshire some man whom the Duke used to favour and he wants Plantagenet to come in for that I can t understand what difference it makes But he will be in the Cabinet Oh yes But who do you suppose is to be the new Member for Silverbridge I can t guess said Alice Though of course she did guess Mind I don t know it He has never told me But he told me that he had been with the Duke and asked the Duke to let Jeffrey have the seat The Duke became as black as thunder and said that Jeffrey had no fortune In short he wouldn t hear of it Poor Jeffrey we must try to do something for him but I really don t know how Then the Duke said that Plantagenet should put in for Silverbridge some friend who would support himself and I fancy mind it s only fancy but I fancy that Plantagenet mentioned to his Grace one mister Grey Oh Glencora They ve been talking together till sometimes I think mister Grey is worse than Plantagenet When mister Grey began to say something the other night in the drawing room about sugar I knew it was all up with you He ll be a financial Secretary you see if he isn t or a lord of something or an under somebody of State and then some day he ll go mad either because he does or because he doesn t get into the Cabinet Lady Glencora as she said all this knew well that the news she was giving would please her cousin better than any other tidings that could be told By degrees the guests came The two Miss Howards were the first and they expressed themselves as delighted with Lady Glencora s taste and with mister Palliser s munificence for at that time the brooches and armlets had been produced Kate had said very little about these matters but the Miss Howards were loud in their thanks But they were good humoured merry girls and the house was pleasanter after their arrival than it had been before Then came the dreaded personage the guest Lady Midlothian On the subject of Lady Midlothian Kate had really become curious She had a real desire to see the face and gait of the woman and to hear her voice Lady Midlothian came and with her came Lady Jane and Lady Mary I am by no means sure that Lady Jane and Lady Mary were not nearly as old as the two Miss Pallisers but they were not probably so fully resolved as to the condition of their future modes of living as were those two ladies and if so they were not wrong to shine as bridesmaids With them Alice had made some slight acquaintance during the last spring in London and as they were now to attend upon her as the bride they were sufficiently gracious To Kate too they were civil enough and things in public went on very pleasantly at Matching A scene there was of course between Alice and Lady Midlothian a scene in private You must go through it Lady Glencora had said with jocose mournfulness and why should you not let her jump upon you a little It can t hurt you now But I don t like people to jump upon me Alice said And why are you to have everything just as you like it You are so unreasonable Think how I ve been jumped on Think what I have borne from them If you knew the things she used to say to me you would not be such a coward I was sent down to her for a week and had no power of helping myself And the Marchioness used to be sent for to look at me for she never talks She used to look at me and groan and hold up her hands till I hated her the worst of the two Think what they did to me and yet they are my dear friends now Why should you escape altogether Alice could not escape altogether and therefore was closeted with Lady Midlothian for the best part of an hour Did Lady Macleod read to you what I wrote the Countess asked Yes that is she gave me the letter to read And I hope you understand me Alice Oh yes I suppose so You suppose so my dear If you only suppose so I shall not be contented I want you to appreciate my feelings towards you thoroughly I want you to know that I am most anxious as to your future life and that I am thoroughly satisfied with the step you are now taking The Countess paused but Alice said nothing Her tongue was itching to tell the old woman that she cared nothing for this expression of satisfaction but she was aware that she had done much that was deserving of punishment and resolved to take this as part of her penance She was being jumped upon and it was unpleasant but after all that had happened it was only fitting that she should undergo much unpleasantness Thoroughly satisfied continued the Countess and now I only wish to refer in the slightest manner possible to what took place between us when we were both of us under this roof last winter Why refer to it at all Lady Midlothian Because I think it may do good and because I cannot make you understand that I have thoroughly forgiven everything unless I tell you that I have forgiven that also On that occasion I had come all the way from Scotland on purpose to say a few words to you I am so sorry that you should have had the trouble I do not regret it Alice I never do regret doing anything which I believe to have been my duty There is no knowing how far what I said then may have operated for good Alice thought that she knew very well but she said nothing I must confess that what I then understood to be your obstinacy and I must say also if I tell the truth your indifference to to to all prudential considerations whatever not to talk of appearances and decorum and I might say anything like a high line of duty or moral conduct shocked me very much It did indeed my dear Taking it altogether I don t know that I was ever more shocked in my life The thing was so inscrutable Here Lady Midlothian held up one hand in a manner that was truly imposing so inscrutable But that is all over now What was personally offensive to myself I could easily forgive and I do forgive it I shall never think of it any more Here Lady Midlothian put up both her hands gently as though wafting the injury away into the air But what I wish specially to say to you is this your own conduct is forgiven also Here she paused again and Alice winced Who was this dreadful old Countess what was the Countess to her that she should be thus tormented with the old woman s forgiveness John Grey had forgiven her and of external forgiveness that was enough She had not forgiven herself would never forgive herself altogether and the pardon of no old woman in England could assist her in doing so She had sinned but she had not sinned against Lady Midlothian Let her jump upon you and have done with it Lady Glencora had said She had resolved that it should be so but it was very hard to keep her resolution The Marchioness and I have talked it over continued Lady Midlothian and she has asked me to speak for both her and myself There is comfort at any rate in that thought Alice who had never yet seen the Marchioness We have resolved that all those little mistakes should be as though they had never been committed We shall both be most happy to receive you and your husband who is I must say one of the most gentlemanlike looking men I ever saw It seems that he and mister Palliser are on most friendly I may say most confidential terms and that must be quite a pleasure to you It s a pleasure to him which is more to the purpose said Alice Exactly so And now my dear everything is forgiven and shall be forgotten Come and give me a kiss and let me wish you joy Alice did as she was bidden and accepted the kiss and the congratulations and a little box of jewellery which Lady Midlothian produced from out of her pocket The diamonds are from the Marchioness my dear whose means as you doubtless are aware greatly exceed my own The garnets are from me I hope they may both be worn long and happily I hardly know which was the worst the lecture the kiss or the present The latter she would have declined had it been possible but it was not possible When she had agreed to be married at Matching she had not calculated the amount of punishment which would thereby be inflicted on her But I think that though she bore it impatiently she was aware that she had deserved it Although she fretted herself greatly under the infliction of Lady Midlothian she acknowledged to herself even at the time that she deserved all the lashes she received She had made a fool of herself in her vain attempt to be greater and grander than other girls and it was only fair that her folly should be in some sort punished before it was fully pardoned John Grey punished it after one fashion by declining to allude to it or to think of it or to take any account of it And now Lady Midlothian had punished it after another fashion and Alice went out of the Countess s presence with sundry inward exclamations of mea culpa and with many unseen beatings of the breast Two days before the ceremony came the Marchioness and her august daughter Her Lady Jane was much more august than the other Lady Jane very much more august indeed She had very long flaxen hair and very light blue eyes which she did not move frequently and she spoke very little one may almost say not at all and she never seemed to do anything But she was very august and was as all the world knew engaged to marry the Duke of Dumfriesshire who though twice her own age was as yet childless as soon as he should have completed his mourning for his first wife Kate told her cousin that she did not at all know how she should ever stand up as one in a group with so august a person as this Lady Jane and Alice herself felt that such an attendant would quite obliterate her But Lady Jane and her mother were both harmless The Marchioness never spoke to Kate and hardly spoke to Alice and the Marchioness s Lady Jane was quite as silent as her mother On the morning of this day the day on which these very august people came a telegram arrived at the Priory calling for mister Palliser s immediate presence in London He came to Alice full of regret and behaved himself very nicely Alice now regarded him quite as a friend Of course I understand she said and I know that the business which takes you up to London pleases you Well yes it does please me I am glad I don t mind saying so to you But it does not please me to think that I shall be away at your marriage Pray make your father understand that it was absolutely unavoidable But I shall see him of course when I come back And I shall see you too before very long Shall you Oh yes And why so Because mister Grey must be at Silverbridge for his election But perhaps I ought not tell you his secrets Then he took her into the breakfast parlour and showed her his present It was a service of Sevres china very precious and beautiful I got you these things because Grey likes china So do I like china said she with her face brighter than he had ever yet seen it I thought you would like them best said he Alice looking up at him with her eyes full of tears told him that she did like them best and then as he wished her all happiness and as he was stooping over her to kiss her Lady Glencora came in I beg pardon said she I was just one minute too soon was I not She would have them sent here and unpacked said mister Palliser though I told her it was foolish Of course I would said Lady Glencora Everything shall be unpacked and shown It s easy to get somebody to pack them again Much of the wedding tribute had already been deposited with the china and among other things there were the jewels that Lady Midlothian had brought Upon my word her ladyship s diamonds are not to be sneezed at said Lady Glencora I don t care for diamonds said Alice Then Lady Glencora took up the Countess s trinkets and shook her head and turned up her nose There was a wonderfully comic expression on her face as she did so To me they are just as good as the others said Alice To me they are not then said Lady Glencora Diamonds are diamonds and garnets are garnets and I am not so romantic but what I know the difference On the evening before the marriage Alice and Lady Glencora walked for the last time through the Priory ruins It was now September and the evenings were still long so that the ladies could get out upon the lawn after dinner Whether Lady Glencora would have been allowed to walk through the ruins so late as half past eight in the evening if her husband had been there may be doubtful but her husband was away and she took this advantage of his absence Do you remember that night we were here said Lady Glencora When shall I forget it or how is it possible that such a night should ever be forgotten No I shall never forget it Oh dear what wonderful things have happened since that Do you ever think of Jeffrey Yes of course I think of him I did like him so much I hope I shall see him some day And he liked you too young woman and what was more young woman I thought at one time that perhaps you were going to like him in earnest Not in that way certainly You ve done much better of course especially as poor Jeffrey s chance of promotion doesn t look so good now If I have a boy I wonder whether he ll hate me Why should he hate you I can t help it you know if he does Only think what it is to Plantagenet Have you seen the difference it makes in him already Of course it makes a difference the greatest difference in the world And think what it will be to me Alice I used to lie in bed and wish myself dead and make up my mind to drown myself if I could only dare I shan t think any more of that poor fellow now Then she told Alice what had been done for Burgo how his uncle had paid his bills once again and had agreed to give him a small income Poor fellow said Lady Glencora it won t do more than buy him gloves you know The marriage was magnificent greatly to the dismay of Alice and to the discomfort of mister Vavasor who came down on the eve of the ceremony arriving while his daughter and Lady Glencora were in the ruins mister Grey seemed to take it all very easily and as Lady Glencora said played his part exactly as though he were in the habit of being married at any rate once a year Nothing on earth will ever put him out so you need not try my dear she said as Alice stood with her a moment alone in the dressing room up stairs before her departure I know that said Alice and therefore I shall never try xxxxxxxxxx CHAPTER LXXX The Story Is Finished Within the Halls of the Duke of Omnium mister Grey and wife were duly carried away from Matching Priory by post horses and did their honeymoon we may be quite sure with much satisfaction When Alice was first asked where she would go she simply suggested that it should not be to Switzerland They did in truth go by slow stages to Italy to Venice Florence and on to Rome but such had not been their intention when they first started on their journey At that time mister Grey believed that he would be wanted again in England down at Silverbridge in Barsetshire very shortly But before he had married a week he learned that all that was to be postponed The cup of fruition had not yet reached mister Palliser s lips There will be no vacancy either in the county or in the borough till Parliament meets That had been the message sent by mister Palliser to mister Grey Lady Glencora s message to Alice had been rather more full having occupied three pages of note paper the last of which had been crossed but I do not know that it was more explicit She had abused Lord Brock had abused mister Finespun and had abused all public things and institutions because the arrangements as now proposed would be very comfortable to Alice but would not as she was pleased to think be very comfortable to herself You can go to Rome and see everything and enjoy yourself which I was not allowed to do and all this noise and bother and crowd of electioneering will take place down in Barsetshire just when I am in the middle of all my trouble There were many very long letters came from Lady Glencora to Rome during the winter letters which Alice enjoyed thoroughly but which she could not but regard as being very indiscreet The Duke was at the Castle during the Christmas week and the descriptions of the Duke and of his solicitude as to his heir were very comic He comes and bends over me on the sofa in the most stupendous way as though a woman to be the mother of his heir must be a miracle in nature He is quite awful when he says a word or two and more awful in his silence The devil prompted me the other day and I said I hoped it would be a girl There was a look came over his face which nearly frightened me If it should be I believe he will turn me out of the house but how can I help it I wish you were going to have a baby at the same time Then if yours was a boy and mine a girl we d make a change This was very indiscreet Lady Glencora would write indiscreet letters like this which Alice could not show to her husband It was a thousand pities But December and January wore themselves away and the time came in which the Greys were bound to return to England The husband had very fully discussed with his wife that matter of his parliamentary ambition and found in her a very ready listener Having made up his mind to do this thing he was resolved to do it thoroughly and was becoming almost as full of politics almost as much devoted to sugar as mister Palliser himself He at any rate could not complain that his wife would not interest herself in his pursuits Then as they returned came letters from Lady Glencora written as her troubles grew nigh The Duke had gone of course but he was to be there at the appointed time Oh I do so wish he would have a fit of the gout in London or at Timbuctoo said Lady Glencora When they reached London they first heard the news from mister Vavasor who on this occasion condescended to meet them at the railway The Duke has got an heir he said before the carriage door was open born this morning One might have supposed that it was the Duke s baby and not the baby of Lady Glencora and mister Palliser There was a note from mister Palliser to mister Grey Thank God said the note Lady Glencora and the boy mister Palliser had scorned to use the word child Lady Glencora and the boy are quite as well as can be expected Both the new writs were moved for last night mister Palliser s honours as will be seen came rushing upon him all at once Wondrous little baby purpureo genitus What have the gods not done for thee if thou canst only manage to live till thy good things are all thine own to live through all the terrible solicitude with which they will envelope thee Better than royal rank will be thine with influence more than royal and power of action fettered by no royalty Royal wealth which will be really thine own to do with it as it beseemeth thee Thou wilt be at the top of an aristocracy in a country where aristocrats need gird themselves with no buckram All that the world can give will be thine and yet when we talk of thee religiously philosophically or politico economically we are wont to declare that thy chances of happiness are no better no better if they be no worse than are those of thine infant neighbour just born in that farmyard cradle Who shall say that they are better or that they are worse Or if they be better or if they be worse how shall we reconcile to ourselves that seeming injustice And now we will pay a little visit to the small one born in the purple and the story of that visit shall be the end of our history It was early in April quite early in April and mister and missus Grey were both at Gatherum Castle missus Grey was there at the moment of which we write but mister Grey was absent at Silverbridge with mister Palliser This was the day of the Silverbridge election and mister Grey had gone to that ancient borough to offer himself as a candidate to the electors backed by the presence and aid of a very powerful member of the Cabinet Lady Glencora and Alice were sitting up stairs with the small purple born one in their presence and the small purple born one was lying in Alice s lap It is such a comfort that it is over said the mother You are the most ungrateful of women Oh Alice if you could have known Your baby may come just as it pleases You won t lie awake trembling how on earth you will bear your disgrace if one of the vile weaker sex should come to disturb the hopes of your lords and masters for I had two which made it so much more terrible I m sure mister Palliser would not have said a word No he would have said nothing nor would the Duke The Duke would simply have gone away instantly and never have seen me again till the next chance comes if it ever does come And mister Palliser would have been as gentle as a dove much more gentle than he is now for men are rarely gentle in their triumph But I should have known what they both thought and felt It s all right now dear Yes my bonny boy you have made it all right for me have you not And Lady Glencora took her baby into her own arms You have made everything right my little man But oh Alice if you had seen the Duke s long face through those three days if you had heard the tones of the people s voices as they whispered about me if you had encountered the oppressive cheerfulness of those two London doctors doctors are such bad actors you would have thought it impossible for any woman to live throughout There s one comfort if my mannikin lives I can t have another eldest He looks like living don t he Alice Then were perpetrated various mysterious ceremonies of feminine idolatry which were continued till there came a grandly dressed old lady who called herself the nurse and who took the idol away Illustration Yes my bonny boy you have made it all right for me In the course of that afternoon Lady Glencora took Alice all over the house It was a castle of enormous size quite new having been built by the present proprietor very cold very handsome and very dull What an immense place said Alice as she stood looking round her in the grand hall which was never used as an entrance except on very grand occasions Is it not And it cost oh I can t tell you how much it cost A hundred thousand pounds or more Well that would be nothing as the Duke no doubt had the money in his pocket to do what he liked with at the time But the joke is nobody ever thinks of living here Who d live in such a great overgrown place such as this if they could get a comfortable house like Matching Do you remember Longroyston and the hot water pipes I always think of the poor Duchess when I come through here Nobody ever lives here or ever will The Duke comes for one week in the year and Plantagenet says he hates to do that As for me nothing on earth shall ever make me live here I was completely in their power and couldn t help their bringing me here the other day because I had as it were disgraced myself How disgraced yourself In being so long you know before that gentleman was born But they shan t play me the same trick again I shall dare to assert myself now Come we must go away There are some of the British public come to see one of the British sights That s another pleasure here One has to run about to avoid being caught by the visitors The housekeeper tells me they always grumble because they are not allowed to go into my little room up stairs On the evening of that day mister Palliser and mister Grey returned home from Silverbridge together The latter was then a Member of Parliament but the former at that moment was the possessor of no such dignity The election for the borough was now over whereas that for the county had not yet taken place But there was no rival candidate for the position and mister Palliser was thoroughly contented with his fate He was at this moment actually Chancellor of the Exchequer and in about ten days time would be on his legs in the House proposing for his country s use his scheme of finance The two men were seated together in an open carriage and were being whirled along by four horses They were both no doubt happy in their ambition but I think that of the two mister Palliser showed his triumph the most Not that he spoke even to his friend a word that was triumphant in its tone It was not thus that he rejoiced He was by nature too placid for that But there was a nervousness in his contentment which told the tale to any observer who might know how to read it I hope you ll like it he said to Grey I shall never like it as you do Grey answered And why not why not In the first place I have not begun it so young Any time before thirty five is young enough For useful work yes but hardly for enjoyment in the thing And then I don t believe it all as you do To you the British House of Commons is everything Yes everything said mister Palliser with unwonted enthusiasm everything everything That and the Constitution are everything It is not so to me Ah but it will be If you really take to the work and put yourself into harness it will be so You ll get to feel it as I do The man who is counted by his colleagues as number one on the Treasury Bench in the English House of Commons is the first of living men That s my opinion I don t know that I ever said it before but that s my opinion And who is the second the purse bearer to this great man I say nothing about the second I don t know that there is any second I wonder how we shall find Lady Glencora and the boy They had then arrived at the side entrance to the Castle and mister Grey ran up stairs to his wife s room to receive her congratulations And you are a Member of Parliament she asked They tell me so but I don t know whether I actually am one till I ve taken the oaths I am so happy There s no position in the world so glorious It s a pity you are not mister Palliser s wife That s just what he has been saying Oh John I am so happy It is so much more than I have deserved I hope that is I sometimes think Think what dearest I hope nothing that I have ever said has driven you to it I d do more than that dear to make you happy he said as he put his arm round her and kissed her more than that at least if it were in my power Probably my readers may agree with Alice that in the final adjustment of her affairs she had received more than she had deserved All her friends except her husband thought so But as they have all forgiven her including even Lady Midlothian herself I hope that they who have followed her story to its close will not be less generous END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CAN YOU FORGIVE HER This
