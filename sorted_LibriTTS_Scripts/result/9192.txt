none	none	the short business of opening the commission was gone through when the judges re entered the carriage to proceed to the cathedral having been joined by the mayor and corporation The sweet bells of Helstonleigh were still ringing out not to welcome the judges to the city now but as an invitation to them to come and worship God Within the grand entrance of the cathedral waiting to receive the judges stood the Dean of Helstonleigh two or three of the chapter two of the minor canons and the king s scholars and choristers all in their white robes The bells ceased the fine organ pealed out and there are few finer organs in England than that of Helstonleigh the vergers with their silver maces and the decrepit old bedesmen in their black gowns led the way to the choir the long scarlet trains of the judges held up behind and places were found for all The reverend John Pye began the service it was his week for chanting He was one of the senior minor canons and head master of the college school At the desk opposite to him sat the reverend William Yorke a young man who had only just gained his minor canonry The service went on smoothly until the commencement of the anthem In one sense it went on smoothly to the end for no person present not even the judges themselves could see that anything was wrong mister Pye was what was called chanter to the cathedral which meant that it was he who had the privilege of selecting the music for the chants and other portions of the service when the dean did not do so himself The anthem he had put up for this occasion was a

none	none	one taken from the Psalms of David It commenced with a treble solo it was moreover an especial favourite of mister Pye s and he complacently disposed himself to listen But no sooner was the symphony over no sooner had the first notes of the chorister sounded on mister Pye s ear than his face slightly flushed and he lifted his head with a sharp quick gesture That was not the voice which ought to have sung this fine anthem that was a cracked passee voice belonging to the senior chorister a young gentleman of seventeen who was going out of the choir at Michaelmas He had done good service for the choir in his day but his voice was breaking now and the last time he had attempted a solo the bishop who interfered most rarely with the executive of the cathedral and indeed it was not his province to do so had spoken himself to mister Pye on the conclusion of the service and said the boy ought not to be allowed to sing alone again mister Pye bent his head forward to catch a glimpse of the choristers five of whom sat on his side of the choir the decani five on the opposite or cantori side So far as he could see the boy Stephen Bywater who ought to have taken the anthem was not in his place There appeared to be only four of them but the senior boy with his clean starched surplice partially hid those below him mister Pye wondered where his eyes could have been not to have noticed the boy s absence when they had all been gathered round the entrance waiting for the judges Had mister Pye s attention not been fully engrossed with his book As the service had gone on he might have seen the boy opposite to him for there sat Bywater before the bench of king s scholars and right in front of mister Pye mister Pye s glance fell upon him now and he could scarcely believe it He rubbed his eyes and looked and rubbed again Bywater there and without his surplice braving as it were the head master What could he possibly mean by this act of insubordination Why was he not in his place in the school Why was he mixing with the congregation But mister Pye could as yet obtain no solution to the mystery The anthem came to an end the dean had bent his brow at the solo but it did no good and the

none	none	over the sheriff s chaplain ascended to the pulpit to preach the sermon He selected his text from saint John s Gospel That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit In the course of his sermon he pointed out that the unhappy prisoners in the gaol awaiting the summons to answer before an earthly tribunal for the evil deeds they had committed had been led into their present miserable condition by the seductions of the flesh They had fallen into sin he went on by the indulgence of their passions they had placed no restraint upon their animal appetites and guilty pleasures they had sunk gradually into crime and had now to meet the penalty of the law But did no blame he asked attach to those who had remained indifferent to their downward course who had never stretched forth a friendly hand to rescue them from destruction who had made no effort to teach and guide in the ways of truth and righteousness these outcasts of society Were we he demanded at liberty to ignore our responsibility by asking in the words of earth s first criminal Am I my brother s keeper No it was at once our duty and our privilege to engage in the noble work of man s reformation to raise the fallen to seek out the lost and to restore the outcast and this he argued could only be accomplished by a widely disseminated knowledge of God s truth by patient self denying labour in God s work and by a devout dependence on God s Holy Spirit At the conclusion of the service the head master proceeded to the vestry where the minor canons choristers and lay clerks kept their surplices Not the dean and chapter they robed in the chapter house and the king s scholars put on their surplices in the schoolroom The choristers followed mister Pye to the vestry Bywater entering with them The boys grouped themselves together they were expecting to use their own expression a row Bywater what is the meaning of this conduct was the master s stern demand I had no surplice sir was Bywater s answer a saucy looking boy with a red face who had a propensity for getting into rows and consequently into punishment No surplice repeated mister Pye for the like excuse had never been offered by a college boy before

none	none	We were ordered to wear clean surplices this afternoon I brought mine to college this morning I left it here in the vestry and took the dirty one home Well sir when I came to put it on this afternoon it was gone How could it have gone Nonsense sir Who would touch your surplice But I could not find it sir repeated Bywater The choristers know I couldn t and they left me hunting for it when they went into the hall to receive the judges I could not go into my stall sir and sing the anthem without my surplice Hurst had no business to sing it was the vexed rejoinder of the master You know your voice is gone Hurst You should have gone up to the organist stated the case and had another anthem put up But sir I was expecting Bywater in every minute I thought he d be sure to find his surplice somewhere was Hurst s defence And when he did not come and it grew too late to do anything I thought it better to take the anthem myself than to give it to a junior who would be safe to have made a mess of it Better for the judges and other strangers to hear a faded voice in Helstonleigh Cathedral than to hear bad singing The master did not speak So far Hurst s argument had reason in it And I beg your pardon for what I am about to say sir Hurst went on but I hope you will allow me to assure you beforehand that neither I nor my juniors under me have had a hand in this affair Bywater has just told me that the surplice is found and how and blame is sure to be cast upon us but I declare that not one of us has been in the mischief mister Pye opened his eyes What now he asked What is the mischief I found the surplice afterwards sir Bywater said This is it He spoke meaningly as if preparing them for a surprise and pointed to a corner of the vestry There lay a clean but tumbled surplice half soaked in ink The head master and mister Yorke lay clerks and choristers all gathered round and stared in amazement They shall pay me the worth of the surplice spoke Bywater an angry shade crossing his usually good tempered face And have a double flogging into the bargain exclaimed the master Who has done this It looks as though it had been rabbled up for the purpose cried Hurst in schoolboy phraseology bending down and touching it gingerly with his finger The ink has been poured on to it Where did you find it sharply demanded the master not that he was angry with the boys before him but he felt angry that the thing should have taken place I found it behind the screen sir replied Bywater I thought I d look there as a last resource and there it was I should think nobody has been behind that screen for a twelvemonth past for it s over ankles in dust there And you know nothing of it Hurst Nothing whatever sir was the reply of the senior chorister spoken earnestly When Bywater whispered to me what had occurred I set it down as the work of one of the choristers and I taxed them with it But they all denied it strenuously and I believe they spoke the truth I put them on their honour The head master peered at the choristers Innocence was in every face not guilt and he with Hurst believed he must look elsewhere for the culprit That it had been done by a college boy there could be no doubt whatever either out of spite to Bywater or from pure love of mischief The king s scholars had no business in the vestry but just at this period the cathedral was undergoing repair and they could enter if so minded at any time of the day the doors being left open for the convenience of the workmen The master turned out of the vestry The cathedral was emptied of its crowd leaving nothing but the dust to tell of what had been and the bells once more went pealing forth over the city mister Pye crossed the nave and quitted the cathedral by the cloister door followed by the choristers The schoolroom once the large refectory of the monks in monkish days was on the opposite side of the cloisters a large room which you gained by steps and whose high windows were many feet from the ground Could you have climbed to those windows and looked from them you would have beheld a fair scene A clear river wound under the cathedral walls beyond its green banks were greener meadows stretching out in the distance far famed beautiful hills bounded the horizon Close by were the prebendal houses some built of red stone some covered with ivy all venerable with age Pleasant gardens surrounded most of them and dark old elms towered aloft sheltering the rooks which seemed as old as the trees The king s scholars were in the schoolroom cramming their surplices into bags or preparing to walk home with them thrown upon their arms and making enough hubbub to alarm the rooks It dropped to a dead calm at sight of the master On holidays and this was one it was not usual for the masters to enter the school after service The school was founded by royal charter its number limited to forty boys who were called king s scholars ten of whom those whose voices were the best were chosen choristers The master marched to his desk and made a sign for the boys to approach addressing himself to the senior boy Gaunt some mischief has been done in the vestry touching Bywater s surplice Do you know anything of it No sir was the prompt answer And Gaunt was one who scorned to tell a lie The master ranged his eyes round the circle Who does There was no reply The boys looked at one another a sort of stolid surprise for the most part predominating mister Pye resumed Bywater tells me that he left his clean surplice in the vestry this morning This afternoon it was found thrown behind the screen tumbled together beyond all doubt purposely and partially covered with ink I ask who has done this I have not sir burst forth from most of the boys simultaneously The seniors of whom there were three besides Gaunt remained silent But this was nothing unusual for the seniors unless expressly questioned or taxed with a fault did not accustom themselves to a voluntary denial I can only think this has been the result of accident continued the head master It is incredible to suppose any one of you would wantonly destroy a surplice If so let that boy whoever he may have been speak up honourably and I will forgive him I conclude that the ink must have been spilt upon it I say accidentally and that he then in his consternation tumbled the surplice together and threw it out of sight behind the screen It had been more straightforward more in accordance with what I wish you all to be boys of thorough truth and honour had he candidly confessed it But the fear of the moment may have frightened his better judgment away Let him acknowledge it now and I will forgive him though of course he must pay Bywater for another surplice A dead silence Do you hear boys the master sternly asked No answer from any one nothing but continued silence The master rose and his countenance assumed its most severe expression Hear further boys That it is one of you I am convinced and your refusing to speak compels me to fear that it was not an accident but a premeditated wicked act I now warn you whoever did it that if I can discover the author or authors he or they shall be punished with the utmost severity short of expulsion that is allowed by the rules of the school Seniors I call for your aid in this Look to it The master left the schoolroom and Babel broke loose questioning denying protesting one of another Bywater was surrounded Won t there be a stunning flogging Bywater who did it Do you know Bywater sat himself astride over the end of a bench and nodded The senior boy turned to him some slight surprise in his look and tone Do you know Bywater Pretty well Gaunt There are two fellows in this school one s at your desk one s at the second desk and I believe they d either of them do me a nasty turn if they could It was one of them Who do you mean asked Gaunt eagerly Bywater laughed Thank you If I tell now it may defeat the ends of justice as the newspapers say I ll wait till I am sure and then let him look to himself I won t spare him and I don t fancy Pye will You ll never find out if you don t find out at once Bywater cried Hurst Shan t I You ll see was the significant answer It s some distance from here to the vestry of the cathedral and a fellow could scarcely steal there and steal back without being seen by somebody It was done stealthily mark you and when folks go on stealthy errands they are safe to be met Before he had finished speaking a gentlemanly looking boy of about twelve with delicate features a damask flush on his face and wavy auburn hair sprang up with a start Why he exclaimed I saw And there he came to a sudden halt and the flush on his cheek grew deeper and then faded again It was a face of exceeding beauty refined almost as a girl s and it had gained for him in the school the sobriquet of Miss What s the matter with you Miss Charley Oh nothing Bywater Charley Channing exclaimed Gaunt do you know who did it If I did Gaunt I should not tell was the fearless answer Do you know Charley cried Tom Channing who was one of the seniors of the school Where s the good of asking that wretched little muff burst forth Gerald Yorke He s only a girl How do you know it was not one of the lay clerks Bywater They carry ink in their pockets I ll lay Or any of the masons might have gone into the vestry for the matter of that It wasn t a lay clerk and it wasn t a mason stoically nodded Bywater It was a college boy And I shall lay my finger upon him as soon as I am a little bit surer than I am I am three parts sure now If Charley Channing does not suspect somebody I m not here exclaimed Hurst who had closely watched the movement alluded to and he brought his hand down fiercely on the desk as he spoke

t want him or anybody else to get pummelled to powder I ll find it out for myself I say Won t my old aunt be in a way though when she sees the surplice and finds she has another to make I say Hurst didn t you croak out that solo Their lordships in the wigs will be soliciting your photograph as a keepsake I hope they ll set it in diamonds retorted Hurst The boys began to file out putting on their trenchers as they clattered down the steps Charley Channing sat himself down in the cloisters on a pile of books as if willing that the rest should pass out before him His brother saw him sitting there and came up to him speaking in an undertone Charley you know the rules of the school one boy must not tell of another As Bywater says you d get pummelled to powder Look here Tom I tell you Hold your tongue boy sharply cried Tom Channing Do you forget that I am a senior You heard the master s words We know no brothers in school life you must remember Charley laughed Tom you think I am a child I believe I didn t enter the school yesterday All I was going to tell you was this I don t know any more than you who inked the surplice and suspicion goes for nothing All right said Tom Channing as he flew after the rest and Charley sat on and fell into a reverie The senior boy of the school you have heard was Gaunt The other three seniors Tom Channing Harry Huntley and Gerald Yorke possessed a considerable amount of power but nothing equal to that vested in Gaunt They had all three entered the school on the same day and had kept pace with each other as they worked their way up in it consequently not one could be said to hold priority and when Gaunt should quit the school at the following Michaelmas one of the three would become senior Which you may wish to ask Ah we don t know that yet Charley Channing a truthful good boy full of integrity kind and loving by nature and a universal favourite sat tilted on the books He was wishing with all his heart that he had not seen something which he had seen that day He had been going through the cloisters in the afternoon about the time that all Helstonleigh college boys included were in the streets watching for the sheriff s procession when he saw one of the seniors steal Bywater had been happy in the epithet out of the cathedral into the quiet cloisters peer about him and then throw a broken ink bottle into the graveyard which the cloisters enclosed The boy stole away without perceiving Charley and there sat Charley now trying to persuade himself by some ingenious sophistry which however he knew was sophistry that the senior might not have been the one in the mischief that the ink bottle might have been on legitimate duty and that he threw it from him because it was broken Charles Channing did not like these unpleasant secrets There was in the school a code of honour the boys called it so that one should not tell of another and if the head master ever went the length of calling the seniors to his aid those seniors deemed themselves compelled to declare it if the fault became known to them Hence Tom Channing s hasty arrest of his brother s words I wonder if I could see the ink bottle there quoth Charles to himself Rising from the books he ran through the cloisters to a certain part and there by a dexterous spring perched himself on to the frame of the open mullioned windows The gravestones lay pretty thick in the square enclosed yard the long dank grass growing around them but there appeared to be no trace of an ink bottle What on earth are you mounted up there for Come down instantly You know the row there has been about the walls getting defaced The speaker was Gerald Yorke who had come up silently Openly disobey him young Channing dared not for the seniors exacted obedience in school and out of it I ll get down directly sir I am not hurting the wall What are you looking at What is there to see demanded Yorke Nothing particular I was looking for what I can t see pointedly returned Charley Look here Miss Channing I don t quite understand you to day You were excessively mysterious in school just now over that surplice affair Who s to know you were not in the mess yourself I think you might know it returned Charley as he jumped down It was more likely to have been you than I Yorke laid hold of him clutching his jacket with a firm grasp You insolent young jackanapes Now what do you mean You don t stir from here till you tell me I ll tell you mister Yorke I d rather tell cried the boy sinking his voice to a whisper I was here when you came peeping out of the college doors this afternoon and I saw you come up to this niche and fling away an ink bottle Yorke s face flushed scarlet He was a tall strong fellow with a pale complexion thick projecting lips and black hair promising fair to make a Hercules but all the Yorkes were finely framed He gave young Channing a taste of his strength the boy when shaken was in his hands as a very reed You miserable imp Do you know who is said to be the father of lies Let me alone sir It s no lie and you know it s not But I promise you on my honour that I won t split I ll keep it in close always if I can The worst of me is I bring things out sometimes without thought he added ingenuously I know I do but I ll try and keep in this You needn t be in a passion Yorke I couldn t help seeing what I did It wasn t my fault Yorke s face had grown purple with anger Charles Channing if you don t unsay what you have said I ll beat you to within an inch of your life I can t unsay it was the answer You can t reiterated Yorke grasping him as a hawk would a pigeon How dare you brave me to my presence Unsay the lie you have told I am in God s presence Yorke as well as in yours cried the boy reverently and I will not tell a lie Then take your whacking I ll teach you what it is to invent fabrications I ll put you up for Yorke s tongue and hands stopped Turning out of the private cloister entrance of the deanery right upon them had come doctor Gardner one of the prebendaries He cast a displeased glance at Yorke not speaking and little Channing touching his trencher to the doctor flew to the place where he had left his books caught them up and ran out of the cloisters towards home CHAPTER II BAD NEWS The ground near the cathedral occupied by the deanery and the prebendal residences was called the Boundaries There were a few other houses in it chiefly of a moderate size inhabited by private families Across the open gravel walk in front of the south cloister entrance was the house appropriated to the headmaster and the Channings lived in a smaller one nearly on the confines of the Boundaries A portico led into it and there was a sitting room on either side the hall Charley entered and was going full dash across the hall to a small room where the boys studied singing at the top of his voice when the old servant of the family Judith an antiquated body in a snow white mob cap and check apron met him and seized his arm Hush child There s ill news in the house Charley dropped his voice to an awe struck whisper What is it Judith Is papa worse Child there s illness of mind as well as of body I didn t say sickness I said ill news I don t rightly understand it the mistress said a word to me and I guessed the rest And it was me that took in the letter Me I wish I had put it in my kitchen fire first Is it Judith is it news of the the cause Is it over It s over as I gathered Twas a London letter and it came by the afternoon post All the poor master s hopes and dependencies for years have been wrested from him And if they d give me my way I d prosecute them postmen for bringing such ill luck to a body s door Charles stood something like a statue the bright sensitive colour deserting his cheek One of those causes Might versus Right of which there are so many in the world had been pending in the Channing family for years and years It included a considerable amount of money which ought long ago to have devolved peaceably to mister Channing but Might was against him and Might threw it into Chancery The decision of the Vice Chancellor had been given for mister Channing upon which Might in his overbearing power carried it to a higher tribunal Possibly the final decision from which there could be no appeal had now come Judith Charles asked after a pause did you hear whether whether the letter I mean the news had anything to do with the Lord Chancellor Oh bother the Lord Chancellor was Judith s response It had to do with somebody that s an enemy to your poor papa I know that much Who s this The hall door had opened and Judith and Charles turned towards it A gay bright featured young man of three and twenty entered tall and handsome as it was in the nature of the Channings to be He was the eldest son of the family James or as he was invariably styled Hamish He rose six foot two in his stockings was well made and upright In grace and strength of frame the Yorkes and the Channings stood Aone in Helstonleigh Now then What are you two concocting Is he coming over you again to let him make more toffy Judy and burn out the bottom of another saucepan Hamish Judy says there s bad news come in by the London post I am afraid the Lord Chancellor has given judgment given it against us The careless smile the half mocking expression left the lips of Hamish He glanced from Judith to Charles from Charles to Judith Is it sure he breathed It s sure that it s awful news of some sort returned Judith and the mistress said to me that all was over now They be all in there but you two pointing with her finger to the parlour on the left of the hall and you had better go in to them Master Hamish Well returned Hamish in a tone of abstraction You must every one of you just make the best of it and comfort the poor master You are young and strong while he you know what he is You in special Master Hamish for you re the eldest born and were the first of em that I ever nursed upon my knee Of course of course he hastily replied But oh Judith you don t know half the ill this must bring upon us Come along Charley let us hear the worst Laying his arm with an affectionate gesture round the boy s neck Hamish drew him towards the parlour It was a square light cheerful room Not the best room that was on the other side the hall On a sofa underneath the window reclined mister Channing his head and shoulders partly raised by cushions His illness had continued long and now it was feared had become chronic A remarkably fine specimen of manhood he must have been in his day his countenance one of thoughtful goodness pleasant to look upon Arthur the second son had inherited its thoughtfulness its expression of goodness James its beauty but there was a great likeness between all the four sons Arthur only nineteen was nearly as tall as his brother He stood bending over the arm of his father s sofa Tom looking very blank and cross sat at the table his elbows leaning on it missus Channing s pale sweet face was bent towards her daughter s Constance a graceful girl of one and twenty and Annabel a troublesome young lady of nearly fourteen was surreptitiously giving twitches to Tom s hair Arthur moved from the place next his father when Hamish entered as if yielding him the right to stand there A more united family it would be impossible to find The brothers and sisters loved each other dearly and Hamish they almost reverenced excepting Annabel Plenty of love the child possessed but of reverence little With his gay good humour and his indulgent merry hearted spirit Hamish Channing was one to earn love as his right somewhat thoughtless though he was Thoroughly well in the highest sense of the term had the Channings been reared Not of their own wisdom had mister and missus Channing trained their children What s the matter sir asked Hamish smoothing his brow and suffering the hopeful smile to return to his lips Judith says some outrageous luck has arrived come express by post Joke while you may Hamish interposed missus Channing in a low voice I shrink from telling it you Can you not guess the news Hamish looked round at each individually with his sunny smile and then let it rest upon his mother The very worst I can guess is not so bad We are all here in our accustomed health Had we sent Annabel up in that new balloon they are advertising I might fancy it had capsized with her as it will some day Annabel never you be persuaded to mount the air in that fashion Hamish Hamish gently reproved missus Channing But perhaps she discerned the motive which actuated him Annabel clapped her hands She would have thought it great fun to go up in a balloon Well mother the worst tidings that the whole world could bring upon us cannot I say be very dreadful while we can discuss them as we are doing now said Hamish I suppose the Lord Chancellor has pronounced against us Irrevocably The suit is for ever at an end and we have lost it Hamish is right interrupted mister Channing When the letter arrived I was for a short time overwhelmed But I begin to see it already in a less desponding light and by to morrow I dare say I shall be cheerful over it One blessed thing children I say advisedly a blessed thing the worry will be over Charley lifted his head The worry papa Ay my boy The agitation the perpetual excitement the sickening suspense the yearning for the end You cannot understand this Charley you can none of you picture it as it has been for me Could I have gone abroad as other men it would have shaken itself off amidst the bustle of the world and have pressed upon me only at odd times and seasons But here have I lain suspense my constant companion It was not right to allow the anxiety so to work upon me but I could not help it I really could not We shall manage to do without it papa said Arthur Yes after a bit we shall manage very well The worst is we are behindhand in our payments for you know how surely I counted upon this It ought to have been mine it was mine by full right of justice though it now seems that the law was against me It is a great affliction but it is one of those which may be borne with an open brow What do you mean papa Afflictions are of two kinds The one we bring upon ourselves through our own misconduct the other is laid upon us by God for our own advantage Yes my boys we receive many blessings in disguise Trouble of this sort will only serve to draw out your manly energies to make you engage vigorously in the business of life to strengthen your self dependence and your trust in God This calamity of the lost lawsuit we must all meet bravely One mercy at any rate the news has brought with it What is that asked missus Channing lifting her sad face When I have glanced to the possibility of the decision being against me I have wondered how I should pay its long and heavy costs whether our home must not be broken up to do it and ourselves turned out upon the world But the costs are not to fall upon me all are to be paid out of the estate That s good news ejaculated Hamish his face radiant as he nodded around My darling boys resumed mister Channing you must all work and do your best I had thought this money would have made things easier for you but it is not to be Not that I would have a boy of mine cherish for a moment the sad and vain dream which some do that of living in idleness God has sent us all into the world to work some with their hands some with their heads all according to their abilities and their station You will not be the worse off mister Charming added with a smile for working a little harder than you once thought would be necessary Perhaps the money may come to us after all by some miracle suggested Charley No replied mister Channing It has wholly gone from us It is as much lost to us as though we had never possessed a claim to it It was even so This decision of the Lord Chancellor had taken it from the Channing family for ever Never mind cried Tom throwing up his trencher which he had carelessly carried into the room with him As papa says we have our hands and brains and they often win the race against money in the long run Yes The boys had active hands and healthy brains no despicable inheritance when added to a firm faith in God and an ardent wish to use and not misuse the talents given to them CHAPTER III CONSTANCE CHANNING How

none	none	is the old proverb Man proposes but God disposes God s ways are not as our ways His dealings with us are often mysterious Happy those who can detect His hand in all the varied chances and changes of the world I am not sure that we can quite picture to ourselves the life that had been mister Channing s Of gentle birth and reared to no profession the inheritance which ought to have come to him was looked upon as a sufficient independence That it would come to him had never been doubted by himself or by others and it was only at the very moment when he thought he was going to take possession of it that some enemy set up a claim and threw it into Chancery You may object to the word enemy but it could certainly not be looked upon as the act of a friend By every right in all justice it belonged to James Channing but he who put in his claim taking advantage of a quibble of law was a rich man and a mighty one I should not like to take possession of another s money in such a manner The good old fashioned wholesome fear would be upon me that it would bring no good either to me or mine James Channing never supposed but that the money would be his some time Meanwhile he sought and obtained employment to occupy his days to bring grist to the mill until the patrimony should come Hoping hoping hoping on hope and disappointment hope and disappointment there was 
8609_262281_000068_000001	train-clean-100	nothing else 
none	none	for years and years and you know who has said that Hope deferred maketh the heart sick There have been many such cases in the world but I question I say if we can quite realize them However the end had come the certainty of disappointment and mister Channing was already beginning to be
6937_262269_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 thankful 
none	none	that suspense at any rate was over He was the head of an office or it may be more correct to say the head of the Helstonleigh branch of it for the establishment was a London one a large important concern including various departments of Insurance Hamish was in the same office and since mister Channing s rheumatism had become chronic it was Hamish who chiefly transacted the business of the office generally bringing home the books when he left and going over them in the evening with his father Thus the work was effectually transacted and mister Channing retained his salary The directors were contented that it should be so for mister Channing possessed their thorough respect and esteem After the ill news was communicated to them the boys left the parlour and assembled in a group in the study at the back of the house to talk it over Constance was with them but they would not admit Annabel A shady pleasant untidy room was that study opening to a cool shady garden It had oil cloth on the floor instead of carpeting and books and playthings were strewed about it What an awful shame that there should be so much injustice in the world spoke passionate Tom flinging his Euripides on the table But for one thing I should be rather glad the worry s over cried Hamish We know the worst now that we have only ourselves to trust to Our hands and brains as Tom said remarked Charley What is the one thing that you mean Hamish Hamish seized Charley by the waist lifted him up and let him drop again It is what does not concern little boys to know and I don t see why you should be in here with us young sir any more than Annabel A presentiment that this would be the ending has been upon me for some time broke in the gentle voice of Constance In my own mind I have kept laying out plans for us all You see it is not as though we should enjoy the full income that we have hitherto had What s that Constance asked Tom hotly The decision does not touch papa s salary and you heard him say that the costs were to be paid out of the estate A pretty thing it would be if any big wigged Lord Chancellor could take away the money that a man works hard for Hasty as usual Tom she said with a smile You know we all know that counting fully upon this money papa is behindhand in his payments They must be paid off now in the best way that may be found and it will take so much from his income It will make no difference to you Tom all you can do is to try on heartily for the seniorship and the exhibition Oh won t it make a difference to me though retorted Tom And suppose I don t gain it Constance Then you will have to work all the harder Tom in some other walk of life Failing the exhibition of course there will be no chance of your going up to the university and you must give up the hope of entering the Church The worst off the one upon whom this disappointment must fall the hardest will be Arthur Arthur Channing astride on the arm of the old fashioned sofa lifted his large deep blue eyes to Constance with a flash of intelligence it seemed to say that she only spoke of what he already knew He had been silent hitherto he was of a silent nature a quiet loving tender nature while the rest spoke he was content to think Ay that it will exclaimed Hamish What will become of your articles now Arthur It should be explained that Arthur had entered the office of mister Galloway who was a proctor and also was steward to the Dean and Chapter Arthur was only a subordinate in it a clerk receiving pay and very short pay too but it was intended that he should enter upon his articles as soon as this money that should be theirs enabled mister Channing to pay for them Hamish might well ask what would become of his articles now I can t see a single step before me cried Arthur Except that I must stay on as I am a paid clerk What rubbish Arthur flashed Tom who possessed a considerable share of temper when it was roused As if you Arthur Channing could remain a paid clerk at Galloway s Why you d be on a level with Jenkins old Jenkins s son Roland Yorke would look down on you then more than he does now And that need not be The sensitive crimson dyed Arthur s fair open brow Of all the failings that he found it most difficult to subdue in his own heart pride bore the greatest share From the moment the ill news had come to his father the boy felt that he should have to do fierce battle with his pride that there was ever recurring mortification laid up in store for it But I can battle with it he bravely whispered to himself and I will do it God helping me I may whistle for my new cricket bat and stumps now grumbled Tom And I wonder when I shall have my new clothes added Charley How selfish we all are broke forth Arthur Selfish chafed Tom Yes selfish Here we are croaking over our petty disappointments and forgetting the worst share that falls upon papa Failing this money how will he go to the German baths A pause of consternation In their own grievances the boys had lost sight of the hope which had recently been shared by them all An eminent physician passing through Helstonleigh had seen mister Channing and given his opinion that if he would visit certain medicinal spas in Germany health might be restored to him When the cause should be terminated in their favour mister Channing had intended to set out But now it was given against him and hope of setting out had gone with it I wish I could carry him on my back to Germany and work to keep him while he stayed there impulsively spoke Tom Wretchedly selfish we have been to dwell on our disappointments by the side of papa s I wish I was older Constance was standing against the window She was of middle height thoroughly ladylike and graceful her features fair and beautiful and her dark blue eyes and smooth white brow wonderfully like Arthur s She wore a muslin dress with a delicate pink sprig upon it the lace of its open sleeves falling on her pretty white hands which were playing unconsciously with a spray of jessamine while she listened to her brothers as each spoke Tom she interposed in answer to the last remark it is of no use wishing for impossibilities We must look steadfastly at things as they exist and see what is the best that can be made of them All that you and Charles can do is to work well on at your studies Annabel the same and it is to be hoped this blow will take some of her thoughtlessness out of her Hamish and Arthur and I must try and be more active than we have been You echoed Arthur Why what can you do Constance A soft blush rose to her cheeks I tell you that I have seemed to anticipate this she said and my mind has busied itself with plans and projects I shall look out for a situation as daily governess A groan of anger burst from Tom His quick temper and Arthur s pride alike rose up and resented the words A daily governess It is only another name for a servant Fine that would be for Miss Channing Constance laughed Oh Tom there are worse misfortunes at sea I would go out wholly but that papa would not like to spare me and I must take Annabel for music and other things of an evening Don t look cross It is an excellent thought and I shall not mind it What will mamma say asked Tom ironically You just ask her Mamma knows replied Constance Mamma has had her fears about the termination of the lawsuit just as I have Ah while you boys were laughing and joking and pursuing your sports or your studies of a night I and mamma would be talking over the shadowed future I told mamma that if the time and the necessity came for turning my education and talents to account I should do it with a willing heart and mamma being rather more sensible than her impetuous son Tom cordially approved Tom made a paper bullet and flung it at Constance his honest eyes half laughing So should I approve said Hamish It is a case taking into consideration my father s state in which all of us should help who are able Of course were you boys grown up and getting money Constance should be exempt from aiding and abetting but as it is it is different There will be no disgrace in her becoming a governess and Helstonleigh will never think it so She is a lady always and so she would be if she were to turn to and wash up dishes The only doubt is He stopped and looked hesitatingly at Constance As if penetrating his meaning her eyes fell before his Whether Yorke will like it went on Hamish as though he had not halted in his sentence And the pretty blush in Constance Channing s face deepened to a glowing crimson Tom made a whole heap of bullets at once and showered them on to her So Hamish be quiet Tom you may inquire all over Helstonleigh to morrow whether any one wants a governess a well trained young lady of twenty one who can play sing and paint speak really good English and decent French and has a smattering of German rattled on Constance as if to cover her blushes I shall ask forty guineas a year Do you think I shall get it I think you ought to ask eighty said Arthur So I would if I were thirty one instead of twenty one said Constance
6904_262291_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear 
none	none	here am I laughing and joking over it but it is a serious thing to undertake the instruction of the young I hope I shall be enabled to do my duty in it What s that It was a merry mocking laugh which came from the outside of the window and then a head of auburn hair wild and entangled was pushed up and in burst Annabel her saucy dark eyes dancing with delight You locked me out but I have been outside the window and heard it all cried she dancing before them in the most provoking manner Arthur can only be a paid clerk and Constance is going to be a governess and get forty guineas a year and if Tom doesn t gain his exhibition he must turn bell ringer to the college for papa can t pay for him at the university now What do you deserve you wicked little picture of deceit demanded Hamish Do you forget the old story of the listener who lost his ears I always do listen whenever I can and I always will avowed Annabel I have warned you so a hundred times over and now I warn you again I wish Tom would turn bell ringer I d make him ring a peal that should astonish Helstonleigh the day Constance goes out as governess Shan t I have a fine time of it It s lessons for me now morning noon and night she s always worrying me but once let us get her back turned and I shall have whole holiday She may think I ll do my lessons with her at night but I won t The boys began to chase her round the table She was almost a match for all four a troublesome indulged sunny hearted child who delighted in committing faults that she might have the pleasure of avowing them She flew out into the garden first knocking over Constance s paint box and some of them went after her At that moment mister Yorke came in You have seen him once before in his place in Helstonleigh Cathedral a tall slender man with pale well formed features and an attractive smile His dark eyes rested on Constance as he entered and once more the brilliant colour lighted up her face When prospects should be a little better that is when mister Yorke should have a sufficient living bestowed upon him Constance was to become his wife His stipend from the minor canonry was at present trifling Judith met me in the hall as I was going into the parlour and told me I had better come here he observed She said bad news had arrived for mister Channing Yes answered Hamish The lawsuit is lost Lost echoed mister Yorke Irrevocably We were discussing ways and means amongst ourselves said Hamish for of course this changes our prospects materially And Constance is going out as a governess if she can find any one to take her and Arthur is to plod on with Joe Jenkins and Tom means to apply for the post of bell ringer to the cathedral interposed the incorrigible Annabel who had once more darted in and heard the last words Can you recommend Constance to a situation mister Yorke He treated the information lightly laughed at and with Annabel but Constance noticed that a flush crossed his brow and that he quitted the subject Has the inked surplice been found out Tom I mean the culprit Not yet mister Yorke Charles you can tell me who it was I hear There was a startled glance for a moment in Charles s eye as he looked up at mister Yorke and an unconscious meaning in his tone Why do you know who it was sir Not I said mister Yorke I know that whoever it may have been deserves a sound flogging if he did it willfully Then sir why do you suppose I know I met Hurst just now and he stopped me with the news that he was sure Charley Channing could put his hand upon the offender if he chose to do it It was not yourself was it Charley mister Yorke laughed as he asked the question Charley laughed also but in a constrained manner Meanwhile the others to whom the topic had been as Sanscrit demanded an explanation which mister Yorke gave so far as he was cognizant of the facts What a shame to spoil a surplice Have you cause to suspect any particular boy Charley demanded Hamish Don t ask him in my presence interrupted Tom in the same hurried manner that he had used in the cloisters I should be compelled in honour to inform the master and Charley would have his life thrashed out of him by the school Don t you ask me either mister Yorke said Charles and the tone of his voice still unconsciously to himself bore a strange serious earnestness Why not returned mister Yorke I am not a senior of the college school and under obedience to its head master If you are all to stop in this room I and Tom shall never get our lessons done was all the reply made by Charles as he drew a chair to the table and opened his exercise books And I never could afford that cried Tom following his example and looking out the books he required It won t do to let Huntley and Yorke get ahead of me Trying for the seniorship as strenuously as ever Tom asked mister Yorke Of course I am replied Tom Channing lifting his eyes in slight surprise And I hope to get it Which of the three stands the best chance Well said Tom it will be about a neck and neck race between us My name stands first on the rolls of the school therefore were our merits equal in strict justice it ought to be given to me But the master could pass me over if he pleased and decide upon either of the other two Which of those two stands first on the rolls Harry Huntley Yorke is the last But that does not count for much you know mister Yorke as we all entered together They enrolled us as our initial letters stood in the alphabet It will turn wholly upon your scholastic merits then I hear but Helstonleigh is famous for its gossip that in past times it has frequently gone by favour So it has said Tom Channing throwing back his head with a whole world of indignation in the action Eligible boys have been passed over and the most incapable dolt set up above them all because his friends were in a good position and hand in glove with the head master I don t mean Pye you know before he came It s said the last case was so flagrant that it came to the ears of the dean and he interfered and forbade favour for the future At any rate there s an impression running through the school that merit and conduct taken together will be allowed fair play Conduct echoed Arthur Channing Tom nodded Conduct is to be brought in this time One day when the first desk fell into a row with the head master through some mischief we had gone into out of school he asked us if we were aware that our conduct as it might be good or ill might gain or lose us the seniorship Yorke who is bold enough you know for ten remarked that that was a new dodge and the master overheard the words and said Yes he was happy to say there were many new dodges he had seen fit to introduce which he trusted might tend to make the school different from what it had been Of course we had the laugh at Yorke but the master took no more notice of it Since then I assure you mister Yorke our behaviour has been a pattern for young ladies mine and Huntley s and Yorke s We don t care to lose a chance Tom Channing nodded sagaciously as he concluded and they left the room to him and Charles CHAPTER IV NO HOLIDAY TO DAY
6937_262269_000000_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Constance that we have a moment alone what is this about you began mister Yorke as they stood together in the garden 
6937_262269_000001_000000	train-clean-360	 Annabel said the truth that I do think of going out as daily governess she replied bending over a carnation to hide the blush which rose to her cheeks a very rival to the blushing flower 
none	none	It is a great misfortune that has fallen upon us at least we can only look at it in that light at present and will beyond doubt be productive of some embarrassment Do you not see William that it is incumbent upon us all to endeavour to lighten this embarrassment those of us who can do so 
6937_262269_000001_000003	train-clean-360	I must assume my share of the burden 
6937_262269_000002_000000	train-clean-360	mister Yorke was silent 
6937_262269_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Constance took it for granted that he was displeased 
6937_262269_000002_000002	train-clean-360	He was of an excellent family and she supposed he disliked the step she was about to take deemed it would be derogatory to his future wife 
6937_262269_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you fully made up your mind he at length asked 
none	none	Yes I have talked it over with mamma for indeed she and I both seem to have anticipated this and she thinks with me that it is what I ought to do 
6937_262269_000004_000002	train-clean-360	William how could I reconcile it to my conscience not to help she continued 
6937_262269_000004_000003	train-clean-360	 Think of papa think of his strait 
6937_262269_000004_000004	train-clean-360	It appears to be a plain duty thrown in my path 
6937_262269_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 By yourself Constance 
6937_262269_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Not by myself she whispered lifting for a moment her large blue eyes 
6937_262269_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh William William do not be displeased with me do not forbid it 
none	none	It is honourable to work it is right to do what we can 
6937_262269_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Strive to see it in the right light 
6937_262269_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Let that carnation alone Constance give your attention to me 
6937_262269_000007_000001	train-clean-360	What if I do forbid it 
none	none	She walked a little forward leaving the carnation bed and halted under the shade of the dark cedar tree her heart and colour alike fading 
6937_262269_000008_000001	train-clean-360	mister Yorke followed and stood before her 
6937_262269_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 William I must do my duty 
none	none	There is no other way open to me by which I can earn something to help in this time of need except that of becoming a governess Many a lady better born than I has done it before me
6937_262269_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 A daily governess I think you said 
6937_262269_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Papa could not spare me to go out altogether Annabel could not spare me either and 
6937_262269_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I would not spare you he struck in filling up her pause 
6937_262269_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 Was that what you were about to say Constance 
6937_262269_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The rosy hue stole over her face again and a sweet smile to her lips Oh William if you will only sanction it 
6937_262269_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I shall go about it then with the lightest heart 
6937_262269_000014_000000	train-clean-360	He looked at her with an expression she did not understand and shook his head 
6937_262269_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Constance thought it a negative shake and her hopes fell again 
6937_262269_000014_000002	train-clean-360	 You did not answer my question said mister Yorke 
6937_262269_000014_000003	train-clean-360	 What if I forbid it 
6937_262269_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 But it seems to be my duty she urged from between her pale and parted lips 
6937_262269_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Constance that is no answer 
6937_262269_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh do not do not 
none	none	William do not you throw this temptation in my way that of choosing between yourself and a plain duty that lies before me
6937_262269_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 The temptation as you call it must be for a later consideration 
6937_262269_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Why will you not answer me 
6937_262269_000018_000002	train-clean-360	What would be your course if I forbade it 
none	none	I do not know 
6937_262269_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But Oh William if you gave me up 
6937_262269_000020_000000	train-clean-360	She could not continue 
6937_262269_000020_000001	train-clean-360	She turned away to hide her face from mister Yorke He followed and obtained forcible view of it 
6937_262269_000020_000002	train-clean-360	It was wet with tears 
6937_262269_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Nay but I did not mean to carry it so far as to cause you real grief my dearest he said in a changed tone 
6937_262269_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 Though you brought it on yourself he added laughing as he bent his face down 
6937_262269_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 How did I bring it on myself 
none	none	By doubting me 
6937_262269_000023_000001	train-clean-360	I saw you doubted me at the first when Annabel spoke of it in the study 
none	none	Constance if you possessed as you are of great acquirements refused from any notion of false pride to exert them for your family in a time of need I should say you were little fitted for the wife of one whose whole duty it must be to do his Master s work
6937_262269_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 You will sanction the measure then she rejoined her countenance lighting up 
6937_262269_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 How could you doubt me 
none	none	I wish I could make a home at once to take you to but as you must remain in this a little longer it is only fair that you should contribute to its maintenance We all have to bend to circumstances 
6937_262269_000025_000003	train-clean-360	I shall not love my wife the less because she has had the courage to turn her talents to account 
6937_262269_000025_000004	train-clean-360	What could you be thinking of child 
6937_262269_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Forgive me William she softly pleaded 
6937_262269_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 But you looked so grave and were so silent 
6937_262269_000027_000000	train-clean-360	mister Yorke smiled 
none	none	The truth is Constance I was turning in my mind whether I could not help to place you and pondering the advantages and disadvantages of a situation I know of 
6937_262269_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Lady Augusta is looking out for a daily governess 
6937_262269_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Is she exclaimed Constance 
none	none	I wonder whether I should suit her 
6937_262269_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Constance spoke hesitatingly 
none	none	The thought which had flashed over her own mind was whether Lady Augusta Yorke could afford to pay her sufficient remuneration 
6937_262269_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Probably the same doubt had made one of the disadvantages hinted at by mister Yorke 
6937_262269_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I called there yesterday and interrupted a scene between Lady Augusta and Miss Caroline he said 
6937_262269_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 Unseemly anger on my lady s part and rebellion on Carry s forming as usual its chief features 
6937_262269_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 But Lady Augusta is so indulgent to her children interrupted Constance 
6937_262269_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Perniciously indulgent generally and when the effects break out in insolence and disobedience then there ensues a scene 
6937_262269_000032_000001	train-clean-360	If you go there you will witness them occasionally and I assure you they are not edifying 
6937_262269_000032_000002	train-clean-360	You must endeavour to train the girls to something better than they have been trained to yet Constance 
6937_262269_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 If I do go 
none	none	I knew how long it would last Lady Augusta s instructing them herself resumed mister Yorke It is not a month since the governess left Why
8609_262281_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 does she 
none	none	wish to take a daily governess instead of one in the house Why Lady Augusta does a thing is scarcely ever to be accounted for by herself or by any one else replied mister Yorke Some convenience or inconvenience she mentioned to me about sleeping arrangements 
6937_262269_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Shall I ascertain particulars for you Constance touching salary and other matters 
6937_262269_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 If you please 
none	none	Papa is somewhat fastidious but he could not object to my going there and its being so very near our own house would be a great point of
6937_262269_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Constance interrupted a voice at this juncture 
6937_262269_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 Is mister Yorke there 
6937_262269_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 He is here mamma replied Constance walking forward to missus Channing mister Yorke attending her 
none	none	I thought I heard you enter she said as mister Yorke took her hand mister Channing will be pleased to see you if you will come in and chat with him 
6937_262269_000040_000002	train-clean-360	The children have told you the tidings 
6937_262269_000040_000003	train-clean-360	It is a great blow to their prospects 
6937_262269_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 But they seem determined to bear it bravely he answered in a hearty tone 
6937_262269_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 You may be proud to have such children missus Channing 
6937_262269_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Not proud she softly said 
none	none	Thankful True I am obliged to you for correcting me was the clergyman s ingenuous answer as he walked with missus Channing across the hall Constance halted for Judith came out of the kitchen and spoke in a whisper And what s the right and the wrong of it Miss Constance Is the money gone
6937_262269_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Gone entirely Judith 
6937_262269_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Gone for good 
6937_262269_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 For good groaned Judith I should say for ill 
6937_262269_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Why does the Queen let there be a Lord Chancellor 
6937_262269_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 It is not the Lord Chancellor s fault Judith 
6937_262269_000047_000001	train-clean-360	He only administers the law 
none	none	Why couldn t he just as well have given it for your papa as against him I suppose he considers that the law is on the other side sighed Constance 
6937_262269_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Judith with a pettish movement returned to her kitchen and at that moment Hamish came downstairs 
6937_262269_000050_000001	train-clean-360	He had changed his dress and had a pair of new white gloves in his hand 
6937_262269_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you going out to night Hamish 
6937_262269_000052_000000	train-clean-360	There was a stress on the word to night and Hamish marked it 
6937_262269_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 I promised you know Constance 
none	none	And my staying away would do no good it could not improve things 
6937_262269_000052_000003	train-clean-360	Fare you well my pretty sister 
none	none	Tell mamma I shall be home by eleven It ll be a sad cut down for em all muttered Judith gazing at Hamish round the kitchen door post Where he ll find money for his white gloves and things now is beyond my telling the darling boy If I could but get to that Lord Chancellor Had you possessed the privilege of living in Helstonleigh at the time of which this story treats and I can assure you you might live in a less privileged city it is possible that on the morning following the above events your peaceful slumbers might have been rudely broken by a noise loud enough to waken the seven sleepers of Ephesus 
6937_262269_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Before seven o clock the whole school choristers and king s scholars assembled in the cloisters 
none	none	But instead of entering the schoolroom for early school they formed themselves into a dense mass if you ever saw schoolboys march otherwise I have not and treading on each other s heels proceeded through the town to the lodgings of the judges in pursuance of a time honoured custom There the head boy sent in his name to the very chamber of the Lord Chief Justice who happened this time to have come to the Helstonleigh circuit mister Gaunt senior of the college school craving holiday for himself and the whole fry who had attended him
6937_262269_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 College boys cried his lordship winking and blinking as other less majestic mortals do when awakened suddenly out of their morning sleep 
none	none	Yes my lord replied the servant All the school s come up such a lot of em 
6937_262269_000057_000002	train-clean-360	It s the holiday they are asking for 
6937_262269_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh ah I recollect cried his lordship for it was not the first time he had been to Helstonleigh 
none	none	Give one of my cards to the senior boy Roberts 
6937_262269_000058_000002	train-clean-360	My compliments to the head master and I beg he will grant the boys a holiday 
6937_262269_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Roberts did as he was bid he also had been to Helstonleigh before with his master and delivered the card and message to Gaunt 
6937_262269_000059_000001	train-clean-360	The consequence of which was the school tore through the streets in triumph shouting Holiday in tones to be heard a mile off and bringing people in white garments from their beds to the windows 
6937_262269_000059_000002	train-clean-360	The least they feared was that the town had taken fire 
none	none	Back to the house of the head master for the pantomime to be played through This usually was for the master as wise on the subject as they were would lie that morning in bed to send the master s servant into his room with the card and the message upon which permission for the holiday would come out and the boys would disperse exercising their legs and lungs No such luck however on this morning 
6937_262269_000060_000003	train-clean-360	The servant met them at the door and grinned dreadfully at the crowd 
6937_262269_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Won t you catch it gentlemen 
6937_262269_000061_000001	train-clean-360	The head master s gone into school and is waiting for you marking you all late of course 
6937_262269_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Gone into school repeated Gaunt haughtily resenting the familiarity as well as the information 
none	none	What do you mean
6937_262269_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I just mean that sir was the reply upon which Gaunt felt uncommonly inclined to knock him down 
none	none	But the man had a propensity for grinning and was sure to exercise it on all possible occasions There s some row up and you are not to have holiday continued the servant the master said last night I was to call him this morning as usual 
6937_262269_000064_000000	train-clean-360	At this unexpected reply the boys slunk away to the college schoolroom their buoyant spirits sunk down to dust and ashes figuratively speaking 
6937_262269_000064_000001	train-clean-360	They could not understand it they had not the most distant idea what their offence could have been 
6937_262269_000064_000002	train-clean-360	Gaunt entered and the rest trooped in after him 
none	none	The head master sat at his desk in stern state the other masters were in their places What is the meaning of this insubordination the master sharply demanded addressing Gaunt
6937_262269_000064_000005	train-clean-360	 You are three quarters of an hour behind your time 
6937_262269_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 We have been up to the judges as usual for holiday sir replied Gaunt in a tone of deprecation 
none	none	His lordship sends his card and compliments to you and
6937_262269_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Holiday interrupted the master 
6937_262269_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 Holiday he repeated with emphasis as if disbelieving his own ears 
6937_262269_000066_000002	train-clean-360	 Do you consider that the school deserves it 
6937_262269_000066_000003	train-clean-360	A pretty senior you must be if you do 
6937_262269_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 What has the school done sir respectfully asked Gaunt 
6937_262269_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Your memory must be conveniently short chafed the master 
6937_262269_000068_000001	train-clean-360	 Have you forgotten the inked surplice 
6937_262269_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Gaunt paused 
6937_262269_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 But that was not the act of the whole school sir 
6937_262269_000069_000002	train-clean-360	It was probably the act of only one 
6937_262269_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 But so long as that one does not confess the whole school must bear it returned the master looking round on the assembly 
6937_262269_000070_000001	train-clean-360	 Boys understand me 
none	none	It is not for the fault itself that may have been as I said yesterday the result of accident but it is the concealment of the fault that makes me angry 
6937_262269_000070_000003	train-clean-360	Will you confess now he who did it 
none	none	No the appeal brought forth no further result than the other had done The master continued
6937_262269_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 You may think I speak now to the guilty boy and let him take these words to himself that you were quite alone when you did it that no eye was watching 
none	none	But let me remind you that the eye of God was upon you What you refuse to tell He can bring to light if it shall so please Him in His own wonderful way His own good time 
6937_262269_000072_000002	train-clean-360	There will be no holiday to day 
none	none	Prayers The boys fell into their places and stood with hanging heads something like rebellion working in every breast At breakfast time they were dismissed and gathered in the cloisters to give vent to their sentiments
6937_262269_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Isn t it a stunning shame cried hot Tom Channing 
none	none	The school ought not to suffer for the fault of one boy The master has no right
6937_262269_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 The fault lies in the boy not in the master interrupted Gaunt 
6937_262269_000075_000001	train-clean-360	 A sneak a coward 
6937_262269_000075_000002	train-clean-360	If he has a spark of manly honour in him he ll speak up now 
none	none	As it has come to this I say Charley Channing should be made to declare what he knows said one
6937_262269_000076_000001	train-clean-360	 He saw it done 
6937_262269_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Who says he did quickly asked Tom Channing 
6937_262269_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Some one said so and that he was afraid to tell 
6937_262269_000079_000000	train-clean-360	Gaunt lifted his finger and made a sign to Charles to approach 
none	none	Now boy as the latter obeyed you will answer me remember 
6937_262269_000079_000002	train-clean-360	The master has called the seniors to his aid and I order you to speak 
6937_262269_000079_000003	train-clean-360	Did you see this mischief done 
6937_262269_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 No I did not fearlessly replied little Channing 
6937_262269_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 If he doesn t know he suspects persisted Hurst 
none	none	Come Miss Channing
6937_262269_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 We don t declare things upon suspicion do we mister Gaunt appealed Charles 
6937_262269_000082_000001	train-clean-360	 I may suspect one Hurst may suspect another Bywater said he suspected two the whole school may be suspicious one of another Where s the use of that 
none	none	It is of no use decided Gaunt
6937_262269_000083_000001	train-clean-360	 You say you did not see the surplice damaged 
6937_262269_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 I did not upon my word of honour 
6937_262269_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 That s enough said Gaunt 
none	none	Depend upon it the fellow while he was at it took precious good precautions against being seen 
6937_262269_000085_000002	train-clean-360	When he gets found out he had better not come within reach of the seniors I warn him of that they might not leave him a head on his shoulders or a tooth in his mouth 
6937_262269_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Suppose it should turn out to have been a senior mister Gaunt spoke Bywater 
none	none	Suppose you should turn out to be an everlasting big donkey retorted the senior boy CHAPTER V ROLAND YORKE Just without the Boundaries in a wide quiet street called Close Street was the office of Richard Galloway Esquire Proctor and Steward to the Dean and Chapter Excepting for this solitary office the street consisted of private houses and it was one of the approaches to the cathedral though not the chief one mister Galloway was a bachelor a short stout man shaped like a cask with a fat round face round open grey eyes that always looked as if their owner was in a state of wonder and a little round mouth But he was a shrewd man and a capable he was also in his way a dandy dressed scrupulously in the fashion with delicate shirt fronts and snow white wristbands and for the last twenty five years at least had been a mark for all the single ladies of Helstonleigh to set their caps at Of beauty mister Galloway could boast little but of his hair he was moderately vain a very good head of hair it was and curled naturally But hair let it be luxuriant enough to excite the admiration of a whole army of coiffeurs is like other things in this sublunary world of ours subject to change it will not last for ever and mister Galloway s from a fine and glossy brown turned as years went on to sober grey nay almost to white He did not particularly admire the change but he had to submit to it Nature is stronger than we are A friend hinted that it might be dyed mister Galloway resented the suggestion anything false was abhorrent to him When however after an illness his hair began to fall off alarmingly he thought it no harm to use a certain specific emanating from one of her Majesty s physicians extensively set forth and patronized as an undoubted remedy for hair that was falling off mister Galloway used it extensively in his fear for he had an equal dread both of baldness and wigs The lotion not only had the desired effect but it had more the hair grew on again luxuriantly and its whiteness turned into the finest flaxen you ever saw a light delicate flaxen exactly like the curls you see upon the heads of blue eyed wax dolls This is a fact and whether mister Galloway liked it or not he had to put up with it Many would not be persuaded but that he had used some delicate dye hitherto unknown to science and the suspicion vexed mister Galloway Behold him therefore with a perfect shower of smooth fair curls upon his head equal to any young beau It was in this gentleman s office that Arthur Channing had been placed with a view to his becoming ultimately a proctor To article him to mister Galloway would take a good round sum of money and this had been put off until the termination of the suit when mister Channing had looked forward to being at his ease in a pecuniary point of view There were two others in the same office The one was Roland Yorke who was articled the other was Joseph Jenkins a thin spare humble man of nine and thirty who had served mister Galloway for nearly twenty years earning twenty five shillings a week He was a son of old Jenkins the bedesman and his wife kept a small hosiery shop in High Street Roland Yorke was of course not paid on the contrary he had paid pretty smartly to mister Galloway for the privilege of being initiated into the mysteries belonging to a proctor Arthur Channing may be said to have occupied a position in the office midway between the two He was to become on the footing of Roland Yorke but meanwhile he received a small weekly sum in remuneration of his services as Joe Jenkins did Roland Yorke in his proud moods looked down upon him as a paid clerk mister Jenkins looked up to him as a gentleman It was a somewhat anomalous position but Arthur had held his own bravely up in it until this blow came looking forward to a brighter time In the years gone by one of the stalls in Helstonleigh Cathedral was held by the Reverend doctor Yorke he had also some time filled the office of sub dean He had married imprudently the daughter of an Irish peer a pretty good tempered girl who was as fond of extravagance as she was devoid of means to support it She had not a shilling in the world it was even said that the bills for her trousseau came in afterwards to doctor Yorke but people you know are given to scandal Want of fortune had been nothing had Lady Augusta only possessed ordinary prudence but she spent the doctor s money faster than he received it In the course of years doctor Yorke died leaving eight children and slender means for them There were six boys and two girls Lady Augusta went to reside in a cheap and roomy house somewhat dilapidated in the Boundaries close to her old prebendal residence and scrambled on in her careless spending fashion never out of debt She retained their old barouche and would retain it and was a great deal too fond of ordering horses from the livery stables and driving out in state Gifted with excellent qualities had her children been born but of training in the highest sense of the word she had given them none George the eldest had a commission and was away with his regiment Roland the second had been designed for the Church but no persuasion could induce him to be sufficiently attentive to his studies to qualify himself for it he was therefore placed with mister Galloway and the Church honours were now intended for Gerald The fourth son Theodore was also in the college school a junior Next came two girls Caroline and Fanny and there were two little boys still younger Haughty self willed but of sufficiently honourable nature were the Yorkes If Lady Augusta had only toiled to foster the good and eradicate the evil they would have grown up to bless her Good soil was there to work upon as there was in the Channings but in the case of the Yorkes it was allowed to run to waste or to generate weeds In short to do as it pleased A noisy scrambling uncomfortable sort of home was that of the Yorkes the boys sometimes contending one with another Lady Augusta often quarrelling with all The home of the Channings was ever full of love calm and peace Can you guess where the difference lay On the morning when the college boys had gone up to crave holiday of the judges and had not obtained it at least not from the head master Arthur Channing proceeded as usual to mister Galloway s after breakfast Seated at a desk in his place writing he seemed to be ever seated there was mister Jenkins He lifted his head when Arthur entered with a Good morning sir and then dropped it again over his copying Good morning replied Arthur And at that moment mister Galloway his flaxen curls in full flow upon his head something like rings came forth from his private room Good morning sir Arthur added to his master mister Galloway nodded a reply to the salutation Have you seen anything of Yorke he asked I want that deed that he s about finished as soon as possible He will not be an instant said Arthur I saw him coming up the street Roland Yorke bustled in a dark young man of twenty one with large but fine features and a countenance expressive of indecision Come mister Yorke you promised to be here early to day You know that deed is being waited for So I am early sir returned Roland Early for you perhaps grunted mister Galloway Get to it at once Roland Yorke unlocked a drawer collected sundry parchments together and sat down to his desk He and Arthur had their places side by side mister Galloway stood at a table and began sorting some papers that were upon it How is mister Channing this morning Arthur Much as usual thank you sir Certain news which arrived last night has not tended to cheer him It is true then remarked mister Galloway I heard a rumour of it Oh it s true enough said Arthur It is in all the morning papers Well there never was a more unjust decision emphatically spoke mister Galloway Mark you I am not reflecting on the Lord Chancellor s judgment I have always said that there were one or two nasty points in that suit which the law might get hold of but I know the whole cause by heart from beginning to end and that money was as much your father s as this coat that I have on is mine Tell him I ll come in one of these fine evenings and abuse the injustice of our laws with him will you Yes sir replied Arthur What s this row in the college school about a destroyed surplice and the boys not getting their holiday through it resumed mister Galloway Oh are they not savage struck in Roland Yorke The first thing Tod did when he came home to breakfast was to fling over his bowl of coffee he was in such a passion Lady Augusta she came down to breakfast this morning for a wonder boxed his ears and ordered him to drink water but he went into the kitchen and made a lot of chocolate for himself What are the particulars How was it done I cannot understand it at all said mister Galloway Bywater left his clean surplice yesterday in the vestry and some one threw ink over it half soaked it in ink so the choristers told Tom answered Arthur Channing In the afternoon they had service late you know sir waiting for the judges Bywater was not in his place to sing the anthem and Hurst sang it and it put the master out very much Put him out all the more that he has no one to punish for it laughed Roland Yorke Of course Bywater couldn t appear in his stall and sing the anthem if he had no surplice to put on and the master couldn t tan him for not doing it I know this if it had happened while I was in the college school I d just have skinned some of the fellows alive but what I d have made them confess Suppose you had skinned the wrong party cynically observed mister Galloway You are too hasty with your tongue Roland Yorke My nephew Mark ran in just now to tell me of the holiday being denied and that was the first I had heard of the affair Mark thinks one of the seniors was in it not Gaunt Arthur Channing and Roland Yorke both looked up with a sharp quick gesture Gaunt excepted the only senior besides their respective brothers was Harry Huntley It is not likely sir said Arthur A senior do it scoffed Roland Yorke What a young idiot Mark Galloway must be to think that Mark does not seem to think much about it on his own account said mister Galloway He said Bywater thought so from some cause or other and has offered to bet the whole school that it will turn out to be a senior Does he though cried Yorke looking puzzled Bywater s a cautious fellow with his money he never bets at random I say sir 
6904_262305_000029_000006	train-clean-360	what else 
none	none	did Galloway tell you That was all replied mister Galloway And if you wonder at a staid old proctor chattering about this desultory news with his clerks in business hours it may be explained to you that mister Galloway took the greatest possible interest almost a boyish interest in the college school It was where he had been educated himself where his nephews were being educated he was on intimate terms with its masters knew every boy in it to speak to saw them troop past his house daily in their progress to and fro watched them in their surplices in a Sunday during morning and afternoon service was cognizant of their advancement their shortcomings their merits and their scrapes in fact the head master could not take a greater interest in the doings of the collegiate school than did mister Galloway Whether of work or whether of gossip his ears were ever open to listen to its records Besides they were not so overburdened with work in that office but that there was ample time for discussing any news that might be agreeable to its master His work was light his returns were heavy his stewardship alone brought him in several hundreds a year The Reverend mister Pye seems uncommonly annoyed about it sir mister Jenkins ventured to put in To interrupt or take part in any conversation was not usual with him unless he could communicate little tit bits of information touching the passing topic You are aware that mister Harper the lay clerk lodges at our house sir Well mister Pye came round last night especially to question him about it What could Harper tell asked mister Galloway He could not tell anything except that he would answer for the lay clerks knowing nothing of the transaction The master said he never supposed the lay clerks did know anything of it but he had his reasons for putting the question He had been to the masons too who are repairing the cathedral and they declared to the master one and all that they had not been into the vestry yesterday or even round to that side of the college where the vestry is situated Why should the master take it up so pertinaciously wondered Roland Yorke I m sure I don t know sir He was like one in a fever so excited over it Harper said Did he talk to you about it Jenkins asked mister Galloway I did not see him sir it was Harper told me afterwards was the reply of Jenkins as he subsided to his writing again Just at this juncture who should come in view of the window but the head master himself He was passing it with a quick step when out flew mister Galloway and caught him by the button Roland Yorke who was ever glad of a pretext for idleness rose from his stool and pushed his nose close up to the nearest pane to listen to any colloquy that might ensue but the window being open he might have heard without leaving his seat I hear the boys have not a holiday to day Pye began mister Galloway No that they have not emphatically pronounced the master and if they go on as they seem to be going on now I ll keep them without it for a twelvemonth I believe the inking of that surplice was a concocted plan look you Galloway to To what asked mister Galloway for the master stopped short Never mind just yet I have my strong suspicions as to the guilty boy and I am doing what I can to convert them into proofs If it be as I suspect now I shall expel him But what could it have been done for debated mister Galloway There s no point in the thing that I can see to ink and damage a surplice If the boy to whom it belonged had been inked one might not have wondered so much I ll point him cried the master if I catch the right one Could it have been one of the seniors returned the proctor all his strong interest awakened It was one who ought to have known better evasively returned the master I can t stop to talk now Galloway I have an errand to do and must be back to duty at ten He marched off quickly and mister Galloway came indoors again Is that the way you get on with your business mister Yorke Yorke clattered to his desk I ll get on with it sir I was listening to what the master said It does not concern you what he said It was not one of your brothers who did it I suppose No that it was not haughtily spoke Roland Yorke drawing up his head with a proud fierce gesture mister Galloway withdrew to his private room and for a few minutes silence supervened nothing was to be heard but the scratching of pens But Roland Yorke who had a great antipathy to steady work and as great a love for his own tongue soon began again I say Channing what an awful blow the dropping of that expected money must be for you fellows I m blest if I didn t dream of it last night If it spoilt my rest what must it have done by yours Why how could you have heard of it last night exclaimed Arthur in surprise I don t think a soul came to our house to hear the news except mister Yorke and you were not likely to see him He left late It is in every one s mouth this morning I had it from Hamish He came to the party at the Knivetts Didn t Hamish get taken in laughed Roland He understood it was quite a ladies affair and loomed in dressed up to the nines and there he found only a bachelor gathering of Dick s Hamish was disappointed I think he fancied he was going to meet Ellen Huntley and glum enough he looked He had only just heard of the loss interrupted Arthur Enough to make him look glum Rubbish It wasn t that He announced at once that the money was gone for good and all and laughed over it and said there were worse disasters at sea Knivett said he never saw a fellow carry ill news off with so high a hand Had he been proclaiming the accession of a fortune instead of the loss of one he could not have been more carelessly cheerful Channing what on earth shall you do about your articles A question that caused the greatest pain especially when put by Roland Yorke and Arthur s sensitive face flushed You ll have to stop as a paid clerk for interminable years Jenkins you ll have him for your bosom companion if you look sharp and make friends cried Roland laughing loudly No sir I don t think mister Arthur Channing is likely to become a paid clerk said Jenkins Not likely to become a paid clerk why he is one If he is not one I d like to know who is Channing you know you are nothing else I may be something else in time quietly replied Arthur who knew how to control his rebellious spirit I say what a rum go it is about that surplice exclaimed Roland Yorke dashing into another topic It s not exactly the mischief itself that s rum but the master seem to be making so much stir and mystery over it And then the hint at the seniors They must mean Huntley I don t know who they mean said Arthur but I am sure Huntley never did it He is too open too honourable And do you pretend to say that Tom Channing and my brother Ger are not honourable fiercely interrupted Roland Yorke There you go Yorke jumping to conclusions It is not to be credited that any one of the seniors did it still less if they had done it that they would not acknowledge it They are all boys of truth and honour so far as I believe Huntley I am sure is And of Tom also I conclude you feel sure Yes I do And I am sure of Ger Yorke So if the master is directing his suspicion to the seniors he ll get floored It s odd what can have turned it upon them I don t think the master suspects the seniors said Arthur He called them to his aid You heard what he just now said to Galloway Jenkins there is a knock at the door Jenkins went to open it He came back and said mister Yorke was wanted Roland lazily proceeded to the outer passage and when he saw who was standing there he put himself into a passion What do you mean by presuming to come to me here he haughtily asked Well sir perhaps you ll tell me where I am to come so as to get to see you civilly replied the applicant one who bore the appearance of a tradesman It seems it s of no use going to your house if I went ten times a day I should get the same answer that you are not at home Just

none	none	said Roland Not till you pay me or tell me for certain when you will pay me and keep your promise I want my money sir and I must have it We want a great many things that we can t get returned Roland in a provokingly light tone I ll pay you as soon as I can man you needn t be afraid I m not exactly afraid spoke the man I suppose if it came to it Lady Augusta would see that I had the money You hold your tongue about Lady Augusta What s Lady Augusta to you Any odds and ends that I may owe have nothing to do with Lady Augusta Look here Simms I ll pay you next week You have said that so many times mister Yorke At any rate I ll pay you part of it next week if I can t the whole I will upon my honour There now you know that I shall keep my word Apparently satisfied the man departed and Roland lounged into the office again with the same idle movements that he had left it It was that confounded Simms grumbled he Jenkins why did you say I was in You did not tell me to say the contrary sir He came yesterday but you were out then What does he want asked Arthur Wanted me to pay him a trifle I owe but it s not convenient to do it till next week What an Eden this lower world might be if debt had never been invented You need not get into debt said Arthur It is not compulsory One might build a mud hut outside the town walls and shut one s self up in it and eat herbs for dinner and sleep upon rushes and turn hermit for good retorted Roland You need not talk about debt Channing I don t owe much said Arthur noting the significance of Yorke s concluding sentence If you don t some one else does Who Ask Hamish Arthur went on writing with a sinking heart There was an undercurrent of fear running within him had been for some time that Hamish did owe money on his own private score But this allusion to it was not pleasant How much do you owe went on Roland Oh a twenty pound note would pay my debts and leave me something out of it said Arthur in a joking tone The fact was that he did not owe a shilling to any one Jenkins do you know what I am to set about next he continued I have filled in this lease Jenkins was beginning to look amidst some papers at his elbow in answer to the appeal but at that moment mister Galloway entered and despatched Arthur to get a cheque cashed at the bank CHAPTER VI LADY AUGUSTA YORKE AT HOME If you don t put away that trash Caroline and go upstairs and practise I ll make you go Strewing the table in that manner Look what a pickle the room is in The words came from Lady Augusta Yorke a tall dark woman with high cheek bones and they were spoken at a height that might not have been deemed orthodox at court Miss Caroline Yorke a young demoiselle with a net that was more frequently off her head than on it slip shod shoes and untidy stockings had placed a quantity of mulberry leaves on the centre table and a silkworm on each leaf She leisurely proceeded with her work bringing forth more silkworms from her paper trays paying not the least attention to her mother Lady Augusta advanced and treated her to a slight tap on the ear her favourite mode of correcting her children Now mamma What s that for Do you hear me you disobedient child I will have this rubbish put away I say Goodness Martha don t bring any one in here broke off Lady Augusta as a maid appeared showing in a visitor Oh it is you William I don t mind you Come in It was the Reverend William Yorke who entered He was not altogether a favourite of Lady Augusta s Though only distantly related to her late husband he yet bore the name of Yorke and when he came to Helstonleigh for he was not a native of the place and became a candidate for a vacant minor canonry Lady Augusta s pride had taken fire The minor canons were looked upon by the exclusives of the cathedral as holding a very inferior position amidst the clergy and she resented that one belonging to her should descend to set up his place amongst them mister Yorke shook hands with Lady Augusta and then turned to look at the leaves and silkworms Are you doing that for ornament Caroline Ornament wrathfully cried Lady Augusta She is doing it to waste time and to provoke me No I am not mamma denied Miss Caroline My poor silkworms never have anything but lettuce leaves Tod brought these for me from the bishop s garden and I am looking at the silkworms enjoying the change Tod is in hot water remarked mister Yorke He was fighting with another boy as I came through the cloisters Then he ll come home with his clothes torn as he did the last time he fought exclaimed Lady Augusta in consternation I think no one ever had such a set of children as mine she peevishly continued The boys boisterous as so many wild animals and the girls enough to drive one crazy with their idle disobedient ways Look at this room William encumbered from one end to the other things thrown out of hand by Caroline and Fanny As to lessons they never open one For three days I have never ceased telling Caroline to go and practise and she has not attempted to obey me I shall go out of my mind with one thing or another I know I shall Nice dunces they ll grow up Go and practise now Caroline said mister Yorke I will put your silkworms up for you 
6904_262291_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Caroline pouted 
none	none	I hate practising He laid his hand gently upon her gazing at her with his dark pleasant eyes reproachful now But you do not hate obeying your mamma You must never let it come to that Caroline She suffered him to lead her to the door went docilely enough to the drawing room and sat down to the piano Oh for a little better training for those children mister Yorke began placing the silkworms in the trays and Lady Augusta went on grumbling It is a dreadful fate to be left a widow with a heap of unruly children who will not be controlled I must find a governess for the girls and then I shall be free from them for a few hours in the day I thought I would try and save the money and teach them myself but I might just as well attempt to teach so many little wild Indians I am not fitted for teaching it is beyond me Don t you think you could hear of a governess William You go about so much I have heard of one since I saw you yesterday he replied A young lady whom you know is anxious to take a situation and I think she might suit you Whom I know cried Lady Augusta Who is it Miss Channing Lady Augusta looked up in astonishment Is she going out as governess That comes of losing this lawsuit She has lost no time in the decision When an unpalatable step has to be taken the sooner it is set about the less will be the cost remarked mister Yorke Unpalatable you may well say that This will be the climax will it not William Climax of what Of all the unpleasantness that has attended your engagement with Miss Channing I beg your pardon Lady Augusta was the interruption of mister Yorke No unpleasantness whatever has attended my engagement with Miss Channing I think so for I consider her beneath you and therefore that it is nothing but unpleasant from beginning to end The Channings are very well in their way but they are not equal to the Yorkes You might make this a pretext for giving her up mister Yorke laughed I think her all the more worthy of me The only question that is apt to arise within me is whether I am worthy of her As we shall never agree upon this point Lady Augusta it may not be worth while to discuss it About the other thing I believe she would make an admirable governess for Caroline and Fanny if you could obtain her Oh I dare say she would do that She is a lady and has been well educated Would she want a large salary Forty guineas a year to begin with Lady Augusta interrupted him with a scream I never could give half of it I am sure I never could What with housekeeping expenses and milliners bills and visiting and the boys everlastingly dragging money out of me I have scarcely anything to spare for education Yet it is more essential than all the rest Your income properly apportioned would afford Another scream from Lady Augusta Her son Theodore Tod familiarly burst into the room jacketless his hair entangled blood upon his face and his shirt sleeves in shreds You rebellious wicked fright of a boy was the salutation of my lady when she could recover breath Oh it s nothing mamma Don t bother replied Master Tod waving her off I have been going into Pierce senior and have polished him off with a jolly good licking He won t get me into a row again I ll bet What row did he get you into He s a nasty sneaking tattler and he took and told something to Gaunt and Gaunt put me up for punishment and I had a caning from old Pye I vowed I d pay Pierce out for it and I have done it though he is a sight bigger than me What was it about inquired mister Yorke The damaged surplice Damaged surplice be hanged politely retorted the young gentleman who in gaining the victory appeared to have lost his temper It was something concerning our lessons at the third desk if you must know You might be civil Tod said Lady Augusta Look at your shirt Who do you suppose is going to mend that It can go unmended responded Master Tod I wish it was the fashion to go without clothes They are always getting torn I wish it was heartily responded my lady That same evening in returning to her house from a visit Constance Channing encountered mister Yorke He turned to walk with her to the door I intended to call this afternoon Constance but was prevented from doing so he observed I have spoken to Lady Augusta Well she answered with a smile and a blush She would be very glad of you but the difficulty at first appeared to be about salary However I pointed out a few home truths and she admitted that if the girls were to be educated she supposed she must pay for it She will give you forty guineas a year but you are to call upon her and settle other details To morrow if it should be convenient to you Constance clasped her hands I am so pleased she exclaimed in a low tone So am I said mister Yorke I would rather you went to Lady Augusta s than to a stranger s And do Constance try and make those poor girls more what they ought to be That I shall try you may be sure William Are you not coming in No said mister Yorke who had held out his hand on reaching the door He was pretty constant in his evening visits to the Channings but he had made an engagement for this one with a brother clergyman Constance entered She looked in the study for her brothers but only Arthur was there He was leaning his elbow upon the table in a thoughtful mood Where are they all inquired Constance Tom and Charles have gone to the cricket match I don t think Hamish has come in Why did you not go to cricket also I don t know said Arthur I did not feel much inclination for cricket this evening You looked depressed Arthur but I have some good news for you Constance said bending over him with a bright smile It is settled about my going out and I am to have forty guineas a year Guess where it is to Arthur threw his arm round Constance and they stood together looking at the trailing honeysuckle just outside the window Tell me darling It is to Lady Augusta s William has been talking to her and she would like to have me Does it not seem lucky to find it so soon Lucky Constance Ah well you know what I think Arthur though I did say lucky returned Constance I know it is God who is helping us Very beautiful very touching was the simple trustfulness reposed in God by Constance and Arthur Channing The good seed had been sown on good ground and was bringing forth its fruit I was deep in a reverie when you interrupted me Constance Arthur resumed Something seems to whisper to me that this loss which we regard as a great misfortune may turn out for good in the end In the end It may have come for our good now said Constance Perhaps I wanted my pride lowered she laughed and this has come to do it and is despatching me out a meek governess Perhaps we all wanted it cried Arthur meaningly There are other bad habits it may stop besides pride He was thinking of Hamish and his propensity for spending Forty guineas you are to have Yes said Constance Arthur do you know a scheme that I have in my head I have been thinking of it all day What is it Stay here is some one coming in It is Hamish Hamish entered with the account books under his arm preparatory to going over them with his father Constance drew him to her Hamish I have a plan in my head if we can only carry it out I am going to tell it you One that will set the river on fire cried gay laughing Hamish If we you and I and Arthur can only manage to earn enough money and if we can observe strict economy at home who knows but we may send papa to the German baths yet A cloud came over Hamish s face and his smile faded I don t see how that is to be done But you have not heard of my good luck I am going to Lady Augusta s and am to have forty guineas a year Now if you and Arthur will help it may be easy Oh Hamish it would be worth any effort any struggle Think how it would be rewarded Papa restored to health to freedom from pain A look of positive pain seated itself on Hamish s brow Yes he sighed I wish it could be done But you do not speak hopefully Because if I must tell you the truth I do not feel hopefully I fear we could not do it at least until things are brighter If we do our very best we might receive great help Hamish What help he asked God s help she whispered Hamish smiled He had not yet learnt what Constance had Besides Hamish was just then in a little trouble on his own account he knew very well that his funds were wanted in another quarter Constance dear do not look at me so wistfully I will try with all my might and main to help my father but I fear I cannot do anything yet I mean to draw in my expenses he went on laughing to live like any old screw of a miser and never squander a halfpenny where a farthing will suffice He took his books and went in to mister Channing Constance began training the honeysuckle her mind busy and a verse of Holy Writ running through it Commit thy way unto the Lord and put thy trust in Him and He shall bring it to pass Ay she murmured glancing upwards at the blue evening sky our whole whole trust in patient reliance and whatsoever is best for us will be ours Annabel stole up to Constance and entwined her arms caressingly round her Constance turned and parted the child s hair upon her forehead with a gentle hand Am I to find a little rebel in you Annabel Will you not try and make things smooth for me Oh Constance dear was the whispered answer it was only my fun last night when I said you should not take me for lessons in an evening I will study all day by myself and get my lessons quite ready for you so as to give you no trouble in the evening Would you like to hear me my music now Constance bent to kiss her No dear child there is no necessity for my taking you in an evening until my days shall be occupied at Lady Augusta Yorke s CHAPTER VII mister KETCH missus Channing sat with her children Breakfast was over and she had the Bible open before her Never since their earliest years of understanding had she failed to assemble them together for a few minutes reading morning and evening Not for too long at once she knew the value of not tiring young children when she was leading them to feel an interest in sacred things She would take Hamish a little fellow of three years old upon her knee read to him a short Bible story suited to his age and then talk to him Talk to him in a soft loving gentle tone of God of Jesus of heaven of his duties in this world of what he must do to attain to everlasting peace in the next Day by day step by step untiringly unceasingly had she thus laboured to awaken good in the child s heart to train it to holiness to fill it with love of God As the other children came on in years she in like manner took them From simple Bible stories to more advanced Bible stories and thence to the Bible itself with other books at times and seasons a little reading a little conversation Gospel truths impressed upon them from her earnest lips Be you very sure that where this great duty of all duties is left unfulfilled by a mother a child is not brought up as it ought to be Win your child towards heaven in his early years and he will not forget it when he is old It will be as a very shield compassing him about through life He may wander astray there is no telling in the heyday of his hot blooded youth for the world s temptations are as a running fire scorching all that venture into its heat but the good foundation has been laid and the earnest incessant prayers have gone up and he will find his way home again missus Channing closed the Bible and spoke as usual It was all that teaching should be Good lessons as to this world loving pictures of that to come She had contrived to impress them not with the too popular notion that heaven was a far off place up in the skies some vague millions of miles away and to which we might be millions of years off but that it was very near to them that God was ever present with them and that Death when he came should be looked upon as a friend not an enemy Hamish was three and twenty years old now and he loved those minutes of instruction as he had done when a child They had borne their fruit for him and for all though not perhaps in an equal degree The reading over and the conversation over she gave the book to Constance to put away and the boys rose and prepared to enter upon their several occupations It was not the beginning of the day for Tom and Charles for they had been already to early school Is papa so very much worse to day mamma asked Tom I did not say he was worse Tom replied missus Channing I said he had passed a restless night and felt tired and weak Thinking over that confounded lawsuit cried hot thoughtless Tom Thomas reproved missus Channing I beg your pardon mamma Unorthodox words are the fashion in school and one catches them up I forget myself when I repeat them before you To repeat them before me is no worse than repeating them behind me Tom Tom laughed Very true mamma It was not a logical excuse But I am sure the news brought to us by the mail on Wednesday night is enough to put a saint out of temper Had there been anything unjust in it had the money not been rightly ours it would have been different but to be deprived of what is legally our own Not legally as it turns out struck in Hamish Justly then said Tom It s too bad especially as we don t know what we shall do without it Tom you are not to look at the dark side of things cried Constance in a pretty wilful commanding manner We shall do very well without it it remains to be proved whether we shall not do better than with it Children I wish to say a word to you upon this subject said missus Channing When the news arrived I was you know almost overwhelmed by it not seeing as Tom says what we were to do without the money In the full shock of the disappointment it wore for me its worst aspect a far more sombre one than the case really merited But now that I have had time to see it in its true light my disappointment has subsided I consider that we took a completely wrong view of it Had the decision deprived us of the income we enjoy then indeed it would have been grievous but in reality it deprives us of nothing Not one single privilege that we possessed before does it take from us not a single outlay will it cost us We looked to this money to do many things with but its not coming renders us no worse off than we were Expecting it has caused us to get behindhand with our bills which we must gradually pay off in the best way we can it takes from us the power to article Arthur and it straitens us in many ways for as you grow up you grow more expensive This is the extent of the ill except Oh mamma you forget The worst ill of all is that papa cannot now go to Germany I was about to say that Arthur But other means for his going thither may be found Understand me my dears I do not see any means or chance of means at present you must not fancy that but it is possible that they may arise with the time of need One service at any rate the decision has rendered me Service echoed Tom Yes smiled missus Channing It has proved to me that my children are loving and dutiful Instead of repining as some might they are already seeking how they may make up themselves for the money that has not come And Constance begins it Don t fear us mother cried Hamish with his sunny smile We will be of more use to you yet than the money would have been They dispersed Hamish to his office Arthur to mister Galloway s Tom and Charles to the cloisters that famous playground of the college school Stolen pleasures it is said are sweetest and just because there had been a stir lately amongst the cathedral clergy touching the desirability of forbidding the cloisters to the boys for play so much the more eager were they to frequent them As Arthur was going down Close Street he encountered mister Williams the cathedral organist striding along with a roll of music in his hand He was Arthur s music master When Arthur Channing was in the choir a college schoolboy he had displayed considerable taste for music and it was decided that he should learn the organ He had continued to take lessons after he left the choir and did so still I was thinking of coming round to speak to you to day mister Williams What about asked the organist Anything pressing Well you have heard of course that that suit is given against us so I don t mean to continue the organ They have said nothing to me at home but it is of no use spending money that might be saved But I see you are in too great a hurry to stay to talk now Hurry I am hurried off my legs cried the organist If a dozen or two of my pupils would give up learning as you talk of doing I should only be obliged to them I have more work than I can attend to And now Jupp must go and lay himself up and I have the services to attend myself morning and afternoon mister Jupp was assistant organist An apprentice to mister Williams but just out of his time What s the matter with Jupp asked Arthur A little bit of fever and a great deal of laziness responded mister Williams He is the laziest fellow alive Since his uncle died and that money came to him he doesn t care a straw how things go He was copyist to the cathedral and he gave that up last week I have asked Sandon the lay clerk if he will take the copying but he declines He is another lazy one The organist hurried off Arthur strove to detain him for another word or two but it was of no use So he continued his way to mister Galloway s Busy enough were his thoughts there His fingers were occupied with writing but his mind went roaming without leave This post of copyist of music to the cathedral which appeared to be going begging why should not he undertake it if mister Williams would give it to him He was quite able to do so and though he very much disliked music copying that was nothing he was not going to set up dislikes and humour them He had only a vague idea what might be the remuneration ten or twelve or fifteen pounds a year he fancied it might bring in Better that than nothing it would be a beginning to follow in the wake that Constance had commenced and he could do it of an evening or at other odd times I won t lose an hour in asking for it thought Arthur At one o clock when he was released from the office he ran through the Boundaries to the cloisters intending to pass through them on his way to the house of the organist that being rather a nearer road to it than if he had gone round the town The sound of the organ however struck upon his ear causing him to assume that it was the organist who was playing Arthur tried the cathedral door found it open and went it It was mister Williams He had been trying some new music and rose from the organ as Arthur reached the top of the stairs no very pleasant expression on his countenance What is the matter asked Arthur perceiving that something had put him out I hate ingratitude responded mister Williams Jenkins he called out to the old bedesman who had been blowing for him you may go to your dinner I shan t want you any more now Old Jenkins hobbled down from the organ loft and mister Williams continued to Arthur Would you believe that Jupp has withdrawn himself utterly From the college exclaimed Arthur From the college and from me His father comes to me an hour ago and says he is sure Jupp s in a bad state of health and he intends to send him to his relatives in the Scotch mountains for some months to try and brace him up Not a word of apology for leaving me at a pinch It will be very inconvenient for you said Arthur I suppose that new apprentice of yours is of no use yet for the services Use irascibly retorted mister Williams he could not play a psalm if it were to save his life I depended upon Jupp It was an understood thing that he should remain with me as assistant had it not been I should have taken good care to bring somebody on to replace him As to attending the services on week days myself it is next door to an impossibility If I do my teaching will be ruined I wish I was at liberty said Arthur I would take them for you Look here Channing said the organist Since I had this information of old Jupp s my brain has been worrying itself pretty well as you may imagine Now there s no one I would rather trust to take the week day services than you for you are fully capable and I have trained you into my own style of playing I never could get Jupp entirely into it he is too fond of noise and flourishes It has struck me that perhaps mister Galloway might spare you his office is not overdone with work and I would make it worth your while Arthur somewhat bewildered at the proposal sat down on one of the stools and stared You will not be offended at my saying this I speak in consequence of your telling me this morning you could not afford to go on with your lessons continued the organist But for that I should not have thought of proposing such a thing to you What capital practice it would be for you too The best proof to convince you I am not offended is to tell you what brings me here now said Arthur in a cordial tone I understood this morning that you were at a loss for some one to undertake the copying of the cathedral music I have come to ask you to give it to me You may have it and welcome said mister Williams That s nothing I want to know about the services It would take me an hour morning and afternoon from the office debated Arthur I wonder whether mister Galloway would let me go an hour earlier and stay an hour later to make up for it You can put the question to him I dare say he will especially as he is on terms of friendship with your father I would give you let me see deliberated the organist falling into a musing attitude twelve pounds a quarter Say fifty pounds a year if you stay with me so long And you should have nothing to do with the choristers I d practise them myself Arthur s face flushed It was a great temptation and the question flashed into his mind whether it would not be well to leave mister Galloway s as his prospects there appeared to be blighted and embrace this if that gentleman declined to allow him the necessary hours of absence Fifty pounds a year And he spoke unconsciously aloud there would be the copying besides Oh that s not much cried the organist That s paid by the sheet I should like it excessively exclaimed Arthur Well just turn it over in your mind But you must let me know at once Channing by to morrow at the latest If you cannot take it I must find some one else Arthur Channing went out of the cathedral hardly knowing whether he stood on his head or his heels Constance said that God would help us was his grateful thought Such a whirlwind of noise Arthur when he reached the cloisters found himself in the midst of the college boys who were just let out of school Leaping shouting pushing scuffling playing contending Arthur had not so very long ago been a college boy himself and enjoyed the fun How are you old fellows jolly They gathered around him Arthur was a favourite with them had been always when he was in the school The elder boys loftily commanded off the juniors who had to retire to a respectful distance I say Channing there s the stunningest go began Bywater dancing a triumphant hornpipe You know Jupp Well he has been and sent in word to Williams that he is going to die or something of that sort and it s necessary he should be off on the spree to get himself well again Old Jupp came this morning just as college was over and said it and Williams is in the jolliest rage going to be left without any one to take the organ It will just pay him out for being such a tyrant to us choristers Perhaps I am going to take it returned Arthur You what a cram It is not indeed said Arthur I shall take it if I can get leave from mister Galloway Williams has just asked me Is that true Arthur burst forth Tom Channing elbowing his way to the front Now Tom should I say it if it were not true I only hope mister Galloway will throw no difficulty in my way And do you mean to say that you are going to be cock over us choristers asked Bywater No thank you laughed Arthur mister Williams will best fill that honour Bywater has the mystery of the inked surplice come to light No and be shot to it The master s in a regular way over it though and And what do you think eagerly interrupted Tod Yorke whose face was ornamented with several shades of colour blue green and yellow the result of the previous day s pugilistic encounter my brother Roland heard the master say he suspected one of the seniors Arthur Channing looked inquiringly at Gaunt The latter tossed his head haughtily Roland Yorke must have made some mistake he observed to Arthur It is perfectly out of the question that the master can suspect a senior I can t imagine where the school could have picked up the notion Gaunt was standing with Arthur as he spoke and the three seniors Channing Huntley and Yorke happened to be in a line facing them Arthur regarded them one by one You don t look very like committing such a thing as that any one of you he laughed It is curious where the notion can have come from Such absurdity ejaculated Gerald Yorke As if it were likely Pye would suspect one of us seniors It s not credible Not at all credible that you would do it said Arthur Had it been the result of accident of course you would have hastened to declare it any one of you three As Arthur spoke he involuntarily turned his eyes on the sea of faces behind the three seniors as if searching for signs in some countenance among them by which he might recognize the culprit My goodness uttered the senior boy to Arthur Had any one of those three done such a thing accident or no accident and not declared it he d get his name struck off the rolls A junior may be pardoned for things that a senior cannot Besides there d be the losing his chance of the seniorship and of the exhibition cried one from the throng of boys in the rear How are you progressing for the seniorship asked Arthur of the three Which of you stands the best chance I think Channing does freely spoke up Harry Huntley Why Because our progress is so equal that I don t think one will get ahead of another so that the choice cannot be made that way and Channing s name stands first on the rolls Who is to know if they ll give us fair play and no humbug said Tom Channing If they do it will be what they have never given yet exclaimed Stephen Bywater Kissing goes by favour Ah but I heard that the dean At this moment a boy dashed into the throng scattering it right and left Where are your eyes he whispered Close upon them was the dean Arm in arm with him in his hat and apron walked the Bishop of Helstonleigh The boys stood aside and took off their trenchers The dean merely raised his hand in response to the salutation he appeared to be deep in thought but the bishop nodded freely among them I heard that the dean found fault the last time the exhibition fell and said favour should never be shown again so long as he was Dean of Helstonleigh said Harry Huntley when the clergy were beyond hearing continuing the sentence he had been interrupted in I say that with fair play it will be Channing s failing Channing it will be mine failing me it will be Yorke s Now then retorted Gerald Yorke Why should you have the chance before me pray Huntley laughed Only that my name heads yours on the rolls Once in three years there fell an exhibition for Helstonleigh College school to send a boy to Oxford It would be due the following Easter Gaunt declined to compete for it he would leave the school at Michaelmas and it was a pretty generally understood thing that whichever of the three mentioned boys should be appointed senior in his place would be presented with the exhibition Channing and Yorke most ardently desired to gain it both of them from the same motive want of funds at home to take them to the university If Tom Channing did not gain it he was making up his mind to pocket pride and go as a servitor Yorke would not have done such a thing for the world all the proud Yorke blood would be up in arms at one of their name appearing as a servitor at Oxford No If Gerald Yorke should lose the exhibition Lady Augusta must manage to screw out funds to send him He and Tom Channing were alike designed for the Church Harry Huntley had no such need the son of a gentleman of good property the exhibition was of little moment to him in a pecuniary point of view indeed a doubt had been whispered amongst the boys whether mister Huntley would allow Harry to take advantage of it if he did gain it for he was a liberal minded and just man Harry of course desired to be the successful one for fame s sake just as ardently as did Channing and Yorke I m blessed if here isn t that renowned functionary Jack Ketch The exclamation came from young Galloway Limping in at one of the cloister doors came the cloister porter a surly man of sixty whose temper was not improved by periodical attacks of lumbago He and the college boys were open enemies The porter would have rejoiced in denying them the cloisters altogether and nothing had gladdened his grim old heart like the discussion which was said to have taken place between the dean and chapter concerning the propriety of shutting out the boys and their noise from the cloisters as a playground He bore an unfortunate name Ketch and the boys you may be very sure did not fail to take advantage of it joining to it sundry embellishments more pointed than polite He came up a ragged gig whip in his hand which he was fond of smacking round the throng of boys He had never yet ventured to touch one of them and perhaps it was just as well for him that he had not Now you boys be off with your hullabaloo Is this a decent noise to make around gentlefolks doors You don t know may be as doctor Burrows is in town doctor Burrows happened to live in a house which had a door opening to the cloisters The boys retorted The worst they gave mister Ketch was chaff but his temper could bear anything better than that especially if it was administered by the senior boy Dear me who s this began Gaunt in a tone of ultra politeness Boys do you see this gentleman who condescends to accost us I really believe it is Sir John Ketch What s that in his hand a piece of rope Surely mister Ketch you have not been turning off that unfortunate prisoner who was condemned yesterday Rather hasty work sir was it not mister Ketch foamed I tell you what it is sir You be the senior boy and instead of restraining these wicked young reptiles you edges em on Take care young gent as I don t complain of you to the dean Seniors have been hoisted afore now Have they really Well you ought to know mister Calcraft There s the dean just gone out of the cloisters if you make haste Calcraft you ll catch him up Put your best foot foremost and ask him if he won t report mister Gaunt for punishment The porter could have danced with rage and his whip was smacking ominously He did not dare advance it too near the circle when the senior boy was present or indeed when any of the elder boys were How s your lumbago mister Ketch demanded Stephen Bywater I d advise you to get rid of that before the next time you go on duty it might be in your way you know Never was such a thing heard of as for the chief toppler off of the three kingdoms to be disabled in his limbs What would you do I m afraid you d be obliged to resign your post and sink into private life Now I just vow to goodness as I ll do all I can to get these cloisters took from you boys shrieked old Ketch clasping his hands together There s insults as flesh and blood can t stand and as sure as I m living I ll pay you out for it He turned tail and hobbled off as he spoke and the boys raised three groans for Jack Ketch and then rushed away by the other entrance to their own dinners The fact was the porter had brought ill will upon himself through his cross grained temper He had no right whatever to interfere between the boys and the cloisters it was not his place to do so The king s scholars knew this and being spirited king s scholars as they were would not stand it Tom said Arthur Channing don t say anything at home about the organ Wait and see if I get it first Charley did not hear he was ordered off with the juniors CHAPTER VIII THE ASSISTANT ORGANIST Things often seem to go by the rule of contrary Arthur returned to the office at two o clock brimful of the favour he was going to solicit of mister Galloway but he encountered present disappointment For the first time for many weeks mister Galloway did not make his appearance in the office at all he was out the whole of the afternoon Roland Yorke to whom Arthur confided the plan ridiculed it Catch me taking such a task upon myself If I could play the organ like a Mendelssohn and send the folks into ecstasies I d never saddle myself with the worry of doing it morning and afternoon You ll soon be sick of the bargain Channing I should never be sick of it if I did it for nothing I am too fond of music for that And it will be a very easy way of earning money Not so easy as making your mother stump up was the reply And if your refinement turns from the expression my good reader I am sorry you should have to read it but it is what mister Roland Yorke said I had a regular scene with Lady Augusta this morning It s the most unreasonable thing in the world you know Channing for her to think I can live without money and so I told her said I must and would have it in fact Did you get it Of course I did I wanted to pay Simms and one or two more trifles that were pressing I was not going to have the fellow here after me again I wish such a thing as money had never been invented You may as well wish we could live without eating So I do sometimes when I go home expecting a good dinner and there s only some horrid cold stuff upon the table There never was a worse housekeeper than Lady Augusta It s my belief our servants must live like fighting cocks for I am sure the bills are heavy enough and we don t get the benefit of them What made you so late this afternoon asked Arthur I went round to pay Simms for one thing and then I called in upon Hamish and stayed talking with him Wasn t he in a sea of envy when I told him I had been scoring off that Simms He wished he could do the same Hamish does not owe anything to Simms cried Arthur with hasty retort Doesn t he laughed Roland Yorke That s all you know about it Ask him yourself If you please sir interposed mister Jenkins at this juncture I shall soon be waiting for that paper mister Galloway directed me to send it off by post Bother the paper returned Roland but nevertheless he applied himself to complete it He was in the habit of discoursing upon private topics before Jenkins without any reserve regarding him as a perfect nonentity When Arthur went home in the evening he found mister Galloway sitting with his father Well cried the proctor as Arthur entered and who has been at the office this afternoon No one in particular sir Oh yes there was though I forgot The dean looked in and wanted to see you What did he want He did not say sir He told Jenkins it would do another time Arthur left his father and mister Galloway together He did not broach the subject that was uppermost in his heart Gifted with rare delicacy of feeling he would not speak to mister Galloway until he could see him alone To prefer the request in his father s presence might have caused mister Galloway more trouble in refusing it I can t think what has happened to Arthur this evening exclaimed one of them His spirits are up to fever heat Tell us what it is Arthur Arthur laughed I hope they will not be lowered to freezing point within the next hour that s all When he heard mister Galloway leaving he hastened after him and overtook him in the Boundaries I wanted to say a few words to you sir if you please Say on said mister Galloway Why did you not say them indoors I scarcely know how I shall say them now sir for it is a very great favour that I have to ask you and you may be angry perhaps at my thinking you might grant it You want a holiday I suppose
6904_262291_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no 
none	none	sir nothing of that sort I want Well cried mister Galloway surprised at his hesitation but now that the moment of preferring the request had come Arthur shrank from doing it Could you allow me sir would it make very much difference to allow me to come to the office an hour earlier and remain in it an hour later stammered Arthur What for exclaimed mister Galloway with marked surprise I have had an offer made me sir to take the cathedral organ at week day service I should very much like to accept it if it could be managed Why where s Jupp uttered mister Galloway Jupp has resigned He is ill and is going out for his health I ll tell you how it all happened went on Arthur losing diffidence now that he was fairly launched upon his subject Of course this failure of the suit makes a great difference to our prospects at home it renders it incumbent upon us to do what we can to help Why does it interrupted mister Galloway It may make a difference to your future ease but it makes none to your present means There is money wanted in many ways sir a favourable termination to the suit was counted upon so certainly For one thing it is necessary that my father should try the German baths Of course he must try them cried mister Galloway But it will cost money sir deprecated Arthur Altogether we have determined to do what we can Constance has set us the example by engaging herself as daily governess at Lady Augusta s She goes on Monday Very commendable of her observed the proctor who loved a gossip like any old woman I hope she ll not let those two unruly girls worry her to death And I was casting about in my mind this morning what I could do to help when I met the organist proceeded Arthur He chanced to say that he could find no one to take the music copying Well sir I thought it over and at one o clock I went to ask him to give it to me I found him at the organ in a state of vexation Jupp had resigned his post and mister Williams had no one to replace him The long and the short of it is sir that he offered it to me And did you accept it crossly responded mister Galloway Of course I could not do that sir until I had spoken to you If it were possible that I could make up the two hours to you I should be very glad to take it And do it for nothing I suppose Oh no He would give me fifty pounds a year And there would be the copying besides That s a great deal cried mister Galloway It appears to me to be good pay replied Arthur But he would lose a great deal more than that if he had to attend the cathedral himself He said it would ruin his teaching Ah self interest two for himself and one for you ejaculated the proctor What does mister Channing say I have said nothing at home It was of no use telling them until I had spoken to you Now that my prospects are gone What prospects interrupted mister Galloway My articles to you sir Of course there s no chance of that now mister Galloway grunted The ruin that Chancery suits work Mark you Arthur Channing this is such a thing as was never asked a proctor before leave of absence for two hours in the best part of the day If I grant it it will be out of the great friendship I bear your father Oh sir I shall never forget the obligation Take care you don t You must come and work for two hours before breakfast in a morning Willingly readily exclaimed Arthur Channing his face glowing Then may I really tell mister Williams that I can accept it If I don t say yes I suppose you d magnify me into a sullen old bear as bad as Ketch the porter You may accept it Stop thundered mister Galloway coming to a dead standstill Arthur was startled What now sir Are you to be instructor to those random animals the choristers Oh no I shall have nothing to do with that Very good If you had taken to them I should have recommended you to guard against such a specimen of singing as was displayed the other day before the judges Arthur laughed spoke a word of heartfelt thanks and took his way off hand to the residence of the organist as light as any bird I have obtained leave mister Williams I may take your offer he exclaimed with scant ceremony when he found himself in that gentleman s presence who was at tea with his wife mister Galloway has authorized me to accept it How do you do missus Williams That s a great weight off my mind then cried the organist I set that dolt of an apprentice of mine to play the folks out of college this afternoon when service was over and of all performances Six mistakes he made in three bars and broke down at last I could have boxed his ears The dean was standing below when I went down Who was that playing mister Williams he demanded So I told him about Jupp s ill behaviour in leaving me and that I had offered the place to you But is Channing quite competent cried he for you know what a fine ear for music the dean has besides he added is he not at Galloway s I said we hoped mister Galloway would spare you and that I would answer for your competency So mind Channing you must put on the steam and not disgrace my guarantee I don t mean the steam of noise or that you should go through the service with all the stops out Arthur laughed and declining the invitation to remain and take tea he went out He was anxious to declare the news at home A few steps on his road he overtook Hamish Where do you spring from exclaimed Hamish passing his arm within Arthur s From concluding an agreement that will bring me in fifty pounds a year said Arthur Gammon Master Arthur It is not gammon Hamish It is sober truth Hamish turned and looked at him aroused by something in the tone And what are you to do for it Just pass a couple of hours a day delighting my own ears and heart Do you remember what Constance said last night Hamish it is wonderful that this help should so soon have come to me Stay Where are you going interrupted Hamish as Arthur was turning into a side street This is the nearest way home I had rather not go that way Why exclaimed Arthur in surprise Hamish how funny you look What is the matter Must I tell you It is for your ear alone mind There s a certain tradesman s house down there that I d rather not pass he has a habit of coming out and dunning me Do you remember mister Dick Swiveller Hamish laughed gaily He would have laughed on his road to prison it was in his nature But Arthur seemed to take a leap from his high ropes Is it Simms he breathed No it is not Simms Who has been telling you anything about Simms Arthur It is not so very much that I owe Simms What is this good luck of yours Arthur did not immediately reply A dark shadow had fallen upon his spirit as a forerunner of evil CHAPTER IX HAMISH S CANDLES Old Judith sat in her kitchen Her hands were clasped upon her knees and her head was bent in thought Rare indeed was it to catch Judith indulging in a moment s idleness She appeared to be holding soliloquy with herself It s the most incomprehensible thing in the world I have heard of ghosts and talking about ghosts that child was in a tremor last night again I m sure he was Brave little heart he goes up to bed in the dark on purpose to break himself of the fear I went in for them shirts missis told me of and he started like anything and his face turned white He hadn t heard me till I was in the room I d no candle and twas enough to startle him Oh is it you Judith said he quietly making believe to be as indifferent as may be I struck a light for I couldn t find the shirts and then I saw his white face He can t overget the fear twas implanted in him in babyhood and I only wish I could get that wicked girl punished as I d punish her for it was her work But about the t other I have heard of ghosts walking though thank goodness I m not frightened at em like the child is but for a young man to go upstairs night after night pretending to go to rest and sitting up till morning light is what I never did hear on If it was once in a way twould be a different thing but it s always I m sure it s pretty nigh a year since Why Judith you are in a brown study The interruption came from Constance who had entered the kitchen to give an order Judith looked up I m in a peck of trouble Miss Constance And the worst is I don t know whether to tell about it or to keep it in He d not like it to get to the missis s ears I know but then you see perhaps I ought to tell her for his sake Constance smiled Would you like to tell me instead of mamma Charley has been at some mischief again among the saucepans Burnt out more bottoms perhaps Not he the darling resentfully rejoined Judith The burning out of that one was enough for him I m sure he took contrition to himself as if it had been made of gold What is it then Well said Judith looking round as if fearing the walls would hear and speaking mysteriously it s about mister Hamish I don t know but I will tell you Miss Constance and it ll be so far a weight off my mind I was just saying to myself that I had heard of ghosts walking but what mister Hamish does every blessed night I never did hear of in all my born days Constance felt a little startled What does he do she hastily asked You know Miss Constance my bedroom s overhead above the kitchen here and being built out on the side I can see the windows at the back of the house from it as we can see em from this kitchen window for the matter of that if we put our heads out About a twelvemonth ago I m sure its not far short of it I took to notice that the light in mister Hamish s chamber wasn t put out so soon as it was in the other rooms So one night when I was half crazy with that face ache you remember my having it Miss Constance and knew I shouldn t get to sleep if I lay down I thought I d just see how long he kept it in Would you believe Miss Constance that at three o clock in the morning his light was still burning Well said Constance feeling the tale was not half told I thought what on earth could he be after I might have feared that he had got into bed and left it alight by mistake but that I saw his shadow once or twice pass the blind Well I didn t say a word to him next day I thought he might not like it but my mind wouldn t be easy and I looked out again and I found that night after night that light was in Miss Constance I thought I d trick him so I took care to put just about an inch of candle in his bed candlestick and no more but law bless me when folks is bent on forbidden things it is not candle ends that will stop em I suppose you mean that the light burnt still in spite of your inch of candle said Constance It just did returned Judith He gets into my kitchen and robs my candle box I thought to myself So I counted my candles and marked em and I found I was wrong for they wasn t touched But one day when I was putting his cupboard to rights I came upon a paper right at the back Two great big composite candles it had in it and another half burnt away Oh this is where you keep your store my young master is it I thought They were them big round things which seems never to burn to an end three to the pound Constance made no reply Judith gathered breath and continued I took upon myself to speak to him I told him it wasn t well for anybody s health to sit up at night in that fashion not counting the danger he ran of setting the house on fire and burning us all to cinders in our beds He laughed you know his way Miss Constance and said he d take care of his health and of the house and I was just to make myself easy and hold my tongue and that I need not be uneasy about fire for I could open my window and drop into the rain water barrel and there I should be safe But in spite of his joking tone there ran through it a sound of command and from that hour to this I have never opened my lips about it to anybody living And he burns the light still Except Saturday and Sunday nights it s always alight longer or shorter Them two nights he gets into bed respectable as the rest of the house do You have noticed Miss Constance that the evenings he is not out he ll go up to his chamber by half past nine or ten Frequently assented Constance As soon as the reading is over he will wish us good night Well them nights when he goes up early he puts his light out sooner by twelve or by half past or by one but when he spends his evenings out not getting home until eleven he ll have it burning till two or three in the morning What can he sit up for involuntarily exclaimed Constance I don t know unless it is that the work at the office is too heavy for him said Judith He has his own work to do there and master s as well It is not at all heavy said Constance There is an additional clerk since papa s illness you know It cannot be that It has to do with the office books for certain returned Judith Why else is he so particular in taking em into his room every night He takes them for safety spoke Constance in a very hesitating manner as if not feeling perfectly assured of the grounds for her assertion Maybe sniffed Judith in disbelief It can t be that he sits up to read she resumed Nobody in their senses would do that Reading may be pleasant to some folks especially them story books but sleep is pleasanter This last two or three blessed nights since that ill news come to make us miserable I question if he has gone to bed at all for his candle has only been put out when daylight came to shame it But Judith how do you know all this exclaimed Constance after a few minutes reflection You surely don t sit up to watch the light Pretty fit I should be for my work in the morning if I did No Miss Constance I moved my bed round to the other corner so as I could see his window as I lay in it and I have got myself into a habit of waking up at all hours and looking Truth to say I m not easy fire is sooner set alight than put out and if there s the water butt for me to drop into there ain t water butts for the rest of the house Very true murmured Constance speaking as if she were in reflection Nobody knows the worry this has been upon my mind resumed Judith Every night when I have seen his window alight I have said to myself I ll tell my mistress of this when morning comes but when the morning has come my resolution has failed me It might worry her and anger mister Hamish and do no good after all If he really has not time for his books in the day why he must do em at night I suppose it would never do for him to fall off and let the master s means drop through What ought to be done Miss Constance I really do not know Judith replied Constance You must let me think about it She fell into an unpleasant reverie The most feasible solution she could come to was the one adopted by Judith that Hamish passed his nights at the books If so how sadly he must idle away his time in the day Did he give his hours up to nonsense and pleasure And how could he contrive to hide his shortcomings from mister Channing Constance was not sure whether the books went regularly under the actual inspection of mister Channing or whether Hamish went over them aloud If only the latter could the faults be concealed She knew nothing of book keeping and was unable to say Leaving her to puzzle over the matter we will return to Hamish himself We left him in the last chapter you may remember objecting to go down a certain side street which would have cut off a short distance of their road his excuse to Arthur being that a troublesome creditor of his lived in it The plea was a true one Not to make a mystery of it it may as well be acknowledged that Hamish had contracted some debts and that he found it difficult to pay them They were not many and a moderate sum would have settled them but that moderate sum Hamish did not possess Let us give him his due But that he had fully counted upon a time of wealth being close at hand it is probable that he never would have contracted them When Hamish erred it was invariably from thoughtlessness from carelessness never from deliberate intention Arthur of course turned from the objectionable street and continued his straightforward course They were frequently hindered the streets were always crowded at assize time and acquaintances continually stopped them Amongst others they met Roland Yorke Are you coming round to Cator s to night he asked of Hamish Not I returned Hamish with his usual gay laugh I am going to draw in my expenses and settle down into a miser Moonshine cried Roland Is it moonshine though It is just a little bit of serious fact Yorke When lord chancellors turn against us and dash our hopes we can t go on as though the exchequer had no bottom to it It will cost you nothing to come to Cator s He is expecting one or two fellows and has laid in a prime lot of Manillas Evening visiting costs a great deal one way or another returned Hamish and I intend to drop most of mine for the present You needn t stare so Yorke I am staring at you Drop evening visiting Any one dropping that may expect to be in a lunatic asylum in six months What a prospect for me laughed Hamish Will you come to Cator s No thank you Then you are a muff retorted Roland as he went on It was dusk when they reached the cathedral I wonder whether the cloisters are still open Arthur exclaimed It will not take a minute to ascertain said Hamish If not we must go round They found the cloisters still unclosed and passed in Gloomy and sombre were they at that evening hour So sombre that in proceeding along the west quadrangle the two young men positively started when some dark figure glided from within a niche and stood in their way Whose ghost are you cried Hamish A short covert whistle of surprise answered him You here cried the figure in a tone of excessive disappointment What brings you in the cloisters so late Hamish dextrously wound him towards what little light was cast from the graveyard and discerned the features of Hurst Half a dozen more figures brought themselves out of the niches Stephen Bywater young Galloway Tod Yorke Harrison Hall and Berkeley Let me alone mister Hamish Channing Hush Don t make a row What mischief is going on Hurst asked Hamish Well whatever it may have been it strikes me you have stopped it was Hurst s reply I say wasn t there the Boundaries for you to go through without coming bothering into the cloisters I am sorry to have spoiled sport laughed Hamish I should not have liked it done to me when I was a college boy Let us know what the treason was You won t tell No if it is nothing very bad Honour bright Stop a bit Hurst hastily interposed Bywater There s no knowing what he may think very bad Give generals not particulars Here the fellow comes I do believe It was only a trick we were going to play old Ketch whispered Hurst Come out quickly better that he should not hear us or it may spoil sport for another time Gently boys Hurst and the rest stole round the cloisters and out at the south door Hamish and Arthur followed more leisurely and less silently Ketch came up Who s this here a haunting the cloisters at this time o night Who be you I ask The cloisters are free until they are closed Ketch cried Hamish Nobody haven t no right to pass through em at this hour except the clergy theirselves grumbled the porter We shall have them boys a playing in em at dark next You should close them earlier if you want to keep them empty returned Hamish Why don t you close them at three in the afternoon The porter growled He knew that he did not dare to close them before dusk almost dark and he knew that Hamish knew it too and therefore he looked upon the remark as a quiet bit of sarcasm I wish the dean ud give me leave to shut them boys out of em he exclaimed It ud be a jovial day for me Hamish and Arthur passed out wishing him good night He did not reply to it but banged the gate on their heels locked it and turned to retrace his steps through the cloisters The college boys who had hidden themselves from his view came forward again He has got off scot free to night but perhaps he won t do so to morrow cried Bywater Were you going to set upon him asked Arthur We were not going to put a finger upon him I give you my word we were not said Hurst What then were you going to do But the boys would not be caught It might stop fun you know mister Hamish You might get telling your brother Tom and Tom might let it out to Gaunt and Gaunt might turn crusty and forbid it We were going to serve the fellow out but not to touch him or to hurt him and that s enough As you please said Hamish He is a surly old fellow He is an old brute he s a dog in a kennel he deserves hanging burst from the throng of boys What do you think he went and did this afternoon added Hurst to the two Channings He sneaked up to the dean with a wretched complaint of us boys which hadn t a word of truth in it not a syllable I assure you He did it only because Gaunt had put him in a temper at one o clock The dean did not listen to him that s one good thing How jolly he d have been just at this moment if you two had not come up Wouldn t he boys The boys burst into a laugh roar upon roar peal upon peal shrieking and holding their sides till the very Boundaries echoed again Laughing is infectious and Hamish and Arthur shrieked out with them not knowing in the least what they were laughing at But Arthur was heavy at heart in the midst of it Do you owe much money Hamish he inquired after they had left the boys and were walking soberly along under the quiet elm trees More than I can pay old fellow just at present was the answer But is it much Hamish No it is not much taking it in the abstract Quite a trifling sum Arthur caught at the word trifling it seemed to dissipate his fears Had he been alarming himself for nothing Is it ten pounds Hamish Ten pounds repeated Hamish in a tone of mockery That would be little indeed Is it fifty I dare say it may be A pound here and a pound there and a few pounds elsewhere yes taking it altogether I expect it would be fifty And how much more thought Arthur to himself You said it was a trifling sum Hamish Well fifty pounds is not a large sum Though of course we estimate sums like other things by comparison You can understand now why I was not sanguine with regard to Constance s hopeful project of helping my father to get to the German baths I the eldest who ought to be the first to assist in it am the least likely to do so I don t know how I managed to get into debt mused Hamish It came upon me imperceptibly it did indeed I depended so entirely upon that money falling to us that I grew careless and would often order things which I was not in need of Arthur since that news came I have felt overwhelmed with worry and botheration I wish you were free If wishes were horses we should all be on horseback How debts grow upon you Hamish continued changing his light tone for a graver one Until within the last day or two when I have thought it necessary to take stock of outstanding claims I had no idea I owed half so much What shall you do about it That is more easily asked than answered My own funds are forestalled for some time to come And the worst is that now this suit is known to have terminated against us people are not so willing to wait as they were before I have had no end of them after me to day How shall you contrive to satisfy them Satisfy them in some way I must But how I ask Hamish Rob some bank or other replied Hamish in his off hand joking way Shall you speak to my father Where s the use returned Hamish He cannot help me just now he is straitened enough himself He might help you with advice His experience is larger than yours his judgment better In the multitude of counsellors there is safety you know Hamish I have made up my mind to say nothing to my father If he could assist me I would disclose all to him as it is it would only be inflicting upon him unnecessary pain Understand Arthur what I have said to you is in confidence you must not speak of it to him Of course not I should not think of interfering between you and him I wish I could help you I wish you could old fellow But you need not look so serious How you can be so gay and careless over it I cannot imagine said Arthur Hamish laughed If there s only a little patch of sunshine as large as a man s hand I am sure to see it and trust to it Is there any sunshine in this A little bit and I hope it will help me out of it I am sure I was born with a large share of hope in my composition Show me the bit of sunshine Hamish I can t do that was the answer I fear it is not so much actual sunshine that s to be seen yet only its reflection You could not see it at all Arthur but I as I tell you am extravagantly hopeful The same ever gay tone the same pleasant smile accompanied the words And yet at that moment instead of walking straightforward into the open space beyond the elm trees as Arthur did Hamish withdrew his arm from his brother s and halted under their shade peering cautiously around They were then within view of their own door What are you looking at To make sure that the coast is clear I heard to day Arthur I know that I shall shock you that a fellow had taken out a writ against me I don t want to get it served if I can help it Arthur was indeed shocked Oh Hamish was all he uttered But the tone betrayed a strange amount of pain mingled with reproach You must not think ill of me I declare that I have been led into this scrape blindfolded as may be said I never dreamt I was getting into it I am not reckless by nature and but for the expectation of that money I should be as free now as you are Thought upon thought was crowding into Arthur s mind He did not speak I cannot charge myself with any foolish or unnecessary expenditure Hamish resumed And he added in a deeper tone my worst enemy will not accuse me of rashly incurring debts to gratify my own pleasures I do not get into mischief Were I addicted to drinking or to gambling my debts might have been ten times what they are They are enough it seems said Arthur But he spoke the words in sadness not in a spirit of reproof Arthur they may prove of the greatest service in teaching me caution for the future Perhaps I wanted the lesson Let me once get out of this hash and I will take pretty good care not to fall into another If you only can get out of it Oh I shall do it somehow never fear Let us go on there seems to be no one about CHAPTER X A FALSE ALARM They reached home unmolested Arthur went straight to mister Channing who was lying as usual on his sofa and bent over him with a smile sweet and hopeful as that of Hamish Father may I gain fifty pounds a year if I can do it without detriment to my place at mister Galloway s
6904_262291_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you say 
none	none	my boy Would you have any objection to my taking the organ at college on week days mister Williams has offered it to me mister Channing turned his head and looked at him He did not understand You could not take it Arthur you could not be absent from the office and young Jupp takes the organ What is it that you are talking of Arthur explained in his quiet manner a glad light shining in his eyes Jupp had left the college for good mister Williams had offered the place to him and mister Galloway had authorized him to accept it He should only have to go to the office for two hours before breakfast in a morning to make up for the two lost in the day My brave boy exclaimed mister Channing making prisoner of his hand I said this untoward loss of the suit might turn out to be a blessing in disguise And so it will it is bringing forth the sterling love of my children You are doing this for me Arthur Doing it a great deal for myself papa You do not know the gratification it will be to me those two hours play daily I understand my dear understand it all Especially as Arthur came to a sudden stop Especially as what asked mister Channing As I had thought of giving up taking lessons Arthur hastily added not going deeper into explanations I play quite well enough now to cease learning mister Williams said one day that with practice I might soon equal him I wonder what those parents do Arthur who own ungrateful or rebellious children mister Channing exclaimed after a pause of thought The world is full of trouble and it is of many kinds and takes various phases but if we can only be happy in our children all other trouble may pass lightly over us as a summer cloud I thank God that my children have never brought home to me an hour s care How merciful He has been to me Arthur s thoughts reverted to Hamish and his trouble He felt thankful then that it was hid from mister Channing I have already accepted the place papa I knew I might count upon your consent Upon my warm approbation My son do your best at your task And mister Channing added sinking his voice to a whisper when the choristers peal out their hymn of praise to God during these sacred services let your heart ascend with it in fervent praise and thanksgiving Too many go through these services in a matter of course spirit their heart far away Do not you Hamish at this moment came in carrying the books Are you ready sir There s not much to do this evening Ready at any time Hamish Hamish laid the books before him on the table and sat down Arthur left the room mister Channing liked to be alone with Hamish when the accounts were being gone over missus Channing was in the drawing room some of the children with her Arthur entered missus Channing cried he with mock ceremony allow me to introduce you to the assistant organist of the cathedral She smiled supposing it to be some joke Very well sir He can come in He is in ma am It is myself Is young mister Jupp there she asked for he sometimes came home with Arthur Young mister Jupp has disappeared from public life and I am appointed in his place It is quite true Arthur she remonstrated Mamma indeed it is true mister Williams has made me the offer and mister Galloway has consented to allow me time to attend the week day services and papa is glad of it and I hope you will be glad also I have known of it since this morning spoke Tom with an assumption of easy consequence while missus Channing was recovering her senses which had been nearly frightened away Arthur I hope Williams intends to pay you Fifty pounds a year And the copying besides Is it true Arthur breathlessly exclaimed missus Channing I have told you that it is mother mine Jupp has resigned and I am assistant organist Annabel danced round him in an ecstasy of delight Not at his success success or failure did not much trouble Annabel but she thought there might be a prospect of some fun in store for herself Arthur you ll let me come into the cathedral and blow for you You little stupid cried Tom Much good you could do at blowing A girl blowing the college organ That s rich Better let Williams catch you there She d actually go I believe It is not your business Tom it is Arthur s retorted Annabel with flushed cheeks Mamma can t you teach Tom to interfere with himself and not with me I would rather teach Annabel to be a young lady and not a tomboy said missus Channing You may as well wish to be allowed to ring the college bells as blow the organ child I should like that said Annabel Oh what fun if the rope went up with me missus Channing turned a reproving glance on her and resumed her conversation with Arthur Why did you not tell me before my boy It was too good news to keep to yourself How long has it been in contemplation Dear mamma only to day It was only this morning that Jupp resigned Only to day It must have been decided very hastily then for a measure of that sort mister Williams was so put to it that he took care to lose no time He spoke to me at one o clock I had gone to him to the cathedral asking for the copying which I heard was going begging and he broached the other subject on the spur of the moment as it seemed to me Nothing could be decided until I had seen mister Galloway and I spoke to him after he left here this afternoon He will allow me to be absent from the office an hour morning and afternoon on condition that I attend for two hours before breakfast But Arthur you will have a great deal upon your hands Not any too much It will keep me out of mischief When shall you find time to do the copying In an evening I suppose I shall find plenty of time As Hamish had observed there was little to do at the books that evening and he soon left the parlour Constance happened to be in the hall as he crossed it on his way to his bedroom Judith who appeared to have been on the watch came gliding from the half opened kitchen door and approached Constance looking after Hamish as he went up the stairs Do you see Miss Constance she whispered He is carrying the books up with him as usual At this juncture 
6904_262305_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Hamish turned round 
none	none	to speak to his sister Constance I don t want any supper to night tell my mother You can call me when it is time for the reading And he is going to set on at em now and he ll be at em till morning light continued Judith s whisper And he ll drop off into his grave with decline taint in the nature of a young man to do without sleep and that ll be the ending And he ll burn himself up first and all the house with him I think I will go and speak to him debated Constance I should advised Judith The worst is if the books must be done why they must and I don t see that there is any help for it But Constance hesitated considerably She did not at all like to interfere it appeared so very much to resemble the work of a spy Several minutes she deliberated and then went slowly up the stairs Knocking at Hamish s door she turned the handle and would have entered It was locked Who s there called out Hamish Can I come in for a minute Hamish I want to say a word to you He did not undo the door immediately There appeared to be an opening and closing of his desk first a scuffle as of things being put away When Constance entered she saw one of the insurance books open on the table the pen and ink near it the others were not to be seen The keys were in the table lock A conviction flashed over the mind of Constance that Judith was right in supposing the office accounts to be the object that kept him up What can he do with his time in the day she thought What is it Constance Can you let me speak to you Hamish If you won t be long I was just beginning to be busy he replied taking out the keys and putting them into his pocket I see you were she said glancing at the ledger Hamish you must not be offended with me or think I interfere unwarrantably I would not do it but that I am anxious for you Why is it that you sit up so late at night There was a sudden accession of colour to his face Constance saw it but there was a smile as well How do you know I do sit up Has Judy been telling tales Judy is uneasy about it and she spoke to me this evening She has visions of the house being burnt up with every one in it and of your fatally injuring your health I believe she would consider the latter calamity almost more grievous than the former for you know you were always her favourite Hamish is there no danger of either There is not I am too cautious for the one to happen and I believe too hardy for the other Judy is a simpleton he laughed she has her water butt and what more can she desire Hamish why do you sit up Have you not time for your work in the day No Or else I should do it in the day I do not sit up enough to hurt me I have on an average three hours night work five days in the week and if that can damage a strong fellow like me call me a puny changeling You sit up much longer than that Not often These light days I sometimes do not sit up half so long I get up in the morning instead Constance you look grave enough for a judge And you laughing enough to provoke me Suppose I tell papa of this habit of yours and get him to forbid it Then my dear you would work irreparable mischief he replied becoming grave in his turn Were I to be prevented from doing as I please in my chamber in this house I must find a room elsewhere in which I should be my own master Hamish You oblige me to say it Constance You and Judy must lay your heads together upon some other grievance for indeed for this particular one there is no remedy She is an old goose and you are a young one Is it right that we should submit to the risk of being set on fire My dear if that is the point I ll have a fire escape placed over the front door every night and pay a couple of watchmen to act as guardians Constance again dropping his tone of mockery you know that you may trust me better than that But Hamish how do you spend your time that you cannot complete your books in the day Oh drawled Hamish ours is the laziest office gossiping and scandal going on in it from morning till night In the fatigue induced by that I am not sure that I don t take a nap sometimes Constance could not tell what to make of him He was gazing at her with the most perplexing expression of face looking ready to burst into a laugh One last word Hamish for I hear Judith calling to you Are you obliged to do this night work I am Then I will say no more and things must go on as it seems they have hitherto done Arthur came running upstairs and Hamish met him at the chamber door Arthur who appeared strangely agitated began speaking in a half whisper unconscious that his sister was within She heard every word Judy says some young man wants you Hamish I fear it may be the fellow to serve the writ What on earth is to be done Did Judy say I was at home Yes and has handed him into the study to wait Did you not hear her calling to you I can t see him Hamish was about to say Yes I will see him he added after a moment s reflection Anything rather than have a disturbance which might come to my mother s ears And I suppose if he could not serve it now he would watch for me in the morning Shall I go down first and hear what he has to say Arthur boy it would do no good I have brought this upon myself and must battle with it A Channing cannot turn coward But he may act with discretion said Arthur I will speak to the man and if there s no help for it I ll call you Down flew Arthur four stairs at a time Hamish remained with his body inside his chamber door and his head out I conclude he was listening and in the confusion he had probably totally forgotten Constance Arthur came bounding up the stairs again his eyes sparkling A false alarm Hamish It s only Martin Pope Martin Pope echoed Hamish considerably relieved for Martin Pope was an acquaintance of his and sub editor of one of the Helstonleigh newspapers Why could not Judy have opened her mouth He ran down the stairs the colour which had left his face returning to it But it did not to that of Constance hers had changed to an ashy whiteness Arthur saw her standing there saw that she must have heard and understood all Oh Arthur has it come to this Is Hamish in that depth of debt Hush What brought you here Constance What writ is it that he fears Is there indeed one out against him I don t know much about it There may be one She wrung her hands The next thing to a writ is a prison is it not If he should be taken what would become of the office of papa s position Do not agitate yourself he implored It can do no good Nothing can do good nothing nothing Oh what trouble Constance in the greatest trouble there is always one Refuge Yes she mentally thought bursting into tears What but for that shelter would become of us in our bitter hours of trial CHAPTER XI THE CLOISTER KEYS It was the twenty second day of the month and nearly a week after the date of the last chapter Arthur Channing sat in his place at the cathedral organ playing the psalm for the morning for the hour was that of divine service O give thanks unto the Lord for He is gracious and His mercy endureth for ever The boy s whole heart went up with the words He gave thanks mercies had come upon him upon his and that great dread which was turning his days to gall his nights to sleeplessness the arrest of Hamish had not as yet been attempted He felt it all as he sat there and in a softer voice he echoed the sweet song of the choristers below verse after verse as each verse rose on the air filling the aisles of the old cathedral how that God delivers those who cry unto Him those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death those whose hearts fail through heaviness who fall down and there is none to help them He brings them out of the darkness and breaks their bonds in sunder They that go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters who see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep whose hearts cower at the stormy rising of the waves and in their agony of distress cry unto Him to help them and He hears the cry and delivers them He stills the angry waves and calms the storm and brings them into the haven where they would be and then they are glad because they are at rest O that men would therefore praise the Lord for His goodness and declare the wonders that He doeth for the children of men And again when they are minished and brought low through oppression through any plague or trouble though He suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants and let them wander out of the way in the wilderness yet helpeth He the poor out of misery and maketh him households like a flock of sheep Whoso is wise will ponder these things and they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord The refrain died away the gentle echo died after it and silence fell upon the cathedral It was broken by the voice of the Reverend William Yorke giving out the first lesson a chapter in Jeremiah At the conclusion of the service Arthur Channing left the college In the cloisters he was overtaken by the choristers who were hastening back to the schoolroom At the same moment Ketch the porter passed coming towards them from the south entrance of the cloisters He touched his hat in his usual ungracious fashion to the dean and doctor Gardner who were turning into the chapter house carrying their trenchers and looked the other way as he passed the boys Arthur caught hold of Hurst Have you served out old Ketch as you threatened he laughingly asked Hush whispered Hurst It has not come off yet We had an idea that an inkling of it had got abroad so we thought it best to keep quiet for a few nights lest the Philistines should be on the watch But the time is fixed now and I can tell you that it is not a hundred nights off With a shower of mysterious nods and winks Hurst rushed away and bounded up the stairs to the schoolroom Arthur returned to mister Galloway s It s the awfullest shame burst forth Tom Channing that day at dinner and allow me to remark par parenthese that in reading about schoolboys you must be content to accept their grammar as it comes and he brought the handle of his knife down upon the table in a passion Thomas uttered mister Channing in amazed reproof Well papa and so it is and the school s going pretty near mad over it returned Tom turning his crimsoned face upon his father Would you believe that I and Huntley are to be passed over in the chance for the seniorship and Yorke is to have it without reference to merit No I do not believe it Tom quietly replied mister Channing But even were it true it is no reason why you should break out in that unseemly manner Did you ever know a hot temper do good to its possessor I know I am hot tempered confessed Tom I cannot help it papa it was born with me Many of our failings were born with us my boy as I have always understood But they are to be subdued not indulged Papa you must acknowledge that it is a shame if Pye has promised the seniorship to Yorke over my head and Huntley s reiterated Tom who was apt to speak as strongly as he thought If he gets the seniorship the exhibition will follow that is an understood thing Would it be just Why are you saying this What have you heard Well it is a roundabout tale answered Tom But the rumour in the school is this and if it turns out to be true Gerald Yorke will about get eaten up alive Is that the rumour Tom said missus Channing Tom laughed in spite of his anger I had not come to the rumour mamma Lady Augusta and doctor Burrows are great friends you know and we hear that they have been salving over Pye Gently Tom put in mister Channing Talking over Pye then corrected Tom impatient to proceed with his story and Pye has promised to promote Gerald Yorke to the seniorship He doctor Burrows has gone away again interrupted Annabel I saw him go by to day in his travelling carriage Judy says he has gone to his rectory some of the deanery servants told her so You ll get something Annabel if you interrupt in that fashion cried Tom Last Monday doctor Burrows gave a dinner party Pye was there and Lady Augusta was there and it was then they got Pye to promise it to Yorke How is it known that
6904_262291_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 they did 
none	none	asked mister Channing The boys all say it papa It was circulating through the school this morning like wild fire You will never take the prize for logic Tom How did the boys hear it I ask Through mister Calcraft replied Tom Tom mister Ketch then said Tom correcting himself as he had done before Both names are a mile too good for him Ketch came into contact with some of the boys this morning before ten o clock school and of course they went into a wordy war which is nothing new Huntley was the only senior present and Ketch was insolent to him One of the boys told Ketch that he would not dare to be so next year if Huntley should be senior boy Ketch sneered at that and said Huntley never would be senior boy nor Channing either for it was already given to Yorke The boys took his words up ridiculing the notion of his knowing anything of the matter and they did not spare their taunts That roused his temper and the old fellow let out all he knew He said Lady Augusta Yorke was at Galloway s office yesterday boasting about it before Jenkins A roundabout tale indeed remarked mister Channing and told in a somewhat roundabout manner Tom I should not put faith in it Did you hear anything of this Arthur No sir I know that Lady Augusta called at the office yesterday afternoon while I was at college I don t know anything more Huntley intends to drop across Jenkins this afternoon and question him resumed Tom Channing There can t be any doubt that it was he who gave the information to Ketch If Huntley finds that Lady Augusta did assert it the school will take the affair up The boast amused Hamish In what manner will the school be pleased to take it up questioned he Recommend the dean to hold mister Pye under surveillance Or send Lady Augusta a challenge Tom Channing nodded his head mysteriously There is many a true word spoken in jest Hamish I don t know yet what we should do we should do something The school won t stand it tamely The day for that one sided sort of oppression has gone out with our grandmothers fashions It would be very wrong of the school to stand it said Charley throwing in his word If the honours are to go by sneaking favour and not by merit where is the use of any of us putting out our mettle You be quiet Miss Charley you juniors have nothing to do with it were all the thanks the boy received from Tom Now the facts really were very much as Tom Channing asserted though whether or how far mister Pye had promised and whether Lady Augusta s boast had been a vain one was a matter for speculation Neither could it be surmised the part if any played in it by Prebendary Burrows It was certain that Lady Augusta had on the previous day boasted to mister Galloway in his office that her son was to have the seniorship that mister Pye had promised it to her and doctor Burrows at the dinner party She spoke of it without the least reserve in a tone of much self gratulation and she laughingly told Jenkins who was at his desk writing that he might wish Gerald joy when he next saw him Jenkins accepted it all as truth it may be questioned if mister Galloway did for he knew that Lady Augusta did not always weigh her words before speaking In the evening this same evening mind after the call at the office of Lady Augusta mister Jenkins proceeded towards home when he left his work He took the road through the cloisters As he was passing the porter s lodge who should he see in it but his father old Jenkins the bedesman holding a gossip with Ketch and they saw him If that ain t our Joe a going past exclaimed the bedesman Joe stepped in He was proceeding to join in the converse when a lot of the college boys tore along hooting and shouting and kicking a ball about It was kicked into the lodge and a few compliments were thrown at the boys by the porter before they could get the ball out again These compliments you may be quite sure the boys did not fail to return with interest Tom Channing in particular being charmingly polite And the saucy young beast ll be the senior boy soon foamed mister Ketch as the lot decamped I wish I could get him gagged I do No he will not said Joe Jenkins speaking impulsively in his superior knowledge Yorke is to be senior How do you know that Joe asked his father Joe replied by relating what he had heard said by the Lady Augusta that afternoon It did not conciliate the porter in the remotest degree he was not more favourably inclined to Gerald Yorke than he was to Tom Channing Had he heard the school never was to have a senior again or a junior either that might have pleased him But on the following morning when he fell into dispute with the boys in the cloisters he spoke out his information in a spirit of triumph over Huntley Bit by bit angered by the boys taunts he repeated every word he had heard from Jenkins The news as it was busily circulated from one to the other caused no slight hubbub in the school and gave rise to that explosion of Tom Channing s at the dinner table Huntley sought Jenkins as he had said he would do and received confirmation of the report so far as the man s knowledge went But Jenkins was terribly vexed that the report had got abroad through him He determined to pay a visit to mister Ketch and reproach him with his incaution mister Ketch sat in his lodge taking his supper bread and cheese and a pint of ale procured at the nearest public house Except in the light months of summer it was his habit to close the cloister gates before supper time but as mister Ketch liked to take that meal early that is to say at eight o clock and as dusk for at least four months in the year obstinately persisted in putting itself off to a later hour in spite of his growling and as he might not shut up before dusk he had no resource but to take his supper first and lock up afterwards The lodge was a quaint abode of one room only built in an obscure nook of the cathedral near the grand entrance He was pursuing his meal after his own peculiar custom eating drinking and grumbling It s worse nor leather this cheese Selling it to a body for double Gloucester I d like to double them as made it Eight pence a pound and short weight beside I wonder there ain t a law passed to keep down the cost o provisions A pause given chiefly to grunting and mister Ketch resumed This bread s rougher nor a bear s hide Go and ask for new and they palms you off with stale They ll put a loaf a week old into the oven to hot up again and then sell it to you for new There ought to be a criminal code passed for hanging bakers They re all cheats They mixes up alum and bone dust and plaster of Paris and Drat that door Who s kicking at it now No one was kicking Some one was civilly knocking The door was pushed slightly open and the inoffensive face of mister Joseph Jenkins appeared in the aperture I say mister Ketch began he in a mild tone of deprecation whatever is it that you have gone and done What d ye mean growled old Ketch Is this a way to come and set upon a gentleman in his own house Who taught you manners Joe Jenkins You have been repeating what I mentioned last night about Lady Augusta s son getting the seniorship said Jenkins coming in and closing the door You did say it retorted mister Ketch I know I did But I did not suppose you were going to repeat it again If it was a secret why didn t you say so asked mister Ketch It was not exactly a secret or Lady Augusta would not have mentioned it before me remonstrated Joe But it is not the proper thing for me to come out of mister Galloway s office and talk of anything I may have heard said in it by his friends and then for it to get round to his ears again Put it to yourself mister Ketch and say whether you would like it What did you talk of it for then snarled Ketch preparing to take a copious draught of ale Because I thought you and father were safe You might both have known better than to speak of it out of doors There is sure to be a commotion over it Miserable beer Brewed out of ditch water Young mister Huntley came to me to day to know the rights and the wrongs of it as he said continued Joseph He spoke to mister Galloway about it afterwards though I must say he was kind enough not to bring in my name only said in a general way that he had heard it He is an honourable young gentleman is that Huntley He vows the report shall be conveyed to the dean Serve em right snapped the porter If the dean does his duty he ll order a general flogging for the school all round It ll do em good Galloway did not say much except that he knew what he should do were he Huntley s or Channing s father Which I took to mean that in his opinion there ought to be an inquiry instituted And you know there ought said mister Ketch I know I m sure I don t know was the mild answer It is not my place to reflect upon my superiors mister Ketch to say they should do this or they should do that I like to reverence them and to keep a civil tongue in my head Which is what you don t do If I knowed who brewed this beer I d enter an action again him for putting in no malt I would not have had this get about for any money resumed Jenkins Neither you nor father shall ever catch me opening my lips again Keep em shut then growled old Ketch mister Ketch leisurely finished his supper and the two continued talking until dusk came on almost dark for the porter churl though he was liked a visitor as well as any one possibly as a vent for his temper He did not often find one who would stand it so meekly as Joe Jenkins At length mister Jenkins lifted himself off the shut up press bedstead on which he had been perched and prepared to depart Come along of me while I lock up said Ketch somewhat less ungraciously than usual mister Jenkins hesitated My wife will be wondering what has become of me she ll blow me up for keeping supper waiting debated he aloud But well I don t mind going with you this once for company s sake he added in his willingness to be obliging The two large keys one at each end of a string were hung up just within the lodge door they belonged to the two gates of the cloisters Old Ketch took them down and went out with Jenkins merely closing his own door he rarely fastened it unless he was going some distance Very dark were the enclosed cloisters as they entered by the west gate It was later than the usual hour of closing and it was moreover a gloomy evening the sky overcast They went through the cloisters to the south gate Ketch grumbling all the way He locked it and then turned back again Arrived about midway of the west quadrangle the very darkest part in all the cloisters and the most dreary Jenkins suddenly startled his companion by declaring there was a light in the burial ground Come along growled Ketch You ll say there s corpse candles there next It is only a little spark like said Jenkins halting I should not wonder but it is one of those pretty innocent glowworms He leaned his arms upon the mullioned frame of the open Gothic window raised himself on tiptoe to obtain as complete a view as was possible and pushed his head out to reconnoitre the grave yard mister Ketch shuffled on the keys held somewhat loosely in his hand by the string clanking together Be you going to stop there all night he called out when he had gone a few paces half turning round to speak At that moment a somewhat startling incident occurred The keys were whisked out of mister Ketch s hand and fell or appeared to fall with a clatter on the flags at his feet He turned his anger upon Jenkins Now then you senseless calf What did you do that for Did you speak asked Jenkins taking his elbows from the distant window frame and approaching mister Ketch felt a little staggered His belief had been that Jenkins had come up silently and dashed the keys from his hand but Jenkins it appeared had not left the window However like too many other cross grained spirits he persisted in venting blame upon him Aren t you ashamed of yourself to play an old man such a trick I have played no trick said Jenkins I thought I saw a glowworm and I stopped to look but I couldn t see it again There s no trick in that Ugh cried the porter in his wrath You took and clutched the keys from me and throwed em on the ground Pick em up Well I never heard the like said Jenkins I was not within yards and yards of you If you dropped the keys it was no fault of mine But being a peaceably inclined man he stooped and found the keys The porter grunted An inner current of conviction rose in his heart that he must undoubtedly have dropped them though he could have declared at the time that they were mysteriously snatched from him He seized the string firmly now and hobbled on to the west door abusing Jenkins all the way They arrived at the west door which was gained by a narrow closed passage from the gate of entrance as was the south door in a similar manner and there mister Ketch used his eyes and his tongue considerably for the door instead of being open as he had left it was shut and locked What on earth has done this shrieked he Done what asked mister Jenkins Done what was the irascible echo Be you a fool Joe Jenkins Don t you see the door s fast Unfasten it said Jenkins sensibly mister Ketch proceeded to do so at least to apply one of the keys to the lock with much fumbling It apparently did not occur to him to wonder how the locking up process could have been effected considering that the key had been in his own possession Fumbling and fumbling now with one key now with the other and then critically feeling the keys and their wards the truth at length burst upon the unhappy man that the keys were not the right keys and that he and Jenkins were locked in A profuse perspiration broke out over him They must be the keys remonstrated mister Jenkins They are not the keys shrieked Ketch D ye think I don t know my own keys now I come to feel em But they were your keys that fell down and that I picked up argued Jenkins perfectly sure in his own mind that they could be no others There was not a fairy in the cloisters to come and change them Feel em roared Ketch in his despair These be a couple of horrid rusty old things that can t have been in use since the cloisters was built You have changed em you have he sobbed the notion taking possession of him forcibly You are a doing it to play me a infamous trick and I ll have you up before the dean to morrow I ll shake the life out of you I will Laying summary hold of mister Jenkins he began to shake him with all his feeble strength The latter soon extricated himself and he succeeded in impressing on the man the fallacy of his suspicion Don t I want to get home to my supper and my wife Don t I tell you that she ll set upon me like anything for keeping it waiting he meekly remonstrated Do I want to be locked up in these unpleasant cloisters Give me the keys and let me try them Ketch in sheer helplessness was fain to comply He resigned the keys to Jenkins and Jenkins tried them but he was none the nearer unlocking the gate In their increasing perplexity they resolved to return to the place in the quadrangle where the keys had fallen a very forlorn suggestion proceeding from mister Jenkins that the right keys might be lying there still and that this rusty pair might by some curious and unaccountable chance have been lying there also They commenced their search disputing the one hotly the other temperately as to which was the exact spot With feet and hands they hunted as well as the dark would allow them all in vain and Ketch gave vent to a loud burst of feeling when he realized the fact that they were positively locked up in the cloisters beyond hope of succour in the dark and lonely night CHAPTER XII A MISHAP TO THE BISHOP Fordham I wonder whether the cloisters are closed I will see my lord The question came from the Bishop of Helstonleigh who as it fell out had been to make an evening call upon the dean The dean s servant was now conducting his lordship down the grand staircase on his departure In proceeding to the palace from the deanery to go through the cloisters cut off quite two thirds of the distance Fordham left the hall a lamp in his hand and traversed sundry passages which brought him to the deanery garden Crossing the garden and treading another short passage he came to the cloisters The bishop had followed lighted by Fordham and talking affably A very pleasant man was the Bishop of Helstonleigh standing little upon forms and ceremonies In frame he was nearly as active as a college boy It is all right I think my lord said Fordham I hear the porter s voice now in the cloisters How dark it is exclaimed the bishop Ketch must be closing late to night What a noise he is making In point of fact mister Ketch had just arrived at that agreeable moment which concluded the last chapter the conviction that no other keys were to be found and that he and Jenkins were fast The tone in which he was making his sentiments known upon the calamity was not a subdued one Shall I light you round my lord By no means by no means I shall be up with Ketch in a minute He seems in a temper Good night Fordham Good night to your lordship The servant went back to the deanery The prelate groped his way round to the west quadrangle Are you closing Ketch mister Ketch started as if he had been shot and his noise dropped to a calm Truth to say his style of complaint had not been orthodox or exactly suitable to the ears of his bishop He and Jenkins both recognized the voice and bowed low dark though it was What is the matter Ketch You are making enough noise Matter my lord groaned Ketch Here s matter enough to make a saint saving your lordship s presence forget his prayers We be locked up in the cloisters Locked up repeated the bishop What do you mean Who is with you It is me my lord said Jenkins meekly answering for himself Joseph Jenkins my lord at mister Galloway s I came in with the porter just for company my lord when he came to lock up and we have somehow got locked in The bishop demanded an explanation It was not very easily afforded Ketch and Jenkins talked one against the other and when the bishop did at length understand the tale he scarcely gave credence to it It is an incomprehensible story Ketch that you should drop your keys and they should be changed for others as they lay on the flags Are you sure you brought out the right keys My lord I couldn t bring out any others returned Ketch in a tone that longed to betray its resentment and would have betrayed it to any one but a bishop I haven t no others to bring my lord The two keys hang up on the nail always and there ain t another key besides in the house except the door key Some one must have changed them previously must have hung up these in their places remarked the bishop But my lord it couldn t be I say reiterated old Ketch almost shrieking I know the keys just as well as I know my own hands and they was the right keys that I brought out The best proof my lord is that I locked the south door fast enough and how could I have done that with these wretched old rusty things The keys must be on the flags still said his lordship That is the only conclusion I can come to my lord mildly put in Jenkins But we cannot find them And meanwhile we are locked in for the night and here s his right reverend lordship the bishop locked in with us danced old Ketch almost beside himself with anger Of course it wouldn t matter for me and Jenkins speaking in comparison we are nobody but it is a shameful indignity for my lord We must try and get out Ketch said his lordship in a tone that sounded as if he were more inclined to laugh than cry I will go back to the deanery Away went the bishop as quickly as the gloom allowed him and away went the other two in his wake Arrived at the passage which led from the cloisters to the deanery garden they groped their way to the end only to find the door closed and locked Well this is a pleasant situation exclaimed the bishop his tone betraying amusement as well as annoyance and with his own prelatical hands he pummelled at the door and shouted with his own prelatical voice When the bishop was tired Jenkins and Ketch began to pummel and to shout and they pummelled and shouted till their knuckles were sore and their throats were hoarse It was all in vain The garden intervened between them and the deanery and they could not be heard It certainly was a pretty situation as the prelate remarked The Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Helstonleigh ranking about fifth by precedence on the episcopal bench locked up ignominiously in the cloisters of Helstonleigh with Ketch the porter and Jenkins the steward s clerk likely so far as appearances might be trusted to have to pass the night there The like had never yet been heard of The bishop went to the south gate and tried the keys himself the bishop went to the west gate and tried them there the bishop stamped about the west quadrangle hoping to stamp upon the missing keys but nothing came of it Ketch and Jenkins attended him Ketch grumbling in the most angry terms that he dared Jenkins in humble silence I really do not see what is to be done debated the bishop who no doubt wished himself well out of the dilemma as any less exalted mortal would have done The doors leading into the college are sure to be closed Quite sure groaned Ketch And to get into the college would not serve us that I see added the bishop We should be no better off there than here Saving that we might ring the bell my lord suggested Jenkins with deference They proceeded to the college gates It was a forlorn hope and one that did not serve them The gates were locked the doors closed behind them No reaching the bell that way it might as well have been a hundred miles off They traversed the cloisters again and tried the door of the schoolroom It was locked Had it not been the senior boy might have expected punishment from the head master They tried the small door leading into the residence of doctor Burrows fast also that abode just now was empty The folding doors of the chapter house were opened easily and they entered But what did it avail them There was the large round room lined with its books furnished with its immense table and easy chairs but it was as much shut in from the hearing of the outside world as they were The bishop came into contact with a chair and sat down in it Jenkins who as clerk to mister Galloway the steward to the dean and chapter was familiar with the chapter house felt his way to the spot where he knew matches were sometimes kept He could not find any it was the time of light evenings There s just one chance my lord suggested Jenkins That the little unused door at the corner of the cloisters leading into the body of the cathedral may not be locked Precious careless of the sextons if it is not grunted Ketch It is a door nobody ever thinks of going in at my lord returned Jenkins as if he would apologize for the sextons carelessness should it be found unfastened If it is open we might get to the bell The sextons proud stuck up gentlemen be made up of carelessness and anything else that s bad groaned Ketch Holding up their heads above us porters It was worth the trial The bishop rose from the chair and groped his way out of the chapter house the two others following If it hadn t been for that Jenkins s folly fancying he saw a light in the burying ground and me turning round to order him to come on it might not have happened grumbled Ketch as they wound round the cloisters A light in the burial ground hastily repeated the bishop What light Oh a corpse candle or some nonsense of that sort he had his mind running on my lord Half the world is idiots and Jenkins is the biggest of em My lord spoke poor Jenkins deprecatingly I never had such a thought within me as that it was a corpse candle I said I fancied it might be a glowworm And I believe it was one my lord A more sensible thought than the other observed the prelate Luck at last The door was found to be unlocked It was a low narrow door only used on the very rare occasion of a funeral and was situated in a shady out of the way nook where no one ever thought of looking Oh come this is something cried the bishop cheerily as he stepped into the cathedral And your lordship now sees what fine careless sextons we have got struck in Ketch We must overlook their carelessness this time in consideration of the service it renders us said the bishop in a kindly tone Take care of the pillars Ketch Thank ye my lord I m going along with my hands held out before me to save my head returned Ketch Most likely the bishop and Jenkins were doing the same Dexterously steering clear of the pillars they emerged in the wide open body of the cathedral and bent their steps across it to the spot where hung the ropes of the bells The head sexton to the cathedral whom you must not confound with a gravedigger as you might an ordinary sexton cathedral sextons are personages of more importance was seated about this hour at supper in his home close to the cathedral Suddenly the deep toned college bell boomed out and the man started as if a gun had been fired at him Why that s the college bell he uttered to his family And the family stared with open mouths without replying The college bell it certainly was and it was striking out sharp irregular strokes as though the ringer were not accustomed to his work The sexton started up in a state of the most amazed consternation It is magic it is nothing less that the bell should be ringing out at this hour exclaimed he Father suggested a juvenile perhaps somebody s got locked up in the college For which prevision he was rewarded with a stinging smack on the head Take that sir D ye think I don t know better than to lock folks up in the college It was me myself as locked up this evening No need to box him for that resented the wife The bell is ringing and I ll be bound the boy s right enough One of them masons must have fallen asleep in the day and has just woke up to find himself shut in Hope he likes his berth Whatever it might be ringing the bell whether magic or mason of course it must be seen to and the sexton hastened out the cathedral keys in his hand He bent his steps towards the front entrance passing the cloisters which as he knew would be locked at that hour And that bear of a Ketch won t hurry himself to unlock them soliloquized he He found the front gates surrounded The bell had struck upon the wondering ears of many living within the precincts of the cathedral who flocked out to ascertain the reason Amongst others the college boys were coming up in troops Now good people please by your leave cried the sexton Let me get to the gates They made way for the man and his ponderous keys and entrance to the college was gained The sexton was beginning a sharp reproof to the mason and the crowd preparing a chorus to it when they were seized with consternation and fell back on each other s toes It was the Bishop of Helstonleigh in his laced up hat and apron who walked forth The sexton humbly snatched off his hat the college boys raised their trenchers Thank you all for coming to the rescue said the bishop in a pleasant tone It was not an agreeable situation to be locked in the cathedral My lord stammered the sexton in awe struck dread as to whether he had unwittingly been the culprit how did your lordship get locked in That is what we must inquire into replied the bishop The next to hobble out was Ketch In his own fashion almost ignoring the presence of the bishop he made known the tale It was received with ridicule The college boys especially cast mockery upon it and began dancing a jig when the bishop s back was turned Let a couple of keys drop down and when picked up you found them transmogrified into old rusty machines made in the year one cried Bywater That s very like a whale Ketch Ketch tore off to his lodge as fast as his lumbago allowed him calling upon the crowd to come and look at the nail where the keys always hung except when in use and holding out the rusty dissemblers for public view in a furious passion He dashed open the door The college boys pushing before the crowd and following on the bishop s heels who had probably his own reasons for wishing to see the solution of the affair thronged into the lodge There s the nail my lord and there Ketch stopped dumbfounded On the nail hanging by the string as quietly as if they had hung for ages were the cloister keys Ketch rubbed his eyes and stared and rubbed again The bishop smiled I told you Ketch I thought you must be mistaken in supposing you brought the proper keys out Ketch burst into a wail of anger and deprecation He had took out the right keys and Jenkins could bear him out in the assertion Some wicked trick had been played upon him and the keys brought back during his absence and hung up on their hook He d lay his life it was the college boys The bishop turned his eyes on those young gentlemen But nothing could be more innocent than their countenances as they stood before him in their trenchers Rather too innocent perhaps and the bishop s eyes twinkled and a half smile crossed his lips but he made no sign Well would it be if all the clergy were as sweet tempered as that Bishop of Helstonleigh Well Ketch take care of your keys for the future was all he said as he walked away Good night boys Good night to your lordship replied the boys once more raising their trenchers and the crowd outside respectfully saluted their prelate who returned it in kind What are you waiting for Thorpe the bishop demanded when he found the sexton was still at the great gates holding them about an inch open For Jenkins my lord was the reply Ketch said he was also locked in Certainly he was replied the bishop Has he not come forth That he has not my lord I have let nobody whatever out except your lordship and the porter I have called out to him but he does not answer and does not come He went up into the organ loft in search of a candle and matches remarked the bishop You had better go after him Thorpe He may not know that the doors are open The bishop left crossing over to the palace Thorpe calling one of the old bedesmen some of whom had then come up left him in charge of the gate and did as he was ordered He descended the steps passed through the wide doors and groped his way in the dark towards the choir Jenkins There was no answer Jenkins he called out again Still there was no answer except the sound of the sexton s own voice as it echoed in the silence of the large edifice Well this is an odd go exclaimed Thorpe as he leaned against a pillar and surveyed the darkness of the cathedral He can t have melted away into a ghost or dropped down into the crypt among the coffins Jenkins I say With a word of impatience at the continued silence the sexton returned to the entrance gates All that could be done was to get a light and search for him They procured a lantern Ketch ungraciously supplying it and the sexton taking two or three of the spectators with him proceeded to the search He has gone to sleep in the organ loft that is what he has done cried Thorpe making known what the bishop had said Alas Jenkins had not gone to sleep At the foot of the steps leading to the organ loft they came upon him He was lying there insensible blood oozing from a wound in the forehead How had it come about What had caused it Meanwhile the college boys after driving mister Ketch nearly wild with their jokes and ridicule touching the mystery of the keys were scared by the sudden appearance of the head master They decamped as fast as their legs could carry them bringing themselves to an anchor at a safe distance under shade of the friendly elm trees Bywater stuck his back against one and his laughter came forth in peals Some of the rest tried to stop it whispering caution It s of no good talking you fellows I can t keep it in I shall burst if I try I have been at bursting point ever since I twitched the keys out of his hands in the cloisters and threw the rusty ones down You see I was right that it was best for one of us to go in without our boots and to wait If half a dozen had gone we should never have got away unheard I pretty nearly burst when I saw the bishop come out instead of Ketch cried Tod Yorke Burst with fright So did a few more of us said Galloway I say will there be a row Goodness knows He is a kind old chap is the bishop Better for it to have been him than the dean What was it Ketch said about Jenkins seeing a glowworm Oh shrieked Bywater holding his sides that was the best of all I had taken a lucifer out of my pocket playing with it while they went round to the south gate and it suddenly struck fire I threw it over to the burial ground and that soft Jenkins took it for a glowworm It s a stunning go emphatically concluded mister Tod Yorke The best we have had this half yet Hush sh sh sh whispered the boys under their breath There goes the master CHAPTER XIII MAD NANCE mister Galloway was in his office mister Galloway was fuming and fretting at the non arrival of his clerk mister Jenkins mister Jenkins was a punctual man in fact more than punctual his proper time for arriving at the office was half past nine but the cathedral clock had rarely struck the quarter past before mister Jenkins would be at his post Almost any other morning it would not have mattered a straw to mister Galloway whether Jenkins was a little after or a little before his time but on this particular morning he had especial need of him and had come himself to the office unusually early One two three four chimed the quarters of the cathedral There it goes half past nine ejaculated mister Galloway What does Jenkins mean by it He knew he was wanted early A sharp knock at the office door and there entered a little dark woman in a black bonnet and a beard She was mister Jenkins s better half and had the reputation for being considerably the grey mare Good morning mister Galloway A pretty kettle of fish this is What s the matter now asked mister Galloway surprised at the address Where s Jenkins Jenkins is in bed with his head plastered up He s the greatest booby living and would positively have come here all the same but I told him I d strap him down with cords if he attempted it A pretty object he d have looked staggering through the streets with his head big enough for two and held together with white plaster What has he done to his head wondered mister Galloway Good gracious have you not heard exclaimed the lady whose mode of speech was rarely overburdened with polite words though she meant no disrespect by it He got locked up in the cloisters last night with old Ketch and the bishop mister Galloway stared at her He had been dining the previous evening with some friends at the other end of the town and knew nothing of the occurrence Had he been within hearing when the college bell tolled out at night he would have run to ascertain the cause as eagerly as any schoolboy Locked up in the cloisters with old Ketch and the bishop he repeated in amazement I do not understand missus Jenkins proceeded to enlighten him She gave the explanation of the strange affair of the keys as it had been given to her by the unlucky Joe While telling it Arthur Channing entered and almost immediately afterwards Roland Yorke The bishop of all people uttered mister Galloway What an untoward thing for his lordship No more untoward for him than for others retorted the lady It just serves Jenkins right What business had he to go dancing through the cloisters with old Ketch and his keys But how did Jenkins get hurt asked mister Galloway for that particular point had not yet been touched upon He is the greatest fool going is Jenkins was the complimentary retort of Jenkins s wife After he had helped to ring out the bell he must needs go poking and groping into the organ loft hunting for matches or some such insane rubbish He might have known had he possessed any sense that candles and matches are not likely to be there in summer time Why if the organist wanted ever so much to stop in after dark when the college is locked up for the night he wouldn t be allowed to do it It s only in winter when he has to light a candle to get through the afternoon service that they keep matches and dips up there But about his head repeated mister Galloway who was aware of the natural propensity of missus Jenkins to wander from the point under discussion Yes about his head she wrathfully answered In attempting to descend the stairs again he missed his footing and pitched right down to the bottom of the flight That s how his head came in for it He wants a nurse with him always does Jenkins for he is no better than a child in leading strings Is he much hurt And there he d have lain till morning but for the bishop resumed missus Jenkins passing over the inquiry After his lordship got out he finding Jenkins did not come told Thorpe to go and look for him in the organ loft Thorpe said he should have done nothing of the sort but for the bishop s order he was just going to lock the great doors again and there Jenkins would have been fast They found him lying at the foot of the stairs just inside the choir gates with no more life in him than there is in a dead man I asked you whether he is seriously hurt missus Jenkins Pretty well He came to his senses as they were bringing him home and somebody ran for Hurst the surgeon He is better this morning But not well enough to come to business Hurst told him if he worried himself with business or anything else to day he d get brain fever as sure as a gun He ordered him to stop in bed and keep quiet if he could Of course he must do so observed mister Galloway There is no of course in it when men are the actors dissented missus Jenkins Hurst did well to say if he could when ordering him to keep quiet I d rather have an animal ill in the house than I d have a man they are ten times more reasonable There has Jenkins been tormenting himself ever since seven o clock this morning about coming here he was wanted particularly he said Would you go if you were dead I asked him and he stood it out that if he were dead it would be a different thing Not different at all I said A nice thing it would be to have to nurse him through a brain fever I am grieved that it should have happened said mister Galloway kindly Tell him from me that we can manage very well without him He must not venture here again until mister Hurst says he may come with safety I should have told him that to pacify him whether you had said it or not candidly avowed missus Jenkins And now I must go back home on the run As good have no one to mind my shop as that young house girl of ours If a customer comes in for a pair of black stockings she ll take and give em a white knitted nightcap She s as deficient of common sense as Jenkins is Your servant sir Good morning young gentlemen Here wait a minute cried mister Galloway as she was speeding off I cannot understand at all The keys could not have been changed as they lay on the flags Neither can anybody else understand it returned missus Jenkins If Jenkins was not a sober man and he had better let me catch him being anything else I should say the two him and Ketch had had a drop too much The bishop himself could make neither top nor tail of it It ll teach Jenkins not to go gallivanting again after other folk s business She finally turned away and mister Galloway set himself to revolve the perplexing narrative The more he thought the less he was nearer doing so like the bishop he could make neither top nor tail of it It is entirely beyond belief he remarked to Arthur Channing unless Ketch took out the wrong keys And if he took out the wrong keys how could he have locked the south door interrupted Roland Yorke I d lay anybody five shillings that those mischievous scamps of college boys were at the bottom of it I taxed Gerald with it and he flew out at me for my pains But the seniors may not have been in it You should have heard the bell clank out last night mister Galloway I suppose it brought out a few was mister Galloway s rejoinder It did that said Arthur Channing Myself for one When I saw the bishop emerge from the college doors I could scarcely believe my sight I d have given half a crown to see him cried Roland Yorke If there s any fun going on it is sure to be my fate to miss it Cator was at my house having a cigar with me and though we heard the bell we did not disturb ourselves to see what it might mean What is your opinion of last night s work Arthur asked mister Galloway returning to the point Arthur s opinion was a very decided one but he did not choose to say so The meeting with the college boys at their stealthy post in the cloisters when he and Hamish were passing through at dusk a few nights before coupled with the hints then thrown out of the serving out of Ketch could leave little doubt as to the culprits Arthur returned an answer couched in general terms Could it have been the college boys think you debated mister Galloway Not being a college boy I cannot speak positively sir he said laughing Gaunt knows nothing of it I met him as I was going home to breakfast from my early hour s work here and he told me he did not There would have been no harm done after all but for the accident to Jenkins One of you gentlemen can just step in to see Jenkins in the course of the day and reassure him that he is not wanted said mister Galloway I know how necessary it is to keep the mind tranquil in any fear of brain affection No more was said and the occupation of the day began A busy day was that at mister Galloway s much to the chagrin of Roland Yorke who had an unconquerable objection to doing too much He broke out into grumblings at Arthur when the latter came running in from his duty at college I ll tell you what is Channing you ought not to have made the bargain to go to that bothering organ on busy days and Galloway must have been out of his mind to let you make it Look at the heap of work there is to do I will soon make up for the lost hour said Arthur setting to with a will Where s mister Galloway Gone to the bank grumbled Roland And I have had to answer a dozen callers in at least and do all my writing besides I wonder what possessed Jenkins to go and knock his head to powder mister Galloway shortly returned and sat down to write It was a thing he rarely did he left writing to his clerks unless it was the writing of letters By one o clock the chief portion of the work was done and mister Roland Yorke s spirits recovered their elasticity He went home to dinner as usual Arthur preferred to remain at his post and get on further sending the housekeeper s little maid out for a twopenny roll which he ate as he wrote He was of a remarkably conscientious nature and thought it only fair to sacrifice a little time in case of need in return for the great favour which had been granted him by mister Galloway Many of the families who had sons in the college school dined at one o clock as it was the most convenient hour for the boys Growing youths are not satisfied with anything less substantial than a dinner in the middle of the day and two dinners in a household tell heavily upon the house keeping The Channings did not afford two neither did Lady Augusta Yorke so their hour was one o clock What a muff you must be to go without your dinner cried Roland Yorke to Arthur when he returned at two o clock I wouldn t I have had my dinner said Arthur What did you have cried Roland pricking up his ears Did Galloway send to the hotel for roast ducks and green peas That s what we had at home and the peas were half boiled and the ducks were scorched and cooked without stuffing A wretched set of incapables our house turns out and my lady does not know how to alter it You have actually finished that deed Channing It is finished you see It is surprising how much one can do in a quiet hour Is Galloway out Arthur pointed with his pen to the door of mister Galloway s private room to indicate that he was in it He is writing letters I say Channing there s positively nothing left to do went on Roland casting his eyes over the desk Here are these leases but they are not wanted until to morrow Who says we can t work in this office Arthur laughed good naturedly to think of the small amount out of that day s work which had fallen to Roland s share Some time elapsed mister Galloway came into their room from his own to consult a Bradshaw which lay on the shelf alongside Jenkins s desk He held in his hand a very closely written letter It was of large letter paper size and appeared to be filled to the utmost of its four pages While he was looking at the book the cathedral clock chimed the three quarters past two and the bell rang for divine service It can never be that time of day exclaimed mister Galloway in consternation as he took out his watch Sixteen minutes to three and I am a minute slow How has the time passed I ought to have been at mister Galloway brought his words to a standstill apparently too absorbed in the railway guide to conclude them Roland Yorke who had a free tongue even with his master filled up the pause Were you going out sir Is that any business of yours mister Roland Talking won t fill in that lease sir The lease is not in a hurry sir returned incorrigible Roland But he held his tongue then and bent his head over his work mister Galloway dipped his pen in the ink and copied something from Bradshaw into the closely written letter standing at Jenkins s desk to do it then he passed the blotting paper quickly over the words and folded the letter Channing he said speaking very hastily you will see a twenty pound bank note on my desk and the directed envelope of this letter bring them here Arthur went and brought forth the envelope and bank note mister Galloway doubled the note in four and slipped it between the folds of the letter putting both into the envelope He had fastened it down when a loud noise and commotion was heard in the street Curious as are said to be antiquated maidens mister Galloway rushed to the window and threw it up his two clerks attending in his wake Something very fine in a white dress and pink and scarlet flowers on her bonnetless head as if attired for an evening party was whirling round the middle of the road in circles a tall woman who must once have been beautiful She appeared to be whirling someone else with her amid laughter and shrieks and cries and groans from the gathering mob It is Mad Nance uttered mister Galloway Poor thing she really ought to be in confinement So every one had said for a long time but no one bestirred themselves to place her in it This unfortunate creature Mad Nance as she was called was sufficiently harmless to be at large on sufferance and sufficiently mad at times to put a street in an uproar In her least sane moments she would appear as now in an old dimity white dress scrupulously washed and ironed and decorated with innumerable frills some natural flowers generally wild ones in her hair Dandelions were her favourites she would make them into a wreath and fasten it on letting her entangled hair hang beneath To day she had contrived to pick up some geranium blossoms scarlet and pink Who has she got hold of there exclaimed mister Galloway He does not seem to like it Arthur burst into laughter when he discovered that it was Harper the lay clerk This unlucky gentleman who had been quietly and inoffensively proceeding up Close Street on his way to service in the cathedral was seized upon by Mad Nance by the hands He was a thin weak little man a very reed in her strong grasp She shrieked she laughed she danced she flew with him round and round He shrieked also his hat was off his wig was gone and it was half the business of mister Harper s life to make that wig appear as his own hair He talked he raved he remonstrated I am very much afraid that he swore mister Galloway laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks The crowd was parted by an authoritative hand and the same hand gentle now laid its firmness upon the woman and released the prisoner It was Hamish Channing who had come to the rescue suppressing his mirth as he best could while he effected it I ll have the law of her panted Harper as he picked up his hat and wig If there s justice to be got in Helstonleigh she shall suffer for this It s a town s shame to let her go about molesting peaceable wayfarers and shaking the life out of them Something at a distance appeared to attract the attention of the unhappy woman and she flew away Hamish and mister Harper were left alone in the streets the latter still exploding with wrath and vowing all sorts of revenge Put up with it quietly Harper advised Hamish She is like a little child not accountable for her actions That s just like you mister Hamish Channing If they took your head off you d put up with it How would you like your wig flung away in the sight of a whole street I don t wear one answered Hamish laughing Here s your hat not much damaged apparently mister Harper settling his wig on his head and composing himself as he best could continued his way to the cathedral turning his hat about in his hand and closely looking at it Hamish stepped across to mister Galloway s meeting that gentleman at the door A good thing you came up as you did mister Hamish Harper will remember Mad Nance for a year to come I expect he will replied Hamish laughing still mister Galloway laughed also and walked hastily down the street CHAPTER XIV KEEPING OFFICE Hamish entered the office Arthur and Roland Yorke had their heads stretched out of the window and did not hear his footsteps He advanced quietly and brought his hands down hastily upon the shoulder of each Roland started and knocked his head against the window frame How you startle a fellow I thought it was Mad Nance come in to lay hands upon me She has laid hands upon enough for one day said Hamish Harper will dream of her to night I thought Galloway would have gone into a fit he laughed so cried Arthur As for my sides they ll ache for an hour Roland Yorke s lip curled with an angry expression My opinion agrees with Harper s he said I think Mad Nance ought to be punished We are none of us safe from her if this is to be her game If you punish her to day she would do the same again to morrow were the fit to come over her rejoined Hamish It is not often she breaks out like this The only thing is to steer clear of her Hamish has a fellow feeling for Mad Nance mockingly spoke Roland Yorke Yes poor thing for her story is a sad one If the same grievous wrong were worked upon some of us perhaps we might take to dancing for the benefit of the public Talking of the public Arthur continued Hamish turning to his brother what became of you at dinner time The mother was for setting the town crier to work I could not get home to day We have had double work to do as Jenkins is away Hamish tilted himself on to the edge of mister Jenkins s desk and took up the letter apparently in absence of mind which mister Galloway had left there ready for the post mister Robert Galloway Sea View Terrace Ventnor Isle of Wight he read aloud That must be mister Galloway s cousin he remarked the one who has run through so much money Of course it is answered Roland Yorke Galloway pretty near keeps him I know there s a twenty pound bank note going to him in that letter Catch me doing it if I were Galloway I wish it was going into my pocket instead said Hamish balancing the letter on his fingers as if wishing to test its weight I wish the clouds would drop sovereigns But they don t said Roland Yorke Hamish put the letter back from whence he had taken it and jumped off the desk I must be walking said he Stopping here will not do my work If we By Jove there s Knivett uttered Roland Yorke Where s he off to so fast I have something that I must tell him Snatching up his hat Roland darted at full speed out of the office in search of one who was running at full speed also down the street Hamish looked out amused at the chase Arthur who had called after Roland in vain seemed vexed Knivett is one of the fleetest runners in Helstonleigh said Hamish Yorke will scarcely catch him up I wish Yorke would allow himself a little thought and not act upon impulse exclaimed Arthur I cannot stop three minutes longer and he knows that I shall be late for college He was already preparing to go there Putting some papers in order upon his desk and locking up others he carried the letter for Ventnor into mister Galloway s private room and placed it in the letter rack Two others ready for the post were lying there Then he went to the front door to look out for Yorke Yorke was not to be seen What a thoughtless fellow he is exclaimed Arthur in his vexation What is to be done Hamish you will have to stop here Thank you what else asked Hamish I must be at the college whatever betide This was true yet neither might the office be left vacant Arthur grew a little flurried Do stay Hamish it will not hinder you five minutes I dare say Yorke is sure to be in Hamish came to the door halting on its first step and looking out over Arthur s shoulder He drew his head in again with a sudden movement Is not that old Hopper down there he asked in a whisper the tone sounding as one of fear Arthur turned his eyes on a shabby old man who was crossing the end of the street and saw Hopper the sheriff s officer Yes why It is that old fellow who holds the writ He may be on the watch for me now I can t go out just yet Arthur I ll stay here till Yorke comes back again He returned to the office sat down and leaned his brow upon his hand A strange brow of care it was just then according ill with the gay face of Hamish Channing Arthur waiting for no second permission flew towards the cathedral as fast as his long legs would carry him The dean and chapter were preparing to leave the chapter house as he tore past it through the cloisters Three o clock was striking Arthur s heart and breath were alike panting when he gained the dark stairs At that moment to his excessive astonishment the organ began to peal forth Seated at it was mister Williams and a few words of explanation ensued The organist said he should remain for the service which rendered Arthur at liberty to go back again He was retracing his steps underneath the elm trees in the Boundaries at a slower pace than he had recently passed them when in turning a corner he came face to face with the sheriff s officer Arthur whose thoughts were at that moment fixed upon Hamish and his difficulties started away from the man with an impulse for which he could not have accounted No need for you to be frightened of me mister Arthur said the man who in his more palmy days before he had learnt to take more than was good for him had been a clerk in mister Channing s office I have nothing about me that will bite you He laid a stress upon the you in both cases Arthur understood only too well what was meant though he would not appear to do so Nor any one else either I hope Hopper A warm day is it not Hopper drew close to Arthur not looking at him apparently examining with hands and eyes the trunk of the elm tree underneath which they had halted You tell your brother not to put himself in my way said he in a low tone his lips scarcely moving He is in a bit of trouble as I suppose you know Yes breathed Arthur Well I don t want to serve the writ upon him I won t serve it unless he makes me by throwing himself within length of my arm If he sees me coming up one street let him cut down another into a shop anywhere I have eyes that only see when I want them to I come prowling about here once or twice a day for show but I come at a time when I am pretty sure he can t be seen just gone out or just gone in I d rather not harm him You are not so considerate to all said Arthur after a pause given to revolving the words and to wondering whether they were spoken in good faith or with some concealed purpose He could not decide which No I am not pointedly returned Hopper in answer There are some that I look after sharp as a ferret looks after a rat but I ll never do that by any son of mister Channing s I can t forget the old days sir when your father was kind to me He stood by me longer than my own friends did But for him I should have starved in that long illness I had when the office would have me no longer Why doesn t mister Hamish settle this he abruptly added I suppose he cannot answered Arthur It is only a bagatelle at the worst and our folks would not have gone to extremities if he had shown only a disposition to settle I am sure that if he would go to them now and pay down a ten pound note and say You shall have the rest as I can get it they d withdraw proceedings ay even for five pounds I believe they would Tell him to do it mister Arthur tell him I always know which way the wind blows with our people I will tell him but I fear he is very short of money just now Five or ten pounds may be as impossible to find sometimes as five or ten thousand Better find it than be locked up said Hopper How would the office get on Deprive him of the power of management and it might cost mister Channing his place What use is a man when he is in prison I was in mister Channing s office for ten years mister Arthur and I know every trick and turn in it though I have left it a good while And now that I have just said this I ll go on my way Mind you tell him Thank you warmly replied Arthur And when you have told him please to forget that you have heard it There s somebody s eyes peering at me over the deanery blinds They may peer I don t mind them deaneries don t trouble themselves with sheriff s officers He glided away and Arthur went straight to the office Hamish was alone he was seated at Jenkins s desk writing a note You here still Hamish Where s Yorke Echo answers where replied Hamish who appeared to have recovered his full flow of spirits I have seen nothing of him That s Yorke all over it is too bad It would be were this a busy afternoon with me But what brings you back mister Arthur Have you left the organ to play itself Williams is taking it he heard of Jenkins s accident and thought I might not be able to get away from the office twice today so he attended himself Come that s good natured of Williams A bargain s a bargain and having made the bargain of course it is your own look out that you fulfil it Yes it was considerate of Williams Considerate for himself laughed Arthur He did not come down to give me holiday but in the fear that mister Galloway might prevent my attending A pretty thing it would have been he said to me had there been no organist this afternoon it might have cost me my post Moonshine said Hamish It might have cost him a word of reproof nothing more Helstonleigh s dean is a strict one remember I told Williams he might always depend upon me What should you have done pray had I not been here to turn office keeper laughed Hamish Of the two duties I must have obeyed the more important one I should have locked up the office and given the key to the housekeeper till college was over or until Yorke returned He deserves something for this move Has any one called No Arthur I have been making free with a sheet of paper and an envelope said Hamish completing the note he was writing I suppose I am welcome to it To ten if you want them returned Arthur To whom are you writing As if I should put you au courant of my love letters gaily answered Hamish How could Hamish indulge in this careless gaiety with a sword hanging over his head It was verily a puzzle to Arthur A light sunny nature was Hamish Channing s This sobering blow which had fallen on it had probably not come before it was needed Had his bark been sailing for ever in smooth waters he might have wasted his life indolently basking on the calm seductive waves But the storm rose the waves ran high threatening to engulf him and Hamish knew that his best energies must be put forth to surmount them Never never talk of troubles as great unmitigated evils to the God fearing the God trusting they are fraught with hidden love Hamish were I threatened with worry as you are I could not be otherwise than oppressed and serious Where would be the use of that cried gay Hamish Care killed a cat Look here Arthur you and your grave face Did you ever know care do a fellow good I never did but a great deal of harm I shall manage to scramble out of the pit somehow You ll see He put the note into his pocket as he spoke and took up his hat to depart Stop an instant longer Hamish I have just met Hopper He did not convert you into a writ server I hope I don t think it would be legal There you are joking again Hamish he has the writ but he does not wish to serve it You are to keep out of his way he says and he will not seek to put himself in yours My father was kind to him in days gone by and he remembers it now He s a regular trump I ll send him half a crown in a parcel exclaimed Hamish I wish you would hear me out He says a ten pound note perhaps a five pound note on account would induce his people suppose you understand the phrase to stay proceedings and to give you time He strongly advises it to be done That s all Not only all Arthur had to say upon the point but all he had time to say At that moment the barouche of Lady Augusta Yorke drove up to the door and they both went out to it Lady Augusta her daughter Fanny and Constance Channing were in it She was on her way to attend a missionary meeting at the Guildhall and had called for Roland that he might escort her into the room Roland is not to be found Lady Augusta said Hamish raising his hat with one of his sunny smiles He darted off it is impossible to say where thereby making me a prisoner My brother had to attend the cathedral and there was no one to keep office Then I think I must make a prisoner of you in turn mister Hamish Channing graciously said Lady Augusta Will you accompany us Hamish shook his head I wish I could but I have already wasted more time than I ought to have done It will not cost you five minutes more urged Lady Augusta You shall only just take us into the hall I will release you then if you must be released Three ladies never can go in alone fancy how we should be stared at Constance bent her pretty face forward Do Hamish if you can He suffered himself to be persuaded stepped into the barouche and took his seat by Lady Augusta As they drove away Arthur thought the greatest ornament the carriage contained had been added to it in handsome Hamish A full hour Arthur worked on at his deeds and leases and Roland Yorke never returned mister Galloway came in then Where s Yorke was his first question Arthur replied that he did not know he had stepped out somewhere Arthur Channing was not one to make mischief or get another into trouble mister Galloway asked no further he probably inferred that Yorke had only just gone He sat down at Jenkins s desk and began to read over a lease Can I have the stamps sir for this deed Arthur presently asked They are not ready Have the letters gone to the post Not yet sir You can take them now then And Arthur suppose you step in as you return and see how Jenkins is Very well sir He went into mister Galloway s room and brought forth the three letters from the rack Is this one not to be sealed he inquired of mister Galloway indicating the one directed to Ventnor for it was mister Galloway s invariable custom to seal letters which contained money after they had been gummed down It is doubly safe he would say Ay to be sure replied mister Galloway I went off in a hurry and did not do it Bring me the wax Arthur handed him the wax and a light mister Galloway sealed the letter stamping it with the seal hanging to his watch chain He then held out his hand for another of the letters and sealed that And this one also inquired Arthur holding out the third No You can take them now Arthur departed A few paces from the door he met Roland Yorke coming along in a white heat Channing I could not help it I could not upon my honour I had to go somewhere with Knivett and we were kept till now Galloway s in an awful rage I suppose He has only just come in You had no right to play me this trick Yorke But for Hamish I must have locked up the office Don t you do it again or mister Galloway may hear of it It is all owing to that confounded Jenkins flashed Roland Why did he go and get his head smashed You are a good fellow Arthur I ll do you a neighbourly turn some time He sped into the office and Arthur walked to the post with the letters Coming back he turned into missus Jenkins s shop in the High Street missus Jenkins was behind the counter Oh go up go up and see him she cried in a tone of suppressed passion His bedroom s front up the two pair flight and I ll take my affidavit that there s been fifty folks here this day to see him if there has been one I could sow a peck of peas on the stairs You ll find other company up there Arthur groped his way up the stairs they were dark too coming in from the sunshine He found the room and entered Jenkins lay in bed his bandaged head upon the pillow and seated by his side his apron falling and his clerical hat held between his knees was the Bishop of Helstonleigh CHAPTER XV A SPLASH IN THE RIVER Amongst other facts patent to common and uncommon sense is the very obvious one that a man cannot be in two places at once In like manner no author that I ever heard of was able to relate two different portions of his narrative at one and the same time Thus you will readily understand that if I devoted the last chapter to mister Galloway his clerks and their concerns generally it could not be given to mister Ketch and his concerns although in the strict order of time and sequence the latter gentleman might have claimed an equal if not a premier right mister Ketch stood in his lodge leaning for support upon the shut up press bedstead which by day looked like a high chest of drawers with brass handles his eyes fixed on the keys hanging on the opposite nail His state of mind may be best expressed by the strong epithet savage mister Ketch had not a pleasant face at the best of times it was yellow and withered and his small bright eyes were always dropping water and the two or three locks of hair which he still possessed were faded and stood out solitary and stiff after the manner of those pictures you have seen of heathens who decorate their heads with upright tails At this moment his countenance looked particularly unpleasant mister Ketch had spent part of the night and the whole of this morning revolving the previous evening s affair of the cloisters The more he thought of it the less he liked it and the surer grew his conviction that the evil had been the work of his enemies the college boys It s as safe as day he wrathfully soliloquized There be the right keys nodding to the two on the wall and there be the wrong ones nodding towards an old knife tray into which he had angrily thrown the rusty keys upon entering his lodge last night accompanied by the crowd They meant to lock me up all night in the cloisters the wicked cannibals I hope the dean ll expel em I ll make my complaint to the head master I will Drat all college schools there s never no good done in em How are you this morning Ketch The salutation proceeded from Stephen Bywater who in the boisterous manner peculiar to himself and his tribe had flung open the door without the ceremony of knocking I m none the better for seeing you growled Ketch You need not be uncivil returned Bywater with great suavity I am only making a morning call upon you after the fashion of gentlefolks the public delights to pay respect to its officials you know How do you feel after that mishap last night We can t think any of us how you came to make the mistake I ll mistake you shrieked Ketch I kep a nasty old rusty brace o keys in my lodge to take out instead o the right ones didn t I How uncommonly stupid it was of you to do so said Bywater pretending to take the remark literally I would not keep a duplicate pair of keys by me I should make sure they d bring me to grief What do you say You did not keep duplicate keys they were false ones Why that s just what we all told you last night The bishop told you so He said he knew you had made a mistake and taken out the wrong keys for the right My belief is that you went out without any keys at all You left them hanging upon the nail and you found them there You had not got a second pair You just wait raved old Ketch I m a coming round to the head master and I ll bring the keys with me He ll let you boys know whether there s two pairs or one Horrid old rusty things they be as rusty as you Who says they are rusty Who says it They are rusty shrieked the old man You d like to get me into a madhouse you boys would worrying me I ll show you whether they re rusty I ll show you whether there s a second brace o keys or not I ll show em to the head master I ll show em to the dean I ll show em again to his lordship the bi What s gone of the keys The last sentence was uttered in a different tone and in apparent perplexity With shaking hands excited by passion mister Ketch was rummaging the knife box an old deep mahogany tray dark with age divided by a partition rummaging for the rusty keys He could not find them He searched on this side he searched on that he pulled out the contents one by one a black handled knife a white handled fork a green handled knife with a broken point and a brown handled fork with one prong which comprised his household cutlery a small whetstone a comb and a blacking brush a gimlet and a small hammer some leather shoe strings three or four tallow candles a match box and an extinguisher the key of his door the bolt of his casement window and a few other miscellanies He could not come upon the false keys and finally he made a snatch at the tray and turned it upside down The keys were not there When he had fully taken in the fact it cost him some little time to do it he turned his anger upon Bywater You have took em you have you have turned thief and stole em I put em here in the knife box and they are gone What have you done with em Come that s good exclaimed Bywater in too genuine a tone to admit a suspicion of its truth I have not been near your knife box I have not put my foot inside the door In point of fact Bywater had not He had stood outside bending his head and body inwards his hands grasping either door post What s gone with em who as took em off I ll swear I put em there and I have never looked at em nor touched em since There s an infamous conspiracy forming against me I m going to be blowed up like Guy Fawkes If you did put them there if you know some of your friends must have taken them cried Bywater in a tone midway between reason and irony There haven t a soul been nigh the place shrieked Ketch Except the milk and he gave me my ha porth through the winder Hurrah said Bywater throwing up his trencher It s a clear case of dreams You dreamt you had a second pair of keys Ketch and couldn t get rid of the impression on awaking mister Ketch D H Dreamer in chief to Helstonleigh Bywater commenced an aggravating dance Ketch was aggravated sufficiently without it What d ye call me he asked in a state of concentrated temper that turned his face livid D What d ye mean by D D stands for that bad sperit as is too near to you college boys he s among you always like a ranging lion It s like your impedence to call me by his name My dear mister Ketch call you by his name I never thought of such a thing politely retorted Bywater You are not promoted to that honour yet D H stands for Deputy Hangman Isn t it affixed to the cathedral roll kept amid the archives in the chapter house John Ketch D H porter to the cloisters I hope you don t omit the distinguishing initials when you sign your letters Ketch foamed Bywater danced The former could not find words The latter found plenty I say though mister Calcraft don t you make a similar mistake when you are going on public duty If you were to go there dreaming you had the right apparatus and find in the last moment that you had brought the wrong you don t know what the consequences might be The real victim might escape rescued by the enraged crowd and they might put the nightcap upon you and operate upon you instead So be careful We couldn t afford to lose you Only think what a lot of money it would cost to put the college into mourning Ketch gave a great gasp of agony threw an iron ladle at his tormentor which falling short of its aim came clanking down on the red brick floor and banged the door in Bywater s face Bywater withdrew to a short distance under cover of the cathedral wall and bent his body backwards and forwards with the violence of his laughter unconscious that the Bishop of Helstonleigh was standing near him surveying him with an exceedingly amused expression His lordship had been an ear witness to part of the colloquy very much to his edification What is your mirth Bywater Bywater drew himself straight and turned round as if he had been shot I was only laughing my lord he said touching his trencher I see you were you will lose your breath altogether some day if you laugh in that violent manner What were you and Ketch quarrelling about We were not quarrelling my lord I was only chaff teasing him rejoined Bywater substituting one word for the other as if fearing the first might not altogether be suited to the bishop s ears and Ketch fell into a passion As he often does I fear remarked his lordship I fancy you boys provoke him unjustifiably My lord said Bywater turning his red impudent but honest face full upon the prelate I don t deny that we do provoke him but you can have no idea what an awful tyrant he is to us I can t believe any one was ever born with such a cross grained temper He vents it upon every one not only upon the college boys but upon all who come in his way If your lordship were not the bishop added bold Bywater he would vent it upon you Would he said the bishop who was a dear lover of candour and would have excused a whole bushel of mischief rather than one little grain of falsehood Not a day passes but he sets upon us with his tongue He would keep us out of the cloisters he would keep us out of our own schoolroom He goes to the head master with the most unfounded cram stories and when the master declines to notice them for he knows Ketch of old then he goes presumingly to the dean If he let us alone we should let him alone I am not speaking this in the light of a complaint to your lordship Bywater added throwing his head back I don t want to get him into a row tyrant though he is and the college boys can hold their own against Ketch I expect they can significantly replied the bishop He would keep you out of the cloisters would he He is aiming at it returned Bywater There never would have been a word said about our playing there but for him If the dean shuts us out it will be Ketch s doings The college boys have played in the cloisters since the school was founded He would keep you out of the cloisters so by way of retaliation you lock him into them an uncomfortable place of abode for a night Bywater My lord cried Bywater Sir responded his lordship Does your lordship think it was I who played that trick on Ketch Yes I do speaking of you conjointly with the school Bywater s eyes and his good humoured countenance fell before the steady gaze of the prelate But in the gaze there was an earnest if Bywater could read it aright of good feeling of excuse for the mischief rather than of punishment in store The boy s face was red enough at all times but it turned to scarlet now If the bishop had before suspected the share played in the affair by the college boys it had by this time been converted into a certainty Boy said he confess it if you like be silent if you like but do not tell me a lie Bywater turned up his face again His free fearless eyes free in the cause of daring but fearless in that of truth looked straight into those of the bishop I never do tell lies he answered There s not a boy in the school punished oftener than I am and I don t say but I generally deserve it but it is never for telling a lie If I did tell them I should slip out of many a scrape that I am punished for now The bishop could read truth as well as any one better than many and he saw that it was being told to him now Which of you must be punished for this trick as ringleader he asked I my lord if any one must be frankly avowed Bywater We should have let him out at ten o clock We never meant to keep him there all night If I am punished I hope your lordship will be so kind as allow it to be put down to your own account not to Ketch s I should not like it to be thought that I caught it for him I heartily beg your pardon my lord for having been so unfortunate as to include you in the locking up We are all as sorry as can be that it should have happened I am ready to take any punishment for that that you may order me Ah said the bishop had you known that I was in the cloisters your friend Ketch would have come off scot free Yes that he would until Until what asked the bishop for Bywater had brought his words to a standstill Until a more convenient night I was going to say my lord Well that s candid said the bishop Bywater he gravely added you have spoken the truth to me freely Had you equivocated in the slightest degree I should have punished you for the equivocation As it is I shall look upon this as a confidential communication and not order you punishment But we will not have any more tricks played at locking up Ketch You understand All right my lord Thank you a hundred times Bywater touching his trencher leaped off The bishop turned to enter his palace gates which were close by and encountered Ketch talking to the head master The latter had been passing the lodge when he was seen and pounced upon by Ketch who thought it a good opportunity to make his complaint I am as morally sure it was them sir as I am that I be alive he was saying when the bishop came up And I don t know who they has dealings with but for certain they have sperited away them rusty keys what did the mischief without so much as putting one o their noses inside my lodge I placed em safe in the knife box last night and they re gone this morning I hope sir you ll punish them as they deserve I am nothing of course If they had locked me up and kept me there till I was worn to a skeleton it might be thought light of but his lordship the bishop bowing sideways to the prelate was a sufferer by their wickedness To be sure I was said the bishop in a grave tone but with a twinkle in his eye and therefore the complaint to mister Pye must be preferred by me Ketch We will talk of it when I have leisure he added to mister Pye with a pleasant nod as he went through the palace gates The head master bowed to the bishop and walked away leaving Ketch on the growl Meanwhile Bywater flying through the cloisters came upon Hurst and two or three more of the conspirators The time was between nine and ten o clock The boys had been home for breakfast after early school and were now reassembling but they did not go into school until a quarter before ten He is such a glorious old trump that bishop burst forth Bywater He knows all about it and is not going to put us up for punishment Let s cut round to the palace gates and cheer him Knows that it was us echoed the startled boys How did it come out to him asked Hurst He guessed it I think said Bywater and he taxed me with it So I couldn t help myself and told him I d take the punishment and he said he d excuse us but there was to be no locking up of mister Calcraft again I d lay a hundred guineas the bishop went in for scrapes himself when he was a boy emphatically added Bywater I ll be bound he thinks we only served the fellow right Hurrah for the bishop Hurrah for the bishop shouted Hurst with the other chorus of voices Long life to him He s made of the right sort of stuff I say though Jenkins is the worst added Hurst his note changing My father says he doesn t know but what brain fever will come on Moonshine laughed the boys Upon my word and honour it is not He pitched right upon his head it might have cost him his life had he fallen upon the edge of the stone step but they think he alighted flat My father was round with him this morning at six o clock Does your father know about it Not he What next cried Hurst Should I stand before him and take my trencher off with a bow and say If you please sir it was the college boys who served out old Ketch That would be a nice joke He said at breakfast this morning that that fumbling old Ketch must have got hold of the wrong keys Of course sir answered I Oh what do you think though interrupted Bywater Ketch can t find the keys He put them into a knife box he says and this morning they are gone He intended to take them round to Pye and I left him going rampant over the loss Didn t I chaff him Hurst laughed He unbuttoned the pocket of his trousers and partially exhibited two rusty keys I was not going to leave them to Ketch for witnesses said he I saw him throw them into the tray last night and I walked them out again while he was talking to the crowd I say Hurst don t be such a ninny as to keep them about you exclaimed Berkeley in a fright Suppose Pye should go in for a search this morning and visit our pockets You d floor us at once The truth is I don t know where to put them ingenuously acknowledged Hurst If I hid them at home they d be found if I dropped them in the street some hullaballoo might arise from it Let s carry them back to the old iron shop and get the fellow to buy them back at half price Catch him doing that Besides the trick is sure to get wind in the town he might be capable of coming forward and declaring that we bought the keys at his shop Let s throw em down old Pye s well They d come up again in the bucket as ghosts do Couldn t we make a railway parcel of them and direct it to mister Smith London Two pounds to pay to be kept till called for added Mark Galloway improving upon the suggestion They d put it in their fire proof safe and it would never come out again Throw them into the river said Stephen Bywater That s the only safe place for them they d lie at the bottom for ever We have time to do it now Come along Acting upon the impulse as schoolboys usually do they went galloping out of the cloisters running against the head master who was entering and nearly overturning his equilibrium He gave them an angry word of caution they touched their caps in reply and somewhat slackened their speed resuming the gallop when he was out of hearing Inclosing the cathedral and its precincts on the western side was a wall built of red stone It was only breast high standing on the cathedral side but on the other side it descended several feet to the broad path which ran along the banks of the river The boys made for this wall and gained it their faces hot and their breath gone Who ll pitch em in cried Hurst who did not altogether relish being chief actor himself for windows looked on to that particular spot from various angles and corners of the Boundaries You shall do it Galloway Oh shall I though returned young Galloway not relishing it either You precious rebel Take the keys and do as I order you Young Galloway was under Hurst He no more dared to disobey him than he could have disobeyed the head master Had Hurst ordered him to jump into the river he must have done it He took the keys tendered him by Hurst and was raising them for the pitch when Bywater laid his hand upon them and struck them down with a sudden movement clutching them to him You little wretch you are as deaf as a donkey he uttered There s somebody coming up Turn your head and look who it is It proved to be Fordham the dean s servant He was accidentally passing The boys did not fear him nevertheless it was only prudent to remain still until he had gone by They stood all five leaning upon the wall soiling their waistcoats and jackets in apparent contemplation of the view beyond A pleasant view The river wound peacefully between its green banks meadows and cornfields were stretched out beyond while an opening afforded a glimpse of that lovely chain of hills and the white houses nestled at their base A barge drawn by a horse was appearing slowly from underneath the city bridge blue smoke ascending from its chimney A woman on board was hanging out linen to dry a shirt a pair of stockings and a handkerchief her husband s change for the coming Sunday A young girl was scraping potatoes beside her and a man probably the husband sat steering his pipe in his mouth The boys fixed their eyes upon the boat I shouldn t mind such a life as that fellow s yonder exclaimed young Berkeley who was fonder of idleness than he was of Latin I ll turn bargeman when other trades fail It must be rather jolly to sit steering a boat all day and do nothing but smoke Fordham s gone and be hanged to him Now for it Galloway Stop a bit said Bywater They must be wrapped up or else tied close together Better wrap them up and then no matter who sees They can t swear there are keys inside Who has any paper about him One of the boys Hall had his exercise book with him They tore a sheet or two out of it and folded it round the keys Hurst producing some string I ll fling them in said Bywater Make haste then or we shall have to wait till the barge has gone by Bywater took a cautious look round saw nobody and flung the parcel into the middle of the river Rari nantes in gurgite vasto ejaculated he Now you gents what be you throwing into the river The words came from Hudson the porter to the Boundaries who appeared to have sprung up from the ground In reality he had been standing on the steps leading to the river but the boat house had hidden him from their view He was a very different man from the cloister porter was afraid of the college boys rather than otherwise and addressed them individually as sir The keeper of the boat house heard this and came up the steps If you gentlemen have been throwing anything into the river you know that it s against the rules Don t bother returned Hurst to the keeper But you know it is wrong gentlemen remonstrated the keeper What was it you threw in It made a dreadful splash Ah what was it coolly answered Hurst What should you say to a dead cat Hudson have the goodness to mind your business unless you would like to get reported for interfering with what does not concern you There s a quarter to ten exclaimed Bywater as the college clock chimed the three quarters We shall be marked late every soul of us They flew away their feet scarcely touching the ground clattered up the schoolroom stairs and took their places Gaunt was only beginning to call over the roll and they escaped the late mark It s better to be born lucky than rich said saucy Bywater

none	none	MUCH TO ALTER 
8609_262281_000004_000000	train-clean-100	At the same moment Constance Channing was traversing the Boundaries on her way to Lady Augusta Yorke s where she had some days since commenced her duties 
8609_262281_000004_000001	train-clean-100	It took her scarcely two minutes to get there for the houses were almost within view of each other 
8609_262281_000004_000002	train-clean-100	Constance would willingly have commenced the daily routine at an earlier hour 
8609_262281_000004_000003	train-clean-100	Lady Augusta freely confessed that to come earlier would be useless for she could not get her daughters up 
8609_262281_000004_000004	train-clean-100	Strictly speaking Lady Augusta did not personally try to get them up for she generally lay in bed herself 
8609_262281_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 That is one of the habits I must alter in the children thought Constance 
8609_262281_000006_000000	train-clean-100	She entered took off her things in the room appropriated to her and passed into the schoolroom 
8609_262281_000006_000001	train-clean-100	It was empty though the children ought to have been there preparing their lessons 
8609_262281_000006_000002	train-clean-100	Fanny came running in her hair in curl papers some bread and butter in her hand 
8609_262281_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Carry has not finished her breakfast Miss Channing quoth she 
8609_262281_000007_000001	train-clean-100	 She was lazy this morning 
none	none	I think some one else was lazy also said Constance gently drawing the child to her
8609_262281_000008_000001	train-clean-100	 Why did you come down half dressed my dear 
8609_262281_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 I am quite dressed responded Fanny 
8609_262281_000009_000001	train-clean-100	 My frock s on and so is my pinafore 
8609_262281_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 And these said Constance touching the curl papers 
8609_262281_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh Martha got up late and said she had no time to take them out 
8609_262281_000011_000001	train-clean-100	It will keep in curl all the better Miss Channing and perhaps I am going to the missionary meeting with mamma 
8609_262281_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Constance rang the bell 
none	none	Martha who was the only maid kept except the cook appeared in answer to it 
8609_262281_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Lady Augusta was wont to say that she had too much expense with her boys to keep many servants and the argument was a true one 
8609_262281_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Be so kind as to take the papers out of Miss Fanny s hair 
8609_262281_000013_000001	train-clean-100	And let it be done in future Martha before she comes to me 
8609_262281_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Gently as the words were spoken there was no mistaking that the tone was one of authority and not to be trifled with 
8609_262281_000014_000001	train-clean-100	Martha withdrew with the child 
8609_262281_000014_000002	train-clean-100	And just then Caroline came in full of eagerness 
8609_262281_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Miss Channing mamma says she shall take one of us to the missionary meeting whichever you choose to fix upon 
8609_262281_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Mind you fix upon me 
none	none	What does that little chit Fanny want at a missionary meeting 
8609_262281_000015_000003	train-clean-100	She is too young to go 
8609_262281_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 It is expected to be a very interesting meeting observed Constance making no reply to Miss Caroline s special request 
8609_262281_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 A gentleman who has lived for some years amongst the poor heathens is to give a history of his personal experiences 
8609_262281_000016_000002	train-clean-100	Some of the anecdotes are beautiful 
8609_262281_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Who told you they were asked Caroline 
8609_262281_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 mister Yorke replied Constance a pretty blush rising to her cheek 
8609_262281_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 He knows the lecturer well 
8609_262281_000018_000002	train-clean-100	You would be pleased to hear them 
8609_262281_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 It is not for that I wish to go said Caroline 
none	none	I think meetings where there s nothing but talking are the dullest things in the world If I were to listen it would send me to sleep
8609_262281_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Then why do you wish so much to attend this one 
8609_262281_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Because I shall wear my new dress 
8609_262281_000021_000001	train-clean-100	I have not had it on yet 
none	none	It rained last Sunday and mamma would not let me put it on for college 
8609_262281_000021_000003	train-clean-100	I was in such a passion 
8609_262281_000022_000000	train-clean-100	Constance wondered where she should begin 
8609_262281_000022_000001	train-clean-100	There was so much to do so much to alter in so many ways 
8609_262281_000022_000002	train-clean-100	To set to work abruptly would never answer 
8609_262281_000022_000003	train-clean-100	It must be commenced gradually almost imperceptibly little by little 
8609_262281_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Caroline do you know that you have disobeyed me 
8609_262281_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 In what way Miss Channing 
8609_262281_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Did I not request you to have that exercise written out 
8609_262281_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 I know said Caroline with some contrition 
8609_262281_000026_000001	train-clean-100	 I intended to write it out this morning before you came but somehow I lay in bed 
8609_262281_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 If I were to come to you every morning at seven o clock would you undertake to get up and be ready for me asked Constance 
8609_262281_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Caroline drew a long face 
8609_262281_000028_000001	train-clean-100	She did not speak 
8609_262281_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 My dear you are fifteen 
8609_262281_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Well responded Caroline 
none	none	And you must not feel hurt if I tell you that I should think no other young lady of that age and in your position is half so deficient as you are 
8609_262281_000031_000001	train-clean-100	Deficient in many ways Caroline in goodness in thoughtfulness and in other desirable qualities and greatly so in education 
8609_262281_000031_000002	train-clean-100	Annabel who is a year younger than you is twice as advanced 
8609_262281_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Annabel says you worry her into learning 
8609_262281_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Annabel is fond of talking nonsense but she is a good loving child at heart 
none	none	You would be surprised at the little trouble she really gives me while she makes a show of giving me a great deal I have so much to teach you Caroline to your mind and heart as well as to your intellect that I feel the hours as at present arranged will be insufficient for me My dear when you grow up to womanhood I am sure you will wish to be loving and loved 
8609_262281_000034_000000	train-clean-100	Caroline burst into tears 
8609_262281_000034_000001	train-clean-100	 I should do better if mamma were not so cross with me Miss Channing 
8609_262281_000034_000002	train-clean-100	I always do anything that William Yorke asks me and I will do anything for you 
8609_262281_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Constance kissed her 
8609_262281_000035_000001	train-clean-100	 Then will you begin by rising early and being ready for me at seven 
8609_262281_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I will answered Caroline 
none	none	But Martha must be sure to call me Are you going to the meeting this afternoon
8609_262281_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Of course not said Constance 
8609_262281_000037_000001	train-clean-100	 My time now belongs to you 
none	none	But I think mamma wishes you to go with us 
8609_262281_000038_000001	train-clean-100	She said something about it 
none	none	Does she 
8609_262281_000039_000001	train-clean-100	I should very much like to go 
8609_262281_000040_000000	train-clean-100	Lady Augusta came in and proffered the invitation to Constance to accompany them 
8609_262281_000040_000001	train-clean-100	Constance then spoke of giving the children the extra two hours from seven to nine it was really necessary she said if she was to do her duty by them 
8609_262281_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 How very conscientious you are laughed Lady Augusta her tone savouring of ridicule 
8609_262281_000042_000000	train-clean-100	Constance coloured almost to tears with her emotion 
8609_262281_000042_000001	train-clean-100	 I am responsible to One always Lady Augusta 
8609_262281_000042_000002	train-clean-100	I may not make mine only eye service 
8609_262281_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 You will never put up with our scrambling breakfast Miss Channing 
8609_262281_000043_000001	train-clean-100	The boys are so unruly and I do not get up to it half my time 
none	none	I will return home to breakfast 
8609_262281_000044_000001	train-clean-100	I should prefer to do so 
8609_262281_000044_000002	train-clean-100	And I will be here again at ten 
8609_262281_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 Whatever time do you get up 
8609_262281_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Not very early answered Constance 
8609_262281_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 Hitherto I have risen at seven summer and winter 
8609_262281_000046_000002	train-clean-100	Dressing and reading takes me just an hour for the other hour I find plenty of occupation 
8609_262281_000046_000003	train-clean-100	We do not breakfast until nine on account of Tom and Charley 
8609_262281_000046_000004	train-clean-100	I shall rise at six now and come here at seven 
8609_262281_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Very well said Lady Augusta 
8609_262281_000047_000001	train-clean-100	 I suppose this will only apply to the summer months 
8609_262281_000047_000002	train-clean-100	One of the girls shall go with us to day whichever deserves it best 
8609_262281_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 You are not leaving one of them at home to make room for me I hope Lady Augusta 
none	none	Not at all answered Lady Augusta I never chaperon two children to a crowded meeting 
8609_262281_000049_000002	train-clean-100	People might say they took up the room of grown up persons 
none	none	You will let me go not Caroline Miss Channing pleaded Fanny when her mother had quitted them
8609_262281_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 No said Caroline sharply Miss Channing will fix upon me 
8609_262281_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 I shall obey Lady Augusta and decide upon the one who shall best merit it smiled Constance 
8609_262281_000052_000001	train-clean-100	 It will be only right to do so 
8609_262281_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Suppose we are both good and merit it equally suggested Fanny 
none	none	Then my dear little girl you must not be disappointed if in that case I give the privilege to Caroline as being the elder of the two But I will make it up to you in some other way 
8609_262281_000055_000000	train-clean-100	Alas for poor Caroline s resolution 
none	none	For a short time an hour or so she did strive to do her best but then good resolutions were forgotten and idleness followed 
8609_262281_000055_000002	train-clean-100	Not only idleness temper also 
none	none	Never had she been so troublesome to Constance as on this day she even forgot herself so far as to be insolent Fanny was taken to the meeting you saw her in the carriage when Lady Augusta drove to mister Galloway s office and persuaded Hamish to join them Caroline was left at home in a state of open rebellion with the lessons to learn which she had not learnt in the day
8609_262281_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 How shall you get on with them Constance the reverend 
none	none	William Yorke inquired of her that same evening
8609_262281_000056_000002	train-clean-100	 Have the weeds destroyed the good seed 
8609_262281_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 Not quite destroyed it replied Constance though she sighed sadly as she spoke as if nearly losing heart for the task she had undertaken There is so much ill to undo 
none	none	Caroline is the worst the weeds with her have had longer time to get ahead 
8609_262281_000057_000002	train-clean-100	I think perhaps if I could keep her wholly with me for a twelvemonth or so watching over her constantly a great deal might be effected 
none	none	If that anticipated living would fall in which seems very far away in the clouds and you were wholly mine we might have Caroline with us for a time laughed mister Yorke Constance laughed too
8609_262281_000059_000001	train-clean-100	 Do not be impatient or it will seem to be further off still 
none	none	It will come William 
8609_262281_000060_000000	train-clean-100	They had been speaking in an undertone standing together at a window apart from the rest 
8609_262281_000060_000001	train-clean-100	mister Channing was lying on his sofa underneath the other window and now spoke to mister Yorke 
8609_262281_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 You had a treat I hear at the meeting to day 
8609_262281_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 We had indeed sir replied mister Yorke advancing to take a seat near him 
8609_262281_000062_000001	train-clean-100	 It is not often we have the privilege of listening to so eloquent a speaker as doctor Lamb 
8609_262281_000062_000002	train-clean-100	His experience is great and his whole heart was in his subject 
8609_262281_000062_000003	train-clean-100	I should like to bring him here to call upon you 
none	none	I should be pleased to receive him replied mister Channing
8609_262281_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 I think it is possible that his experience in another line may be of service to you continued mister Yorke 
none	none	You are aware that ill health drove him home
8609_262281_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 I have heard so 
8609_262281_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 His complaint was rheumatism very much as I fancy the same sort of rheumatism that afflicts you 
8609_262281_000066_000001	train-clean-100	He told me he came to Europe with very little hope he feared his complaint had become chronic and incurable But he has been restored in a wonderful manner and is in sound health again 
8609_262281_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 And what remedies did he use eagerly asked mister Channing 
8609_262281_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 A three months residence at some medicinal springs in Germany 
none	none	Nothing else When I say nothing else of course I must imply that he was under medical treatment there 
8609_262281_000068_000003	train-clean-100	It is the very thing you see sir that has been ordered for you 
none	none	Ay sighed mister Channing feeling how very faint appeared to be the hope that he should have the opportunity of trying it
8609_262281_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 I was mentioning your case to him observed mister Yorke 
none	none	He said he had no doubt the baths would do you equal good 
8609_262281_000070_000002	train-clean-100	He is a doctor you know 
none	none	I will bring him here to talk it over with you 
8609_262281_000071_000000	train-clean-100	At that moment mister Galloway entered the subject was continued 
none	none	mister Yorke and mister Galloway were eloquent on it telling mister Channing that he must go to Germany as a point of duty The Channings themselves were silent they could not see the way at all clear When mister Yorke was leaving he beckoned Constance and Arthur into the hall mister Channing must go he whispered to them
8609_262281_000072_000001	train-clean-100	 Think of all that is at stake 
8609_262281_000072_000002	train-clean-100	Renewed health exertion happiness 
8609_262281_000072_000003	train-clean-100	Arthur you did not urge it by a single word 
none	none	Arthur did not feel hopeful indeed his heart sank within him the whole time that they were talking 
8609_262281_000073_000001	train-clean-100	Hamish and his difficulties were the dark shadow though he could not tell this to mister Yorke 
none	none	Were mister Channing to go abroad and the arrest of Hamish to follow upon it the post they held and its emoluments might be taken from them at once and for ever doctor Lamb says the cost was so trifling as scarcely to be credited continued mister Yorke in a tone of remonstrance Arthur don t you care to help to save him I would move heaven and earth to save my father impulsively spoke Arthur stung by the implied reproof I should not care what labour it cost me to procure the money so that I succeeded We all would said Constance you must know we would William From Hamish downwards Who is that making free with Hamish s name demanded that gentleman himself entering the house with a free step and merry countenance Did you think I was lost I was seduced into joining your missionary meeting people and have had to stop late at the office to make up for it We have been talking about papa Hamish said Constance Fresh hope seems to arise daily that those German baths would restore him to health They cured doctor Lamb I say Hamish that the money must be found for it somehow added mister Yorke Found of course it shall be found cried gay Hamish I intend to be a chief contributor to it myself But his joking words and careless manner jarred at that moment upon the spirit both of Arthur and Constance Channing Why Could there have been any unconscious foreshadowing of evil to come CHAPTER XVII SUNDAY MORNING AT mister CHANNING S AND AT LADY AUGUSTA S The day of rest came round in due course A day of rest it is in truth to those who have learnt to make it such a pleasant time of peace a privileged season of commune with God a loving day of social happiness for home and home ties And yet strange to say it is to some the most hurried uncomfortable disagreeable day of all the seven missus Channing s breakfast hour was nine o clock on ordinary days made thus late for the sake of convenience 
8644-262282-0000	train-other-500	On Sundays it was half past eight Discipline and training had rendered it easy to observe rules at mister Channing s or it may be better to say it had rendered them difficult to be disobeyed
8644-262282-0001	train-other-500	At half past eight all were in the breakfast room dressed for the day When the hour for divine service arrived
none	none	 they had only to put on their hats and bonnets to be ready for it Even old Judy was grand on a Sunday morning 
8644-262282-0002	train-other-500	Her mob cap was of spotted instead of plain net and her check apron was replaced by a white one With great personal inconvenience and some pain for he was always worse in the morning
none	none	 mister Channing would on that day rise to breakfast 
8644-262282-0003	train-other-500	It had been his invariable custom to take the reading himself on Sunday the little time he devoted to religion and he was unwilling to break through it Breakfast over it was immediately entered upon and would be finished by ten o clock
8644-262282-0004	train-other-500	He did not preach a sermon
none	none	 he did not give them much reading it was only a little homely preparation for the day 
8644-262282-0005	train-other-500	and the services they were about to enter upon Very unwise had it been of mister Channing to tire his children with a private service before the public service began Breakfast on these mornings was always a longer meal than usual
8644-262282-0006	train-other-500	There was no necessity to hurry over it in order to hasten to the various occupations of every day life It was taken leisurely amidst much pleasant social converse As they were assembling for breakfast on this morning Arthur came in
8644-262282-0007	train-other-500	It was so unusual for them to leave the house early on a Sunday that mister Channing looked at him with surprise I have been to see Jenkins sir he explained In coming home last night I met mister Hurst who told me he feared Jenkins was getting worse
8644-262282-0008	train-other-500	I would not go to see him then it might have been late to disturb him so I have been now And how is he inquired mister Channing A great deal better replied Arthur So much better that mister Hurst says he may come
8644-262282-0009	train-other-500	to the office to morrow should there be no relapse He enjoins strict quiet for to day And missus Jenkins is determined that he shall have quiet
none	none	 therefore I am sure he will 
8644-262282-0010	train-other-500	Arthur added laughing She says he appeared ill last night only from the number of visitors he had seen They were coming in all day long and on Friday besides Why should people flock to see Jenkins exclaimed Tom He is nobody
8644-262282-0011	train-other-500	That is just what missus Jenkins said this morning returned Arthur
none	none	 I believe they go out of curiosity to hear the truth of the locking up in the cloisters 
8644-262282-0012	train-other-500	The bishop s having been one of the sufferers has aroused the interest of Helstonleigh I am very glad that Jenkins is better observed mister Charming So am I emphatically answered Arthur
8644-262282-0013	train-other-500	He was pretty sure Tom had had no share in the exploit but he did not know about Charley The dean preaches to day suddenly called out Tom How do you know demanded Annabel Because I do
8644-262282-0014	train-other-500	oracularly spoke Tom Will you condescend to inform me how you know it Tom if you will not inform Annabel asked mister Channing Tom laughed The dean began his close residence yesterday papa
8644-262282-0015	train-other-500	Therefore we know he will preach to day mister Channing sighed He was debarred from attending the services and he felt the deprivation keenly when he found that any particularly eminent man was to fill the cathedral pulpit
8644-262282-0016	train-other-500	The dean of Helstonleigh was an admirable preacher Oh exclaimed mister Channing in the uncontrollable impulse of the moment if I could only regain health and strength
8644-262282-0017	train-other-500	It will come James God willing said missus Channing looking up hopefully from the cups she was filling What I have heard of doctor Lamb s restoration has put new confidence into me
8644-262282-0018	train-other-500	I think mister Yorke intends to bring doctor Lamb to see you this afternoon papa said Constance I shall be glad to see him I shall be glad to hear the particulars of his case and its cure exclaimed mister Channing with all conscious eagerness
8644-262282-0019	train-other-500	Did mister Yorke tell you he should bring him to day Constance Yes papa doctor Lamb intends to be at the cathedral for afternoon service and mister Yorke said he would bring him here afterwards You must get him to take tea with us Mary
8644-262282-0020	train-other-500	Certainly answered missus Channing In six months from this James you may be as well and active as ever mister Channing raised his hands as if warding off the words Not of the words was he afraid but of the hopes they whispered
none	none	 I think too much about it already Mary It is not as though I were sure of getting to the medicinal baths We will take care that you do that sir 
8644-262282-0021	train-other-500	said Hamish with his sunny smile You cannot help in it you know Hamish
none	none	 interposed saucy Annabel It will be Arthur and Constance who will help 
8644-262282-0022	train-other-500	not you I heard you say so
none	none	 But I have changed my mind and intend to help 
8644-262282-0023	train-other-500	returned Hamish And if you will allow me the remark young lady I think it would better become a certain little girl not to chatter quite so much
8644-262282-0024	train-other-500	Was Hamish speaking in jest or earnest with regard to the helping point of the affair A peculiar tone in his voice in spite of its lightness had struck both Constance and Arthur each being in the secret of his
8644-262282-0025	train-other-500	more than want of funds The second bell was beginning to chime as the Channings entered the cloister gates Tom and Charles had gone on before Panting breathless almost knocking down Annabel
8644-262282-0026	train-other-500	came Tod Yorke terribly afraid of being marked late Take care Tod exclaimed Hamish Are you running for a wager Don t keep me mister Hamish Channing
none	none	 Those incapable servants of ours never called us till the bell began I have had no breakfast 
8644-262282-0027	train-other-500	and Gerald couldn t find his shirt He has had to come off in his dirty one with his waistcoat buttoned up Won t my lady be in a rage when she sees him Getting up and breakfasting were generally
8644-262282-0028	train-other-500	bustling affairs at Lady Augusta s but the confusion of every day was as nothing compared with that of Sunday Master Tod was wrong when he complained that he had not been called The servants had called both him and Gerald who shared the same room
none	none	 but the young gentlemen had gone to sleep again The breakfast hour was the same as other mornings nine o clock 
8644-262282-0029	train-other-500	but for all the observance it obtained
none	none	 it might as well have been nine at night 
8644-262282-0030	train-other-500	To give the servants their due breakfast on this morning was on the table at nine
none	none	 that is the cloth the cups and saucers and there it remained until ten 
8644-262282-0031	train-other-500	The maids meanwhile enjoyed their own leisurely breakfast in the kitchen regaling themselves with hot coffee poached eggs buttered toast and a dish of gossip At ten Lady Augusta who made a merit of always rising to breakfast on a Sunday
8644-262282-0032	train-other-500	entered the breakfast room in a dirty morning wrapper and rang the bell Is nobody down cried she sharply I think not my lady
none	none	 was Martha s reply I have not heard them I have been three times in the young ladies room but they would not get up This was not quite true 
8644-262282-0033	train-other-500	Martha had been in once and had been scolded for her pains None of them ever will get up on a Sunday morning added Martha they say where s the good Bring in breakfast
none	none	 crossly responded Lady Augusta And then go to the young ladies and see whether the rest are getting up What has the cook been at with this coffee Lady Augusta added when she began to pour it out It is cold 
8644-262282-0034	train-other-500	Her coffee is always cold
none	none	 It has been made half an hour I know my lady 
8644-262282-0035	train-other-500	The first to appear was the youngest child of all little Frank the next his brother a year older they wore dirty collars and their hair was uncombed Then came the girls Caroline without a frock a shawl thrown on instead
none	none	 and Fanny in curl papers 
8644-262282-0036	train-other-500	Lady Augusta scolded them for their late appearance forgetting possibly that she herself set the example It is not much past ten said Caroline We shall be in time for college It is nearly upon half past replied Lady Augusta
8644-262282-0037	train-other-500	Why do you come down in a petticoat Caroline That stupid dressmaker has put no tape to my dress fretfully responded Caroline
none	none	 Martha is sewing it on 
8644-262282-0038	train-other-500	Roland lounged in not more presentable than the rest Why had Lady Augusta not brought them up to better habits Why should they come down on a Sunday morning more untidy than on other mornings
none	none	 They would have told you 
8644-262282-0039	train-other-500	had you asked the question that on other mornings they must be ready to hasten to their daily occupations Had Sunday no occupation then Did it deserve no marked deference
8644-262282-0040	train-other-500	Had I been Lady Augusta Yorke I should have said to Roland that morning when I saw his slip shod slippers and his collarless neck If you can show no respect for me show it for the day Half past ten struck and Lady Augusta started up to fly to her own room
8644-262282-0041	train-other-500	She had still much to do ere she could be presentable for college Caroline followed Fanny wondered what Gerald and Tod would do Not yet down Those boys will get a tanning to morrow from old Pye
8644-262282-0042	train-other-500	exclaimed Roland remembering the time when tannings had been his portion for the same fault Go and see what they are after Martha They were after jumping up in alarm aroused by the college bell Amidst wild confusion for nothing seemed to be at hand
8644-262282-0043	train-other-500	with harsh reproaches to Martha touching their shirts and socks and other articles of attire they scrambled downstairs somehow and flew out of the house on their way to the college schoolroom Gerald drinking a freshly made scalding cup of coffee
8644-262282-0044	train-other-500	Tod cramming a thick piece of bread and butter into his pocket and trusting to some spare moment to eat it in All this was the usual scramble of Sunday morning The Yorkes did get to college somehow and there was an end of it
8644-262282-0045	train-other-500	After the conclusion of the service as the congregation were dispersing mister Galloway came up to Arthur Channing in the cloisters and drew him aside Do you recollect taking the letters to the post on Friday afternoon he inquired
none	none	 On Friday mused Arthur 
8644-262282-0046	train-other-500	who could not at the moment recollect much about that particular day s letters it was he who generally posted them for the office
none	none	 Oh yes I do remember sir he replied as the relative circumstances flashed across him mister Galloway looked at him possibly doubting whether he really did remember How many letters were there for the post that afternoon he asked Three promptly rejoined Arthur Two were for London and one was for Ventnor Just so assented mister Galloway Now then to whom did you intrust the posting of those letters I did not intrust them to any one replied Arthur I posted them myself You are sure Quite sure sir answered Arthur in some surprise But mister Galloway said no more and gave no reason for his inquiry He turned into his own house which was situated near the cloister gates and Arthur went on home Had you been attending worship in Helstonleigh Cathedral that same afternoon you might have observed as one of the congregation a tall stout man with a dark sallow face and grey hair He sat in a stall near to the Reverend William Yorke who was the chanter for the afternoon It was doctor Lamb A somewhat peculiar history was his Brought up to the medical profession and taking his physician s degree early he went out to settle in New Zealand where he had friends Circumstances brought him into frequent contact with the natives there A benevolent thoughtful man gifted with much Christian grace the sad spiritual state of these poor heathens gave the deepest concern to doctor Lamb He did what he could for them in his leisure hours but his profession took up most of his time often did he wish he had more time at his command A few years of hard work and then the wish was realized A small patrimony was bequeathed him sufficient to enable him to live without work From that time he applied himself to the arduous duties of a missionary and his labours were crowned with marked success Next came illness He was attacked with rheumatism in the joints and after many useless remedies had been tried he came home in search of health which he found as you have heard in certain German spas mister Channing watched the clock eagerly Unless it has been your portion my reader to undergo long and apparently hopeless affliction and to find yourself at length unexpectedly told that there may be a cure for you that another afflicted in a similar manner has been restored to health by simple means and will call upon you and describe to you what they were you could scarcely understand the nervous expectancy of mister Channing on this afternoon Four o clock they would soon be here now A very little time longer and they were with him his family mister Yorke and doctor Lamb The chief subject of anxiety was soon entered upon doctor Lamb describing his illness at great length But were you as helpless as I am inquired mister Channing Quite as helpless I was carried on board and carried to a bed at an hotel when I reached England From what I have heard of your case and from what you say I should judge the nature of your malady to be precisely similar to mine And now tell me about the healing process doctor Lamb paused You must promise to put faith in my prescription mister Channing raised his eyes in surprise Why should I not do so Because it will appear to you so very simple I consulted a medical man in London one skilled in rheumatic cases and he gave it as his opinion that a month or two passed at one of the continental springs might restore me I laughed at him You did not believe him I did not indeed Shall I confess to you that I felt vexed with him There was I a poor afflicted man lying helpless racked with pain and to be gravely assured that a short sojourn at a pleasant foreign watering place would in all probability cure me sounded very like mockery I knew something of the disease its ordinary treatment and its various phases It was true I had left Europe for many years and strange changes had been taking place in medical science Still I had no faith in what he said as being applicable to my own case and for a whole month week after week day after day I declined to entertain his views I considered that it would be so much time and money wasted doctor Lamb paused mister Channing did not interrupt him One Sunday evening I was on my solitary sofa lying in pain as I can see you are lying now The bells were ringing out for evening service I lay thinking of my distressed condition wishing I could be healed By and by after the bells had ceased and the worshippers had assembled within the walls of the sanctuary from which privilege I was excluded I took up my Bible It opened at the fifth chapter of the second book of Kings I began to read somewhat listlessly I fear listlessly at any rate compared with the strange enthusiasm which grew upon me as I read Go and wash in Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean And Naaman was wroth And his servants spake unto him and said My father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith unto thee Wash and be clean mister Channing doctor Lamb continued in a deeper tone the words sounded in my ear fell upon my heart as a very message sent direct from God All the folly of my own obstinate disbelief came full upon me the scales seemed to fall from my eyes and I said Shall I not try that simple thing A firm conviction that the chapter had been directed to me that night as a warning seated itself within me and from that hour I never entertained a shadow of doubt but that the baths would be successful And you journeyed to them Instantly Within a week I was there I seemed to know that I was going to my cure You will not probably understand this I understand it perfectly was mister Channing s answer I believe that a merciful Providence does vouchsafe at rare times to move us by these direct interpositions I need not ask you if you were cured I have heard that you were I see you are Can you tell me aught of the actual means I was ordered to a small place in the neighbourhood of Aix la Chapelle a quiet unpretending place where there are ever rising springs of boiling sulphuric water The precise course of treatment I will come in another day and describe to you I had to drink a great deal of the water warm six or eight half pints of it a day I had to bathe regularly in this water and I had to take what are called douche baths every other day I have heard of the douche baths said mister Channing Rather fierce are they not Fierce echoed the doctor The first time I tried one I thought I should never come out alive The water was dashed upon me through a tube with what seemed alarming force until I grew used to it whilst an attendant rubbed and turned and twisted my limbs about as if they had been so many straws in his strong hand So violent is the action of the water that my face had to be protected by a board lest it should come into contact with it Strong treatment remarked mister Channing Strong but effectual Effectual so far as my case was concerned Whether it was drinking the water or the sulphur baths the douches the pure air or the Prussian doctor s medicine or all combined I was under God s goodness restored to health I entertain no doubt that you may be restored in like manner And the cost asked mister Channing with a sigh he could not wholly suppress There s the beauty of it the advantage to us poor folks who possess a shallow purse and that only half filled laughed doctor Lamb Had it been costly I could not have afforded it These baths mind you are in the hotel which is the greatest possible accommodation to invalids the warm baths cost a franc each the douche two francs the water you drink nothing The doctor s fee is four and sixpence and you need not consult him often Ascertain the proper course and go on with it But the hotel expenses That cost me four shillings a day everything included except a trifle for servants Candles alone were extras and I did not burn them very much for I was glad to go to bed early Wine I do not take or that also would have been an extra You could not live very much cheaper at home How I should like to go broke from the lips of mister Channing Hamish came forward You must go my dear father It shall be managed You speak hopefully Hamish Hamish smiled I feel so sir Do you feel so also my friend said doctor Lamb fervently Go forth to the remedy as I did in the full confidence that God can and will send His blessing upon it CHAPTER XVIII mister JENKINS ALIVE AGAIN The quiet of Sunday was over and Helstonleigh awoke on the Monday morning to the bustle of every day life mister Jenkins awoke with others and got up not Jenkins the old bedesman but his son Joseph who had the grey mare for his wife It was mister Jenkins s intention to resume his occupation that day with mister Hurst s and missus Jenkins s permission the former he might have defied the latter he dared not However he was on the safe side for both had accorded it missus Jenkins was making breakfast in the small parlour behind her hosiery shop when her husband appeared He looked all the worse for his accident Poor Joe was one whom a little illness told upon Thin pale and lantern jawed at the best of times indeed he was not infrequently honoured with the nickname of scare crow he now looked thinner and paler than ever His tall shadowy form seemed bent with the weakness induced by lying a few days in bed while his hair had been cut off in three places at the top of his head to give way to as many patches of white plaster A nice figure you ll cut in the office to day with those ornaments on your crown was missus Jenkins s salutation I am thinking to fold this broadly upon my head and tie it under my chin said he meekly holding out a square black silk handkerchief which he had brought down in his hand That would not hide the patch upon your forehead stupid responded missus Jenkins I believe you must have bumped upon the edge of every stair in the organ loft as you came down to get so many wounds she continued crossly If you ever do such a senseless trick again you shan t stir abroad without me or the maid at your back to take care of you I promise you that I have combed my hair over the place on my forehead civilly replied mister Jenkins I don t think it shows much And made yourself look like an owl I thought it was nothing less than a stuffed owl coming in Why can t you wear your hat That would hide your crown and your forehead too I did think of that and I dare say mister Galloway would allow me to do it and overlook the disrespect in consideration of the circumstances answered Jenkins But then I thought again suppose the dean should chance to come into the office to day or any of the canons There s no telling but they may I could not keep my hat on in their presence and I should not like to take it off and expose the plasters You d frighten them away if you did said missus Jenkins dashing some water into the teapot Therefore he added when she had finished speaking I think it will be better to put on this handkerchief People do wear them when suffering from neuralgia or from toothache Law wear it if you like what a fuss you make about nothing If you chose to go with your head wrapped up in a blanket nobody would look at you Very true meekly coughed mister Jenkins What are you doing irascibly demanded missus Jenkins perceiving that of two slices of bacon which she had put upon his plate one had been surreptitiously conveyed back to the dish I am not hungry this morning I cannot eat it I say you shall eat it What next Do you think you are going to starve yourself My appetite will come back to me in a morning or two he deprecatingly observed It is back quite enough for that bacon was the answer Come I ll have it eaten She ruled him in everything as she would a child and appetite or no appetite mister Jenkins had to obey Then he prepared for his departure The black silk square was tied on so as to cover the damages the hat was well drawn over the brows and mister Jenkins started When mister Galloway entered his office that morning which he did earlier than usual there sat mister Jenkins in his usual place copying a lease He looked glad to see his old clerk It is pleasant to welcome a familiar face after an absence Are you sure you are equal to work Jenkins Quite so sir thank you I had a little fever at first and mister Hurst was afraid of that but it has quite subsided Beyond being a trifle sore on the head and stiff at the elbows and one hip I am quite myself again I was sorry to hear of the accident Jenkins mister Galloway resumed I was as vexed at it as I could be sir When I first came to myself I hardly knew what damage was done and the uncertainty of getting to business perhaps for weeks did worry me much I don t deny too that I have been in a little pain But oh sir it was worth happening it was indeed only to experience the kindness and good fellowship that have been shown me I am sure half the town has been to see me or to ask after me I hear you have had your share of visitors The bishop himself came said poor Jenkins tears of gratitude rising to his eyes in the intensity of his emotion He did indeed sir He came on the Friday and groped his way up our dark stairs for very dark they are when mister Harper s sitting room door is shut and sat down by my bedside and chatted just as plainly and familiarly as if he had been no better than one of my own acquaintances mister Arthur Channing found him there when he came with your kind message sir So I heard said mister Galloway You and the bishop were both in the same boat I cannot for my part get at the mystery of that locking up business The bishop as good as said so sir that we had both been in it I was trying to express my acknowledgments to his lordship for his condescension apologizing for my plain bedroom and the dark stairs and all that and saying as well as I knew how that the like of me was not worthy of a visit from him when he laughed in his affable way and said We were both caught in the same trap Jenkins Had I been the one to receive personal injury I make no doubt that you would have come the next day to inquire after me What a great thing it is to be blessed with a benevolent heart like the Bishop of Helstonleigh s Arthur Channing came in and interrupted the conversation He was settling to his occupation when mister Galloway drew his attention in an abrupt and angry manner as it struck Arthur Channing you told me yesterday that you posted that letter for Ventnor on Friday So I did sir It has been robbed Robbed returned Arthur in surprise scarcely realizing immediately the meaning of the word You know that it contained money a twenty pound note You saw me put it in Yes I know that hesitated Arthur What are you stammering at In good truth Arthur could not have told except that he hesitated in surprise He had cast his thoughts into the past and was lost in them The fact is you did not post the letters yourself resumed mister Galloway You gave them to somebody else to post in a fit of idleness and the result is that the letter was rifled and I have lost twenty pounds Sir I assure you that I did post them myself replied Arthur with firmness I went straight from this door to the post office In coming back I called on Jenkins turning to him as you bade me and afterwards I returned here I mentioned to you then sir that the bishop was with Jenkins mister Jenkins glanced up from his desk a streak of colour illumining his thin cheek half hidden by the black handkerchief I was just saying sir to mister Galloway that you found his lordship at my bedside he said to Arthur Has the note been taken out of the letter sir demanded Arthur Did the letter reach its destination without it Yes replied mister Galloway in answer to both questions I had a few lines from mister Robert Galloway yesterday morning stating that the letter had arrived but no bank note was enclosed in it Now where is the note Where can it be reiterated Arthur The letter must have been opened on the road I declare to you sir that I put it myself into the post office It is a crying shame for this civilized country that one cannot send a bank note across the kingdom in a letter but it must get taken out of it exclaimed mister Galloway in his vexation The puzzle to me is how those letter carriers happen just to pitch upon the right letters to open those letters that contain money He went into his private room as he spoke banging the door after him a sure symptom that his temper was not in a state of serenity and not hearing or seeing Roland Yorke who had entered and was wishing him good morning What s amiss he seems in a tantrum ejaculated mister Roland with his usual want of ceremony Hallo Jenkins is it really you By the accounts brought here I thought you were not going to have a head on your shoulders for six months to come Glad to see you Thank you sir I am thankful to say I have got pretty well over the hurt Roland said Arthur in a half whisper bringing his head close to his friend s as they leaned together over the desk you remember that Ventnor letter sent on Friday with the money in it Ventnor letter interrupted Roland What Ventnor letter The one for Robert Galloway Hamish was looking at it It had a twenty pound note in it For Ventnor was it I did not notice what place it was bound for That fellow the cousin Galloway changes his place of abode like the Wandering Jew What of the letter It has been robbed of the note No uttered Roland It has The cousin says the letter reached him but the note did not mister Galloway seems uncommonly put out He accused me at first of not taking it myself to the post As if I should confide letters of value to any one not worthy of trust Did you post it yourself asked Roland Of course I did When you were coming in after playing truant on Friday afternoon I was then going You might have seen the letters in my hand Roland shook his head I was in too great a stew to notice letters or anything else This will cure Galloway of sending bank notes in letters Have the post office people had news of the loss sent to them They must hunt up the thief mister Galloway is sure to do all that s necessary remarked Arthur For my part if I sent bank notes across the country in letters I should expect them to be taken I wonder at Galloway He is cautious in other things Others had wondered at mister Galloway besides Roland Yorke A man of caution generally he yet persisted in the practice of enclosing bank notes in letters Persons cognizant of this habit had remonstrated with him not his clerks of course they had not presumed to do so mister Galloway who liked his own way had become somewhat testy upon the point and not a week before the present time had answered in a sort of contradictory spirit that his money letters had always gone safely hitherto and he made no doubt they always would go safely The present loss therefore coming as it were to check his obstinacy vexed him more than it would otherwise have done He did not care for the loss of the money half so much as he did for the tacit reproof to himself I wonder if Galloway took the number of the note cried Roland Whether or not though it would not serve him much bank notes lost in transit never come to light Don t they though retorted Arthur Look at the many convictions for post office robbery I do not suppose that one case in ten is tracked home disputed Roland They are regular thieves those letter carriers But then the fellows are paid so badly Do not be so sweeping in your assertions Roland Yorke interposed mister Galloway coming forward from his own room How dare you so asperse the letter carriers They are a hard working quiet honest body of men Yes sir honest I repeat it Where one has yielded to temptation fingering what was not his own hundreds rise superior to it retaining their integrity I would advise you not to be so free with your tongue Not to be free with his tongue would have been hard to Roland Lady Augusta was sending a box of camomile pills to some friend in Ireland the other day sir but it was never heard of again after she put it into the post office here cried he to mister Galloway The fellow who appropriated it no doubt thought he had a prize of jewels I should like to have seen his mortification when he opened the parcel and found it contained pills Lady Augusta said she hoped he had liver complaint and then they might be of service to him mister Galloway made no response He had caught up a lease that was lying on Jenkins s desk and stood looking at it with no pleasant expression of countenance On went that undaunted Roland The next thing Lady Augusta had occasion to send by post was a gold cameo pin It was enclosed in a pasteboard box and when packed looked just like the parcel of pills I wrote PILLS on it in great round text hand That reached its destination safely enough sir More safely than you would if it depended upon your pursuing your business steadily retorted mister Galloway to Roland Fill in that tithe paper As Roland with a suppressed yawn and in his usual lazy manner set himself to work there came a clatter at the office door and a man entered in the uniform of a telegraphic official bearing a despatch in his hand mister Galloway had then turned to his room and Roland ever ready for anything but work started up and received the packet from the man Where s it from asked he in his curiosity Southampton replied the messenger A telegram from Southampton sir announced Roland to mister Galloway The latter took the despatch and opened it directing Jenkins to sign the paper This done the messenger departed The words of the message were few but mister Galloway s eye was bending upon them sternly and his brow had knitted as if in perplexity Young gentlemen you must look to this he said coming forward and standing before Roland and Arthur I find that the post office is not to blame for this loss it must have occurred in this room before the letter went to the post office They both looked up both coloured as if with inward consternation Thoughts we all know are quick as lightning what was each thinking of that it should give rise to emotion Arthur was the first to speak Do you allude to the loss of the bank note sir What else should I allude to sharply answered mister Galloway But the post office must be cheeky to deny it off hand flashed Roland How is it possible that they can answer for the honesty of every man whose hands that letter passed through Pray who told you they had denied it mister Roland Yorke demanded his master Roland felt a little checked I inferred it sir I dare say Then allow me to tell you that they have not denied it And one very cogent reason why they have not is that they are not yet cognizant of the loss I do not jump at conclusions as you do Roland Yorke and I thought it necessary to make a little private inquiry before accusing the post office lest the post office might not be in fault you know Quite right I have no doubt sir replied Roland in a chafed accent for mister Galloway was speaking satirically and Roland never liked to have ridicule cast upon him Like old Ketch it affected his temper By this communication touching the telegraphic despatch I learn that the letter was not opened after it left this office resumed mister Galloway Consequently the note must have been abstracted from it while the letter lay here Who has been guilty of it Neither Arthur nor Roland spoke It was not a pleasant accusation if you can call it an accusation and their faces deepened to scarlet while mister Jenkins looked up half terrified and began to think what a mercy it was that he had broken his head just that last particular Thursday night on the marble flags of the cathedral CHAPTER XIX THE LOSS When money is lost out of an office suspicion very frequently falls upon one or more of that office s employes mister Galloway s doubts however had not yet extended to those employed in his 
8644-262284-0000	train-other-500	The letter containing the bank note had been despatched to mister Robert Galloway at Ventnor on the Friday On the Sunday morning while mister Galloway was at breakfast a short answer was delivered to him from his cousin Your letter has reached me
8644-262284-0001	train-other-500	but not the note you must have omitted to enclose it was the news it contained relative to that particular point mister Galloway knew that he had enclosed the note there was little doubt that both his clerks could testify that he had done so
none	none	 for it was done in their presence 
8644-262284-0002	train-other-500	How could it have been taken out again Had it been abstracted while the letter was still in his office or on its way to the post or in its transmission to Ventnor If in the office argued mister Galloway it must have been done before I sealed it
8644-262284-0003	train-other-500	if afterwards that seal must have been tampered with probably broken I ll drop a note to Robert and ask the question He rose from his breakfast and penned a line to Southampton where as he had reason to believe
none	none	 mister Robert Galloway would be on the Monday 
8644-262284-0004	train-other-500	It was not mister Galloway s habit to write letters on a Sunday but he considered that the present occasion justified the act I certainly enclosed the note in my letter he wrote Send me word instantly whether the seal had been tampered with
8644-262284-0005	train-other-500	I stamped it with my private seal mister Robert Galloway received this on the Monday morning He did not wait for the post but forwarded the reply by telegraph
none	none	 The seal had not been broken Will send you back the envelope by first post 
8644-262284-0006	train-other-500	This was the despatch which you saw mister Galloway receive in his office He went back into his private room carrying the despatch with him and there he sat down to think
8644-262284-0007	train-other-500	From the very first he had not believed the fraud to lie with the post office for this reason had the note been taken out by one of its servants the letter would almost certainly not have reached its destination it would have disappeared with the note
8644-262284-0008	train-other-500	He had cast a doubt upon whether Arthur Channing had posted the letters himself Arthur assured him that he had done so and mister Galloway believed him
8644-262284-0009	train-other-500	the information that the seal of the letter was unbroken was now a further confirmation had he needed it At least it confirmed that the letter had not been opened after it left the office mister Galloway perfectly remembered fastening down the letter
none	none	 He probably would have sealed it then but for the commotion that arose at the same moment in the street caused by Mad Nance There could be no shadow of doubt so far as mister Galloway could see 
8644-262284-0010	train-other-500	and so far as he believed that the abstraction had taken place between the time of his fastening down the envelope and of his sealing it Who had done it I ll lay a guinea I know how it happened he exclaimed to himself
8644-262284-0011	train-other-500	Channing was at college I must have given him permission in a soft moment to take that organ or I should never have done it quitting the office daily and Yorke in his indolent carelessness must have got gossiping outside leaving it
8644-262284-0012	train-other-500	is hard to say who in the office This comes of poor Jenkins s fall
none	none	 mister Galloway rang his bell It was answered by Jenkins 
8644-262284-0013	train-other-500	Send mister Arthur Channing in said mister Galloway Arthur entered in obedience mister Galloway signed to him to close the door and then spoke This is an awkward business Channing Very awkward indeed sir
8644-262284-0014	train-other-500	replied Arthur at no loss to understand what mister Galloway alluded to I do not see that it was possible for the note to have been taken from the letter except in its transmission through the post I tell you it was taken from it before it left this office
8644-262284-0015	train-other-500	tartly returned mister Galloway I have my reasons for the assertion Did you see me put the bank note into the letter Of course I did sir I was standing by when you did it I remained by you after bringing you the note from this room
8644-262284-0016	train-other-500	I enclosed the note and fastened down the envelope said mister Galloway pointing the feather of his quill pen at each proposition I did not seal it then because looking at Mad Nance hindered me and I went out
8644-262284-0017	train-other-500	leaving the letter on Jenkins s desk in your charge and Yorke s Yes sir I placed the letter in the rack in your room immediately afterwards And pray what loose acquaintances did you and Yorke receive here that afternoon
none	none	 Not any replied Arthur 
8644-262284-0018	train-other-500	I do not know when the office has been so free from callers No person whatever entered it except my brother Hamish That s all nonsense said mister Galloway You are getting to speak as incautiously as Yorke
8644-262284-0019	train-other-500	How can you tell who came here when you were at college Yorke would be alone then No Yorke was not Arthur was beginning But he stopped suddenly and hesitated
8644-262284-0020	train-other-500	He did not care to tell mister Galloway that Yorke had played truant all that afternoon mister Galloway saw his hesitation and did not like it Come what have you to conceal You and Yorke held a levee here I suppose That s the fact
8644-262284-0021	train-other-500	You had so many fellows in here gossiping that you don t know who may have meddled with the letter and when you were off to college they stayed on with Yorke No sir
8644-262284-0022	train-other-500	For one thing I did not take the organ that afternoon I went as usual but mister Williams was there himself so I came back at once I was only away about ten minutes And how many did you find with Yorke
none	none	 Yorke 
8644-262284-0023	train-other-500	stepped out to speak to some one just before I went to college replied Arthur obliged to allude to it but determined to say as little as possible Hamish was here sir you met him coming in as you were going out and I got him to stay in the office till I returned
8644-262284-0024	train-other-500	Pretty doings retorted mister Galloway Hindering the time of mister Hamish Channing that you and Yorke may kick up your heels elsewhere Nice trustworthy clerks both of you I was obliged to go to college sir said Arthur in a tone of deprecation
8644-262284-0025	train-other-500	Was Yorke obliged to go out I was back again very shortly I assure you sir said Arthur passing over the remark And I did not leave the office again until you sent me to the post Stop said mister Galloway
8644-262284-0026	train-other-500	let me clearly understand As I went out Hamish came in Then you say Yorke went out and you to get to college left Hamish keeping office Did any one else come in besides Hamish Not any one
8644-262284-0027	train-other-500	When I returned from college I inquired of Hamish who had called and he said no one had called Then Lady Augusta Yorke drove up and Hamish went away with her She was going to the missionary meeting
8644-262284-0028	train-other-500	And you persist in saying that no one came in after that No one did come in sir Very well Send Yorke to me
8644-262284-0029	train-other-500	Roland made his appearance a pen behind his ear and a ruler in his hand More show than work sarcastically exclaimed mister Galloway Now sir I have been questioning mister Arthur Channing about this unpleasant business
8644-262284-0030	train-other-500	for I am determined to come to the bottom of it I can get nothing satisfactory from him so I must try what I can do with you Have the goodness to tell me how you spent your time on Friday afternoon On Friday
none	none	 let s see 
8644-262284-0031	train-other-500	began Roland out of his wits with perplexity as to how he should conceal his afternoon s absence from mister Galloway It s difficult to recollect what one does on one particular day
none	none	 more than another sir Oh indeed 
8644-262284-0032	train-other-500	Perhaps to begin with you can remember the circumstances of my enclosing the bank note in the letter I went into the other room to consult a Bradshaw I remember that quite well sir interrupted Roland
none	none	 Channing fetched the bank note from this room 
8644-262284-0033	train-other-500	and you put it into the envelope It was just before we were all called to the window by Mad Nance After that pursued mister Galloway
none	none	 After that I think sir you went out after that 
8644-262284-0034	train-other-500	and Hamish Channing came in Who else came in I don t remember any one else answered Roland wishing some one would come in then and stop the questioning No such luck however
8644-262284-0035	train-other-500	How many people called in while Channing was at college and you were keeping office demanded mister Galloway Roland fidgeted first on one leg then on the other He felt that it must all come out What a passion he ll go into with me thought Roland
8644-262284-0036	train-other-500	It is certain that no one can have touched the bank note in this office sir he said aloud Those poor half starved postmen must have helped themselves to it When I ask for your opinion upon who has helped themselves to it it will be time enough to give it me
8644-262284-0037	train-other-500	returned mister Galloway drily I say that the money was taken from the letter before it left this office when it was under the charge of you and Channing I hope you do not suspect us of taking it sir said Roland going into a heat
none	none	 I suspect that you have been guilty of negligence in some way mister Roland 
8644-262284-0038	train-other-500	Could the bank note drop out of the letter of itself I suppose it could not sir Good Then it is my business to ascertain if I can how it did get out of it You have not answered my question Who came into this office
8644-262284-0039	train-other-500	while Channing was at the cathedral on Friday afternoon I declare nobody ever had such luck as I burst forth Roland in a tone half comic half defiant as he felt he must make a merit of necessity and confess
none	none	 If I get into the smallest scrape in the world it is safe to come out The fact is sir I was not here 
8644-262284-0040	train-other-500	last Friday afternoon during Channing s hour for college What not at all exclaimed mister Galloway who had not suspected that Yorke was absent so long As I say it s my luck to be found out
none	none	 grumbled Roland I can t lift a finger to day if it ought not to be lifted but it is known to morrow I saw one of my chums going past the end of the street sir and I ran after him 
8644-262284-0041	train-other-500	And I am sorry to say I was seduced into stopping out with him longer than I ought to have done mister Galloway stared at Roland At what time did you go out he asked Just after you did sir The bell was going for college
8644-262284-0042	train-other-500	And pray what time did you come in again Well sir you saw me come in It was getting on for five o clock Do you mean to say you had not been in at all between those hours It was Knivett s fault grumbled Roland He kept me
8644-262284-0043	train-other-500	mister Galloway sat drumming on his desk apparently gazing at Roland in reality thinking To hear that mister Roland Yorke had taken French leave for nearly a whole afternoon
8644-262284-0044	train-other-500	just on the especial afternoon that he ought not to have taken it Jenkins being away did not surprise him in the least it was very much in the line of the Yorkes to do so
none	none	 To scold or punish Roland for it would have been productive of little good 
8644-262284-0045	train-other-500	since he was sure to do it again the very next time the temptation offered itself Failing temptation he would remain at his post steadily enough No it was not Roland s escapade that mister Galloway was considering
8644-262284-0046	train-other-500	but the very narrow radius that the affair of the letter appeared to be drawing itself into If Roland was absent he could not have had half the town in to chatter and if Arthur Channing asserted that none had been in mister Galloway could give credence to Arthur
8644-262284-0047	train-other-500	But then how had the money disappeared Who had taken it Channing he called out loudly and sharply Arthur who was preparing to attend the cathedral for the bell had rung out hastened in
8644-262284-0048	train-other-500	How came you not to tell me when we were speaking of Roland Yorke s absence that he remained away all the afternoon questioned mister Galloway
8644-262284-0049	train-other-500	Arthur was silent He glanced once at Roland Well cried mister Galloway It was better for him to tell you himself sir as I conclude he has now done
8644-262284-0050	train-other-500	The fact is you are two birds of a feather stormed mister Galloway who when once roused which was not often would say anything that came uppermost just or unjust The one won t tell tales of the other If
none	none	 the one set my office on fire and then said it was the cat did it 
8644-262284-0051	train-other-500	the other would stick to it Is it true sir that he was not at the office during my absence from it on Friday afternoon he continued to Arthur That is true
none	none	 Then who can have taken the money uttered mister Galloway speaking what was uppermost in his thoughts Which is as much as to say that I took it burst from haughty Roland mister Galloway I 
8644-262284-0052	train-other-500	Keep quiet Roland Yorke interrupted that gentleman I do not suspect you of taking it
none	none	 I did suspect that you might have got some idlers in here mauvais sujets 
8644-262284-0053	train-other-500	you know for you call plenty of them friends but if you were absent yourself that suspicion falls to the ground Again I say who can have taken the money
8644-262284-0054	train-other-500	It is an utter impossibility that Yorke could have taken it even were he capable of such a thing generously spoke Arthur From the time you left the office yourself sir until after the letters were taken out of it to be posted he was away from it
8644-262284-0055	train-other-500	Just like him exclaimed mister Galloway It must have been done while your brother Hamish was waiting in the office We must ascertain from him who came in He told me no one came in repeated Arthur Rubbish
8644-262284-0056	train-other-500	testily observed mister Galloway Some one must have come in some one with light fingers too the money could not go without hands You are off to college now I suppose Channing Yes sir When service is over
8644-262284-0057	train-other-500	just go down as far as your brother s office and ask him about it He is as obstinate as any old adder exclaimed Roland Yorke to Arthur when they left mister Galloway alone The only possible way in which it can have gone is through that post office
8644-262284-0058	train-other-500	The men have forked it as they did Lady Augusta s pills He says it was not the post office mused Arthur He said as I understood that the telegraphic despatch proved to him that it had been taken out here
none	none	 What an idiot you are ejaculated Roland 
8644-262284-0059	train-other-500	How could a despatch tell him who took it or who did not unless it was a despatch from those spirit rappers mesmerists or whatever they call themselves They profess to show you who your grandmother was if you don t know Roland laughed as he spoke
8644-262284-0060	train-other-500	Arthur was not inclined for joking the affair perplexed him in no ordinary degree I wish mister Galloway would mention his grounds for thinking the note was taken before it went to the post he said He ought to mention them cried Roland fiercely
8644-262284-0061	train-other-500	He says he learns by the despatch that the letter was not opened after it left this office Now it is impossible that any despatch could tell him that
none	none	 He talks to me about broad assertions That s a pretty broad one 
8644-262284-0062	train-other-500	What did the despatch say who sent it Would it afford you satisfaction to know mister Roland and Roland wheeled round with a start for it was the voice of mister Galloway He had followed them into the front office and caught the latter part of the conversation
8644-262284-0063	train-other-500	Come sir he added I will teach you a lesson in caution When I have sealed letters that contained money after they were previously fastened down with gum
8644-262284-0064	train-other-500	I have seen you throw your head back mister Roland with that favourite scornful movement of yours As if gum did not stick them fast enough you have said in your heart But now the fact of my having sealed this letter in question
8644-262284-0065	train-other-500	enables me to say that the letter was not opened after it left my hands The despatch you are so curious about was from my cousin telling me that the seal reached him intact
8644-262284-0066	train-other-500	I did not know the letter was sealed remarked Roland But that proves nothing sir They might melt the wax and seal it up again Every one keeps a stamp of this sort he added stretching his hand out for the seal usually used in the office an ordinary cross barred wafer stamp
none	none	 Ah said mister Galloway you are very clever Master Roland But I happened to stamp that letter 
8644-262284-0067	train-other-500	with my own private seal That alters the case of course said Roland after a pause Sir I wish you would set me to work to find out he impulsively continued I d go to the post office and
8644-262284-0068	train-other-500	And there make enough noise for ten and defeat your own ends interrupted mister Galloway
none	none	 Channing you will be late Do not forget to see Hamish Yes I must be off said Arthur coming out of his reverie with a start He had waited to hear about the seal And now flew towards the cathedral I wish it had not happened he ejaculated I know Galloway does not suspect me or Yorke but still I wish it had never happened CHAPTER XX THE LOOMING OF AN AWFUL FEAR Hamish Channing sat in his private room his now for in the absence of mister Channing Hamish was master The insurance office was situated in Guild Street a principal street near to the Town Hall It consisted of an entrance hall two rooms and a closet for hanging up coats and for washing hands The room on the left of the hall as you entered was the principal office the room on the right was the private room of mister Channing now used I say by Hamish The upper part of the house was occupied as a dwelling the people renting it having nothing to do with the office It was a large roomy house and possessed a separate entrance Hamish gay good tempered careless though he was ruled the office with a firm hand There was no familiarity of manner there the clerks liked him but they had to defer to him and obey him He was seated at his desk deep in some accounts on this same morning the one mentioned in the last chapter when one of the clerks entered and said that mister Arthur Channing was asking to speak to him for it was mister Hamish Channing s good pleasure not to be interrupted indiscriminately unless a clerk first ascertained whether he was at liberty to be seen Possibly Hamish feared treachery might be abroad Arthur entered Hamish pushed his books from him and stretched himself Well old fellow you seem out of breath I came down at a pace rejoined Arthur College is just over I say Hamish a disagreeable thing has happened at Galloway s I have never seen him put out as he is now Has his hair taken a change again and come out a lovely rose colour I wish you would not turn everything into joke cried Arthur who was really troubled and the words vexed him You saw a letter on Jenkins s desk last Friday the afternoon you know that Yorke went off and you remained while I went to college There was a twenty pound note in it Well the note has in some mysterious manner been abstracted from it Hamish lifted his eyebrows What can Galloway expect if he sends bank notes in letters Yes but this was taken before it left our office Galloway says so He sealed it with his private seal and the letter arrived at his cousin s intact the seal unbroken a pretty sure proof that the note could not have been in it when it was sealed Who took it out asked Hamish That s the question There was not a soul near the place that I can find out except you and I Yorke was away Jenkins was away and mister Galloway was away He says some one must have come in while you were in the office Not so much as a ghost came in said Hamish Are you sure Hamish Sure I am sure they did not unless I dropped asleep That was not an unlikely catastrophe to happen shut up by myself in that dull office amidst musty parchments with nothing to do Hamish can you be serious for once This is a serious matter mister Martin Pope wants you sir said the clerk again interrupting at this juncture Martin Pope s face came in also over the clerk s shoulder It was red and he looked in a hurry Hamish he has had a letter and is off by the half past eleven train spoke Martin Pope in some excitement You must rush up to the station if you want a last word with him You will hardly catch him running your best Up jumped Hamish in excitement as great as his friend s He closed and locked the desk caught his hat and was speeding out of the office when Arthur to whom the words had been a puzzle seized his arm Hamish did any one come in It was mister Galloway sent me here to ascertain No they did not Should I not tell you if they had Take care Arthur I must fly like the wind Come away Pope Arthur walked back to mister Galloway s That gentleman was out Roland Yorke was out But Jenkins upon whom the unfortunate affair had taken great hold lifted his face to Arthur his eyes asking the question that his tongue scarcely presumed to do My brother says no one came in while he was here It is very strange mister Arthur sir if I had repined at all at that accident and felt it as a misfortune how this would have reproved me spoke Jenkins in his simple faith Why sir it must have come to me as a mercy a blessing to take me away out of this office at the very time What do you mean Jenkins There s no telling sir but mister Galloway might have suspected me It is the first loss we have had since I have been here all these years and Nonsense interrupted Arthur You may as well fear that mister Galloway will suspect me or mister Yorke No sir you and mister Yorke are different you are gentlemen mister Galloway would no more suspect you than he would suspect himself I am thankful I was absent Be easy Jenkins smiled Arthur Absent or present every one can trust you mister Galloway did not return until nearly one o clock He went straight to his own room Arthur followed him I have seen Hamish sir He says no person whatever entered on Friday while he was here alone mister Galloway paused apparently revolving the news Hamish must be mistaken he answered He told me at the time last Friday that no one had been in resumed Arthur I asked the question when I returned from college thinking people might have called on business He said they had not done so and he says the same now But look you here Arthur debated mister Galloway in a tone of reasoning I suspect neither you nor Yorke indeed as it seems Yorke put himself out of suspicion s way by walking off but if no one came to the office and yet the note went remember the position in which you place yourself I say I don t blame you I don t suspect you but I do say that the mystery must be cleared up Are you certain no person came into the office during your presence in it I am quite certain of that sir I have told you so And is Hamish equally certain that no one entered while he was here alone He says so But Arthur s words bore a sound of hesitation which mister Galloway may or may not have observed He would have spoken far more positively had Hamish not joked about it Says will not do for me retorted mister Galloway I should like to see Hamish You have nothing particular to finish before one o clock suppose you run up to Guild Street and request him to come round this way as he goes home to dinner It will not take him two minutes out of his road Arthur departed choosing the nearest way to Guild Street It led him through the street Hamish had been careful to avoid on account of a troublesome creditor Arthur had no such fear One o clock struck as he turned into it About midway down it what was his astonishment at encountering Hamish Not hurrying along dreading to be seen but flourishing leisurely at his ease nodding to every one he knew his sweet smile in full play and his cane whirling circlets in the air Hamish I thought this was forbidden ground So it was until a day or two ago laughed Hamish but I have managed to charm the enemy He spoke in his usual light careless half mocking style and passed his arm within Arthur s At that moment a shopkeeper came to his door and respectfully touched his hat to Hamish Hamish nodded in return and laughed again as he walked on with Arthur That was the fiercest enemy in all this street of Philistines Arthur See how civil he is now How did you charm him Oh by a process known to myself Did you come down on purpose to escort me home to dinner Very polite of you I came to ask you to go round by mister Galloway s office and to call in and see him He will not take your word at second hand Take my word about what asked Hamish That the office had no visitors while you were in it the other day That money matter grows more mysterious every hour Then I have not time to go round exclaimed Hamish in for him quite an impatient accent I don t know anything about the money or the letter Why should I be bothered Hamish you must go said Arthur impressively Do you know that so far as can be ascertained no human being was in the office alone with the letter except you and I Were we to shun inquiry suspicion might fall upon us Hamish drew himself up haughtily somewhat after the fashion of Roland Yorke What absurdity Arthur steal a twenty pound note But when they came to the turning where two roads met one of which led to Close Street Hamish had apparently reconsidered his determination I suppose I must go or the old fellow will be offended You can tell them at home that I shall be in directly don t let them wait dinner He walked away quickly Arthur pursued the path which would take him round the cathedral to the Boundaries He bent his head in thought He was lost in perplexity in spite of what mister Galloway urged with regard to the seal he could not believe but that the money had gone safely to the post office and was stolen afterwards Thus busied within himself he had reached the elm trees when he ran up against Hopper the bailiff Arthur looked up and the man s features relaxed into a smile We shut the door when the steed s stolen mister Arthur was his salutation Now that my pockets are emptied of what would have done no good to your brother I come here to meet him at the right time Just to show folks should any be about that I did know my way here although it unfortunately fell out that I always missed him He nodded and winked Arthur completely at sea as to his meaning made some trifling remark in answer He did well to come to terms with them continued Hopper dropping his voice Though it was only a five pound as I hear and a promise for the rest you see they took it Ten times over they said to me We don t want to proceed to extremities with Hamish Channing I was as glad as could be when they withdrew the writ I do hope he will go on smooth and straight now that he has begun paying up a bit Tell him old Hopper says it mister Arthur Hopper glided on leaving Arthur glued to the spot Begun to pay up Paid five pounds off one debt Paid there could be no doubt of it partially or wholly the enemy in the proscribed street What did it mean Every drop of blood in Arthur Channing s body stood still and then coursed on fiercely Had he seen the cathedral tower toppling down upon his head he had feared it less than the awful dread which was dawning upon him He went home to dinner Hamish went home Hamish was more gay and talkative than usual Arthur was silent as the grave What was the matter some one asked him His head ached was the answer and indeed it was no false plea Hamish did not say a syllable about the loss at table neither did Arthur Arthur was silenced now It is useless to attempt to disguise the fear that had fallen upon him You my reader will probably have glanced at it as suspiciously as did Arthur Channing Until this loophole had appeared the facts had been to Arthur s mind utterly mysterious they now shone out all too clearly in glaring colours He knew that he himself had not touched the money and no one else had been left with it except Hamish Debt what had the paltry fear of debt and its consequences been compared with this mister Galloway talked much of the mystery that afternoon Yorke talked of it Jenkins talked of it Arthur barely answered never except when obliged to do so and his manner confused at times for he could not help its being so excited the attention of mister Galloway One would think you had helped yourself to the money Channing he crossly exclaimed to him once when they were alone in the private room No sir I did not Arthur answered in a low tone but his face flushed scarlet and then grew deadly pale If a Channing his brother had done it why he felt himself almost equally guilty and it dyed his brow with shame mister Galloway noticed the signs and attributed them to the pain caused by his question Don t be foolish Arthur I feel sure of you and Yorke Though with Yorke s carelessness and his spendthrift habits I do not know that I should have been so sure of him had he been left alone with the temptation Sir exclaimed Arthur in a tone of pain Yorke did not touch it I would answer for his innocence with my life Don t I say I do not suspect him or you either testily returned mister Galloway It is the mystery of the affair that worries me If no elucidation turns up between now and to morrow morning I shall place it in the hands of the police The announcement scared away Arthur s caution almost scared away his senses Oh pray pray mister Galloway do not let the police become cognizant of it he uttered in an accent of wild alarm And mister Galloway stared at him in very amazement and Jenkins who had come in to ask a question stared too It might not produce any good result and would cause us no end of trouble Arthur added striving to assign some plausible explanation to his words That is my affair said mister Galloway When Arthur reached home the news had penetrated there also missus Channing s tea table was absorbed with it Tom and Charles gave the school version of it and the reverend mister Yorke who was taking tea with them gave his Both accounts were increased by sundry embellishments which had never taken place in reality Not a soul was ever near the letter exclaimed Tom except Arthur and Jenkins and Roland Yorke The post office must be to blame for this observed mister Channing But you are wrong Tom with regard to Jenkins He could not have been there Mark Galloway says his uncle had a telegraphic despatch to say the post office knew nothing about it exclaimed Charles Much you know about it Miss Charley quoth Tom The despatch was about the seal it was not from the post office at all They have not accused the post office yet Arthur let them talk on headache the excuse for his own silence It did ache in no measured degree When appealed to Was it this way Arthur Was it the other he was obliged to speak so that an accurate version of the affair was arrived at before tea was over Constance alone saw that something unusual was the matter with him She attributed it to fears at the absence of Hamish who had been expected home to tea and did not come in Constance s own fears at this absence grew to a terrific height Had he been arrested She beckoned Arthur from the room for she could no longer control herself Her lips were white as she drew him into the study and spoke Arthur what has become of Hamish Has anything happened to him Happened to him repeated Arthur vaguely too absorbed in his own sad thoughts to reply at once Has he been taken Taken Hamish Oh you mean for debt he continued his heart beating and fully aroused now There is no further fear I believe He has managed to arrange with the people How has he contrived it exclaimed Constance in wonder Arthur turned his face away Hamish does not make me his confidant Constance stole her hand into his Arthur what is the matter with you this evening Is it that unpleasant affair at mister Galloway s He turned from her He laid his face upon the table and groaned in anguish Be still Constance You can do no good But what is it uttered Constance in alarm You surely do not fear that suspicion should be cast on you or on Hamish although as it appears you and he were alone in the office with the letter Be still I say Constance he wailed There is nothing for it but to to to bear You will do well to ask no more about it A faint dread began to dawn upon her You and Hamish were alone with the letter the echo of the words came thumping against her brain But she beat it off Suspect a Channing Arthur I need not ask if you are innocent it would be a gratuitous insult to you No he quietly said you need not ask that And Hamish she would have continued but the words would not come She changed them for others How do you know that he has paid any of his debts Arthur I heard it I At that moment they heard something else Hamish s voice in the hall In the impulse of the moment in the glad revulsion of feeling for if Hamish were safe in the hall he could not be in prison Constance flew to him and clasped her hands round his neck Oh Hamish Hamish thank Heaven that you are here Hamish was surprised He went with Constance into the study where Arthur had remained What do you mean Constance What is the matter I am always fearful she whispered always fearful I know you owe money and that they might put you in prison Hamish I think of it by night and by day My pretty sister cried Hamish caressingly as he smoothed her hair just as Constance sometimes smoothed Annabel s that danger has passed for the present If you were arrested papa might lose his post she murmured I know it it is that which has worried me I have been doing what I could to avert it Constance these things are not for you Who told you anything about them Never mind I What will you give me for something I have found exclaimed Annabel bursting in upon them her hands behind her and her eyes dancing It is one of your treasures Hamish Then give it me Annabel Come I am tired I cannot play with you this evening I won t give it you until you guess what it is Hamish was evidently in no mood for play Annabel danced round and about him provokingly eluding his grasp He caught her suddenly and laid his hands upon hers With a shriek of laughing defiance she flung something on the floor and four or five sovereigns rolled about It was Hamish s purse She had found it on the hall table by the side of his hat and gloves left there

none	none	inadvertently Hamish stooped to pick up the money See how rich he is danced Annabel after telling us he was as poor as a church mouse Where has it all come from Never had they seen Hamish more annoyed When he had secured the money he gave a pretty sharp tap to Annabel and ordered her in a ringing tone of command not to meddle with his things again He quitted the room and Annabel ran after him laughing and defiant still Where has it all come from The words spoken in innocence by the child rang as a knell on the ears of Constance and Arthur Channing Constance s very heart turned sick sick as Arthur s had been since the meeting with Hopper under the elm trees CHAPTER XXI mister BUTTERBY The clock of Helstonleigh Cathedral was striking eight and the postman was going his rounds through the Boundaries Formerly nothing so common as a regular postman when on duty was admitted within the pale of that exclusive place The Boundaries chiefly occupied by the higher order of the clergy did not condescend to have its letters delivered in the ordinary way and by the ordinary hands It was the custom for the postman to take them to the Boundary gate and there put them into the porter s great box just as if he had been posting letters at the town post office and the porter forthwith delivered them at their several destinations The late porter however had grown with years half blind and wholly stupid Some letters he dropped some he lost some he delivered at wrong houses some he persisted in declaring when questioned had never been delivered to him at all In short mistakes and confusion were incessant so the porter was exonerated from that portion of his duty and the postman entered upon it There was a fresh porter now but the old custom had not been resumed Ring ring ring ring for one peculiarity of the Boundaries was that most of its doors possessed no knockers only bells on he went the man on this morning leaving letters almost everywhere At length he came to mister Galloway s and rang there a peal that it is the delight of a postman to ring but when the door was opened he delivered in only one letter and a newspaper The business letters were generally directed to the office mister Galloway was half way through his breakfast He was no sluggard and he liked to devote the whole hour from eight to nine to his breakfast and his Times Occasionally as on this morning he would sit down before eight in order that he might have nearly finished breakfast before the letters arrived His servants knew by experience that when this happened he was expecting something unusual by the post His man came in He laid the letter and the newspaper by his master s side mister Galloway tore open the Times gave one glance at the price of the funds and the money article then put aside the paper and took up the letter The latter was from his cousin mister Robert Galloway It contained also the envelope in which mister Galloway had enclosed the twenty pound note You perceive wrote mister Robert that the seal has not been tampered with It is perfectly intact Hence I infer that you must be in error in supposing that you enclosed the note mister Galloway examined the envelope closely His cousin had not broken the seal in opening the letter but had cut the paper above it He was a methodical man in trifles this mister Robert Galloway and generally did cut open his envelopes It had been all the better for him had he learnt to be methodical with his money Yes it is as Robert says soliloquized mister Galloway The seal has not been touched since it went out of my hands therefore the note must previously have been extracted from the letter Now who did it He sat his elbow on the table his chin in his hand and the envelope before him Apparently he was studying it minutely in reality he was lost in thought It s just like the work of a conjuror he presently exclaimed Not a caller near the place that I can find out and yet the bank note vanishes out of the letter Notes don t vanish without hands and I ll do as I said yesterday consult the police If any one can come to the bottom of it it s Butterby Had the seal been broken I should have given it to the post office to ferret out the crime would have lain with them and so would the discovery As it is the business is mine He wrote a line rapidly in pencil folded called in his man servant and despatched him with it to the police station The station was very near mister Galloway s on the other side of the cathedral halfway between that edifice and the town hall In ten minutes after the servant had left the house mister Butterby was on his road to it mister Butterby puzzled Helstonleigh He was not an inspector he was not a sergeant he was not a common officer and he was never seen in official dress Who was mister Butterby Helstonleigh wondered That he had a great deal to do with the police was one of their staff and received his pay was certain but what his standing might be and what his peculiar line of duty they could not tell Sometimes he was absent from Helstonleigh for months at a time probably puzzling other towns mister Galloway would have told you he was a detective but perhaps mister Galloway s grounds for the assertion existed only in his own opinion For convenience sake we will call him a detective remembering however that we have no authority for the term mister Butterby came forward a spare pale man of middle height his eyes deeply set and his nose turned up to the skies He was of silent habit probably of a silent nature mister Galloway recited the circumstances of his loss The detective sat near him his hands on his knees his head bent his eyes cast upon the floor He did not interrupt the story by a single word When it was ended he took up the envelope and examined it in equal silence examined it with ridiculous minuteness mister Galloway thought for he poked and peered and touched it everywhere He held it up to the light he studied the postmarks he gazed at the seal through an odd looking little glass that he took from his waistcoat pocket he particularly criticised the folds he drew his fingers along its edges he actually sniffed it all in silence and with an impassive countenance Have you the number of the note was his first question No said mister Galloway He looked up at this The thought may have struck him that not to take the number of a bank note sent by post betrayed some carelessness for a man of business mister Galloway at least inferred this and answered the look Of course I am in the habit of taking their numbers I don t know that I ever did such a thing before as send a bank note away without it I had an appointment as I tell you at the other end of the town for a quarter to three it was of importance and when I heard the college strike out the three quarters the very hour I ought to have been there I hurriedly put the note into the folds of the letter without waiting to take its number It was not that I forgot to do so but that I could not spare the time Have you any means of ascertaining the number by tracing the note back to whence it may have come into your possession was the next question mister Galloway was obliged to confess that he had none Bank notes are so frequently paid me from different quarters he remarked Yesterday for instance a farmer renting under the Dean and Chapter came in and paid me his half year s rent Another holding the lease of a public house in the town renewed two lives which had dropped in It was Beard of the Barley Mow Now both these men paid in notes tens and fives and they now lie together in my cash drawer but I could not tell you which particular notes came from each man no not if you paid me the worth of the whole to do it Neither could I tell whence I had the note which I put into the letter In this way if a note should turn out to be bad you could not return it to its owner I never took a bad note in my life said mister Galloway speaking impulsively There s not a better judge of notes than myself in the kingdom and Jenkins is as good as I am Another silence mister Butterby remained in the same attitude his head and eyes bent Have you given me all the particulars he presently asked I think so All I remember Then allow me to go over them aloud returned the detective and if I make any mistake or omission have the goodness to correct me On Friday last you took a twenty pound note out of your cash drawer not taking or knowing its number This note you put within the folds of a letter and placed both in an envelope and fastened the envelope down your two clerks Channing and Yorke being present You then went out leaving the letter upon one of the desks As you left Hamish Channing came in Immediately following upon that Yorke went out leaving the brothers alone Arthur departed to attend college Hamish remaining in the office Arthur Channing soon returned finding there was no necessity for him to stay in the cathedral upon which Hamish left Arthur Channing remained alone for more than an hour no one calling or entering the office during that period You then returned yourself found the letter in the same state apparently in which you had left it and you sealed it and sent Arthur Channing with it to the post office These are the brief facts so far as you are cognizant of them and as they have been related to you They are replied mister Galloway I should have mentioned that Arthur Channing carried the letter into my private room before he left the office for college Locking the door Oh dear no Closing the door no doubt but not locking it It would have been unusual to do so Jenkins was away observed the detective in a tone of abstraction which told he was soliloquizing rather than addressing his companion mister Galloway rather fired up at the remark taking it in a different light from that in which it was spoken Jenkins was at home at the time confined to his bed and had he not been I would answer for Jenkins s honesty as I would for my own Can you see any possible solution to the mystery A very possible one was the dry answer There is no doubt whatever upon my mind that the theft was committed by Arthur Channing mister Galloway started up with an exclamation of surprise mingled with anger Standing within the room was his nephew Mark The time had gone on to nine the hour of release from school and on running past mister Galloway s with the rest of the boys Mark had dutifully called in Mark and his brothers were particularly fond of calling in for their uncle was not stingy with his sixpences and they were always on the look out mister Mark did not get a sixpence this time How dare you intrude upon me in this sly way sir Don t you see I am engaged I will have you knock at my room door before you enter Take yourself off again if you please Mark with a word of deprecation went off his ears pricking with the sentence he had heard from the detective Arthur Channing the thief mister Galloway turned again to the officer He resented the imputation The Channings are altogether above suspicion from the father downwards he remonstrated Were Arthur Channing dishonestly inclined he has had the opportunity to rob me long before this Persons of hitherto honourable conduct honest by nature and by habit have succumbed under sudden temptation or pressing need was the answer Arthur Channing is in no pressing need He is not hard up for money A smile actually curled the detective s lip A great many more young men are harder up for money than they allow to appear The Channings are in what may be called difficulties through the failure of their Chancery suit and the lad must have yielded to temptation mister Galloway could not be brought to see it You may as well set on and suspect Hamish he resentfully said He was equally alone with the letter No was the answer of the keen officer Hamish Channing is in a responsible position he would not be likely to emperil it for a twenty pound note and he could not know that the letter contained money mister Butterby was not cognizant of quite the facts of the case you see It is absurd to suspect Arthur Channing Which is the more absurd to suspect him or to assume that the bank note vanished without hands forced its own way through the envelope and disappeared up the chimney in a whirlwind asked the officer bringing sarcasm to his aid If the facts are as you have stated that only the two Channings had access to the letter the guilt must lie with one of them Facts are facts mister Galloway mister Galloway admitted that facts were facts but he could not be brought to allow the guilt of Arthur Channing The detective rose You have confided the management of this affair to me he observed and I have no doubt I shall be able to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion One more question I must ask you Is it known to your clerks that you have not the number of the note Yes it is Then I fear you stand little chance of ever seeing it again That fact known no time would be lost in parting with it they d make haste to get it safe off Not an instant did mister Butterby take for consideration upon quitting mister Galloway With a sharp unhesitating step as though his mind had been made up for a month past as to what his course must be he took his way to the house of mister Joe Jenkins That gentleman his head still tied up was just leaving for the office and mister Butterby encountered him coming through the shop Good morning Jenkins I want a word with you alone Jenkins bowed in his civil humble fashion but a word alone was more easily asked than had missus Jenkins being all powerful and burning with curiosity The officer had to exert some authority before he could get rid of her and be left at peace with Jenkins What sources of expense has Arthur Channing demanded he so abruptly as to startle and confuse Jenkins Sources of expense sir he repeated What are his habits Does he squander money Does he go out in an evening into expensive company I m sure sir I cannot tell you anything about it Jenkins was mildly beginning He was imperatively interrupted by the detective I ask to know You are aware that I possess authority to compel you to speak therefore answer me without excuse or circumlocution it will save trouble But indeed sir I really do not know persisted Jenkins I should judge mister Arthur Channing to be a steady well conducted young gentleman who has no extravagant habits at all As to his evenings I think he spends them mostly at home Do you know whether he has any pressing debts I heard him say to mister Yorke one day that a twenty pound note would pay all he owed and leave him something out of it spoke Jenkins in his unconscious simplicity Ah said mister Butterby drawing in his lips though his face remained impassive as before When was this Not long ago sir About a week it may have been before I met with that accident which accident I begin to see now sir happened providentially for it caused me to be away from the office when that money was lost An unpleasant loss remarked the officer with apparent carelessness and the young gentlemen must feel it so Arthur Channing especially Yorke I believe was out He does feel it very much sir He was as agitated about it yesterday as could be when mister Galloway talked of putting it into the hands of the police It is a disagreeable thing to happen in an office you know sir A slight pause of silence was made by the detective ere he rejoined Agitated was he And mister Roland Yorke the same no doubt No sir mister Roland does not seem to care much about it He thinks it must have been taken in its transit through the post office and I cannot help being of the same opinion sir Another question or two and Jenkins attended mister Butterby to the door He was preparing to follow him from it but a peremptory female voice arrested his departure Jenkins I want you It is hard upon half past nine my dear I shall be late If it s hard upon half past ten you ll just walk here I want you I say Meek as any lamb mister Jenkins returned to the back parlour and was marshalled into a chair missus Jenkins closed the door and stood before him Now then what did Butterby want I don t know what he wanted replied Jenkins You will sit there till you tell me resolutely replied the lady I am not going to have police inquisitors making mysterious visits inside my doors and not know what they do it for You ll tell me every word that passed and the sooner you begin the better But I am ignorant myself of what he did want mildly deprecated Jenkins He asked me a question or two about mister Arthur Channing but why I don t know Leaving missus Jenkins to ferret out the questions one by one which you may depend upon it she would not fail to do and to keep Jenkins a prisoner until it was over and leaving mister Butterby to proceed to the house of the cathedral organist whither he was now bent to ascertain whether mister Williams did take the organ voluntarily and to Arthur unexpectedly the past Friday afternoon we will go on to other matters mister Butterby best knew what bearing this could have upon the case Police officers sometimes give to their inquiries a strangely wide range CHAPTER XXII AN INTERRUPTED DINNER Have you ever observed a large lake on the approach of a sudden storm its unnatural stillness death like and ominous its undercurrent of anger not yet apparent on the surface and then the breaking forth of fury when the storm has come Not inaptly might the cloisters of Helstonleigh be compared to this that day when the college boys were let out of school at one o clock A strange rumour had been passed about amongst the desks not reaching that at which sat the seniors a rumour which shook the equanimity of the school to its centre and when one o clock struck the boys instead of clattering out with all the noise of which their legs and lungs were capable stole down the stairs quietly and formed into groups of whisperers in the cloisters It was the calm that precedes a storm So unusual a state of affairs was noticed by the senior boy What s up now he asked them in the phraseology in vogue there and elsewhere Are you all going to a funeral I hope it s your sins that you are about to bury A heavy silence answered him Gaunt could not make it out The other three seniors attracted by the scene came back and waited with Gaunt By that time the calm was being ruffled by low murmurings and certain distinct words came from more than one of the groups What do you say burst forth Tom Channing darting forward as the words caught his ear You Jackson speak up what is it Not Jackson s voice especially but several other voices arose then a word from one a word from another half sentences disjointed hints forming together an unmistakable whole The theft of old Galloway s bank note has been traced to Arthur Channing Who says it Who dares to say it flashed Tom his face flaming and his hand clenched The police say it Butterby says it I don t care for the police I don t care for Butterby cried Tom stamping his foot in his terrible indignation I ask who dares to say it here I do then Come mister Channing though you are a senior and can put me up to Pye for punishment upon any false plea that you choose answered a tall fellow Pierce senior who was chiefly remarkable for getting into fights and was just now unusually friendly with Mark Galloway at whose desk he sat Quick as lightning Tom Channing turned and faced him Speak out what you have to say cried he no hints Whew retorted Pierce senior do you think I am afraid I say that Arthur Channing stole the note lost by old Galloway Tom in uncontrollable temper raised his hand and struck him One half minute s struggle nothing more and Pierce senior was sprawling on the ground while Tom Channing s cheek and nose were bleeding Gaunt had stepped in between them I stop this he said Pierce get up Don t lie there like a floundering donkey Channing what possessed you to forget yourself You would have done the same Gaunt had the insult been offered to you Let the fellow retract his words or prove them Very good That is how you ought to have met it at first said Gaunt Now mister Pierce can you make good your assertion Pierce had floundered up and was rubbing one of his long legs which had doubled under him in the fall while his brother Pierce junior was collecting an armful of scattered books and whispering prognostications of parental vengeance in prospective for so surely as Pierce senior fell into a fight at school to the damage of face or clothes so surely was it followed up by punishment at home If you want proof go to Butterby at the police station and get it from him sullenly replied Pierce who owned a sulky temper as well as a pugnacious one Look here interrupted Mark Galloway springing to the front Pierce was a fool to bring it out in that way but I ll speak up now it has come to this I went into my uncle s this morning at nine o clock and there was he shut in with Butterby Butterby was saying that there was no doubt the theft had been committed by Arthur Channing Mind Channing Mark added turning to Tom I am not seconding the accusation on my own score but that Butterby said it I ll declare Pshaw is that all cried Tom Channing lifting his head with a haughty gesture and not condescending to notice the blood which trickled from his cheek You must have misunderstood him boy No I did not replied Mark Galloway I heard him as plainly as I hear you now It is hardly likely that Butterby would say that before you Galloway observed Gaunt Ah but he didn t see I was there or my uncle either said Mark When he is reading his newspaper of a morning he can t bear a noise and I always go into the room as quiet as mischief He turned me out again pretty quick I can tell you but not till I had heard Butterby say that You must have misunderstood him returned Gaunt carelessly taking up Tom Channing s notion and you had no right to blurt out such a thing to the school Arthur Channing is better known and trusted than you mister Mark I didn t accuse Arthur Channing to the school I only repeated to my desk what Butterby said It is that only repeating which does three parts of the mischief in this world said Gaunt giving the boys a little touch of morality gratis to their intense edification As to you Pierce senior you ll get more than you bargain for some of these days if you poke your ill conditioned nose so often into other people s business Tom Channing had marched away towards his home head erect his step ringing firmly and proudly on the cloister flags Charley ran by his side But Charley s face was white and Tom caught sight of it What are you looking like that for Tom you don t think it s true do you Tom turned his scorn upon the boy You little idiot True A Channing turn thief You may perhaps it s best known to yourself but never Arthur I don t mean that I mean can it be true that the police suspect him Oh that s what your face becomes milky for You ought to have been born a girl Miss Charley If the police do suspect him what of that they ll only have the tables turned upon themselves Butterby might come out and say he suspects me of murder Should I care No I d prove my innocence and make him eat his words They were drawing near home Charley looked up at his brother You must wipe your face Tom Tom took out his handkerchief and gave his face a rub In his indignation his carelessness he would have done nothing of the sort had he not been reminded by the boy Is it off Yes it s off I am not sure but it will break out again You must take care Oh bother let it I should like to have polished off that Pierce senior as he deserves A little coin of the same sort would do Galloway no harm Were I senior of the school and Arthur not my brother mister Mark should hear a little home truth about sneaks I ll tell it him in private as it is but I can t put him up for punishment or act in it as Gaunt could Arthur is our brother therefore we feel it more pointedly than Gaunt sensibly remarked Charley I d advise you not to spell forth that sentimental rubbish though you are a young lady retorted Tom A senior boy if he does his duty should make every boy s cause his own and feel for him Tom said the younger and more thoughtful of the two don t let us say anything of this at home Why not asked Tom hotly He would have run in open mouthed It would pain mamma to hear it Boy do you suppose she would fear Arthur You seem to misconstrue all I say Tom Of course she would not fear him you did not fear him but it stung you I know as was proved by your knocking down Pierce Well I won t speak of it before her conciliated Tom somewhat won over or before my father either but catch me keeping it from the rest As Charles had partially foretold they had barely entered when Tom s face again became ornamented with crimson Annabel shrieked out startling mister Channing on his sofa missus Channing as it happened was not present Constance was Lady Augusta Yorke and her daughters were spending part of the day in the country therefore Constance had come home at twelve Look at Tom s face cried the child What has he been doing Hold your tongue little stupid returned Tom hastily bringing his handkerchief into use again which being a white one made the worse exhibition of the two with its bright red stains It s nothing but a scratch But Annabel s eyes were sharp and she had taken in full view of the hurt Tom you have been fighting I am sure of it Come to me Tom said mister Channing Have you been fighting he demanded as Tom crossed the room in obedience and stood close to him Take your handkerchief away that I may see your face It could not be called a fight papa said Tom holding his cheek so that the light from the window fell full upon the hurt One of the boys offended me I hit him and he gave me this then I knocked him down and there it ended It s only a scratch Thomas was this Christian conduct I don t know papa It was schoolboy s mister Channing could not forbear a smile I know it was a schoolboy s conduct that is bad enough and it is my son s that is worse If I had given him what he deserved he would have had ten times as much and perhaps I should for my temper was up only Gaunt put in his interference When I am senior my rule will be different from Gaunt s Ah Tom your temper up It is that temper of yours which brings you harm What was the quarrel about I would rather not tell you papa Not for my own sake he added turning his honest eyes fearlessly on his father but I could not tell it without betraying something about somebody which it may be as well to keep in After that lucid explanation you had better go and get some warm water for your face said mister Channing I will speak with you later Constance followed him from the room volunteering to procure the warm water They were standing in Tom s chamber afterwards Tom bathing his face and Constance looking on when Arthur who had then come in from mister Galloway s passed by to his own room Hallo he called out what s the matter Tom Such a row answered Tom And I wish I could have pitched into Pierce senior as I d have liked What do you think Arthur The school were taking up the notion that you you had stolen old Galloway s bank note Pierce senior set it afloat that is he and Mark Galloway together Mark said a word and Pierce said two and so it went on I should have paid Pierce out but for Gaunt A silence It was filled up by the sound of Tom splashing the water on his face and by that only Arthur spoke presently his tone so calm a one as almost to be unnatural How did the notion arise Mark Galloway said he heard Butterby talking with his uncle that Butterby said the theft could only have been committed by Arthur Channing Mark Galloway s ears must have played him false but it was a regular sneak s trick to come and repeat it to the school I say Constance is my face clean now Constance woke up from a reverie to look at his face Quite clean she answered He dried it dried his hands gave a glance at his shirt front in the glass which had however escaped damage brushed his hair and went downstairs Arthur closed the door and turned to Constance Her eyes were seeking his and her lips stood apart The terrible fear which had fallen upon both the previous day had not yet been spoken out between them It must be spoken now Constance there is tribulation before us he whispered We must school ourselves to bear it however difficult the task may prove Whatever betide the rest of us suspicion must be averted from him What tribulation do you mean she murmured The affair has been placed in the hands of the police and I believe I believe Arthur spoke with agitation that they will publicly investigate it Constance they suspect me The college school is right and Tom is wrong Constance leaned against a chest of drawers to steady herself and pressed her hand upon her shrinking face How have you learnt it I have gathered it from different trifles one fact and another Jenkins said Butterby was with him this morning asking questions about me Better that I should be suspected than Hamish God help me to bear it But it is so unjust that you should suffer for him Were it traced home to him it might be the whole family s ruin for my father would inevitably lose his post He might lose it were only suspicion to stray to Hamish There is no alternative I must screen him Can you be firm Constance when you see me accused Constance leaned her head upon her hand wondering whether she could be firm in the cause But that she knew where to go for strength she might have doubted it for the love of right the principles of justice were strong within her Oh what could possess him she uttered wringing her hands what could possess him Arthur is there no loophole not the faintest loophole for hope of his innocence None that I see No one whatever had access to the letter but Hamish and I He must have yielded to the temptation in a moment of delirium knowing the money would clear him from some of his pressing debts as it has done How could he brave the risk of detection I don t know My head aches pondering over it I suppose he concluded that suspicion would fall upon the post office It would have done so but for that seal placed on the letter afterwards What an unfortunate thing it was that Roland Yorke mentioned there was money inside the letter in the hearing of Hamish Did he mention it exclaimed Constance He said there was a twenty pound note in the letter going to the cousin Galloway and Hamish remarked that he wished it was going into his pocket instead I wish Arthur uttered in a sort of frenzy I had locked the letter up there and then Constance clasped her hands in pain I fear he may have been going wrong for some time she breathed It has come to my knowledge through Judith that he sits up for hours night after night doing something to the books Arthur she shivered glancing fearfully round I hope those accounts are right The doubt thus given utterance to blanched even the cheeks of Arthur Sits up at the books he exclaimed He sits up that is certain and at the books as I conclude He takes them into his room at night It may only be that he has not time or does not make time to go over them in the day It may be so I trust it is I pray it may be Mind you Constance our duty is plain we must screen him screen him at any sacrifice to ourselves for the father and mother s sake Sacrifice to you you ought to say What were our other light troubles compared with this Arthur will they publicly accuse you It may come to that I have been steeling myself all the morning to meet it He looked into her face as he said it Constance could see how his brow and heart were aching At that moment they were called to dinner and Arthur turned to leave the room Constance caught his hand the tears raining from her eyes Arthur she whispered in the very darkest trouble God can comfort us Be assured He will comfort you Hamish did not make his appearance at dinner and they sat down without him This was not so very unusual as to cause surprise he was occasionally detained at the office The meal was about half over when Annabel in her disregard of the bounds of discipline suddenly started from her seat and flew to the window Charley there are two policemen coming here Whatever can they want Perhaps to take you said missus Channing jestingly A short sojourn at the tread mill might be of great service to you Annabel The announcement had struck upon the ear and memory of Tom Policemen he exclaimed standing up in his place and stretching his neck to obtain a view of them Why it never can be that old Butterby Arthur what ails you A sensitive refined nature whether implanted in man or woman is almost sure to betray its emotions on the countenance Such a nature was Arthur Channing s Now that the dread had really come every drop of blood forsook his cheeks and lips leaving his face altogether of a deathly whiteness He was utterly unable to control or help this and it was this pallor which had given rise to Tom s concluding exclamation mister Channing looked at Arthur missus Channing looked at him they all looked at him except Constance and she bent her head lower over her plate to hide as she best might her own white face and its shrinking terror Are you ill Arthur inquired his father A low brief reply came one struggling for calmness No sir Impetuous Tom forgetting caution forgetting all except the moment actually present gave utterance to more than was prudent Arthur you are never fearing what those wretched schoolboys said The police are not come to arrest you Butterby wouldn t be such a fool But the police were in the hall and Judith had come to the dining room door Master Arthur you are wanted please What is all this exclaimed mister Channing in astonishment gazing from Tom to Arthur from Arthur to the vision of the blue official dress a glimpse of which he could catch beyond Judith Tom took up the answer It s nothing papa It s a trick they are playing for fun I ll lay They can t really suspect Arthur of stealing the bank note you know They ll never dare to take him up as they take a felon Charley stole round to Arthur with a wailing cry and threw his arms round him as if their weak protection could retain him in its shelter Arthur gently unwound them and bent down till his lips touched the yearning face held up to him in its anguish Charley boy I am innocent he breathed in the boy s ear You won t doubt that I know Don t keep me They have come for me and I must go with them CHAPTER XXIII AN ESCORT TO THE GUILDHALL The group would have formed a study for a Wilkie The disturbed dinner table the consternation of those assembled at it mister Channing whose sofa wheeled to the table took up the end opposite his wife gazing around with a puzzled stern expression missus Channing glancing behind her with a sense of undefined dread the pale conscious countenances of Arthur and Constance Tom standing up in haughty impetuosity defiant of every one the lively terror of Charley s face as he clung to Arthur and the wide opened eyes of Annabel expressive of nothing but surprise for it took a great deal to alarm that careless young lady while at the door holding it open for Arthur stood Judith in her mob cap full of curiosity and in the background the two policemen A scene indeed that Wilkie in the day of his power would have rejoiced to paint Arthur battling fiercely with his outraged pride and breathing an inward prayer for strength to go through with his task for patience to endure put Charley from him and went into the hall He saw not what was immediately around him the inquiring looks of his father and mother the necessity of some explanation to them he saw not Judith and her curious face A scale was as it were before his eyes blinding them to all outward influences except one the officers of justice standing there and the purpose for which they had come What on earth has happened Master Arthur whispered Judith as he passed her terrifying the old servant with his pale agitated face But he neither heard nor answered he walked straight up to the men I will go with you quietly he said to them in an undertone Do not make a disturbance to alarm my mother We cannot always have our senses about us as the saying runs Some of us I fear enjoy that privilege rarely and the very best lose them on occasion But that Arthur Channing s senses had deserted him he would not have pursued a line of conduct in that critical moment which was liable to be construed into an admission or at least a consciousness of guilt In his anxiety to avert suspicion from Hamish he lost sight of the precautions necessary to protect himself so far as was practicable And yet he had spent time that morning thinking over what his manner his bearing must be if it came to this Had it come upon him unexpectedly he would have met it very differently with far less outward calmness but most probably with indignant denial I will go with you quietly he said to the men All right sir they answered with a nod and a conviction that he was a cool hand and a guilty one It s always best not to resist the law it never does no good He need not have resisted but he ought to have waited until they asked him to go A dim perception of this had already begun to steal over him He was taking his hat from its place in the hall when the voice of mister Channing came ringing on his ear Arthur what is this Give me an explanation Arthur turned back to the room passing through the sea of faces to get there for all except his helpless father had come from their seats to gather round and about that strange mystery in the hall to try to fathom it mister Channing gave one long keen glance at Arthur s face which was very unlike Arthur s usual face just then for all its candour seemed to have gone out of it He did not speak to him he called in one of the men Will you tell me your business here he asked courteously Don t you know it sir was the reply No I do not replied mister Channing Well sir it s an unpleasant accusation that is brought against this young gentleman But perhaps he ll be able to make it clear I hope he will It don t give us no pleasure when folks are convicted especially young ones and those we have always known to be respectable we d rather see em let off Tom interrupted Tom in his fiery indignation Is it of stealing that bank note of Galloway s that you presume to accuse my brother he asked speaking indistinctly in his haste and anger You have said it sir replied the man That s it Then I say whoever accuses him ought to be Silence Thomas interrupted mister Channing Allow me to deal with this Who brings this accusation against my son We had our orders from mister Butterby sir He is acting for mister Galloway He was called in there early this morning Have you come for my son to go with you to mister Galloway s Not there sir We have to take him straight to the Guildhall The magistrates are waiting to hear the case A dismayed pause Even mister Channing s heart with all its implicit faith in the truth and honour of his children beat as if it would burst its bounds Tom s beat too but it was with a desire to pitch into the policemen as he had pitched into Pierce senior in the cloisters mister Channing turned to Arthur You have an answer to this my son The question was not replied to mister Channing spoke again with the same calm emphasis Arthur you can vouch for your innocence Arthur Channing did the very worst thing that he could have done he hesitated Instead of replying readily and firmly I can which he might have done without giving rise to harm he stopped to ask himself how far consistently with safety to Hamish he might defend his own cause His mind was not collected he had not as I have said his senses about him and the unbroken silence waiting for his answer the expectant faces turned upon him helped to confuse him and to drive his reason further away The signs which certainly did look like signs of guilt struck a knell on the heart of his father Arthur he wailed out in a tone of intense agony you are innocent Y es replied Arthur gulping down his rising agitation his rising words impassioned words of exculpation of innocence of truth They had bubbled up within him were hovering on the verge of his burning lips He beat them down again to repression but he never afterwards knew how he did it Better that he had been still silent than speak that dubious indecisive Y es It told terribly against him One conscious of his own innocence does not proclaim it in indistinct half uttered words Tom s mouth dropped with dismay and his astonished eyes seemed as if they could not take themselves from Arthur s uncertain face missus Channing staggered against the wall with a faint cry The policeman spoke up he meant to be kindly In all Helstonleigh there was not a family more respected than were the Channings and the man felt a passing sorrow for his task I wouldn t ask no questions sir if I was you Sometimes it s best not they tell against the accused Time s up called out the one who was in the hall to his fellow We can t stop here all day The hint was taken at once both by Arthur and the man Constance had kept herself still throughout by main force but missus Channing could not see him go away like this She rose and threw her arms round him in a burst of hysterical feeling sobbing out My boy my boy Don t mother don t unnerve me he whispered It is bad enough as it is But you cannot be guilty Arthur For answer he looked into her eyes for a single moment His habitual expression had come back to them again the earnest of truth which she had ever known and trusted It spoke calm to her heart now You are innocent she murmured Then go in peace Annabel broke into a storm of sobs Oh Judith will they hang him What has he done I d hang them two policemen if I did what I should like to do responded Judith Yes you two I mean she added without ceremony as the officials turned round at the words If I had my will I d hang you both up to two of those elm trees yonder right in front of one another Coming to a gentleman s house on this errand Do not take me publicly through the streets said Arthur to his keepers I give you my word to make no resistance I will go to the Guildhall or anywhere else that you please as freely as if I were bound thither on my own pleasure You need not betray that I am in custody They saw that they might trust him One of the policemen went to the opposite side of the way as if pacing his beat the other continued by the side of Arthur not closely enough to give rise to suspicion in those they met A few paces from the door Tom Channing came pelting up and put his arm within Arthur s Guilty or not guilty it shall never be said that a Channing was deserted by his brothers quoth he I wish Hamish could have been here Tom you are thinking me guilty Arthur said in a quiet tone which did not reach the ears of his official escort Well I am in a fix avowed Tom If you are guilty I shall never believe in anything again I have always thought that building a cathedral well and good but if it turns out to be a myth I shan t be surprised after this Are you guilty No lad The denial was simple and calmly expressed but there was sufficient in its tone to make Tom Channing s heart give a great leap within him Thank God What a fool I was But I say Arthur why did you not deny it out and out Your manner frightened us I suppose the police scared you Tom all right now walked along his head up escorting Arthur with as little shame to public examination as he would have done to a public crowning It was not the humiliation of undeserved suspicion that could daunt the Channings the consciousness of guilt could alone effect that Hitherto neither guilt nor its shadow had fallen upon them Tom asked Arthur when they had reached the hall and were about to enter will you do me a little service Won t I though what is it Make the best of your way to mister Williams s and tell him I am prevented from taking the organ this afternoon I shan t tell him the reason said Tom Why not In an hour s time it will be known from one end of Helstonleigh to the other CHAPTER XXIV THE EXAMINATION The magistrates sat on the bench in the town hall of Helstonleigh But before the case was called on for the police had spoken too fast in saying they were waiting for it Arthur became acquainted with one great fact that it was not mister Galloway who had driven matters to this extremity Neither was he aware that Arthur had been taken into custody mister Butterby had assumed the responsibility and acted upon it mister Butterby since his interview with mister Galloway in the morning had gathered as he believed sufficiently corroborating facts to establish or nearly so the guilt of Arthur Channing He supposed that this was all mister Galloway required to remove his objection to stern measures and in procuring the warrant for the capture mister Butterby had acted as for mister Galloway When Arthur was placed in the spot where he had often seen criminals standing his face again wore the livid hue which had overspread it in his home In a few moments this had changed to crimson brow and cheeks were glowing with it It was a painful situation and Arthur felt it to the very depths of his naturally proud spirit I don t think you or I should have liked it The circumstances were stated to the magistrates just as they have been stated to you The placing of the bank note and letter in the envelope by mister Galloway his immediately fastening it down by means of the gum the extraction of the note between that time and the period when the seal was placed on it later in the day and the fact that Arthur Channing alone had access to it Except mister Hamish Channing for a few minutes mister Butterby added who kindly remained in the office while his brother proceeded as far as the cathedral and back again the other clerks Joseph Jenkins and Roland Yorke being absent that afternoon A deeper dye flushed Arthur s face when Hamish s name and share in the afternoon s doings were mentioned and he bent his eyes on the floor at his feet and kept them there Had Hamish not been implicated he would have stood there with a clear eye and a serene brow It was that the all too vivid consciousness of the sin of Hamish which took all spirit out of him and drove him to stand there as one under the brand of guilt He scarcely dared look up lest it should be read in his countenance that he was innocent and Hamish guilty he scarcely dared to pronounce in ever so faltering a tone the avowal I did it not Had it been to save his life from the scaffold he could not have spoken out boldly and freely that day There was the bitter shock of the crime felt for Hamish s own sake Hamish whom they had all so loved so looked up to and there was the dread of the consequences to mister Channing in the event of discovery Had the penalty been hanging I believe that Arthur would have gone to it rather than betray Hamish But you must not suppose he did not feel it for himself there were moments when he feared lest he should not carry it through mister Butterby was waiting for a witness mister Galloway himself and meanwhile he entertained the bench with certain scraps anecdotal and other premising what would be proved before them Jenkins would show that the prisoner had avowed in his presence it would take a twenty pound note to clear him from his debts or hard upon it No interrupted the hitherto silent prisoner to the surprise of those present that is not true It is correct that I did make use of words to that effect but I spoke them in jest I and Roland Yorke were one day speaking of debts and I jokingly said a twenty pound note would pay mine and leave me something out of it Jenkins was present and he may have supposed I spoke in earnest In point of fact I did not owe anything It was an assertion more easily made than proved Arthur Channing might have large liabilities upon him for all that appeared in that court to the contrary mister Butterby handed the seal to the bench who examined it curiously I could have understood this case better had any stranger or strangers approached the letter observed one of the magistrates who knew the Channings personally and greatly respected their high character You are sure you are not mistaken in supposing no one came in he added looking kindly at Arthur Certainly no one came in whilst I was alone in the office sir was the unhesitating answer The magistrate spoke in an under tone to those beside him That avowal is in his favour Had he taken the note one might suppose he would be anxious to make it appear that strangers did enter and so throw suspicion off himself I have made very close inquiry and cannot find that the office was entered at all that afternoon observed mister Butterby mister Butterby had made close inquiry and to do him justice he did not seek to throw one shade more of guilt upon Arthur than he thought the case deserved mister Hamish Channing also mister Butterby stopped There standing within the door was Hamish himself In passing along the street he had seen an unusual commotion around the town hall and upon inquiring its cause was told that Arthur Channing was under examination on suspicion of having stolen the bank note lost by mister Galloway To look at Hamish you would have believed him innocent and unconscious as the day He strode into the justice room his eye flashing his brow haughty his colour high Never had gay Hamish looked so scornfully indignant He threw his glance round the crowded court in search of Arthur and it found him Their eyes met A strange gaze it was going out from the one to the other a gaze which the brothers had never in all their lives exchanged Arthur s spoke of shame all too palpably he could not help it in that bitter moment shame for his brother And Hamish shrank under it If ever one cowered visibly in this world Hamish Channing did then A low suppressed cry went up from Arthur s heart whatever fond faint doubt may have lingered in his mind it died out from that moment Others noticed the significant look exchanged between them but they not in the secret saw only on the part of Hamish what they took for vexation at his brother s position It was suggested that it would save time to take the evidence of mister Hamish Channing at once mister Galloway s might be received later What evidence demanded Hamish standing before the magistrates in a cold uncompromising manner and speaking in a cold uncompromising tone I have none to give I know nothing of the affair Not much we are aware but what little you do know must be spoken mister Hamish Channing They did not swear him These were only informal preliminary proceedings Country courts of law are not always conducted according to orthodox rules nor was that of Helstonleigh There would be another and a more formal examination before the committal of the prisoner for trial if committed he should be A few unimportant questions were put to Hamish and then he was asked whether he saw the letter in question I saw a letter which I suppose to have been the one he replied It was addressed to mister Robert Galloway at Ventnor Did you observe your brother take it into mister Galloway s private room Yes answered Hamish In putting the desks straight before departing for college my brother carried the letter into mister Galloway s room and left it there I distinctly remember his doing so Did you see the letter after that No How long did you remain alone while your brother was away I did not look at my watch irritably returned Hamish who had spoken resentfully throughout as if some great wrong were being inflicted upon him in having to speak at all But you can guess at the time No I can t shortly retorted Hamish And guesses are not evidence Was it ten minutes It may have been I know he seemed to be back almost as soon as he had gone Did any person clerk or stranger or visitor or otherwise come into the office during his absence from it No No person whatever No person whatever I think continued Hamish volunteering an opinion upon the subject although he knew it was out of all rule and precedent to do so that there is a great deal of unprofitable fuss being made about the matter The money must have been lost in going through the post it is impossible to suppose otherwi Hamish was stopped by a commotion Clattering along the outer hall and bursting in at the court door his black hair disordered his usually pale cheeks scarlet his nostrils working with excitement came Roland Yorke He was in a state of fierce emotion Learning as he had done by accident that Arthur had been arrested upon the charge he took up the cause hotly gave vent to a burst of passionate indignation in which he abused every one under the sun except Arthur and tore off to the town hall Elbowing the crowd right and left in his impetuosity pushing one policeman here and another there who would have obstructed his path he came up to Arthur and ranged himself by his side linking his arm within his in an outburst of kindly generosity Old fellow who has done this mister Roland Yorke exclaimed the bench indignantly What do you mean by this behaviour Stand away if you please sir I ll stand away when Arthur Channing stands away retorted Yorke apparently ignoring whose presence he was in Who accuses him mister Galloway does not This is your doing Butterby Take care that their worships don t commit you for contempt of court retorted mister Butterby You are going on for it Roland Yorke Let them commit me if they will foamed Roland I am not going to see a friend falsely accused and not stand up for him Channing no more touched that money than any of you did The post office must have had it A moment mister Roland Yorke if you can calm yourself sufficiently to answer as a rational being interposed the magistrate who had addressed Arthur Have you any proof to urge in support of your assertion that the prisoner did not touch it Proof sir returned Roland subsiding however into a tone of more respect does it want proof to establish the innocence of Arthur Channing Every action of his past life is proof He is honest as the day This warm feeling does you credit in one sense It does me no credit at all fiercely interrupted Roland I don t defend him because he is my friend I don t defend him because we are in the same office and sit side by side at the same desk I do it because I know him to be innocent How do you know it He could not be guilty He is incapable of it Better accuse me or Jenkins than accuse him You and Jenkins were not at the office during the suspected time Well I know we were not acknowledged Roland lowering his voice to a more reasonable tone And just because it happened by some cross grained luck that Channing was Butterby pitches upon him and accuses him of the theft He never did it and I ll say it with my last breath With some trouble threatenings on the part of the court and more explosions from himself mister Roland Yorke was persuaded to retire He went as far as the back of the room and there indulged in under currents of wrath touching injustice and mister Butterby to a select circle who gathered round him Warm hearted and generous by fits and starts was Roland Yorke he had inherited it with his Irish blood from Lady Augusta But meanwhile where was mister Galloway He did not make his appearance and it was said he could not be found Messenger after messenger was despatched to his office to his house and at length mister Butterby went himself All in vain his servants knew nothing about him Jenkins who had the office to himself thought he must be somewhere in the town as he had not said he was going out of it mister Butterby went back crest fallen and confessed that not to take up longer the time of their worships unnecessarily the case must be remanded to the morrow We will take bail said the magistrates before the application was made One surety will be sufficient fifty pounds At that mister Roland who by this time was standing in a sullen manner against a pillar of the court his violence gone and biting his nails moodily made a rush to the front again heeding little who he knocked down in the process I ll be bail he cried eagerly That is Lady Augusta will as I am not a householder I ll hunt her up and bring her here He was turning in impetuous haste to hunt up Lady Augusta when Hamish Channing imperatively waved to him to be still and spoke to the bench My father s security will be sufficient I presume Quite so Since mister Channing s incapacity power to sign and to act for him had been vested in Hamish and the matter was concluded at once The court poured out its crowd Hamish was on the point of taking Arthur s arm but was pushed aside by Roland Yorke who seized upon it as if he could never make enough of him The miserable idiots to bring such a charge against you Arthur I have been half mad ever since I heard of it Thank you Yorke You are very kind Kind Don t talk that school girl rubbish passionately interrupted Roland If I were taken up upon a false charge wouldn t you stand by me That I would were it false or true I ll pay that Butterby out if it s ten years hence And you knowing your own innocence could stand before them there meek faced as a tame cat letting Butterby and the bench have it their own way A calm temper such as yours Arthur may be very what do they call it Christian but I m blest if it s useful I should have made their ears tingle had they put me there as they have not tingled for many a day Who do you suppose took the note inquired Hamish of Roland Yorke speaking for the first time Bother the note was the rejoinder of mister Roland It s nothing to us who took it Arthur didn t Go and ask the post office But the seal Hamish was beginning in a friendly tone of argument Roland bore him down Who cares for the seal I don t If Galloway had stuck himself upon the letter instead of his seal and never got off till it reached the cousin Galloway s hand I wouldn t care It tells nothing Do you want to find your brother guilty he continued in a tone of scorn You did not half stand up for him Hamish Channing as I d expect a brother to stand up for me Now then you people Are you thinking we are live kangaroos escaped from a menagerie Be off about your own business Don t come after us The last was addressed to a crowd who had followed upon their heels from the court staring with that innate delicacy for which the English are remarkable They had seen Arthur Channing a thousand times before every one of them but as he had been arrested they must look at him again Yorke s scornful reproach and fierce face somewhat scattered them If it had been Galloway s doings I d never have put my foot inside his confounded old office again went on Roland No and my lady might have tried her best to force me Lugging a fellow up for a pitiful paltry sum of twenty pounds who is as much a gentleman as himself who as his own senses might tell him wouldn t touch it with the end of his finger But it was that Butterby s handiwork not Galloway s Galloway must have given Butterby his instructions observed Hamish He didn t then snapped Roland Jenkins says he knows he did not by the remarks Galloway made to him this morning And Galloway has been away ever since eleven o clock we can t tell where It is nobody but that evil mischief making Butterby and I d give a crown out of my pocket to have a good duck at him in the river With regard to mister Galloway s knowing nothing of the active proceedings taken against Arthur Roland was right mister Butterby had despatched a note to mister Galloway s office at one o clock stating what he had done and requesting him to be at the office at two for the examination and the note had been lying there ever since It was being opened now Now at the exact moment that mister Roland Yorke was giving vent to that friendly little wish about the river and mister Butterby mister Galloway had met a friend in the town and had gone with him a few miles by rail into the country on unexpected business He had just returned to find the note and to hear Jenkins account of Arthur s arrest I am vexed at this he exclaimed his tone betraying excessive annoyance Butterby has exceeded his orders Jenkins thought he might venture to put in a word for Arthur He had been intensely surprised indeed grieved at the whole affair and not the less so that he feared what he had unconsciously repeated about a twenty pound note paying Arthur s debts might have helped it on I feel as sure as can be sir that it was not mister Arthur Channing he deferentially said I have not been in this office with him for more than twelve months without learning something of his principles The principles of all the Channings are well known returned mister Galloway No whatever may be the apparent proofs I cannot bring myself to think it could be Arthur Channing Although mister Galloway did not say although what but changed the topic abruptly Are they in court now I expect so sir mister Yorke is not back yet mister Galloway walked to the outer door deliberating what his course should be The affair grieved him more than he could express it angered him chiefly for his old friend mister Channing s sake I had better go up to the Guildhall he soliloquized and see if There they were turning the corner of the street Roland Yorke Hamish and Arthur and the followers behind mister Galloway waited till they came up Hamish did not enter or stop but went straight home They will be so anxious for news he exclaimed Not a word had been exchanged between the brothers No wonder that he shuns coming in thought Arthur Roland Yorke threw his hat from him in silence and sat down in his place at the desk mister Galloway touched Arthur with his finger motioned him towards the private room and stood there facing him speaking gravely Tell me the truth as before God Are you innocent or guilty What you say shall not be used against you Quick as lightning in all solemn earnestness the word innocent was on Arthur s lips It had been better for him perhaps that he had spoken it But alas that perplexity as to how far he might venture to assert his own innocence was upon him still What impression could this hesitation coupled with the suspicious circumstances make upon the mind of mister Galloway Have you no answer emphatically asked mister Galloway I am not guilty sir Meanwhile what do you suppose were the sensations of mister Channing We all know that anguish of mind is far more painful to bear when the body is quiescent than when it is in motion In any great trouble any terrible suspense look at our sleepless nights We lie and toss and turn and say When will the night be gone In the day we can partially shake it off walking hither and thither the keenness of the anguish is lost in exertion mister Channing could not take this exertion Lying there always his days were little better to him than nights and this strange blow which had fallen so suddenly and unexpectedly nearly overwhelmed him Until that afternoon he would have confidently said that his son might have been trusted with a room full of untold gold He would have said it still but for Arthur s manner it was that which staggered him More than one urgent message had been despatched for mister Galloway but that gentleman was unable to go to him until late in the evening My friend said mister Galloway bending over the sofa when they were alone I am more grieved at this than you can be mister Channing clasped his hand Tell me what you think yourself the simple truth I ask it Galloway by our long friendship Do you think him innocent or guilty There might be no subterfuge in answer to words so earnest and mister Galloway did not attempt any He bent lower and spoke in a whisper I believe him to be guilty mister Channing closed his eyes and his lips momentarily moved A word of prayer to be helped to bear was going up to the throne of God But never think that it was I who instituted these proceedings against him resumed mister Galloway When I called in Butterby to my aid this morning I had no more notion that it was Arthur Channing who was guilty than I had that it was that sofa of yours Butterby would have cast suspicion to him then but I repelled it He afterwards acted upon his own responsibility while my back was turned It is as I say often to my office people I can t stir out for a few hours but something goes wrong You know the details of the loss Ay by heart replied mister Channing They are suspicious against Arthur only in so far as that he was alone with the letter Sufficient time must have been taken as I conclude to wet the envelope and unfasten the gum and it would appear that he alone had that time This apparent suspicion would have been nothing to my mind knowing Arthur as I do had it not been coupled with a suspicious manner There it is assented mister Galloway warmly It is that manner which leaves no room for doubt I had him with me privately when the examination was over and begged him to tell me as before God innocent or guilty He could not He stood like a statue confused his eyes down and his colour varying He is badly constituted for the commission of crime for he cannot brave it out One knowing himself wrongfully accused would lay his hand upon his heart with an upright countenance and say I am innocent of this so help me Heaven I must confess I did not like his manner yesterday when he heard me say I should place it in the hands of the police continued mister Galloway He grew suddenly agitated and begged I would not do so Ay cried mister Channing with a groan of pain he could not wholly suppress It is an incredible mystery What could he want with the money The tale told about his having debts has no foundation in fact he has positively none mister Galloway shook his head he would not speak out his thoughts He knew that Hamish was in debt he knew that Master Roland Yorke indulged in expensive habits whenever he had the opportunity and he now thought it likely that Arthur between the two examples might have been drawn in I shall not allow my doubts of him to go further than you he said aloud And I shall put a summary stop to the law proceedings How will you do that now that they are publicly entered upon asked mister Channing I ll manage it was the reply We ll see which is strongest I or Butterby When they were gathering together for the reading that night Arthur took his place as usual mister Channing looked at him sternly and spoke sternly in the presence of them all Will your conscience allow you to join in this How it stung him Knowing himself innocent seeing Hamish the real culprit basking there in their love and respect as usual the unmerited obloquy cast upon him was almost too painful to bear He did not answer he was battling down his rebellious spirit and the gentle voice of missus Channing rose instead James there is all the more need for him to join in it if things are as you fear And mister Channing applied himself to the reading My son if thou come to serve the Lord prepare thy soul for temptation Set thy heart aright and constantly endure and make not haste in time of trouble It was a portion of Scripture rarely chosen and perhaps for that reason it fell upon Arthur with greater force As he listened the words brought healing with them and his sore spirit was soothed and grew trusting and peaceful as that of a little child CHAPTER XXV A MORNING CALL You may possibly be blaming Arthur Channing for meeting this trouble in so sad a spirit Were such an accusation cast unjustly upon you you would throw it off impatiently and stand up for yourself and your innocence in the broad light of day Even were you debarred as he was from speaking out the whole truth you would never be cast down to that desponding depth and thereby give a colouring to the doubt cast upon you Are you thinking this But you must remember that it was not for himself that Arthur was so weighed down Had he possessed no conception as to how the note went he would have met the charge very differently bearing himself bravely and flinging their suspicion to the winds You people cannot think me guilty he might have said my whole previous life is a refutation to the charge He would have held up his head and heart cheerfully waiting and looking for the time when elucidation should come No his grief his despondency were felt for Hamish If Arthur Channing had cherished faith in one living being more than in another it was in his elder brother He loved him with a lasting love he revered him as few revere a brother and the shock was great He would far rather have fallen down to guilt himself than that Hamish should have fallen Tom Channing had said with reference to Arthur that if he were guilty he should never believe in anything again they might tell him that the cathedral was a myth and not a cathedral and he should not be surprised This sort of feeling had come over Arthur It had disturbed his faith in honour and goodness it had almost disgusted him with the world Arthur Channing is not the only one who has found his faith in fellow men rudely shaken And yet the first shock over his mind was busy finding excuses for him He knew that Hamish had not erred from any base self gratification but from love You may be inclined to think this a contradiction for all such promptings to crime must be base Of course they are but as the motives differ so do the degrees As surely as though the whole matter had been laid before him felt Arthur Hamish had been driven to it in his desperate need to save his father s position and the family s means of support He felt that had Hamish alone been in question he would not have appropriated a pin that was not his to save himself from arrest what he had done he had done in love Arthur gave him credit for another thing that he had never cast a glance to the possibility of suspicion falling on Arthur the post office would receive credit for the loss Nothing more tangible than that wide field where they might hunt for the supposed thief until they were tired It was a miserable evening that followed the exposure the precursor of many and many miserable evenings in days to come mister and missus Channing Hamish Constance and Arthur sat in the usual sitting room when the rest had retired sat in ominous silence Even Hamish with his naturally sunny face and sunny temper looked gloomy as the grave Was he deliberating as to whether he should show that all principles of manly justice were not quite dead within him by speaking up at last and clearing his wrongfully accused brother But then his father s post his mother s home all might be forfeited Who can tell whether this was the purport of Hamish s thoughts as he sat there in abstraction away from the light his head upon his hand He did not say Arthur rose the silence was telling upon him May I say good night to you father Have you nothing else to say asked mister Channing In what way sir asked Arthur in a low tone In the way of explanation Will you leave me to go to my restless pillow without it This is the first estrangement which has come between us What explanation could he give But to leave his father suffering in body and in mind without attempt at it was a pain hard to bear Father I am innocent he said It was all he could say and it was spoken all too quietly mister Channing gazed at him searchingly In the teeth of appearances Yes sir in the teeth of appearances Then why if I am to believe you have assumed the aspect of guilt which you certainly have done Arthur involuntarily glanced at Hamish the thought of his heart was You know why if no one else does and caught Hamish looking at him stealthily under cover of his fingers Apparently Hamish was annoyed at being so caught and started up Good night mother I am going to bed They wished him good night and he left the room mister Channing turned again to Arthur He took his hand and spoke with agitation My boy do you know that I would almost rather have died than live to see this guilt fall upon you Oh father don t judge me harshly he implored Indeed I am innocent mister Channing paused Arthur you never as I believe told me a lie in your life What is this puzzle I am not telling a lie now I am tempted to believe you But why then act as if you were guilty When those men came here to day you knew what they wanted you resigned yourself voluntarily a prisoner When mister Galloway questioned you privately of your innocence you could not assert it Neither could he now in a more open way than he was doing Can you look me in the face and tell me in all honour that you know nothing of the loss of the note All I can say sir is that I did not take it or touch it Nay but you are equivocating exclaimed mister Channing Arthur felt that he was in some measure and did not gainsay it Are you aware that to morrow you may be committed for trial on the charge I know it replied Arthur Unless unless he stopped in agitation Unless you will interest yourself with Galloway and induce him to withdraw proceedings Your friendship with him has been close and long sir and I think he would do it for you Would you ask this if you were innocent said mister Channing Arthur it is not the punishment you ought to dread but the consciousness of meriting it And of that I am not conscious he answered emphatically in his bitterness Father I would lay down my life to shield you from care think of me as favourably as you can You will not make me your full confidant I wish I could I wish I could He wrung his father s hand and turned to his mother halting before her Would she give him her good night kiss Would she Did a fond mother ever turn against her child To the prison to the scaffold down to the very depths of obloquy and scorn a loving mother clings to her son All else may forsake but she never be he what he will missus Channing drew his face to hers and burst into sobs as she sheltered it on her bosom You will have faith in me my darling mother The words were spoken in the softest whisper He kissed her tenderly and hastened from the room not trusting himself to say good night to Constance In the hall he was waylaid by Judith Master Arthur it isn t true Of course it is not true Judith Don t you know me better What an old oaf I am for asking to be sure Didn t I nurse him and haven t I watched him grow up and don t I know my own boys yet she added to herself but speaking aloud To be sure you have Judy But Master Arthur why is the master casting blame to you And when them insolent police came strutting here to day as large as life in their ugly blue coats and shiny hats why didn t you hold the door wide and show em out again I d never have demeaned myself to go with em politely They wanted me at the town hall you know Judith I suppose you have heard it all Then want should have been their master for me retorted Judith I d never have gone unless they had got a cord and drawn me I shouldn t wonder but they fingered the money themselves Arthur made his escape and went up to his room He was scarcely within it when Hamish left his chamber and came in Arthur s heart beat quicker Was he coming to make a clean breast of it Not he Arthur Hamish began speaking in a kindly but an estranged tone or else Arthur fancied it can I serve you in any way in this business Of course you cannot replied Arthur and he felt vexed with himself that his tone should savour of peevishness I am sorry for it as you may readily believe old fellow resumed Hamish When I entered the court to day you might have knocked me down with a feather Ay I should suppose so said Arthur You did not expect the charge would be brought upon me I neither expected it nor believed it when I was told I inquired of Parkes the beadle what unusual thing was going on seeing so many people about the doors and he answered that you were under examination I laughed at him thinking he was joking Arthur made no reply What can I do for you repeated Hamish You can leave me to myself Hamish That s about the kindest thing you can do for me to night Hamish did not take the hint immediately We must have the accusation quashed at all hazards he went on But my father thinks Galloway will withdraw it Yorke says he ll not leave a stone unturned to make Helstonleigh believe the money was lost in the post office Yorke believes so himself reproachfully rejoined Arthur I think most people do with the exception of Butterby Confounded old meddler There would have been no outcry at all but for him A pause Arthur did not seem inclined to break it Hamish had caught up a bit of whalebone which happened to be lying on the drawers and was twisting it about in his fingers glancing at Arthur from time to time Arthur leaned against the chimneypiece his hands in his pockets and in like manner glanced at him Not the slightest doubt in the world that each was wishing to speak out more freely But some inward feeling restrained them Hamish broke the silence Then you have nothing to say to me Arthur Not to night Arthur thought the saying should have been on the other side He had cherished some faint hope that Hamish would at least acknowledge the trouble he had brought upon him I could not help it Arthur I was driven to my wit s end but I never thought the reproach would fall upon you or words to that effect No nothing of the sort Constance was ascending the stairs as Hamish withdrew Can I come in Arthur she asked For answer he opened the door and drew her inside Has Hamish spoken of it she whispered Not a word as to his own share in it He asked in a general way if he could serve me Constance he feverishly added they do not suspect downstairs do they Suspect what That it was Hamish Of course they do not They suspect you At least papa does He cannot make it out he never was so puzzled in all his life He says you must either have taken the money or connived at its being taken to believe otherwise would render your manner perfectly inexplicable Oh Arthur he is so grieving He says other troubles have arisen without fault on our part but this the greatest has been brought by guilt There is no help for it wailed Arthur I could only clear myself at the expense of Hamish and it would be worse for them to grieve for him than for me Bright sunny Hamish whom my mother has I believe in her heart loved the best of all of us Thank you Constance for keeping my counsel How unselfish you are Arthur Unselfish I don t see it as a merit It is my simple duty to be so in this case If I by a rash word directed suspicion to Hamish and our home in consequence got broken up who would be the selfish one then There s the consideration which frightens and fetters us Papa must have been thinking of that when he thanked God that the trouble had not fallen upon Hamish Did he do that asked Arthur eagerly Yes just now Thank God that the cloud did not fall upon Hamish he exclaimed It had been far worse for us then Arthur listened Had he wanted anything to confirm him in the sacrifice he was making those words of his father s would have done it mister Channing had no greater regard for one son than for the other but he knew as well as his children how much depended upon Hamish The tears were welling up into the eyes of Constance I wish I could speak comfort to you she whispered Comfort will come with time I dare say darling Don t stay I seem quite fagged out to night and would be alone Ay alone Alone with his grief and with God To bed at last but not to sleep not for hours and for hours His anxiety of mind was intense chiefly for Hamish though he endured some on his own score To be pointed at as a thief in the town stung him to the quick even in anticipation and there was also the uncertainty as to the morrow s proceedings for all he knew they might end in the prosecution being carried on and his committal for trial Towards morning he dropped into a heavy slumber and to awake from that was the worst of all for his trouble came pressing upon his brain with tenfold poignancy He rose and dressed in some perplexity perplexity as to the immediate present Ought he or ought he not to go as usual to mister Galloway s He really could not tell If mister Galloway believed him guilty and there was little doubt of that now of course he could no longer be tolerated in the office On the other hand to stop away voluntarily might look like an admission of guilt He determined to go and did so It was the early morning hour when he had the office to himself He got through his work the copying of a somewhat elaborate will and returned home to breakfast He found mister Channing had risen which was not usual Like Arthur his night had been an anxious one and the bustle of the breakfast room was more tolerable than bed I wonder what Hamish s had been The meal passed in uncomfortable silence A tremendous peal at the hall bell startled the house echoing through the Boundaries astonishing the rooks and sending them on the wing On state occasions it pleased Judith to answer the door herself her helpmate over whom she held undisputed sway ruling her with a tight hand dared not come forward to attempt it The bell tinkled still and Judy believing it could be no one less than the bishop come to alarm them with a matutinal visit hurried on a clean white apron and stepped across the hall mister Roland Yorke No one more formidable He passed Judith with an unceremonious nod and marched into the breakfast room Good morning all I say old chap are you ready to come to the office It s good to see you down at this early hour mister Channing He was invited to take a seat but declined it was time they were at Galloway s he said Arthur hesitated I do not know whether mister Galloway will expect me he observed Not expect you flashed Roland lapsing into his loud excited manner I can tell you what Arthur if he doesn t expect you he shan t expect me mister Channing did you ever know anything so shamefully overbearing and unjust as that affair yesterday Unjust if it be unfounded replied mister Channing Unfounded uttered Roland If that s not unfounded there never was an unfounded charge brought yet I d answer for Arthur with my own life I should like to sew up that Butterby I hope sir you ll bring an action against him You feel it strongly Roland I should hope I do Look you mister Channing it is a slur on our office on me and on Jenkins and on Galloway himself Yes on Galloway I say what I mean and nobody shall talk me down I d rather believe it was Galloway did it than Arthur I shall tell him so This sympathy shows very kind feeling on your part Ro I declare I shall go mad if I hear that again interrupted Roland turning red with passion It makes me wild Everybody s on with it You are very kind to take up Arthur Channing s cause they mince out Incorrigible idiots Kind Why mister Channing if that cat of yours there were to be accused of swallowing down a mutton chop and you felt morally certain that she did not do it wouldn t you stand up for her against punishment mister Channing could not forbear a smile at Roland and his hot championship To be morally certain may do when cats are in question mister Roland but the law unfortunately requires something more for us the superior animal No father living has had more cause to put faith in his children than I The unfortunate point in this business is that the loss appears to have occurred so mysteriously when the letter was in Arthur s charge Yes if it had occurred that way but who believes it did except a few pates with shallow brains retorted Roland The note is burning a hole in the pocket of some poor ill paid wight of a letter carrier that s where the note is I beg your pardon mister Channing but it s of no use to interrupt me with arguments about old Galloway s seal They go in at one ear and out at the other What more easy than to put a penknife under the seal and unfasten it You cannot do this where gum is used as well as it was to that letter Who cares for the gum retorted mister Roland I don t pretend to say sir how it was accomplished but I know it must have been done somehow Watch a conjuror at his tricks You can t tell how he gets a shilling out of a box which you yourself put in all you know is he does get it out or how he exhibits some receptacle crammed full which you could have sworn was empty Just so with the letter The bank note did get out of it but we can t tell how except that it was not through Arthur Come along old fellow or Galloway may be blowing us up for arriving late Twitching Tom s hair as he passed him treading on the cat s tail and tossing a branch of sweetbriar full of thorns at Annabel mister Roland Yorke made his way out in a commotion Arthur yielding to the strong will followed Roland passed his arm within his and they went towards Close Street I say old chum I haven t had a wink of sleep all night worrying over this bother My room is over Lady Augusta s and she sent up this morning to know what I was pacing about for like a troubled ghost I woke at four o clock and I could not get to sleep after so I just stamped about a bit to stamp the time away In a happier mood Arthur might have laughed at his Irish talk I am glad you stand by me at any rate Yorke I never did it you know Here comes Williams I wonder in what light he will take up the affair Perhaps he will turn me from my post at the organ He had better flashed Roland I d turn him mister Williams appeared to take up the affair in a resentful haughty sort of spirit something like Roland only that he was quieter over it He threw ridicule upon the charge I am astonished at Galloway he observed when he had spoken with them some moments Should he go on with the case the town will cry shame upon him Ah but you see it was that meddling Butterby not Galloway returned Yorke As if Galloway did not know us chaps in his office better than to suspect us I fancy Butterby is fonder of meddling than he need be said the organist A certain person in the town living not a hundred miles from this very spot was suspected of having made free with a ring which disappeared from a dressing table where she was paying an evening visit and I declare if Butterby did not put his nose into it and worm out all the particulars That she had not taken it That she had But it produced great annoyance all parties concerned even those who had lost the ring would rather have buried it in silence It was hushed up afterwards Butterby ought to understand people s wishes before he sets to work I wish press gangs were in fashion emphatically uttered Roland What a nice prize he d make I suppose I can depend upon you to take the duty at College this morning mister Williams said to Arthur as he was leaving them Yes I shall be out in time for the examination at the Guildhall The hour fixed is half past eleven Old villains the magistrates must have been to remand it at all was the concluding comment of mister Roland Yorke

6904_262291_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Constance Channing proceeded to her duties as usual at Lady Augusta Yorke s 
6904_262291_000004_000001	train-clean-360	She drew her veil over her face only to traverse the very short way that conveyed her thither for the sense of shame was strong upon her not shame for Arthur but for Hamish 
6904_262291_000004_000002	train-clean-360	It had half broken Constance s heart 
6904_262291_000005_000000	train-clean-360	There are times in our every day lives when all things seem to wear a depressing aspect turn which way we will 
6904_262291_000005_000001	train-clean-360	They were wearing it that day to Constance 
6904_262291_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Apart from home troubles she felt particularly discouraged in the educational task she had undertaken 
6904_262291_000005_000003	train-clean-360	You heard the promise made to her by Caroline Yorke to be up and ready for her every morning at seven 
6904_262291_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Caroline kept it for two mornings and then failed This morning and the previous morning Constance had been there at seven and returned home without seeing either of the children 
6904_262291_000005_000005	train-clean-360	Both were ready for her when she entered now 
6904_262291_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 How am I to deal with you she said to Caroline in a sad but affectionate tone 
6904_262291_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 I do not wish to force you to obey me I would prefer that you should do it cheerfully 
6904_262291_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 It is tiresome to get up early responded Caroline 
6904_262291_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 I can t wake when Martha comes 
6904_262291_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Whether Martha goes to you at seven or at eight or at nine she has the same trouble to get you up 
6904_262291_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t see any good in getting up early cried Caroline 
6904_262291_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you see any good in acquiring good habits instead of bad ones asked Constance 
none	none	But Miss Channing why need we learn to get up early 
6904_262291_000011_000001	train-clean-360	We are ladies It s only the poor who need get up at unreasonable hours those who have their living to earn 
6904_262291_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it only the poor who are accountable to God for waste of time Caroline 
6904_262291_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Caroline paused 
6904_262291_000013_000001	train-clean-360	She did not like to give up her argument 
none	none	It s so very low lived to get up with the sun 
6904_262291_000013_000003	train-clean-360	I don t think real ladies ever do it 
6904_262291_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 You think real ladies wait until the sun has been up a few hours and warmed the earth for them 
none	none	Y es said Caroline 
6904_262291_000015_000001	train-clean-360	But it was not spoken very readily for she had a suspicion that Miss Channing was laughing at her 
none	none	May I ask where you have acquired your notions of real ladies Caroline Caroline pouted
6904_262291_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t you call Colonel Jolliffe s daughters ladies Miss Channing 
6904_262291_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes in position 
6904_262291_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 That s where we went yesterday you know 
6904_262291_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Mary Jolliffe says she never gets up until half past eight and that it is not lady like to get up earlier 
6904_262291_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Real ladies don t Miss Channing 
6904_262291_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear shall I relate to you an anecdote that I have heard 
6904_262291_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes replied Caroline her listless mood changing to animation anecdotes or anything of that desultory kind being far more acceptable to the young lady than lessons 
6904_262291_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Before I begin will you tell me whether you condescend to admit that our good Queen is a real lady 
6904_262291_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Miss Channing now you are laughing at me 
6904_262291_000023_000001	train-clean-360	As if any one in all England could be so great a lady as the Queen 
none	none	Very good 
6904_262291_000024_000001	train-clean-360	When she was a little girl a child of her own age the daughter of one of the nobility was brought to Kensington Palace to spend the day with her 
6904_262291_000024_000002	train-clean-360	In talking together the Princess Victoria mentioned something she had seen when out of doors that morning at seven o clock 
6904_262291_000024_000003	train-clean-360	 At seven o clock exclaimed the young visitor how early that is to be abroad 
6904_262291_000024_000004	train-clean-360	I never get out of bed until eight 
none	none	Is there any use in rising so early The Duchess of Kent who was present took up the answer My daughter may be called to fill the throne of England when she shall be grown up therefore it is especially necessary that she should learn the full value of time You see Caroline the princess was not allowed to waste her mornings in bed although she was destined to be the first lady in the land 
6904_262291_000024_000006	train-clean-360	We may be thankful to her admirable mother for making her in that as in many other things a pattern to us 
6904_262291_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it a true anecdote Miss Channing 
6904_262291_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 It was related to my mother many years ago by a lady who was at that time very much at Kensington Palace 
6904_262291_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I think there is little doubt of its truth 
6904_262291_000026_000002	train-clean-360	One fact we all know Caroline the Queen retains her early habits and implants them in her children 
6904_262291_000026_000003	train-clean-360	What do you suppose would be her Majesty s surprise were one of her daughters say the Princess Helena or the Princess Louise to decline to rise early for their morning studies with their governess Miss Hildyard on the plea that it was not lady like 
6904_262291_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Caroline s objection appeared to be melting away under her 
6904_262291_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 But it is a dreadful plague she grumbled to be obliged to get up from one s nice warm bed for the sake of some horrid old lessons 
none	none	You spoke of the poor those who have their living to earn as the only class who need rise early resumed Constance
6904_262291_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Put that notion away from you at once and for ever Caroline there cannot be a more false one 
6904_262291_000028_000002	train-clean-360	The higher we go in the scale of life the more onerous become our duties in this world and the greater is our responsibility to God 
6904_262291_000028_000003	train-clean-360	He to whom five talents were intrusted did not make them other five by wasting his days in idleness 
none	none	Oh Caroline Fanny come closer and listen to me your time and opportunities for good must be used not abused or wasted I will try and get up said Caroline repentantly
6904_262291_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish mamma had trained me to it when I was a child as the Duchess of Kent trained the princess 
6904_262291_000029_000002	train-clean-360	I might have learned to like it by this time 
6904_262291_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Long before this said Constance 
6904_262291_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you remember the good old saying Do what you ought that you may do what you like 
6904_262291_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Habit is second nature 
6904_262291_000030_000003	train-clean-360	Were I told that I might lie in bed every morning until nine or ten o clock as a great favour I should consider it a great punishment 
6904_262291_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 But I have not been trained to get up Miss Channing and it is nothing short of punishment to me to do so 
6904_262291_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 The punishment of self denial we all have to bear Caroline 
6904_262291_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But I can tell you what will take away half its sting 
6904_262291_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 What asked Caroline eagerly 
6904_262291_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Constance bent towards her 
6904_262291_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 Jesus Christ said If any will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me When once we learn HOW to take it up cheerfully bravely for His sake looking to Him to be helped the sting is gone 
6904_262291_000034_000002	train-clean-360	 No cross no crown you know my children 
6904_262291_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 No cross no crown Constance had sufficient cross to carry just then 
6904_262291_000035_000001	train-clean-360	In the course of the morning Lady Augusta came into the room boisterously her manner indicative of great surprise 
none	none	Miss Channing what is this tale about your brother s having been arrested for stealing that missing bank note 
6904_262291_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Some visitors have just called in upon me and they say the town is ringing with the news 
6904_262291_000037_000000	train-clean-360	It was one of the first of Constance Channing s bitter pills they were to be her portion for many a day 
6904_262291_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Her heart fluttered her cheek varied and her answer to Lady Augusta Yorke was low and timid 
6904_262291_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 It is true that he was arrested yesterday on suspicion 
6904_262291_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 What a shocking thing 
6904_262291_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Is he in prison 
none	none	Oh no
6904_262291_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Did he take the note 
6904_262291_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The question pained Constance worse than all 
6904_262291_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 He did not take it she replied in a clear soft tone 
6904_262291_000042_000002	train-clean-360	 To those who know Arthur well it would be impossible to think so 
6904_262291_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 But he was before the magistrates yesterday I hear and is going up again to day 
6904_262291_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes that is so 
6904_262291_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 And Roland could not open his lips to tell me of this when I came home last night grumbled my lady 
6904_262291_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 We were late and he was the only one up Gerald and Tod were in bed 
6904_262291_000045_000002	train-clean-360	I shall ask him why he did not 
6904_262291_000045_000003	train-clean-360	But Miss Channing this must be a dreadful blow for you all 
6904_262291_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 It would be far worse Lady Augusta if we believed him guilty she replied from her aching heart 
none	none	Oh dear I hope he is not guilty continued my lady displaying as little delicacy of feeling as she could well do
6904_262291_000047_000002	train-clean-360	 It would be quite a dangerous thing you know for my Roland to be in the same office 
6904_262291_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Be at ease Lady Augusta returned Constance with a tinge of irony she could not wholly suppress 
6904_262291_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 Your son will incur no harm from the companionship of Arthur 
6904_262291_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 What does Hamish say handsome Hamish 
6904_262291_000049_000001	train-clean-360	He does not deserve that such a blow should come to him 
6904_262291_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Constance felt her colour deepen 
6904_262291_000050_000001	train-clean-360	She bent her face over the exercise she was correcting 
6904_262291_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Is he likely to be cleared of the charge perseveringly resumed Lady Augusta 
6904_262291_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Not by actual proof I fear answered Constance pressing her hand upon her brow as she remembered that he could only be proved innocent by another s being proved guilty 
6904_262291_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 The note seems to have been lost in so very mysterious a manner that positive proof of his innocence will be difficult 
6904_262291_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Well it is a dreadful thing concluded Lady Augusta 
6904_262291_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile at the very moment her ladyship was speaking the magistrates were in the town hall in full conclave the case before them 
6904_262291_000054_000001	train-clean-360	The news had spread had excited interest far and wide the bench was crowded and the court was one dense sea of heads 
6904_262291_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Arthur appeared escorted by his brother Hamish and by Roland Yorke Roland was in high feather throwing his haughty glances everywhere for he had an inkling of what was to be the termination of the affair and did not conceal his triumph 
6904_262291_000055_000001	train-clean-360	mister Galloway also was of their party 
6904_262291_000056_000000	train-clean-360	mister Galloway was the first witness put forth by mister Butterby 
6904_262291_000056_000001	train-clean-360	The latter gentleman was in high feather also believing he saw his way clear to a triumphant conviction 
6904_262291_000056_000002	train-clean-360	mister Galloway was questioned and for some minutes it all went on swimmingly 
6904_262291_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 On the afternoon of the loss before you closed your letter who were in your office 
6904_262291_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 My clerks Roland Yorke and Arthur Channing 
6904_262291_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 They saw the letter I believe 
none	none	They did
6904_262291_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 And the bank note 
none	none	Most probably
6904_262291_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 It was the prisoner Arthur Channing who fetched the bank note from your private room to the other 
6904_262291_000063_000001	train-clean-360	Did he see you put it into the letter 
6904_262291_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 I cannot say 
6904_262291_000065_000000	train-clean-360	A halt 
6904_262291_000065_000001	train-clean-360	 But he was in full possession of his eyes just then 
6904_262291_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 No doubt he was 
6904_262291_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Then what should hinder his seeing you put the note into the letter 
6904_262291_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 I will not swear that I put the note into the letter 
6904_262291_000073_000002	train-clean-360	I will not swear that I put the note into the letter 
6904_262291_000069_000000	train-clean-360	The magistrates pricked up their ears 
6904_262291_000069_000001	train-clean-360	mister Butterby pricked up his and looked at the witness 
none	none	What do you say
6904_262291_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 I will not swear that I put the bank note inside the letter deliberately repeated mister Galloway 
6904_262291_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Not swear that you put the bank note into the letter 
6904_262291_000072_000001	train-clean-360	What is it that you mean 
6904_262291_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 The meaning is plain enough replied mister Galloway calmly 
6904_262291_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 Must I repeat it for the third time 
none	none	I will not swear that I put the note into the letter But your instructions to me were that you did put the note into the letter cried mister Butterby interrupting the examination
6904_262291_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 I will not swear it reiterated the witness 
none	none	Then there s an end of the case exclaimed the magistrates clerk in some choler What on earth was the time of the bench taken up for in bringing it here And there was an end of the case at any rate for the present for nothing more satisfactory could be got out of mister Galloway
6904_262291_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 I have been checkmated ejaculated the angry Butterby 
none	none	They walked back arm in arm to mister Galloway s Roland and Arthur Hamish went the other way to his own office and mister Galloway lingered somewhere behind Jenkins truehearted Jenkins in the black handkerchief still was doubly respectful to Arthur and rose to welcome him a faint hectic of pleasure illumining his face at the termination of the charge
6904_262291_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Who said our office was going to be put down for a thief s uttered Roland 
6904_262291_000080_000001	train-clean-360	 Old Galloway s a trump 
6904_262291_000080_000002	train-clean-360	Here s your place Arthur 
6904_262291_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Arthur did not take it 
6904_262291_000081_000001	train-clean-360	He had seen from the window the approach of mister Galloway and delicacy prevented his assuming his old post until bade to do so 
6904_262291_000081_000002	train-clean-360	mister Galloway came in and motioned him into his own room 
6904_262291_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Arthur Channing he said I have acted leniently in this unpleasant matter for your father s sake but from my very heart I believe you to be guilty 
6904_262291_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 I thank you sir Arthur said for that and all other kindness 
6904_262291_000083_000001	train-clean-360	I am not as guilty as you think me 
6904_262291_000083_000002	train-clean-360	Do you wish me to leave 
6904_262291_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 If you can give me no better assurance of your innocence if you can give me no explanation of the peculiar and most unsatisfactory manner in which you have met the charge yes 
none	none	To retain you here would be unjust to my own interests and unfair as regards Jenkins and Roland Yorke 
6904_262291_000085_000000	train-clean-360	To give this explanation was impossible neither dared Arthur assert more emphatically his innocence 
6904_262291_000085_000001	train-clean-360	Once convince mister Galloway that he was not the guilty party and that gentleman would forthwith issue fresh instructions to Butterby for the further investigation of the affair of this Arthur felt convinced 
6904_262291_000085_000002	train-clean-360	He could only be silent and remain under the stigma 
6904_262291_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I had better you would wish me perhaps to go at once hesitated Arthur 
6904_262291_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes shortly replied mister Galloway 
6904_262291_000088_000000	train-clean-360	He spoke a word of farewell which mister Galloway replied to by a nod and went into the front office 
6904_262291_000088_000001	train-clean-360	There he began to collect together certain trifles that belonged to him 
6904_262291_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that for asked Roland Yorke 
none	none	I am going he replied
6904_262291_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Going roared Roland jumping to his feet and dashing down his pen full of ink with little regard to the deed he was copying 
6904_262291_000091_000001	train-clean-360	 Galloway has never turned you off 
6904_262291_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes he has 
6904_262291_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I ll go too thundered Roland who truth to say had flown into an uncontrollable passion startling Jenkins and arousing mister Galloway I ll not stop in a place where that sort of injustice goes on 
6904_262291_000093_000001	train-clean-360	He ll be turning me out next 
6904_262291_000093_000002	train-clean-360	Catch me stopping for it 
6904_262291_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you taken crazy mister Roland Yorke 
6904_262291_000095_000000	train-clean-360	The question proceeded from his master who came forth to make it Roland turned to him his temper unsubdued and his colour rising 
6904_262291_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Channing never took the money sir 
6904_262291_000096_000001	train-clean-360	It is not just to turn him away 
6904_262291_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you help him to take it pray that you identify yourself with the affair so persistently and violently demanded mister Galloway in a cynical tone 
6904_262291_000097_000001	train-clean-360	And Roland answered with a hot and haughty word 
6904_262291_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 If you cannot attend to your business a little better you will get your dismissal from me you won t require to dismiss yourself said mister Galloway 
6904_262291_000098_000001	train-clean-360	 Sit down sir and go on with your work 
6904_262291_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 And that s all the thanks a fellow gets for taking up a cause of oppression muttered mister Roland Yorke as he sullenly resumed his place at the desk 
none	none	This is a precious world to live in CHAPTER XXVII A PIECE OF PREFERMENT Before the nine days wonder which you know is said to be the accompaniment of all marvels had died away Helstonleigh was fated to be astonished by another piece of news of a different nature the preferment of the Reverend William Yorke A different preferment from what had been anticipated for him otherwise the news had been nothing extraordinary for it is usual for the Dean and Chapter to provide livings for their minor canons In a fine open part of the town was a cluster of buildings called Hazeldon s Charity so named from its founder Sir Thomas Hazeldon a large paved inclosure fenced in by iron railings and a pair of iron gates A chapel stood in the midst On either side right and left ran sixteen almshouses and at the end opposite to the iron gates stood the dwelling of the chaplain to the charity a fine residence called Hazeldon House This preferment worth three hundred a year had been for some weeks vacant the chaplain having died It was in the gift of the present baronet Sir Frederick Hazeldon a descendant of the founder and he now suddenly conferred it upon the reverend William Yorke It took Helstonleigh by surprise It took mister Yorke himself entirely by surprise He possessed no interest whatever with Sir Frederick and had never cast a thought to the probability of its becoming his Perhaps Sir Frederick s motive for bestowing it upon him was this that of all the clergy in the neighbourhood looking out for something good to fall to them mister Yorke had been almost the only one who had not solicited it of Sir Frederick It was none the less welcome It would not interfere in the least with the duties or preferment of his minor canonry a minor canon had once before held it In short it was one of those slices of luck which do sometimes come unexpectedly in this world In the soft light of the summer evening Constance Channing stood under the cedar tree A fine old tree was that the pride of the Channings garden The sun was setting in all its beauty clouds of crimson and purple floated on the horizon a roseate hue tinged the atmosphere and lighted with its own loveliness the sweet face of Constance It was an evening that seemed to speak peace to the soul so would it have spoken to that of Constance but for the ever present trouble which had fallen there Another trouble was falling upon her or seemed to be one that more immediately concerned herself Since the disgrace had come to Arthur mister Yorke had been less frequent in his visits Some days had now elapsed from the time of Arthur s dismissal from mister Galloway s and mister Yorke had called only once This might have arisen from accidental circumstances but Constance felt a different fear in her heart Hark that is his ring at the hall bell Constance has not listened for and loved that ring so long to be mistaken now Another minute and she hears those footsteps approaching warming her life blood quickening her pulses her face deepens to crimson as she turns it towards him She knows nothing yet of his appointment to the Hazeldon chaplaincy mister Yorke has not known it himself two hours He came up and laid his hands upon her shoulders playfully looking down at her What will you give me for some news by way of greeting Constance News she answered raising her eyes to his and scarcely knowing what she did say in the confusion of meeting him in her all conscious love Is it good or bad news Helstonleigh will not call it good I expect There are those upon whom it will fall as a thunder clap Tell it me William I cannot guess she said somewhat wearily I suppose it does not concern me But it does concern you indirectly Poor Constance timorous and full of dread since this grief had fallen was too apt to connect everything with that one source We have done the same in our lives all of us when under the consciousness of some secret terror She appeared to be living upon a mine which might explode any hour and bring down Hamish in its debris The words bore an ominous sound and foolish as it may appear to us who know the nature of mister Yorke s news Constance fell into something very like terror and turned white Does does it concern Arthur she uttered No Constance changing his tone and dropping his hands as he gazed at her why should you be so terrified for Arthur You have been a changed girl since that happened shrinking timid starting at every sound unable to look people in the face Why so if he is innocent She shivered inwardly as was perceptible to the eyes of mister Yorke Tell me the news she answered in a low tone if as you say it concerns me I hope it will concern you Constance At any rate it concerns me The news he gravely added is that I am appointed to the Hazeldon chaplaincy Oh William The sudden revulsion of feeling from intense undefined terror to joyful surprise was too much to bear calmly Her emotion overpowered her and she burst into tears mister Yorke compelled her to sit down on the bench and stood over her his arm on her shoulder her hand clasped in his Constance what is the cause of this he asked when her emotion had passed She avoided the question She dried her tears and schooled her face to smiles and tried to look as unconscious as she might Is it really true that you have the chaplaincy she questioned I received my appointment this evening Why Sir Frederick should have conferred it upon me I am unable to say I feel all the more obliged to him for its being unexpected Shall you like the house Constance The rosy hue stole over her face again and a happy smile parted her lips I once said to mamma when we had been spending the evening there that I should like to live at Hazeldon House I like its rooms and its situation I shall like to be busy among all those poor old people but when I said it William I had not the slightest idea that the chance would ever be mine You have only to determine now how soon the chance shall become certainty he said I must take up my residence there within a month and I do not care how soon my wife takes up hers after that The rose grew deeper She bent her brow down upon her hand and his hiding her face It could not possibly be William What could not be So soon Papa and mamma are going to Germany you know and I must keep house here Besides what would Lady Augusta say at my leaving her situation almost as soon as I have entered upon it Lady Augusta mister Yorke was beginning impulsively but checked himself Constance lifted her face and looked at him His brow was knit and a stern expression had settled on it What is it William I want to know what caused your grief just now was his abrupt rejoinder And what is it that has made you appear so strange of late The words fell on her as an ice bolt For a few brief moments she had forgotten her fears had revelled in the sunshine of the happiness so suddenly laid out before her Back came the gloom the humiliation the terror Had Arthur been guilty of the charge laid to him and you were cognizant of it I could fancy that your manner would be precisely what it is answered mister Yorke Her heart beat wildly He spoke in a reserved haughty tone and she felt a foreboding that some unpleasant explanation was at hand She felt more that perhaps she ought not to become his wife with this cloud hanging over them She nerved herself to say what she deemed she ought to say William she began perhaps you would wish that our marriage should be delayed until until I mean now that this suspicion has fallen upon Arthur She could scarcely utter the words coherently so great was her agitation mister Yorke saw how white and trembling were her lips I cannot believe Arthur guilty was his reply She remembered that Hamish was though Arthur was not and in point of disgrace it amounted to the same thing Constance passed her hand over her perplexed brow He is looked upon as guilty by many that we unfortunately know and it may not be thought well that you should under the circumstance make me your wife You may not think so mister Yorke made no reply He may have been deliberating the question Let us put it in this light William she resumed her tone one of intense pain Suppose for argument s sake that Arthur were guilty would you marry me all the same It is a hard question Constance he said after a pause It must be answered Were Arthur guilty and you cognizant of it screening him I should lose half my confidence in you Constance That was the knell Her heart and her eyes alike fell and she knew in that one moment that all hope of marrying William Yorke was at an end You think that were he guilty I am speaking only for argument s sake she breathed in her emotion you think were I cognizant of it I ought to betray him to make it known to the world I do not say that Constance No But you are my affianced wife and whatever cognizance of the matter you might possess whatever might be the mystery attending it and a mystery I believe there is you should repose the confidence and the mystery in me That you might decide whether or not I am worthy to be your wife she exclaimed a flash of indignation lighting up her spirit To doubt her She felt it keenly Oh that she could have told him the truth But this she dare not for Hamish s sake He took her hand in his and gazed searchingly into her face Constance you know what you are to me This unhappy business has been as great a trial to me as to you Can you deny to me all knowledge of its mystery its guilt I ask not whether Arthur be innocent or guilty I ask whether you are innocent of everything in the way of concealment Can you stand before me and assure me in all truth that you are so She could not I believe in Arthur s innocence she replied in a low tone So did mister Yorke or he might not have rejoined as he did I believe also in his innocence he said Otherwise You would not make me your wife Speak it without hesitation William Well I cannot tell what my course would be Perhaps I would not A silence Constance was feeling the avowal in all its bitter humiliation It seemed to humiliate her No no it would not be right of him to make me his wife now she reflected Hamish s disgrace may come out any day he may still be brought to trial for it His wife s brother and he attached to the cathedral No it would never do William she said aloud we must part Part echoed mister Yorke as the words issued faintly from her trembling lips Tears rose to her eyes it was with difficulty she kept them from falling I cannot become your wife while this cloud overhangs Arthur It would not be right You say you believe in his innocence was the reply of mister Yorke I do But the world does not William she continued placing her hand in his while the tears rained freely down her face let us say farewell now He drew her closer to him Explain this mystery Constance Why are you not open with me What has come between us I cannot explain she sobbed There is nothing for us but to part We will not part Why should we when you say Arthur is innocent and I believe him to be so Constance my darling what is this grief What were the words but a tacit admission that if Arthur were not innocent they should part Constance so interpreted them Had any additional weight been needed to strengthen her resolution this would have supplied it Farewell farewell William To remain with you is only prolonging the pain of parting That her resolution to part was firm he saw It was his turn to be angry now A slight touch of the haughty Yorke temper was in him and there were times when it peeped out He folded his arms and the flush left his countenance I cannot understand you Constance I cannot fathom your motive or why you are doing this unless it be that you never cared for me I have cared for you as I never cared for any one as I shall never care for another To part with you will be like parting with life Then why speak of it Be my wife Constance be my wife No it might bring you disgrace she hysterically answered and that you shall never encounter through me Do not keep me William my resolution is irrevocable Sobbing as though her heart would break she turned from him mister Yorke followed her indoors In the hall stood missus Channing Constance turned aside anywhere to hide her face from her mother s eye missus Channing did not particularly observe her and turned to accost mister Yorke An angry frown was on his brow an angry weight on his spirit Constance s words and course of action had now fully impressed him with the belief that Arthur was guilty that she knew him to be so and the proud Yorke blood within him whispered that it was well so to part But he had loved her with a deep and enduring love and his heart ached bitterly Will you come in and lend us your help in the discussion missus Channing said to him with a smile We are carving out the plan for our journey He bowed and followed her into the sitting room He did not speak of what had just occurred leaving that to Constance if she should choose to give an explanation It was not mister Yorke s place to say Constance has given me up She has impressed me with the conviction that Arthur is guilty and she says she will not bring disgrace upon me No certainly he could not tell them that mister Channing lay as usual on his sofa Hamish near him Gay Hamish who was looking as light faced as ever undoubtedly he seemed as light hearted Hamish had a book before him a map and a pencil He was tracing out the route for his father and mother joking always After much anxious consideration mister Channing had determined to proceed at once to Germany It is true that he could not well afford to do so and before he heard from doctor Lamb the very insignificant cost it would prove he had always put it from him as wholly impracticable at present But the information given him by the doctor altered his views and he began to think it not only practicable but feasible His children were giving much help now to meet home expenses Constance in going to Lady Augusta s Arthur to the Cathedral doctor Lamb strongly urged his going and mister Channing himself knew that if he could only come home restored to health and to activity the journey instead of being an expense would in point of fact prove an economy With much deliberation with much prayer to be helped to a right decision mister Channing at length decided to go It was necessary to start at once for the season was already advanced indeed as doctor Lamb observed he ought to have been away a month ago Then all became bustle and preparation Two or three days were wasted in the unhappy business concerning Arthur But all the grieving over that all the staying at home for it could do no good mister Channing was fain to see this and the preparations were hastened Hamish was most active in all in urging the departure in helping to pack in carving out their route but always joking Now mind mother as you are to be commander in chief it is the Antwerp packet you are to take he was saying in a serio comic dictatorial manner Don t get seduced on to any indiscriminate steamer or you may find yourselves carried off to some unknown regions inhabited by cannibals and never be heard of again The Antwerp steamer and it starts from saint Katherine s Docks if you have the pleasure of knowing that enchanting part of London I made acquaintance with it in a fog in that sight seeing visit I paid to town and its beauty I must confess did not impress me From saint Katherine s Docks you will reach Antwerp in about eighteen hours always provided the ship does not go to pieces Hamish Well I won t anticipate I dare say it is well caulked At any rate take an insurance ticket against accident and then you ll be all right An Irishman slept at the top of a very high hotel Are you not afraid to sleep up there in case of fire a friend asked him By the powers no said he they tell me the house is insured Now mother mine Shall we have to stay in Antwerp Hamish interrupted mister Channing Yes as you return sir an answer that you will think emanated from our Irish friend No one ever yet went to Antwerp without giving the fine old town a few hours inspection I only wish the chance were offered me Now on your way there you will not be able to get about but as you return you will if all the good has been done you that I anticipate Do not be too sanguine Hamish My dear father and Hamish s tone assumed a deeper feeling to be sanguine was implanted in my nature at my birth but in this case I am more than sanguine You will be cured depend upon it When you return in three months time I shall not have a fly waiting for you at the station here or if I do it will be for the mother s exclusive use and benefit I shall parade you through the town on my arm showing your renewed strength of leg and limb to the delighted eyes of Helstonleigh Why are you so silent missus Channing inquired of William Yorke She had suddenly noticed that he had scarcely said a word had sat in a fit of abstraction since his entrance Silent Oh Hamish is talking for all of us he answered starting from his reverie The ingratitude of some people ejaculated Hamish Is he saying that in a spirit of complaint now mister Yorke I am astonished at you At this moment Tom was heard to enter the house That it could be no one but Tom was certain by the noise and commotion that arose the others were quieter except Annabel and she was a girl Tom came in tongue hands and feet all going together What luck is it not mister Yorke I am so glad it has been given to you mister Channing looked up in surprise Tom you will never learn manners What has been given Has he not told you exclaimed Tom ignoring the reproof to his manners He is appointed to Hazeldon Chapel Where s Constance I ll be bound he has told her Saucy Tom They received his news in silence looking to mister Yorke for explanation He rose from his chair and his cheek slightly flushed as he confirmed the tidings Does Constance know it inquired missus Channing speaking in the moment s impulse Yes was mister Yorke s short answer And then he said something not very coherently about having an engagement and took his leave wishing mister Channing every benefit from his journey But we do not go until the day after to morrow objected mister Channing We shall see you before that Another unsatisfactory sentence from mister Yorke that he was not sure In shaking hands with missus Channing he bent down with a whisper I think Constance has something to say to you missus Channing found her in her room in a sad state of distress Child what is this she uttered Oh mother mother it is all at an end and we have parted for ever was poor Constance s wailing answer And missus Channing feeling quite sick with the various troubles that seemed to be coming upon her inquired why it was at an end He feels that the disgrace which has fallen upon us would be reflected upon him were he to make me his wife Mother there is no help for it it would disgrace him But where there is no real guilt there can be no real disgrace objected missus Channing I am firmly persuaded however mysterious and unsatisfactory things may appear that Arthur is not guilty and that time will prove him so Constance could only shiver and sob Knowing what she knew she could entertain no hope Poor child poor child murmured missus Channing her own tears dropping upon the fair young face as she gathered it to her sheltering bosom What have you done that this blight should extend to you Teach me to bear it mother It must be God s will And Constance Channing lay in her resting place and there sobbed out her heart s grief as she had done in her early girlhood CHAPTER XXVIII AN APPEAL TO THE DEAN The first sharpness of the edge worn off Arthur Channing partially recovered his cheerfulness The French have a proverb which is familiar to us all Ce n est que le premier pas qui coute There is a great deal of truth in it as experience teaches us and as Arthur found Of what use my dependence upon God Arthur also reasoned with himself ten times a day if it does not serve to bear me up in this my first trouble As well have been brought up next door to a heathen Let me do the best I can under it and go my way as if it had not happened trusting all to God A good resolution and one that none could have made and kept unless he had learnt that trust which is the surest beacon light we can possess in the world Hour after hour day after day did that trust grow in Arthur Channing s heart He felt a sure conviction that God would bring his innocence to light in His own good time and that time he was content to wait for Not at the expense of Hamish In his brotherly love for Hamish which this transaction had been unable to dispel he would have shielded his reputation at any sacrifice to himself He had grown to excuse Hamish far more than he could ever have excused himself had he been guilty of it He constantly hoped that the sin might never be brought home to Hamish even by the remotest suspicion He hoped that he would never fall again Hamish was now so kind to Arthur gentle in manner thoughtfully considerate anxious to spare him He had taken to profess his full belief in Arthur s innocence not as loudly perhaps but quite as urgently as did Roland Yorke He would prove my innocence and take the guilt to himself but that it would bring ruin to my father fondly soliloquised Arthur Arthur Channing s most earnest desire for the present was to obtain some employment His weekly salary at mister Galloway s had been very trifling but still it was so much loss He had gone to mister Galloway s not so much to be of help to that gentleman who really did not require a third clerk as to get his hand into the routine of the office preparatory to being articled Hence his weekly pay had been almost a nominal sum Small though it was he was anxious to replace it and he sought to hear of something in the town As yet without success Persons were not willing to engage one on whom a doubt rested and a very great doubt in the opinion of the town did rest upon Arthur The manner in which the case had terminated by mister Galloway s refusing to swear he put the bank note into the envelope when it was known that mister Galloway had put it in and that mister Galloway himself knew that he had done so told more against Arthur than the actual charge had done It was not you see establishing Arthur s innocence on the contrary it rather tended to imply his guilt If I go on with this he will be convicted therefore I will withdraw it for his father s sake was the motive the town imputed to mister Galloway His summary dismissal also from the office was urged against him Altogether Arthur did not stand well with Helstonleigh and fresh employment did not readily show itself This was of little moment comparatively speaking while his post in the Cathedral was not endangered But that was to come On the day before the departure of mister and missus Channing Arthur was seated at the organ at afternoon service playing the anthem when mister Williams came up Arthur saw him with surprise It was not the day for practising the choristers therefore what could he want A feeling of dread that it might mean ill to him came over Arthur A feeling all too surely borne out Channing mister Williams began scarcely giving himself time to wait until service was over and the congregation were leaving the dean has been talking to me about this bother What is to be done The life blood at his heart seemed to stand still and then go on again His place there was about to be taken from him he knew it Must he become an idle useless burden upon them at home He met me this morning in High Street and stopped me continued mister Williams He considers that if you were guilty of the theft you ought not to be allowed to retain your place here I told him you were not guilty that I felt thoroughly convinced of it but he listened coldly The dean is a stern man and I have always said it He is a good man and only stern in the cause of injustice replied Arthur who was himself too just to allow blame to rest where it was not due even though it were to defend himself Did he give orders for my dismissal He has not done so yet I said that when a man was wrongly accused it ought not to be a plea for all the world s trampling him down He answered pretty warmly that of course it ought not but that if appearances might be trusted you were not wrongly accused Arthur sat scoring some music with his pencil Never had he felt that appearances were against him more plainly than he felt it then I thought I would step down and tell you this Channing mister Williams observed I shall not dismiss you you may be sure of that but if the dean puts forth his veto I cannot help myself He is master of the Cathedral not I I cannot think what possesses the people to doubt you They never would if they had ten grains of sense The organist concluded his words as he hurried down the stairs he was always much pressed for time Arthur a cold weight lying at his heart put the music together and departed He traversed the nave crossed the body and descended the steps to the cloisters As he was passing the Chapter House the doors opened and doctor Gardner came out in his surplice and trencher He closed the doors after him but not before Arthur had seen the dean seated alone at the table a large folio before him Both of them had just left the Cathedral Arthur raised his hat to the canon who acknowledged it but Arthur thought very coldly To a sore mind fancy is ever active A thought flashed over Arthur that he would go there and then and speak to the dean Acting upon the moment s impulse without premeditation as to what he should say he turned back and laid his hand upon the door handle A passing tremor as to the result arose within him but he had learned where help in need is ever to be obtained and an earnestly breathed word went up then The dean looked round saw that it was Arthur Channing rose from his seat and awaited his approach Will you pardon my intruding upon you here mister Dean he began in his gentle courteous manner and with the urgency of the occasion all his energy seemed to come to him Timidity and tremor vanished and he stood before the dean a true gentleman and a fearless one The dean still wore his surplice and his trencher lay on the table near him Arthur placed his own hat by its side mister Williams has just informed me that you cast a doubt as to the propriety of my still taking the organ he added True said the dean It is not fitting that one upon whom so heavy an imputation lies should be allowed to continue his duty in this Cathedral But sir if that imputation be a mistaken one How are we to know that it is a mistaken one demanded the dean Arthur paused Sir will you take my word for it I am incapable of telling a lie I have come to you to defend my own cause and yet I can only do it by my bare word of assertion You are not a stranger to the circumstances of my family mister Dean and I honestly avow that if this post is taken from me it will be felt as a serious loss I have lost what little I had from mister Galloway I trust I shall not lose this You know Channing that I should be the last to do an unjust thing you also may be aware that I respect your family very much was the dean s reply But this crime which has been laid to your charge is a heavy one If you were guilty of it it cannot be overlooked I was not guilty of it Arthur impressively said his tone full of emotion mister Dean believe me When I shall come to answer to my Maker for my actions upon earth I cannot then speak with more earnest truth than I now speak to you I am entirely innocent of the charge I did not touch the money I did not know that the money was lost until mister Galloway announced it to me some days afterwards The dean gazed at Arthur as he stood before him at his tall form noble even in its youthfulness his fine ingenuous countenance his earnest eye it was impossible to associate such with the brand of guilt and the dean s suspicious doubts melted away If ever uprightness was depicted unmistakably in a human countenance it shone out then from Arthur Channing s But there appears then to be some mystery attaching to the loss to the proceedings altogether debated the dean No doubt there may be no doubt there is was the reply of Arthur Sir he impulsively added will you stand my friend so far as to grant me a favour The dean wondered what was coming Although I have thus asserted my innocence to you and it is the solemn truth there are reasons why I do not wish to speak out so unequivocally to others Will you kindly regard this interview as a confidential one not speaking of its purport even to mister Galloway But why asked the dean I cannot explain I can only throw myself upon your kindness mister Dean to grant the request Indeed he added his face flushing my motive is an urgent one The interview was not of my seeking so you may have your favour said the dean kindly But I cannot see why you should not publicly assert it if as you say you are innocent Indeed I am innocent repeated Arthur Should one ray of light ever be thrown upon the affair you will see mister Dean that I have spoken truth I will accept it as truth said the dean You may continue to take the organ I knew God would be with me in the interview thought Arthur as he thanked the dean and left the Chapter House He did not go home immediately He had a commission to execute in the town and went to do it It took him about an hour which brought it to five o clock In returning through the Boundaries he encountered Roland Yorke just released from that bane of his life the office for the day Arthur told him how near he had been to losing the Cathedral By Jove uttered Roland flying into one of his indignant fits A nice dean he is He d deserve to lose his own place if he had done it Well the danger is over for the present I say Yorke does Galloway talk much about it Not he answered Roland He s as sullen and crabbed as any old bear I often say to Jenkins that he is in a temper with himself for having sent you away and I don t care if he hears me There s an awful amount to do since you went I and Jenkins are worked to death And there ll be the busiest time of all the year coming on soon with the autumn rents and leases I shan t stop long in it I know Smiling at Roland s account of being worked to death for he knew how much the assertion was worth Arthur continued his way Roland continued his and on entering his own house met Constance Channing leaving it He exchanged a few words of chatter with her though it struck him that she looked unusually sad and then found his way to the presence of his mother What an uncommonly pretty girl that Constance Channing is quoth he in his free unceremonious fashion I wonder she condescends to come here to teach the girls I think I shall dismiss her Roland said Lady Augusta I expect she ll dismiss herself ma am without waiting for you to do it now William Yorke has found bread and cheese and a house to live in returned Roland throwing himself at full length on a sofa Then you expect wrong answered Lady Augusta If Miss Channing leaves it will be by my dismissal And I am not sure but I shall do it she added nodding her head What for asked Roland lazily It is not pleasant to retain as instructress to my children one whose brother is a thief Roland tumbled off the sofa and rose up with a great cry a cry of passionate anger of aroused indignation What he thundered Good gracious are you going mad uttered my lady What is Arthur Channing to you that you should take up his cause in this startling way upon every possible occasion He is this to me that he has nobody else to stand up for him stuttered Roland so excited as to impede his utterance We were both in the same office and the shameful charge might have been cast upon me as it was cast upon him It was mere chance Channing is as innocent of it as you mother he is as innocent as that precious dean who has been wondering whether he shall dismiss him from the Cathedral A charitable lot you all are I m sure I don t want to be uncharitable cried Lady Augusta whose heart was kind enough in the main And I am sure the dean never was uncharitable in his life he is too good and enlightened a man to be uncharitable Half the town says he must be guilty and what is one to think Then you would not recommend me to let it make any difference to Miss Channing s coming here No burst forth Roland in a tone that might have brought down the roof had it been made of glass I d scorn such wicked injustice If I were you I d scorn to put myself into these fiery tempers upon other people s business cried my lady It is my business retorted Roland Better go into tempers than be hard and unjust What would William Yorke say at your speaking so of Miss Channing Lady Augusta smiled It was hearing what William Yorke had done that almost decided me He has broken off his engagement with Miss Channing And he has done well Roland It is not meet that he should take his wife from a disgraced family I have been telling him so ever since it happened Roland stood before her as if unable to digest the news his mouth open his eyes staring It is not true he shrieked Indeed it is perfectly true I gathered a suspicion of it from William Yorke s manner to day and I put the question plainly to Miss Channing herself Had they parted in consequence of this business of Arthur s She acknowledged that it was so Roland turned white with honest anger He dashed his hair from his brow and with an ugly word he dashed down the stairs four at a time and flung out of the house probably with the intention of having a little personal explosion with the Reverend William Yorke CHAPTER XXIX A TASTE OF TAN The cloisters of Helstonleigh were echoing with the sounds of a loud dispute according as little with their sacred character as with the fair beauty of the summer s afternoon The excitement caused in the college school by the rumour of Lady Augusta Yorke s having obtained the promise of the head master that her son should be promoted to the seniorship over the heads of Channing and Huntley had been smouldering ominously and gathering greater strength from the very fact that the boys appeared to be powerless in it Powerless they were in spite of Tom Channing s boast at the dinner table that the school would not stand it tamely and his meaning nod when Hamish had mockingly inquired whether the school intended to send Lady Augusta a challenge or to recommend mister Pye to the surveillance of the dean In the first flow of their indignation the boys freely ringing the changes of rebellion had avowed to one another that they would acquaint the dean with the head master s favouritism and request his interference as too many of us do when things happen that annoy us We are only too prone to speak out our mind and to proclaim what our remedy or revenge shall be But when our anger has subsided and we see things in their true light we find that those boasts were only loud talking and cannot be acted upon Thus it was with the Helstonleigh college boys They had hurled forth indignation at the master had pretty nearly conned over the very words in which they should make known their grievance to the dean but when the practical part came to be considered their courage oozed out at their fingers ends The mice you remember passed a resolution in solemn conclave that their enemy the old cat should be belled an excellent precaution and only wanting one small thing to render it efficient no mouse would undertake to do it To prefer a complaint to the dean of their head master was a daring measure such as the school with all its hardihood had never yet attempted It might recoil upon themselves might produce no good to the question at issue and only end in making the master their enemy On the other hand the boys were resolved not to submit tamely to a piece of favouritism so unjust without doing something In the midst of this perplexity one of them suddenly mooted the suggestion that a written memorial should be sent to the head master from the school collectively respectfully requesting him to allow the choice of senior to be made in the legitimate order of things by merit or priority but not by favour Lame as the suggestion was the majority were for its adoption simply because no other plan could be hit upon Some were against it Hot arguments prevailed on both sides and a few personal compliments rather tending to break the peace had been exchanged The senior boy held himself aloof from acting personally it was his place they were fighting for Tom Channing and Huntley were red hot against what they called the sneaking meaning the underhand work Gerald Yorke was equally for non interference either to the master or the dean Yorke protested it was not in the least true that Lady Augusta had been promised anything of the sort In point of fact there was no proof that she had been excepting her own assertion made in the hearing of Jenkins Gerald gravely declared that Jenkins had gone to sleep and dreamt it Affairs had been going on in a cross grained sort of manner all day The school taking it as a whole had been inattentive mister Pye had been severe the second master had caned a whole desk and threatened another and double lessons had been set the upper boys for the following morning Altogether when the gentlemen were released at five o clock they were not in the sweetest of tempers and entered upon a wordy war in the cloisters What possessed you to take and tear up that paper you were surreptitiously scribbling at when Pye ordered you to go up and hand it in demanded Gaunt of George Brittle It was that which put him out with us all Was it a love letter Who was to think he d go and ask for it returned Brittle an indifferent sort of gentleman who liked to take things easily Guess what it was Don t talk to me about guessing imperiously spoke Gaunt I ask you what it was Nothing less than the memorial to himself laughed Brittle Some of us made a rough shell of it and I thought I d set on and copy it fair When old Pye s voice came thundering What s that you are so stealthily busy over mister Brittle hand it in of course I could only tear it into minute pieces and pretend to be deaf You had best not try it on again said Gaunt Nothing puts out Pye like disobeying him to his face Oh doesn t it though returned Brittle Cribs put him out the worst He thought that was a crib or he d not have been so eager for it What sort of a shell is it asked Harry Huntley Who drew it out It won t do at all interposed Hurst The head of it is Revered master and the tail Yours affectionately A shout of laughter Brittle s voice rose above the noise And the middle is an eloquent piece of composition calculated to take the master s obdurate heart by storm and move it to redress our wrongs We have no wrongs to redress of that sort cried Gerald Yorke Being an interested party you ought to keep your mouth shut called out Hurst to Yorke Keep yours shut first retorted Yorke to Hurst Not being interested there s no need to open yours at all Let s see the thing said Huntley Brittle drew from his pocket a sheet of a copy book tumbled blotted scribbled over with the elegance that only a schoolboy can display Several heads had been laid together and a sketch of the memorial drawn out between them Shorn of what Hurst had figuratively called the head and tail and which had been added for nonsense it was not a bad production The boys clustered round Brittle looking over his shoulder as he read the composition aloud for the benefit of those who could not elbow space to see It wouldn t be bad said Huntley critically if it were done into good grammar Into what roared Brittle The grammar s as good as you can produce any day Huntley Come I ll correct it for you said Huntley coolly There are a dozen faults in it The arrogance of those upper desk fellows ejaculated Brittle The stops are not put in yet and they haven t the gumption to allow for them You ll see what it is when it shall be written out properly Huntley It might be sent to the British Museum as a model of good English there to be framed and glazed I ll do it to night It s no business of yours mister Brittle that you should interfere to take an active part in it resumed Gerald Yorke No business of mine That s good When I m thinking of going in for the seniorship myself another time It s the business of the whole batch of us if you come to that roared Bywater trying to accomplish the difficult feat of standing on his head on the open mullioned window frame thereby running the danger of coming to grief amongst the gravestones and grass of the College burial yard If Pye does not get called to order now he may lapse into the habit of passing over hard working fellows with brains to exalt some good for nothing cake with none because he happens to have a Dutchman for his mother That would wash that would You Bywater do you mean that for me hotly demanded Gerald Yorke As if I did laughed Bywater As if I meant it for any cake in particular Unless the cap happens to fit em I don t say it does The thing is this struck in Hurst who will sign the paper It s of no use for Brittle or any other fellow to be at the bother of writing it out if nobody can be got to sign it What do you mean The school s ready to sign it Are the seniors With the seniors there was a hitch Gaunt put himself practically out of the affair Gerald Yorke would not sign it and Channing could not Huntley alone remained Why could not Channing sign it Ah there was the lever that was swaying and agitating the whole school this afternoon Poor Tom Channing was not just now reposing upon rose leaves What with his fiery temper and his pride Tom had enough to do to keep himself within bounds for the school was resenting upon him the stigma that had fallen upon Arthur Not the whole school but quite sufficient of it Not that they openly attacked Tom he could have repaid that in kind but they were sending him to Coventry Some said they would not sign a petition to the master headed by Tom Channing Tom you remember stood on the rolls next to Gaunt They said that if Tom Channing were to succeed as senior of the school the school would rise up in open rebellion That this feeling against him was very much fostered by the Yorkes was doubted Gerald was actuated by a twofold motive one of which was that it enhanced his own chance of the seniorship The other arose from resentment against Arthur Channing for having brought disgrace upon the office which contained his brother Roland Tod fraternized in this matter with Gerald though the same could not be said of him in general no two brothers in the school agreed less well than did the Yorkes Both of them fully believed Arthur to be guilty As good have the thing out now and settle it exclaimed Griffin who came next to Gerald Yorke and would be fourth senior when Gaunt should leave Are you fellows going to sign it or not To whom do you speak demanded Gaunt Well I speak to all said Griffin a good humoured lad but terribly mischievous and for some cause best known to himself warmly espousing the cause of Gerald Yorke Shall you sign it Gaunt No But I don t say that I disapprove of it mind you added Gaunt Were I going in for the seniorship and one below me were suddenly hoisted above my head and made cock of the walk I d know the reason why It is not talking that would satisfy me or grumbling either I d act Gaunt doesn t sign it proceeded Griffin telling off the names upon his fingers That s one Huntley do you I don t come next to Gaunt was Huntley s answer I ll speak in my right turn Tom Channing stood near to Huntley his trencher stuck aside on his head his honest face glowing One arm was full of books the other rested on his hip his whole attitude bespoke self possession his looks defiance Griffin went on Gerald Yorke do you sign it I d see it further first That s two disposed of Gaunt and Yorke pursued Griffin Huntley there s only you Huntley gave a petulant stamp I have told you I will not speak out of my turn Yes I will speak though as we want the affair set at rest he resumed changing his mind abruptly If Channing signs it I will There Channing will you sign it Yes I will said Tom Then it was that the hubbub arose converting the cloisters into an arena One word led to another Fiery blood bubbled up harsh things were said Gerald Yorke and his party reproached Tom Channing with being a disgrace to the school s charter through his brother Arthur Huntley and a few more warmly espoused Tom s cause of whom saucy Bywater was one who roared out cutting sarcasms from his gymnasium on the window frame Tom controlled himself better than might have been expected but he and Gerald Yorke flung passionate retorts one to the other It is not fair to cast in a fellow s teeth the shortcomings of his relations continued Bywater What with our uncles and cousins and mothers and grandmothers there s sure to be one among them that goes off the square Look at that rich lot next door to Lady Augusta s with their carriages and servants and soirees and all the rest of their grandeur their uncle was hanged for sheep stealing I d rather steal a sheep and be hanged for it than help myself to a nasty bit of paltry money and then deny that I did it foamed Gerald The suspicion might have fallen on my brother but that he happened by good luck to be away that afternoon My opinion is that Arthur Charming intended suspicion to fall upon him A howl from Bywater He had gone over head foremost to make acquaintance with the graves They were too much engrossed to heed him Your brother was a great deal more likely to have helped himself to it than Arthur Charming raged Tom He does a hundred dirty things every day that a Channing would rather cut off his arm than attempt The disputants faces were almost touching each other and very fiery faces they were that is speaking figuratively Tom s certainly was red enough but Gerald s was white with passion Some of the bigger boys stood close to prevent blows which Gaunt was forbidding I know he did it shrieked Gerald There You can t know it stamped Tom You don t know it I do And for two pins I d tell The boast was a vain boast the heat of passion alone prompting it Gerald Yorke was not scrupulously particular in calm moments but little recked he what he said in his violent moods Tom repudiated it with scorn But there was another upon whom the words fell with intense fear And that was Charley Channing Misled by Gerald s positive and earnest tone the boy really believed that there must be some foundation for the assertion A wild fear seized him lest Gerald should proclaim some startling fact conveying a conviction of Arthur s guilt to the minds of the school The blood forsook his face his lips trembled and he pushed his way through the throng till he touched Gerald Don t say it Gerald Yorke Don t he imploringly whispered I have kept counsel for you What said Gerald wheeling round I have kept your counsel about the surplice Keep Arthur s in return if you do know anything against him I wish you could have witnessed the change in Gerald Yorke s countenance A streak of scarlet crossed its pallor his eyes blazed forth defiance and a tremor as of fear momentarily shook him To the surprise of the boys who had no notion what might have been the purport of Charley s whisper he seized the boy by the arm and fiercely dragged him away up the cloisters turning the corner into the west quadrangle Get down he hissed get down upon your knees and swear that you ll never breathe a syllable of that calumny again Do you hear me boy No I will not get down said brave Charley Gerald drew in his lips You have heard of a wild tiger my boy One escaped from a caravan the other day and killed a few people I am worse than a wild tiger now and you had better not provoke me Swear it or I ll kill you I will not swear repeated the child I ll try and keep the promise I gave you not to betray about the surplice I will indeed but don t you say again please that Arthur is guilty To talk of killing somebody and to set about doing it are two things Gerald Yorke s killing would have amounted to no more than a good thrashing He held the victim at arm s length his eyes dilating his right hand raised when a head was suddenly propelled close upon them from the graveyard Gerald was so startled as to drop his hold of Charley The head belonged to Stephen Bywater who must have crept across the burial ground and chosen that spot to emerge from attracted probably by the noise What s the row asked he I was about to give Miss Channing a taste of tan replied Gerald who appeared to suddenly cool down from his passion He d have got it sweetly had you not come up I ll tan you too mister Bywater if you come thrusting in yourself like that where you are not expected and not wanted Tan away coolly responded Bywater I can tan again What had the young one been up to Impudence shortly answered Yorke Mark you Miss Channing I have not done with you though it is my pleasure to let you off for the present Halloa What s that It was a tremendous sound of yelling as if some one amidst the throng of boys was being tanned there Gerald and Charley flew off towards it followed by Bywater who propelled himself upwards through the mullioned frame in the best way he could The sufferer proved to be Tod Yorke who was writhing under the sharp correction of some tall fellow six feet high To the surprise of Gerald he recognized his brother Roland You may remember it was stated in the last chapter that Roland Yorke flew off in wild indignation from Lady Augusta s news of the parting of the Reverend mister Yorke and Constance Channing Roland in much inward commotion was striding through the cloisters on his way to find that reverend divine when he strode up to the throng of disputants who were far too much preoccupied with their own concerns to observe him The first distinct voice that struck upon Roland s ear above the general hubbub was that of his brother Tod When Gerald had rushed away with Charley Channing it had struck Tod that he could not do better than take up the dispute on his own score He forced himself through the crowd to where Gerald had stood in front of Tom Channing and began For some little time the confusion was so great he could not be heard but Tod persevered his manner was overbearing his voice loud I say that Tom Channing might have the decency to take himself out of the school When our friends put us into it they didn t expect we should have to consort with thieves brothers You contemptible little reptile How dare you presume to cast aspersion at my brother scornfully uttered Tom And the scorn was all he threw at him for the seniors disdained whatever the provocation to attack personally those younger and less than themselves Tod Yorke knew this How dare I Oh danced Tod I dare because I dare and because it s true When my brother Gerald says he knows it was Arthur Channing helped himself to the note he does know it Do you think he added improving upon Gerald s suggestion that my brother Roland could be in the same office and not know that he helped himself to it He It was at this unlucky moment that Roland had come up He heard the words dashed the intervening boys right and left caught hold of mister Tod by the collar of his jacket and lifted him from the ground as an angry lion might lift a contemptible little animal that had enraged him Roland Yorke was not an inapt type of an angry lion just then with his panting breath his blazing eye and his working nostrils Take that and that and that cried he giving Tod a taste of his strength You speak against Arthur Channing take that You false little hound and that Let me catch you at it again and I won t leave a whole bone in your body Tod writhed Tod howled Tod shrieked Tod roared for mercy All in vain Roland continued his and thats and Gerald and the other two absentees came leaping up Roland loosed him then and turned his flashing eyes upon Gerald Is it true that you said you knew Arthur Channing took the bank note What if I did retorted Gerald Then you told a lie A lie as false as you are If you don t eat your words you are a disgrace to the name of Yorke Boys believe me flashed Roland turning to the wondering throng Gaunt you believe me Arthur Channing never did take the note I know it I know it I tell you I don t care who it was took it but it was not Arthur Channing If you listen again to his false assertions pointing scornfully to Gerald you ll show yourselves to be sneaking curs Roland stopped for want of breath Bold Bywater who was sure to find his tongue before anybody else elbowed his way to the inner circle and flourished about there in complete disregard of the sad state of dilapidation he was in behind a large portion of a very necessary article of attire having been in some unaccountable manner torn away by his recent fall That s right Roland Yorke cried he I d scorn the action of bringing up a fellow s relations against him Whether Arthur Channing took the note or whether he didn t what has that to do with Tom or with us They are saying some of them that Tom Channing shan t sign a petition to the master about the seniorship What petition uttered Roland who had not calmed down a whit Why about Pye giving it to Gerald Yorke over the others heads returned Bywater You know Gerald s crowing over it like anything but I say it s a shame I heard him and Griffin say this morning that there was only Huntley to get over now Tom Channing was put out of it through the bother about Arthur What s the dean about that he does not give Pye a word of a sort asked Roland The dean If we could only get to tell the dean it might be all right But none of us dare do it Thank you for your defence of Arthur said Tom Channing to Roland Yorke as the latter was striding away Roland looked back I am ashamed for all the lot of you You might know that Arthur Channing needs no defence He should not be aspersed in my school Gaunt if I were senior What with one thing and another Roland s temper had not been so aroused for many a day Gaunt ran after him but Roland would not turn his head or speak Your brothers are excited against Tom Channing and that makes them hard upon him with regard to this accusation of Arthur observed Gaunt Tom has gone on above a bit about Gerald s getting his seniorship over him and Huntley Tom Channing can go on at a splitting rate when he likes and he has not spared his words Gerald being the party interested does not like it That s what they were having a row over when you came up Gerald has no more right to be put over Tom Channing s head than you have to be put over Pye s said Roland angrily Of course he has not replied Gaunt But things don t go by rights you know This business of Arthur Channing s has been quite a windfall for Gerald he makes it into an additional reason why Tom at any rate should not have the seniorship And there only remains Huntley He does does he exclaimed Roland If the dean Roland s voice it had not been a soft one died away The dean himself appeared suddenly at the door of the chapter house which they were then passing Roland raised his hat and Gaunt touched his trencher The dean accosted the latter his tone and manner less serene than usual What is the cause of this unusual noise Gaunt It has disturbed me in my reading If the cloisters are to be turned into a bear garden I shall certainly order them to be closed to the boys I ll go and stop it at once sir replied Gaunt touching his trencher again as he hastily retired He had no idea that the dean was in the chapter house Roland taking no time for consideration he very rarely did take it or any of the Yorkes burst forth with the grievance to the dean Not that Roland was one who cared much about justice or injustice in the abstract but he was feeling excessively wroth with Gerald and in a humour to espouse Tom Channing s cause against the world The college boys are in a state of semi rebellion mister Dean and are not so quiet under it as they might be They would like to bring their cause of complaint to you but they don t dare Indeed said the dean The senior boy leaves the school at Michaelmas went on Roland scarcely giving the dean time to say the word The one who stands first to step into his place is Tom Channing the next is Huntley the last is Gerald Yorke There is a belief afloat that mister Pye means to pass over the two first without reference to their merits or their rights and to bestow it upon Gerald Yorke The rumour is that he has promised this to my mother Lady Augusta Ought this to be so mister Dean although my asking it may seem to be opposed to Lady Augusta s wishes and my brother s interests Where have you heard this inquired the dean Oh the whole town is talking of it sir Of course that does not prove its truth but the college boys believe it They think said Roland pointedly that the dean ought to ascertain its grounds of foundation and to interfere Tom Channing is bearing the brunt of this false accusation on his brother which some of the cowards are casting to him It would be too bad were Pye to deprive him of the seniorship You think the accusation on Arthur Channing to be a false one returned the dean There never was a more false accusation brought in this world replied Roland relapsing into excitement I would answer for Arthur Channing with my own life He is entirely innocent Good afternoon mister Dean If I stop longer I may say more than s polite there s no telling Things that I have heard this afternoon have put my temper up He strode away towards the west door leaving the dean looking after him with a smile The dean had been on terms of friendship with doctor Yorke and was intimate with his family Roland s words were a somewhat singular corroboration of Arthur Channing s private defence to the dean only an hour ago Meanwhile Gaunt had gone up to scatter the noisy crew A nice row you have got me into with your quarrelling he exclaimed The dean has been in the chapter house all the time and isn t he in a passion He threatens to shut up the cloisters The announcement brought stillness chagrin What a bothering old duffer he is that dean uttered Bywater He is always turning up when he s not wanted Take your books and disperse in silence was the command of the senior boy Stop a bit said Bywater turning himself round and about for general inspection Look at me Can I go home My roared the boys who had been too preoccupied to be observant Haven t they come to grief But can I go through the streets Oh yes Make a rush for it Tell the folks you have been in the wars CHAPTER XXX THE DEPARTURE I like to see fair skies and sunshine on the morning fixed for a journey It seems to whisper a promise that satisfaction from that journey lies before it a foolish notion no doubt but a pleasant one Never did a more lovely morning arise to gladden the world than that fixed upon for mister and missus Channing s departure The August sky was without a cloud the early dew glittered in the sunbeams bees and butterflies sported amidst the opening flowers mister Channing was up early and had gathered his children around him Tom and Charles had by permission holiday that morning from early school and Constance had not gone to Lady Augusta Yorke s The very excitement and bustle of preparation had appeared to benefit mister Channing perhaps it was the influence of the hope which had seated itself in his heart and was at work there But mister Channing did not count upon this hope one whit more than he could help for disappointment might be its ending In this the hour of parting from his home and his children the hope seemed to have buried itself five fathoms deep if not to have died away completely Who in a similar position to mister Channing s has not felt this depression on leaving a beloved home The parting had been less sad but for the dark cloud hanging over Arthur mister Channing had no resource but to believe him guilty and his manner to him had grown cold and stern It was a pleasing sight could you have looked in upon it that morning one that would put you in mind of that happier world where partings are not For it was to that world that mister Channing had been carrying the thoughts of his children in these the last moments The Bible was before him but all that he had chosen to read was a short psalm And then he prayed God to bless them to keep them from evil to be their all powerful protector There was not a dry eye present and Charles and Annabel Annabel with all her wildness sobbed aloud He was standing up now supported by Hamish his left hand leaning heavily also for support on the shoulder of Tom Oh Arthur felt it keenly felt it as if his heart would break It was Tom whom his father had especially called to his aid he was passed over It was hard to bear He was giving a word of advice of charge to all Constance my pretty one the household is in your charge you must take care of your brothers comforts And Hamish my son I leave Constance to your care Tom let me enjoin you to keep your temper within bounds particularly with regard to that unsatisfactory matter the seniorship Annabel be obedient to your sister and give her no care And Charley my little darling be loving and gentle as you always are Upon my return if I shall be spared to return Father exclaimed Arthur in a burst of irrepressible feeling have you no word for me mister Channing laid his hand upon the head of Arthur Bless oh bless this my son he softly murmured And may God forgive him if he be indeed the erring one we fear But a few minutes had elapsed since mister Channing had repeated aloud the petition in the prayer taught us by our Saviour Lead us not into temptation It had come quickly to one of his hearers If ever temptation assailed a heart it assailed Arthur s then Not I father it is Hamish who is guilty it is for him I have to bear Hamish whom you are caressing was the true culprit I whom you despise am innocent Words such as these might have hovered on Arthur s lips he had nearly spoken them but for the strangely imploring look cast to him from the tearful eyes of Constance who read his struggle Arthur remembered One who had endured temptation far greater than this Who is ever ready to grant the same strength to those who need it A few moments and the struggle and temptation passed and he had not yielded to it Children I do not like these partings They always sadden my heart They make me long for that life where partings shall be no more Oh my dear ones do you all strive on to attain to that blessed life Think what would be our woeful grief if such can assail us there if memory of the past may be allowed us should we find any one of our dear ones absent of you who now stand around me I speak to you all not more to one than to another absent through his own fault his own sin his own carelessness Oh children you cannot tell my love for you my anxious care lest any of you should lose this inconceivable blessing Work on strive on and if we never meet again here Oh papa papa wildly sobbed Annabel we shall meet again You will come back well I trust we shall I do trust I may God is ever merciful and good All I would say is that my life is uncertain that if it be His will not to spare me I shall have but preceded you to that better land My blessing be upon you my children God s blessing be upon you Fare you well In the bustle of getting mister Channing to the fly Arthur was left alone with his mother She clung to him sobbing much Even her faith in him was shaken When the rupture occurred between mister Yorke and Constance Arthur never spoke up to say There is no cause for parting I am not guilty missus Channing was not the only one who had expected him to say this or something equivalent to it and she found her expectation vain Arthur had maintained a studied silence of course it could only tell against him Mother my darling mother I would ask you to trust me still but that I see how difficult it is for you he said as hot tears were wrung from his aching heart Hamish came in Arthur not caring to exhibit his emotion for every one s benefit retired to a distant window My father is in all comfortable said Hamish Mother are you sure you have everything Everything I believe Well put this into your private purse mother mine You ll find some use for it It was a ten pound note missus Channing began protesting that she should have enough without it missus Channing I know your enoughs laughed Hamish in his very gayest and lightest tone You ll be for going without dinner every other day fearing that funds won t last If you don t take it I shall send it after you to morrow Thank you my dear considerate boy she gratefully said as she put up the money which would in truth prove useful But how have you been able to get it for me As if a man could not save up his odd sixpences for a rainy day quoth Hamish She implicitly believed him She had absolute faith in her darling Hamish and the story of his embarrassments had not reached her ear Arthur heard all from his distant window For that very money given to my mother as a gift from him I must suffer was the rebellious thought that ran through his mind The fly started mister and missus Channing and Charley inside Hamish on the box with the driver Tom galloped to the station on foot Of course the boys were eager to see them off But Arthur in his refined sensitiveness would not put himself forward to make one of them and no one asked him to do so The train was on the point of starting mister and missus Channing were in their places certain arrangements having been made for the convenience of mister Channing who was partially lying across from one seat to the other Hamish and the others were standing round for a last word when there came one fighting his way through the platform bustle pushing porters and any one else who impeded his progress to the rightabout It was Roland Yorke Haven t I come up at a splitting pace I overslept myself mister Channing and I thought I should not be in time to give you a God speed I hope you ll have a pleasant time and come back cured sir Thank you Roland These heartfelt wishes from you all are very welcome I say mister Channing continued Roland leaning over the carriage window in utter disregard of danger If you should hear of any good place abroad that you think I might do for I wish you d speak a word for me Place abroad repeated mister Channing while Hamish burst into a laugh Yes said Roland My brother George knew a fellow who went over to Austria or Prussia or some of those places and dropped into a very good thing there quite by accident It was connected with one of the embassies I think five or six hundred a year and little to do mister Channing smiled Such windfalls are rare I fear I am not likely to hear of anything of the sort But what has mister Galloway done to you Roland You are a fixture with him I am tired of Galloway s frankly confessed Roland I didn t enjoy myself there before Arthur left but I am ready to hang myself since with no one to speak to but that calf of a Jenkins If Galloway will take on Arthur again and do him honour I ll stop and make the best of it but if he won t Back back hands off there Are you mad And amidst much shouting and running and dragging careless Roland out of danger the train steamed out of the station CHAPTER XXXI ABROAD A powerful steamer was cutting smoothly through the waters A large expanse of sea lay around dotted with its fishing boats which had come out with the night s tide A magnificent vessel her spars glittering in the rising sun might be observed in the distance and the grey misty sky overhead gave promise of a hot and lovely day Some of the passengers lay on deck where they had stationed themselves the previous night preferring its open air to the closeness of the cabins in the event of rough weather Rough weather they need not have feared The passage had been perfectly calm the sea smooth as a lake not a breath of wind had helped the good ship on her course steam had to do its full work But for this dead calm the fishing craft would not be close in shore looking very much like a flock of sea gulls Had a breeze ever so gentle sprung up they would have put out to more prolific waters A noise a shout a greeting and some of the passengers already awake but lying lazily sprang up to see what caused it It was a passing steamer bound for the great metropolis which they had left not seventeen hours ago The respective captains exchanged salutes from their places aloft and the fine vessels flew past each other Bon voyage bon voyage shouted out a little French boy to the retreating steamer We have had a fine passage captain observed a gentleman who was stretching himself and stamping about the deck after his night s repose on the hard bench Middling responded the captain to whom a dead calm was not quite so agreeable as it was to his passengers Should ha been in all the sooner for a breeze How long will it be now A good time yet Can t go along as if we had wind at our back The steamer made good progress however in spite of the faithless wind It glided up the Scheldt and by and by the spire of Antwerp Cathedral was discerned rising against the clear sky missus Channing who had been one of those early astir went back to her husband He was lying where he had been placed when the vessel left saint Katherine s Docks We shall soon be in James I wish you could see that beautiful spire I have been searching for it ever so long it is in sight now Hamish told me to keep a look out for it Did he replied mister Channing How did Hamish know it might be seen From the guide books I suppose or from hearsay Hamish seems to know everything What a good passage we have had Ay said mister Channing What I should have done in a rough sea I cannot tell The dread of it has been pressing on me as a nightmare since our voyage was decided upon missus Channing smiled Troubles seldom come from the quarter we anticipate them Later when missus Channing was once more leaning over the side of the vessel a man came up and put a card into her hand jabbering away in German at the same time The Custom House officers had come on board then Oh dear if Constance were only here It is for interpreting that we shall miss her thought missus Channing I am sorry that I do not understand you she said turning to the man Madame want an hot el That hot el a good one tapping the card with his finger and dexterously turning the reverse side upward where was set forth in English the advantages of a certain Antwerp inn Thank you but we make no stay at Antwerp we go straight on at once And she would have handed back the card No he would not receive it Madame might be wanting an hot el at another time on her return it might be If so would she patronize it it was a good hot el perfect missus Channing slipped the card into her reticule and searched her directions to see what hotel Hamish had indicated should they require one at Antwerp She found it to be the Hotel du Parc Hamish certainly had contrived to acquire for them a great fund of information and as it turned out information to be relied on Breakfast was to be obtained on board the steamer and they availed themselves of it as did a few of the other passengers Some delay occurred in bringing the steamer to the side after they arrived Whether from that cause or the captain s grievance want of wind or from both they were in later than they ought to have been When the first passenger put his foot on land they had been out twenty hours mister Channing was the last to be removed as with him aid was required missus Channing stood on the shore at the head of the ladder looking down anxiously lest in any way harm should come to him when she found a hand laid upon her shoulder and a familiar voice saluted her missus Channing Who would have thought of seeing you here Have you dropped from the moon Not only was the voice familiar but the face also In the surprise of being so addressed in the confusion around her missus Channing positively did not for a moment recognize it all she saw was that it was a home face mister Huntley she exclaimed when she had gathered her senses and in the rush of pleasure of meeting him of not feeling utterly alone in that strange land she put both her hands into his I may return your question by asking where you have dropped from I thought you were in the south of France So I was he answered until a few days ago when business brought me to Antwerp A gentleman is living here whom I wished to see Take care my men he continued to the English sailors who were carrying up mister Channing Mind your footing But the ascent was accomplished in safety and mister Channing was placed in a carriage Do you understand their lingo mister Huntley asked as the porters talked and chattered around Not a syllable she answered I can manage a little French but this is as a sealed book to me Is it German or Flemish Flemish I conclude he said laughingly but my ears will not tell me any more than yours tell you I should have done well to bring Ellen with me She said in her saucy way Papa when you are among the French and Germans you will be wishing for me to interpret for you As I have been wishing for Constance replied missus Channing In our young days it was not thought more essential to learn German than it was to learn Hindustanee French was only partially taught Quite true said mister Huntley I managed to rub through France after a fashion but I don t know what the natives thought of my French What I did know I have half forgotten But now for explanations Of course mister Channing has come to try the effect of the German springs Yes and we have such hopes she answered There does appear to be a probability that not only relief but a cure may be effected otherwise you may be sure we should not have ventured on so much expense I always said mister Channing ought to try them Very true you did so We were only waiting you know for the termination of the chancery suit It is terminated mister Huntley and against us mister Huntley had been abroad since June travelling in different parts of the Continent but he had heard from home regularly chiefly from his daughter and this loss of the suit was duly communicated with other news Never mind said he to missus Channing Better luck next time He was of a remarkably pleasant disposition in temperament not unlike Hamish Channing A man of keen intellect was mister Huntley his fine face expressing it The luggage collected they rejoined mister Channing I have scarcely said a word to you cried mister Huntley taking his hand But I am better pleased to see you here than I should be to see any one else living It is the first step towards a cure Where are you bound for For Borcette It is I know it interrupted mister Huntley I was at it a year or two ago One of the little Brunnens near Aix la Chapelle I stayed a whole week there I have a great mind to accompany you thither now and settle you there Oh do exclaimed mister Channing his face lighting up as the faces of invalids will light up at the anticipated companionship of a friend If you can spare time do come with us My time is my own the business that brought me here is concluded and I was thinking of leaving to day Having nothing to do after my early breakfast I strolled down to watch in the London steamer little thinking I should see you arrive by it That s settled then I will accompany you as far as Borcette and see you installed When do you return home Now and glad enough I shall be to get there Travelling is delightful for a change but when you have had enough of it home peeps out in the distance with all its charms The train which mister and missus Channing had intended to take was already gone through delay in the steamer s reaching Antwerp and they had to wait for another When it started it had them safely in it mister Huntley with them Their route lay through part of the Netherlands through Malines and some beautiful valleys so beautiful that it is worth going the whole distance from England to see them What is this disturbance about the seniorship and Lady Augusta Yorke asked mister Huntley as it suddenly occurred to his recollection in the earlier part of their journey Master Harry has written me a letter full of notes of exclamation and indignation saying I ought to come home and see about it What is it mister Channing explained at least as far as he was able to do so It has given rise to a good deal of dissatisfaction in the school he added but I cannot think for my own part that it can have any foundation mister Pye would not be likely to give a promise of the kind either to Lady Augusta or to any other of the boys friends If he attempted to give one to me I should throw it back to him with a word of a sort hastily rejoined mister Huntley in a warm tone Nothing can possibly be more unjust than to elevate one boy over another undeservedly nothing in my opinion can be more pernicious It is enough to render the boy himself unjust through life to give him loose ideas of right and wrong Have you not inquired into it No replied mister Channing I shall If I find reason to suspect there may be truth in the report I shall certainly inquire into it Underhand work of that sort goes with me against the grain I can stir in it with a better grace than you can mister Huntley added my son being pretty sure not to succeed to the seniorship so long as yours is above him to take it Tom Channing will make a good senior a better than Harry would Harry in his easy indifference would suffer the school to lapse into insubordination Tom will keep a tight hand over it A sensation of pain darted across the heart of mister Channing Only the day before his leaving home he had accidentally heard a few words spoken between Tom and Charley which had told him that Tom s chance of the seniorship was emperilled through the business connected with Arthur mister Charming had then questioned Tom and found that it was so He must speak of this now to mister Huntley however painful it might be to himself to do so It were more manly to meet it openly than to bury it in silence and let mister Huntley hear of it if he had not heard of it already as soon as he reached Helstonleigh Have you heard anything in particular about Arthur lately inquired mister Channing Of course I have was the answer Ellen did not fail to give me a full account of it I congratulate you on possessing such sons Congratulate To what do you allude asked mister Channing To Arthur s applying after Jupp s post as soon as he knew that the suit had failed He s a true Channing I am glad he got it Not to that I did not allude to that hastily rejoined mister Channing And then with downcast eyes and a downcast heart he related sufficient to put mister Huntley in possession of the facts mister Huntley heard the tale with incredulity a smile of ridicule parting his lips Suspect Arthur of theft he exclaimed What next Had I been in my place on the magistrates bench that day I should have dismissed the charge at once upon such defective evidence Channing what is the matter mister Channing laid his hand upon his aching brow and mister Huntley had to bend over him to catch the whispered answer I do fear that he may be guilty If he is not guilty some strange mystery altogether is attached to it But why do you fear that he is guilty asked mister Huntley in surprise Because his own conduct relating to the charge is so strange He will not assert his innocence or if he does attempt to assert it it is with a faint hesitating manner and tone that can only give one the impression of falsehood instead of truth It is utterly absurd to suppose your son Arthur capable of the crime He is one of those whom it is impossible to doubt noble true honourable No I would suspect myself before I could suspect Arthur Channing I would have suspected myself before I had suspected him impulsively spoke mister Channing But there are the facts coupled with his not denying the charge He could not deny it even to the satisfaction of mister Galloway did not attempt it had he done so Galloway would not have turned him from the office mister Huntley fell into thought revolving over the details is they had been related to him That Arthur was the culprit his judgment utterly repudiated and he came to the conclusion that he must be screening another He glanced at missus Channing who sat in troubled silence You do not believe Arthur guilty he said in a low tone suddenly bending over to her I do not know what to believe T am racked with doubt and pain she answered Arthur s words to me in private are only compatible with entire innocence but then what becomes of the broad facts of his strange appearance of guilt before the world God can bring his innocence to light he says and he is content to wait His time If there is a mystery I ll try to come to the bottom of it when I reach Helstonleigh thought mister Huntley Arthur s not guilty whoever else may be It was impossible to shake his firm faith in Arthur Channing mister Huntley was one of the few who read character strongly and surely and he knew Arthur was incapable of doing wrong Had his eyes witnessed Arthur positively stealing the bank note his mind his judgment would have refused credence to his eyes You may therefore judge that neither then nor afterwards was he likely to admit the possibility of Arthur s guilt And the college school is saying that Tom shall not stand for the seniorship he resumed aloud Does my son say it Some of them are saying it I believe the majority of the school I do not know whether your son is amongst the number He had better not let me find him so cried mister Huntley But now don t suffer this affair to worry you he added turning heartily to mister Channing If Arthur s guilty I ll eat him and I shall make it my business to look into it closely when I reach home You are incapacitated my old friend and I shall act for you Did Ellen not mention this in writing to you No the sly puss Catch Miss Ellen writing to me anything that might tell against the Channings A silence followed The subject which the words seemed to hint at was one upon which there could be no openness between them A warm attachment had sprung up between Hamish Channing and Ellen Huntley but whether mister Huntley would sanction it now that the suit had failed was doubtful He had never absolutely sanctioned it before tacitly in so far as that he had not interfered to prevent Ellen from meeting Hamish in society in friendly intercourse Probably he had never looked upon it from a serious point of view possibly he had never noticed it Hamish had not spoken even to Ellen but that they did care for each other very much was evident to those who chose to open their eyes No two people in all Helstonleigh were so happy in their children as you exclaimed mister Huntley Or had such cause to be so None happier assented missus Channing tears rising to her eyes They were and are good dutiful and loving Would you believe that Hamish little as he can have to spare has been one of the chief contributors to help us here mister Huntley lifted his eyebrows in surprise Hamish has How did he accomplish it He has indeed I fancy he has been saving up with this in view Dear self denying Hamish Now it just happened that mister Huntley was cognizant of mister Hamish s embarrassments so how the saving up could have been effected he was at a loss to know Careless Hamish may have borrowed it thought he to himself but saved it up he has not What are we approaching now interrupted mister Channing They were approaching the Prussian frontier and there they had to change trains more embarrassment for mister Channing After that they went on without interruption and arrived safely at the terminus almost close to Borcette having been about four hours on the road Borcette at last cheerily exclaimed mister Huntley as he shook mister Channing s hand Please God it may prove to you a place of healing Amen was the earnestly murmured answer missus Channing was delighted with Borcette Poor mister Channing could as yet see little of it It was a small unpretending place scarcely ten minutes distance from Aix la Chapelle to which she could walk through an avenue of trees She had never before seen a bubbling fountain of boiling water and regarded those of Borcette with much interest The hottest close to the Hotel Rosenbad where they sojourned boasted a temperature of more than one hundred fifty deg Fahrenheit it was curious to see it rising in the very middle of the street Other things amused her too in fact all she saw was strange and bore its peculiar interest She watched the factory people flocking to and fro at stated hours in the day for Borcette has its factories for woollen fabrics and looking glasses some thousands of souls their walk as regular and steady as that of school girls on their daily march under the governess s eye The men wore blue blouses the women neat and clean wore neither bonnets nor caps but their hair was twisted round their heads as artistically as if done by a hairdresser Not one women or girls but wore enormous gold earrings and the girls plaited their hair and let it hang behind What a contrast they presented to their class in England missus Channing had not long before spent a few weeks in one of our large factory towns in the north She remembered still the miserable unwholesome dirty poverty stricken appearance of the factory workers there their almost disgraceful appearance she remembered still the boisterous or the slouching manner with which they proceeded to their work their language anything but what it ought to be But these Prussians looked a respectable well conducted well to do body of people Where could the great difference lie Not in wages for the English were better paid than the Germans We might go abroad to learn economy and many other desirable accompaniments of daily life Nothing amused her more than to see the laundresses and housewives generally washing the linen at these boiling springs wash wash wash chatter chatter chatter She thought they must have no water in their own homes for they would flock in numbers to the springs with their kettles and jugs to fill them It was Doctor Lamb who had recommended them to the Hotel Rosenbad and they found the recommendation a good one Removed from the narrow dirty offensive streets of the little town it was pleasantly situated The promenade with its broad walks its gay company many of them invalids almost as helpless as mister Channing and its musical bands was in front of the hotel windows a pleasant sight for mister Channing until he could get about himself On the heights behind the hotel were two churches and the sound of their services would be wafted down in soft sweet strains of melody In the neighbourhood there was a shrine to which pilgrims flocked missus Channing regarded them with interest some with their alpen stocks some in fantastic dresses some with strings of beads which they knelt and told and her thoughts went back to the old times of the Crusaders All she saw pleased her But for her anxiety as to what would be the effect of the new treatment upon her husband and the ever lively trouble about Arthur it would have been a time of real delight to missus Channing They could not have been better off than in the Hotel Rosenbad Their rooms were on the second floor a small exquisitely pretty sitting room bearing a great resemblance to most continental sitting rooms its carpet red its muslin curtains snowy white from this opened a bed room containing two beds all as conveniently arranged as it could be Their meals were excellent the dinner table especially being abundantly supplied For all this they paid five francs a day each and the additional accommodation of having the meals served in their room on account of mister Channing was not noted as an additional expense Their wax lights were charged extra and that was all I think English hotel keepers might take a lesson from Borcette The doctor gave great hopes of mister Channing His opinion was that had mister Channing come to these baths when he was first taken ill his confinement would have been very trifling You will find the greatest benefit in a month said the doctor in answer to the anxious question How long the restoration might be in coming In two months you will walk charmingly in three you will be well Cheering news if it could only be borne out I will not have you say If cried mister Huntley who had made one in consultation with the doctor You are told that it will be so under God s blessing and all you have to do is to anticipate it mister Channing smiled They were stationed round the open window of the sitting room he on the most comfortable of sofas missus Channing watching the gay prospect below and thinking she should never tire of it There can be no hope without fear said he But I would not think of fear I would bury that altogether said mister Huntley You have nothing to do here but to take the remedies look forward with confidence and be as happy as the day s long I will if I can said mister Channing with some approach to gaiety I should not have gone to the expense of coming here but that I had great hopes of the result Expense you call it I call it a marvel of cheapness For your pocket Cheap as it is it will tell upon mine but if it does effect my restoration I shall soon repay it tenfold If again It will effect it I say What shall you do with Hamish when you resume your place at the head of your office Let me resume it first Huntley There you go Now if you were only as sanguine and sure as you ought to be I could recommend Hamish to something good to morrow Indeed What is it But if you persist in saying you shall not get well or that there s a doubt whether you will get well where s the use of my doing it So long as you are incapacitated Hamish must be a fixture in Guild Street True So I shall say no more about it at present But remember my old friend that when you are upon your legs and have no further need of Hamish who I expect will not care to drop down into a clerk again where he has been master I may be able to help him to something so do not let anticipations on his score worry you I suppose you will be losing Constance soon mister Channing gave vent to a groan a sharp attack of his malady pierced his frame just then Certain reminiscences caused by the question may have helped its acuteness but of that mister Huntley had no suspicion In the evening when missus Channing was sitting under the acacia trees mister Huntley joined her and she took the opportunity of alluding to the subject Do not mention it again in the presence of my husband she said talking of it can only bring it before his mind with more vivid force Constance and mister Yorke have parted Had missus Channing told him the cathedral had parted mister Huntley could not have felt more surprise Parted he ejaculated From what cause It occurred through this dreadful affair of Arthur s I fancy the fault was as much Constance s as mister Yorke s but I do not know the exact particulars He did not like it he thought I believe that to marry a sister of Arthur s would affect his own honour or she thought it Anyway they parted Had William Yorke been engaged to my daughter and given her up upon so shallow a plea I should have been disposed to chastise him intemperately spoke mister Huntley carried away by his strong feeling But I say I fancy that the giving up was on Constance s side repeated missus Channing She has a keen sense of honour and she knows the pride of the Yorkes Pride such as that would be the better for being taken down a peg returned mister Huntley I am sorry for this The accusation has indeed been productive of serious effects Why did not Arthur go to William Yorke and avow his innocence and tell him there was no cause for their parting Did he not do so missus Channing shook her head only by way of answer and as mister Huntley scrutinized her pale sad countenance he began to think there must be greater mystery about the affair than he had supposed He said no more On the third day he quitted Borcette having seen them as he expressed it fully installed and pursued his route homewards by way of Lille Calais and Dover mister Huntley was no friend to long sea passages people with well filled purses seldom are so CHAPTER XXXII AN OMINOUS COUGH I say Jenkins how you cough Yes sir I do It s a sign that autumn s coming on I have been pretty free from it all the summer I think the few days I lay in bed through that fall must have done good to my chest for since then I have hardly coughed at all This last day or two it has been bad again What cough do you call it went on Roland Yorke you may have guessed he was the speaker A churchyard cough Well I don t know sir said Jenkins It has been called that before now I dare say it will be the end of me at last Cool remarked Roland Cooler than I should be if I had a cough or any plague of the sort that was likely to be my end Does it trouble your mind Jenkins No sir not exactly It gives me rather down hearted thoughts now and then till I remember that everything is sure to be ordered for the best The best Should you call it for the best if you were to go off demanded Roland drawing pen and ink chimneys upon his blotting paper with clouds of smoke coming out as he sat lazily at his desk I dare say sir if that were to happen I should be enabled to see that it was for the best There s no doubt of it According to that theory everything that happens must be for the best You may as well say that pitching on to your head and half killing yourself was for the best Moonshine Jenkins I think even that accident was sent for some wise purpose sir I know in some respects it was very palpably for the best It afforded me some days of quiet serious reflection and it served to show how considerate everybody was for me And the pain That was soon over sir It made me think of that better place where there will be no pain If I am to be called there early mister Roland it is well that my thoughts should be led to it Roland stared with all his eyes I say Jenkins what do you mean You have nothing serious the matter with you No sir nothing but the cough and a weakness that I feel My mother and brother both died of the same thing sir Oh nonsense returned Roland Because one s mother dies is that any reason why we should fall into low spirits and take up the notion that we are going to die and look out for it I am surprised at you Jenkins I am not in low spirits sir and I am sure I do not look out for it I might have looked out for it any autumn or any spring of late had I been that way inclined for I have had the cough at those periods as you know sir There s a difference mister Roland between looking out for a thing and not shutting one s eyes to what may come I say old fellow you just put all such notions away from you and Roland really meant to speak in a kindly cheering spirit My father died of dropsy and I may just as well set on and poke and pat at myself every other morning to see if it s not attacking me Only think what would become of this office without you Galloway would fret and fume himself into his tomb at having nobody but me in it A smile crossed Jenkins s face at the idea of the office confided to the management of Roland Yorke Poor Jenkins was one of the doubtful ones from a sanitary point of view Always shadowy as if a wind would blow him away and for some years suffering much from a cough which only disappeared in summer he could not and did not count upon a long life He had quite recovered from his accident but the cough had now come on with much force and he was feeling unusually weak You don t look ill Jenkins Don t I sir The Reverend mister Yorke met me to day Don t bring up his name before me interrupted Roland raising his voice to anger I may begin to swear perhaps if you do Why what has he done wondered Jenkins Never mind what he has done nodded Roland He is a disgrace to the name of Yorke I enjoyed the pleasure of telling him so the other night more than I have enjoyed anything a long while He was so mad If he had not been a parson I shouldn t wonder but he d have pitched into me mister Roland sir you know the parties are waiting for that lease Jenkins ventured to remind him Let the parties wait rejoined Roland Do they think this office is going to be hurried as if it were a common lawyer s I say Jenkins where has old Galloway taken flight to this afternoon He has an appointment with the surrogate answered Jenkins Oh I quite forgot to mention something to you mister Roland Mention it now said Roland A person came this morning sir and was rather loud said Jenkins in a tone of deprecation as if he would apologize for having to repeat the news He thought you were in mister Roland and that I was only denying you and he grew insolent mister Galloway happened to be in his room unfortunately and heard it and he came out himself and sent the person away mister Galloway was very angry and he desired me to tell you sir that he would not have that sort of people coming here Roland took up the ruler and essayed to balance it on the edge of his nose Who was it asked he I am not sure who it was though I know I have seen the man somewhere I think he wanted payment of a bill sir Nothing more likely rejoined Roland with characteristic indifference I hope his head won t ache till he gets it I am cleared out for some time to come I d like to know who the fellow was though Jenkins that I might punish him for his impudence How dared he come here I asked him to leave his name sir and he said mister Roland Yorke knew his name quite well enough without having it left for him As brassy as that was he I wish to goodness it was the fashion to have a cistern in your house roofs emphatically added Roland A what sir cried Jenkins lifting his eyes from his writing A water cistern with a tap worked by a string at pleasure You could give it a pull you know when such customers as those came and they d find themselves deluged That would cool their insolence if anything would I d get up a company for it and take out a patent if I only had the ready money Jenkins made no reply He was applying himself diligently to his work perhaps hoping that mister Roland Yorke might take the hint and do the same Roland actually did take it at any rate he dipped his pen in the ink and wrote at the very least five or six words then he looked up Jenkins began he again do you know much about Port Natal I don t know anything about it sir except that there is such a place Why you know nothing cried Roland I never saw such a muff I wonder what you reckon yourself good for Jenkins Jenkins shook his head No matter what reproach was brought against him he received it meekly as if it were his due I am not good for much sir beyond just my daily duty here To know about Port Natal and those foreign places is not in my work sir and so I m afraid I neglect them Did you want any information about Port Natal mister Roland I have got it said Roland loads of it I am not sure that I shan t make a start for it Jenkins For Port Natal sir Why it s all the way to Africa Do you suppose I thought it was in Wales retorted Roland It s the jolliest opening for an enterprising man is Port Natal You may land there to day with half a crown in your pocket and come away in a year or two with your fortune made Indeed ejaculated Jenkins How is it made sir Oh you learn all that when you get there I shall go Jenkins if things don t look up a bit in these quarters What things sir Jenkins ventured to ask Tin for one thing work for another answered Roland If I don t get more of the one and less of the other I shall try Port Natal I had a row with my lady at dinner time She thinks a paltry sovereign or two ought to last a fellow for a month My service to her I just dropped a hint of Port Natal and left her weeping She ll have come to by this evening and behave liberally But about the work sir said Jenkins I m sure I make it as light for you as I possibly can You have only had that lease sir all day yesterday and to day Oh it s not just the amount of work Jenkins acknowledged Roland it s the being tied by the leg to this horrid old office As good work as play if one has to be in it I have been fit to cut it altogether every hour since Arthur Channing left for you know you are no company Jenkins Very true sir If I could only get Arthur Channing to go with me I d be off to morrow But he laughs at it He hasn t got half pluck Only fancy Jenkins my coming back in a year or two with twenty thousand pounds in my pocket Wouldn t I give you a treat old chap I d pay a couple of clerks to do your work here and carry you off somewhere in spite of old Galloway for a six months holiday where you d get rid of that precious cough I would Jenkins You are very kind sir Jenkins was stopped by the precious cough It seemed completely to rack his frame Roland looked at him with sympathy and just then steps were heard to enter the passage and a knock came to the office door Who s come bothering now cried Roland Come in Possibly the mandate was not heard for poor Jenkins was coughing still Don t I tell you to come in roared out Roland Are you deaf Open the door I don t care to soil my gloves came the answer from the other side And mister Roland slid off his stool to obey rather less lazily than usual for the voice was that of his mother the Lady Augusta Yorke A very dutiful son you are mister Roland was the salutation of Lady Augusta Forcing me up from dinner before I had finished I didn t do anything of the sort said Roland Yes you did With your threats about Port Natal What do you know about Port Natal Why should you go to Port Natal You will break my heart with grief that s what you will do I was not going to start this afternoon returned Roland But the fact is mother I shall have to go to Port Natal or to some other port unless I can get a little money to go on with here A fellow can t walk about with empty pockets You undutiful extravagant boy exclaimed Lady Augusta I am worried out of my life for money between you all Gerald got two sovereigns from me yesterday What money do you want As much as you can let me have replied mister Roland Lady Augusta threw a five pound note by his side upon the desk When you boys have driven me into the workhouse you ll be satisfied perhaps And now hold your foolish tongue about Port Natal Roland gathered it up with alacrity and a word of thanks Lady Augusta had turned to Jenkins You are the best off Jenkins you have no children to disturb your peace You don t look well Jenkins Thank you kindly my lady I feel but poorly My cough has become troublesome again He has just been saying that he thought the cough was going to take him off interposed Roland Lady Augusta laughed she supposed it was spoken in jest and desired her son to open the door for her Her gloves were new and delicate Had you chosen to remain at the dinner table as a gentleman ought I should have told you some news mister Roland said Lady Augusta Roland was always ready for news He opened his eyes and ears Tell it me now good mother Don t bear malice Your uncle Carrick is coming here on a visit I am glad of that that s good cried Roland When does he come I say mother don t be in a hurry When does he come But Lady Augusta apparently was in a hurry for she did not wait to reply Roland looked after her and saw her shaking hands with a gentleman who was about to enter Oh he s back is he cried unceremonious Roland I thought he was dead and buried and gone to heaven CHAPTER XXXIII NO SENIORSHIP FOR TOM CHANNING Shaking hands with Lady Augusta Yorke as she turned out of mister Galloway s office was mister Huntley He had only just arrived at Helstonleigh had not yet been home but he explained that he wished to give at once a word of pleasant news to Constance Channing of her father and mother and on his way to the Boundaries was calling on mister Galloway You will find Miss Channing at my house said Lady Augusta after some warm inquiries touching mister and missus Channing I would offer to go back there with you but I am on my way to make some calls She turned towards the town as she spoke and mister Huntley entered the office I thought you were never coming home again cried free Roland Why you have been away three months mister Huntley Very nearly Where is mister Galloway In his skin said Roland Jenkins looked up deprecatingly as if he would apologize for the rudeness of Roland Yorke mister Galloway is out sir I dare say he will not be away more than half an hour I cannot wait now said mister Huntley So you are one less in this office than you were when I left The awfullest shame struck in Roland Have you heard that Galloway lost a bank note out of a letter sir Yes I have heard of it from mister Channing And they accused Arthur Channing of taking it exclaimed Roland They took him up for it he was had up twice to the town hall like any felon You may be slow to believe it mister Huntley but it s true It was Butterby sir interposed Jenkins He was rather too officious over it and acted without mister Galloway s orders Don t talk rubbish Jenkins rebuked Roland You have defended Galloway all through the piece but he is as much to blame as Butterby Why did he turn off Channing You do not think him guilty Roland I see said mister Huntley I should hope I don t answered Roland Butterby pitched upon Arthur because there happened to be nobody else at hand to pitch upon just as he d have pitched upon you mister Huntley had you happened to be in the office that afternoon mister Arthur Channing was not guilty I am sure sir pray do not think him so resumed Jenkins his eye lighting as he turned to mister Huntley And mister Huntley smiled in response to the earnestness He believe Arthur Channing guilty He left a message for mister Galloway and quitted the office Roland who was very difficult to settle to work again if once disturbed from it strided himself across his stool and tilted it backwards I m uncommonly glad Carrick s coming cried he Do you remember him Jenkins Who sir That uncle of mine He was at Helstonleigh three years ago I am not sure that I do sir What a sieve of a memory you must have He is as tall as a house We are not bad fellows for height but Carrick beats us He is not married you know and we look to him to square up many a corner To do him justice he never says No when he has the cash but he s often out at elbows himself It was he who bought George his commission and fitted him out and I know my lady looks to him to find the funds Gerald will want to make him into a parson I wonder what he ll do for me Jenkins was about to answer but was stopped by his cough For some minutes it completely exhausted him and Roland for want of a hearer was fain to bring the legs of his stool down again and apply himself lazily to his work At this very moment which was not much past two o clock in the day Bywater had Charley Channing pinned against the palings underneath the elm trees He had him all to himself No other boys were within hearing though many were within sight for they were assembling in and round the cloisters after their dinner Now Miss Charley it s the last time I ll ask you as true as that we are living here You are as obstinate as a young mule I ll give you this one chance and I ll not give you another I d advise you to take it if you have any regard for your skin I don t know anything Bywater You shuffling little turncoat I don t know that there s any fire in that kitchen chimney of the old dean s but I am morally certain that there is because clouds of black smoke are coming out of it And you know just as well who it was that played the trick to my surplice I don t ask you to blurt it out to the school and I won t bring your name up in it at all I won t act upon what you tell me There Bywater I don t know and suspicion goes for nothing Gaunt said it did not Bywater gave Charley a petulant shake I say that you know morally Miss Channing I protest that I heard you mention the word surplice to Gerald Yorke the day there was that row in the cloisters when Roland Yorke gave Tod a thrashing and I tore the seat out of my pants Gerald Yorke looked ready to kill you for it too Come out with it This is about the sixth time I have had you in trap and you have only defied me I don t defy you Bywater I say that I will not tell I would not if I knew It is no business of mine You little ninny Don t you see that your obstinacy is injuring Tom Channing Yorke is going in for the seniorship is sure to get it if it s true that Pye has given the promise to Lady Augusta But let it come out that he was the Jack in the box and his chance falls to the ground And you won t say a word to do good to your brother Charley shook his head He did not take the bait And Tom himself would be the first to punish me for doing wrong He never forgives a sneak It s of no use your keeping me Bywater Listen youngster I have my suspicions I have had them all along and I have a clue that s more But for a certain reason I think my suspicions and my clue point to the wrong party and I don t care to stir in it till I am sure One two three for the last time Will you tell me No Then look you Miss Charley Channing If I do go and denounce the wrong party and find out afterwards that it is the wrong one I ll give you as sweet a drubbing as you ever had and your girl s face shan t save you Now go He propelled Charley from him with a jerk and propelled him against mister Huntley who was at that moment turning the corner close to them on his way from mister Galloway s office You can t go through me Charley said mister Huntley Did you think I was made of glass Bywater My patience exclaimed Bywater Why Harry was grumbling not five minutes ago that you were never coming home at all mister Huntley He was was he Is he here Oh he s somewhere amongst the ruck of them cried Bywater looking towards the distant boys He wants you to see about this bother of the seniorship If somebody doesn t we shall get up a mutiny that s all Here Huntley he shouted at the top of his voice here s an arrival from foreign parts Some of the nearer boys looked round and the word was passed to Huntley Harry Huntley and the rest soon surrounded him and mister Huntley had no reason to complain of the warmth of his reception When news had recently arrived that mister Huntley was coming home the boys had taken up the hope of his interference Of course schoolboy like they all entered upon it eagerly Stop stop stop said mister Huntley One at a time How can I hear if you all talk together Now what s the grievance They detailed it as rationally and with as little noise as it was in their nature to do Huntley was the only senior present but Gaunt came up during the conference It s all a cram mister Huntley cried Tod Yorke My brother Gerald says that Jenkins dreamt it I ll dream you if you don t keep your tongue silent Tod Yorke reprimanded Gaunt Take yourself off to a distance mister Huntley he added turning to that gentleman it is certain that Lady Augusta said it and we can t think she d say it unless Pye promised it It is unfair upon Charming and Huntley A few more words given to the throng upon general matters for mister Huntley touched no more on the other topic and then he continued his way to Lady Augusta s As he passed the house of the Reverend mister Pye that gentleman was coming out of it mister Huntley a decisive straightforward man entered upon the matter at once after some moments spent in greeting You will pardon my speaking of it to you personally he said when he had introduced the subject In most cases I consider it perfectly unjustifiable for the friends of boys in a public school to interfere with the executive of its master but this affair is different Is it or is it not correct that there is an intention afloat to exalt Yorke to the seniorship mister Huntley you must be aware that in no case can the head master of a public school allow himself to be interfered with or questioned was the reply of the master I hope you will meet this amicably returned mister Huntley I have no other wish than to be friendly quite so We all deem ourselves under obligations to you mister Pye and esteem you highly we could not have or wish a better preceptor for our sons But in this instance my duty is plain The injustice if any such injustice is contemplated tells particularly upon Tom Channing and my son mister Channing does not give ear to it I would rather not nevertheless you must pardon me for acting in the uncertainty as though it had foundation I presume you cannot be ignorant of the dissatisfied feeling that reigns in the school I have intimated that I will not be questioned said mister Pye Quite right I merely wished to express a hope that there may be no foundation for the rumour If Tom Channing and Harry forfeit their rights legally through want of merit or ill conduct it is not I that would urge a word in their favour Fair play s a jewel and the highest boy in the school should have no better chance given him than the lowest But if the two senior boys do not so forfeit their rights Yorke must not be exalted above them Who is to dictate to me demanded mister Pye Certainly not I replied mister Huntley in a courteous but firm tone Were the thing to take place I should simply demand through the Dean and Chapter that the charter of the school might be consulted as to whether its tenets had teen strictly followed The head master made no reply Neither did he appear angry only impassible mister Huntley had certainly hit the right nail on the head for the master of Helstonleigh College school was entirely under the control of the Dean and Chapter I can speak to you upon this all the more freely and with better understanding since it is not my boy who stands any chance said mister Huntley with a cordial smile Tom Channing heads him on the rolls Tom Channing will not be senior I have no objection to affirm so much to you observed the master falling in with mister Huntley s manner This sad affair of his brother Arthur s debars him It ought not to debar him even were Arthur guilty warmly returned mister Huntley In justice to Tom Channing himself no But and the master dropped his voice to a confidential tone it is necessary sometimes to study the prejudices taken up by a school to see them and not to appear to see them if you understand me Were Tom Channing made head of the school part of the school would rise up in rebellion some of the boys would no doubt be removed from it For the peace of the school alone it could not be done The boys would not now obey him as senior and there would be perpetual warfare resulting we know not in what Arthur Channing was not guilty I feel as sure of it as I do of my own life He is looked upon as guilty by those who must know best from their familiarity with the details rejoined mister Pye For my own part I have no resource but to believe him so I regard it as one of those anomalies which you cannot understand or would believe in but that it happens under your own eye where the moment s yielding to temptation is at variance with the general character with the whole past life Of course in these cases the disgrace is reflected upon relatives and connections and they have to suffer for it I cannot help the school s resenting it upon Tom It will be cruel to deprive Tom of the seniorship upon these grounds remonstrated mister Huntley To himself individually assented the master But it is well that one promoted to a foundation school s seniorship should be free from moral taint Were there no feeling whatever against Tom Channing in the school I do not think I could consistently with my duty and with a due regard to the fitness of things place him as senior I am sorry for the boy I always liked him and he has been of good report both as to scholarship and conduct I know one thing said mister Huntley that you may search the school through and not find so good a senior as Tom Channing would make He would have made a very good one there s no doubt Would have ruled the boys well and firmly though without oppression Yes we lose a good senior in Tom Channing There was no more to be said mister Huntley felt that the master was thoroughly decided and for the other matter touching Yorke he had done with it until the time of appointment As he went musing on he began to think that mister Pye might be right with regard to depriving Tom of the seniorship however unjust it might appear to Tom himself mister Huntley remembered that not one of the boys except Gaunt had mentioned Tom Channing s name in his recent encounter with them they had spoken of the injustice of exalting Yorke over Harry Huntley He had not noticed it at the time He proceeded to Lady Augusta s and Constance was informed of his visit She had three pupils at Lady Augusta s now for that lady had kindly insisted that Constance should bring Annabel to study with her daughters during the absence of missus Channing Constance left them to themselves and entered the drawing room Pretty Constance so fresh so lovely in her simple muslin dress and her braided hair mister Huntley caught her hands and imprinted a very fatherly kiss upon her fair forehead That is from the absentees Constance I told them I should give it to you And I bring you the bravest news my dear mister Channing was already finding benefit from his change he was indeed There is every hope that he will be restored Constance was radiant with delight To see one who had met and stayed with her father and mother at their distant sojourn was almost like seeing her parents themselves And now my dear I want a word with you about all those untoward trials and troubles which appear to have come thickly during my absence continued mister Huntley First of all as to yourself What mischief making wind has been arising between you and William Yorke The expression of Constance s face changed to sadness and her cheeks grew crimson My dear you will not misunderstand me he resumed I heard of these things at Borcette and I said that I should undertake to inquire into them in the place of your father just as he health permitting him would have undertaken for me in my absence did any trouble arise to Ellen Is it true that you and mister Yorke have parted Yes faltered Constance And the cause Constance strove to suppress her tears You can do nothing mister Huntley nothing whatever Thank you all the same He has made this accusation upon Arthur the plea for breaking off his engagement I could not marry him with this cloud upon me she murmured It would not be right Cloud upon you hastily ejaculated mister Huntley The accusation against Arthur was the sole cause then of your parting Yes the sole cause which led to it mister Huntley paused apparently in thought He is presented to Hazeldon Chapel I hear Did his rupture with you take place after that occurrence I see what you are thinking she impulsively cried caring too much for mister Yorke not to defend him The chief fault of the parting was mine I felt that it would not do to become his wife being being she hesitated much Arthur s sister I believe that he also felt it Indeed mister Huntley there is no help for it nothing can be done Knowing what I do of William Yorke I am sure that the pain of separation must be keen whatever may be his pride Constance unless I am mistaken it is equally keen to you Again rose the soft damask blush to the face of Constance But she answered decisively mister Huntley I pray you to allow the subject to cease Nothing can bring about the renewal of the engagement between myself and mister Yorke It is irrevocably at an end Until Arthur shall be cleared you mean No she answered a vision of Hamish and his guilt flashing across her I mean for good Why does not Arthur assert his innocence to mister Yorke Constance I am sure you know as well as I do that he is not guilty Has he asserted it She made no answer As I would have wished to serve you so will I serve Arthur said mister Huntley I told your father and mother Constance that I should make it my business to investigate the charge against him I shall leave not a stone unturned to bring his innocence to light The avowal terrified Constance and she lost her self possession Oh don t don t she uttered You must not indeed you do not know the mischief it might do Mischief to what to whom exclaimed mister Huntley Constance buried her face in her hands and burst into tears The next moment she had raised it and taken mister Huntley s hand between hers You are papa s friend You would do us good and not harm is it not so she beseechingly said My dear child he exclaimed quite confounded by her words her distress you know that I would not harm any of you for the world Then pray do not seek to dive into that unhappy story she whispered It must not be too closely looked into And mister Huntley quitted Constance as a man who walks in a dream so utterly amazed was he What did it all mean As he was going through the cloisters his nearest way to the town Roland Yorke came flying up With his usual want of ceremony he passed his arm within mister Huntley s Galloway s come in now he exclaimed and I am off to the bank to pay in a bag of money for him Jenkins told him you had called Just hark at that clatter The clatter alluded to by mister Roland was occasioned by the tramp of the choristers on the cloister flags They were coming up behind full speed on their way from the schoolroom to enter the cathedral for the bell had begun for service And here comes that beautiful relative of mine continued Roland as he and mister Huntley passed the cathedral entrance and turned into the west quadrangle of the cloisters Would you credit it mister Huntley that he has turned out a sneak He has He was to have married Constance Channing you know and for fear Arthur should have touched the note he has declared off it If I were Constance I would never allow the fellow to speak to me again Apparently it was the course mister Roland himself intended to observe As the reverend mister Yorke who was coming in to service drew near Roland strode on his step haughty his head in the air which was all the notice he vouchsafed to take Probably the minor canon did not care very much for mister Roland s notice one way or the other but his eye lighted with pleasure at the sight of mister Huntley and he advanced to him his hand outstretched But mister Huntley a man given to show in his manner his likes and dislikes would not see the hand would not stop at all but passed mister Yorke with a distant bow That gentleman had fallen pretty deeply in his estimation since he had heard of the rupture with Constance Channing mister Yorke stood for a moment as if petrified and then strode on his way with a step as haughty as Roland s Roland burst into a glow of delight That s the way to serve him mister Huntley I hope he ll get cut by every good man in Helstonleigh CHAPTER XXXIV GERALD YORKE MADE INTO A BLOCK The reverend mister Yorke in his surplice and hood stood in his stall in the cathedral His countenance was stern absorbed as that of a man who is not altogether at peace with himself Let us hope that he was absorbed in the sacred service in which he was taking a part but we all know to our cost that the spirit will wander at these times and worldly thoughts obtrude themselves The greatest divine that the Church can boast is not always free from them Not an official part in the service was mister Yorke taking that afternoon the duty was being performed by the head master whose week it was to take it Very few people were at service and still less of the clergy the dean was present but not one of the chapter Arthur Channing sat in his place at the organ Arthur s thoughts too were wandering and you know it is of no use to make people out to be better than they are wandering to things especially mundane Arthur had not ceased to look out for something to do to replace the weekly funds lost when he left mister Galloway s He had not yet been successful employment is more easily sought than found especially by one lying under doubt as he was But he had now heard of something which he hoped he might gain Jenkins saying nothing to Roland Yorke or to any one else had hurried to mister Channing s house that day between one and two o clock and hurrying there and back had probably caused that temporary increase of cough which you heard of a chapter or two back Jenkins s errand was to inform Arthur that Dove and Dove solicitors in the town who were by no means so dove like as their name required a temporary clerk and he thought Arthur might suit them Arthur had asked Jenkins to keep a look out for him Is one of their clerks leaving Arthur inquired One of them met with an accident last night up at the railway station replied Jenkins Did you not hear of it sir I heard of that I did not know who was hurt He was trying to cross the line was he not Yes sir It was Marston He had been out with some friends and had taken it is thought more than was good for him A porter pulled him back but Marston fell and the engine crushed his foot He will be laid up two months the doctor says and Dove and Dove are looking out for some one to fill his place for the time If you would like to take it sir you could be looking out for something else while you are there You would more readily get the two hours daily leave of absence from a place like that where they keep three or four clerks than you would from where they keep only one If I like to take it repeated Arthur Will they like to take me That s the question Thank you Jenkins I ll see about it at once He was not able to do so immediately after Jenkins left for Dove and Dove s offices were situated at the other end of the town and he might not be back in time for service So he waited and went first to college and sat I say in his place at the organ his thoughts filled in spite of himself with the new project The service came to an end it had seemed long to Arthur so prone are we to estimate time by our own feelings and his voluntary afterwards was played a shade faster than usual Then he left the cathedral by the front entrance and hastened to the office of Dove and Dove Arthur had had many a rebuff of late when bent on a similar application and his experience taught him that it was best if possible to see the principals not to subject himself to the careless indifference or to the insolence of a clerk Two young men were writing at a desk when he entered Can I see mister Dove he inquired The elder of the writers scrutinized him through the railings of the desk Which of them asked he Either replied Arthur mister Dove or mister Alfred Dove It does not matter mister Dove s out and mister Alfred Dove s not at home was the response You ll have to wait or to call again He preferred to wait and in a very few minutes mister Dove came in Arthur was taken into a small room so full of papers that it seemed difficult to turn in it and there he stated his business You are a son of mister Channing s I believe said mister Dove He spoke morosely coarsely and he had a morose coarse countenance a sure index of the mind in him as in others Was it you who figured in the proceedings at the Guildhall some few weeks ago You may judge whether the remark called up the blood to Arthur s face He suppressed his mortification and spoke bravely It was myself sir I was not guilty My employment in your office would be the copying of deeds solely I presume that would afford me little temptation to be dishonest even were I inclined to be so Had any one paid Arthur in gold to keep in that little bit of sarcasm he could not have done so mister Dove caught up the idea that the words were uttered in sarcasm and scowled fitfully Marston was worth twenty five shillings a week to us and gained it You would not be worth half as much You do not know what I should be worth sir unless you tried me I am a quick and correct copyist but I should not expect to receive as much as an ordinary clerk on account of having to attend the cathedral for morning and afternoon service Wherever I go I must have that privilege allowed me Then I don t think you ll get it with us But look here young Channing it is my brother who undertakes the engaging and management of the clerks you can speak to him Can I see him this afternoon sir He ll be in presently Of course we could not admit you into our office unless some one became security You must be aware of that The words seemed like a checkmate to Arthur He stopped in hesitation Is it usual sir Usual no But it is necessary in your case There was a coarse pointed stress upon the your natural to the man Arthur turned away For a moment he felt that to Dove and Dove s he could not and would not go every feeling within him rebelled against it Presently the rebellion calmed down and he began to think about the security It would be of little use he was sure to apply to mister Alfred Dove who was a shade coarser than mister Dove if anything unless prepared to say that security could be given His father s he thought he might command but he was not sure of that under present circumstances without first speaking to Hamish He turned his steps to Guild Street his unhappy position pressing with unusual weight upon his feelings Can I see my brother he inquired of the clerks in the office He has some gentlemen with him just now sir I dare say you can go in There was nothing much amiss in the words but in the tone there was It was indicative of slight of contempt It was the first time Arthur had been there since the suspicion had fallen on him and they seemed to stare at him as if he had been a hyena not a respectable hyena either He entered Hamish s room Hamish was talking with two gentlemen strangers to Arthur but they were on the point of leaving Arthur stood away against the wainscoting by the corner table waiting until they were gone his attitude his countenance his whole appearance indicative of depression and sadness Hamish closed the door and turned to him He laid his hand kindly upon his shoulder his voice was expressive of the kindest sympathy So you have found your way here once more Arthur I thought you were never coming again What can I do for you lad I have been to Dove and Dove s They are in want of a clerk I think perhaps they would take me but Hamish they want security Dove and Dove s repeated Hamish Nice gentlemen both of them he added in his half pleasant half sarcastic manner Arthur boy I d not be under Dove and Dove if they offered me a gold nugget a day as weighty as the Queen s crown You must not go there They are not agreeable men I know that they are not men who are liked in Helstonleigh but what difference will that make to me So long as I turn out their parchments properly engrossed that is all I need care for What has happened Why are you looking so sad reiterated Hamish who could not fail to perceive that there was some strange grief at work Is my life so sunny just now that I can always be as bright as you retorted Arthur for Hamish s undimmed gaiety did sometimes jar upon his wearied spirit I shall go to Dove and Dove s if they will take me he added resolutely Will you answer for me Hamish in my father s name What amount of security do they require asked Hamish And it was a very proper a very natural question but even that grated on Arthur s nerves Are you afraid of me he rejoined Or do you fear my father would be I dare say they would take my security was Hamish s reply I will answer for you to any amount That is and again came his smile to any amount they may deem me good for If they don t like mine I can offer my father s Will that do Arthur Thank you that is all I want Don t go to Dove and Dove s old boy Hamish said again as Arthur was leaving the room Wait patiently for something better to turn up There s no such great hurry I wish there was room for you to come here It is only a temporary thing it is not for long replied Arthur and he went out On going back to Dove and Dove s the first person he saw upon opening the door of the clerks room was mister Alfred Dove He appeared to be in a passion over something that had gone wrong and was talking fast and furiously What do you want he asked wheeling round upon Arthur Arthur replied by intimating that he would be glad to speak with him Can t you speak then returned mister Alfred Dove I am not deaf Thus met Arthur did not repeat his wish for privacy He intimated his business uncertain whether mister Alfred Dove had heard of it or not and stated that the security could be given I don t know what you mean about security was mister Alfred Dove s rejoinder What security mister Dove said that if I came into your office security would be required answered Arthur My friends are ready to give it mister Dove told you that did he Just like him He has nothing to do with the details of the office Did he know who you are Certainly he did sir I should have thought not offensively returned mister Alfred Dove You must possess some assurance young man to come after a place in a respectable office Security or no security we can t admit one into ours who lies under the accusation of being light fingered It was the man all over Hamish had said Don t go to Dove and Dove s mister Alfred Dove stood with his finger pointing to the door and the two clerks stared in an insolent manner at Arthur With a burning brow and rising spirit Arthur left the room and halted for a moment in the passage outside Patience patience he murmured to himself patience and trust in God He turned into the street quickly and ran against mister Huntley For a minute he could not speak That gentleman detected his emotion and waited till it was over Have you been insulted Arthur he breathed Not much more so than I am now getting accustomed to was the answer that came from his quivering lips I heard they wanted a clerk and went to offer myself I am looked upon as a felon now mister Huntley Being innocent as the day I am innocent before God spoke Arthur in the impulse of his emotion in the fervency of his heart That he spoke but the solemn truth it was impossible to doubt even had mister Huntley been inclined to doubt and Arthur may be excused for forgetting his usual caution in the moment s bitterness Arthur said mister Huntley I promised your father and mother that I should do all in my power to establish your innocence Can you tell me how I am to set about it You cannot do it at all mister Huntley Things must remain as they are Why I cannot explain why I can only repeat it There is some strange mystery attaching to this Arthur did not gainsay it Arthur if I am to allow the affair to rest as I find it you must at least give me a reason why I may not act What is it Because the investigation could only cause tenfold deeper trouble You are very good to think of helping me mister Huntley but I must fight my own battle Others must be quiet in this matter for all our sakes mister Huntley gazed after Arthur as he moved away Constance first Arthur next What could be the meaning of it all Where did the mystery lie A resolution grew up in mister Huntley s heart that he would fathom it for private reasons of his own and in the impulse of the moment he bent his steps there and then towards the police station and demanded an interview with Roland Yorke s bete noire mister Butterby But the cathedral is not quite done with for the afternoon Upon the conclusion of service the dean lingered a few minutes in the nave speaking to one of the vergers When he turned to continue his way he encountered the reverend mister Pye who had been taking off his surplice in the vestry The choristers had been taking off their surplices also and were now trooping through the cloisters back to the schoolroom not more gently than usual The dean saluted mister Pye and they walked out together It is impossible to keep them quiet unless one s eye is continually upon them exclaimed the head master half apologetically as they came in view of the rebels He had a great mind to add And one s cane Boys will be boys said the dean How has this foolish opinion arisen among them that the names standing first on the roll for the seniorship will not be allowed to compete for it continued he with much suavity mister Pye looked rather flushed Really I am unable to say mister Dean It is difficult to account for all the notions taken up by schoolboys Boys do take up strange notions blandly assented the dean But I think were I you mister Pye I would set their minds at rest in this respect You have not yet deemed it worth while I dare say but it may perhaps be as well to do so When the elders of a school once take up the idea that their studies may not meet with due reward it tends to render them indifferent I remember once it was just after I came here as dean many years ago the head master of the school exalted a boy to be senior who stood sixth or seventh on the rolls and was positively half an idiot But those times are past Certainly they are remarked the master It was an unpleasant duty I had to perform then continued the dean in the same agreeable tone as if he were relating an anecdote unpleasant both for the parents of the boy and for the head master But as I remark such things could not occur now I think I would intimate to the king s scholars that they have nothing to fear It shall be done mister Dean was the response of the master and they exchanged bows as the dean turned into the deanery She s three parts a fool is that Lady Augusta muttered the master to the cloister flags as he strode over them Chattering magpie As circumstances had it the way was paved for the master to speak at once Upon entering the college schoolroom in passing the senior desk he overheard whispered words of dispute between Gerald Yorke and Pierce senior touching this very question the seniorship The master reached his own desk gave it a sharp rap with a cane that lay near to hand and spoke in his highest tone looking red and angry What are these disputes that appear to have been latterly disturbing the peace of the school What is that you are saying Gerald Yorke that the seniorship is to be yours Gerald Yorke looked red in his turn and somewhat foolish I beg your pardon sir I was not saying precisely that he answered with hesitation I think you were saying precisely that was the response of the master My ears are quicker than you may fancy mister Yorke If you really have been hugging yourself with the notion that the promotion will be yours the sooner you disabuse your mind of it the better Whoever gains the seniorship will gain it by priority of right by scholarship or by conduct as the matter may be Certainly not by anything else Allow me to recommend you one and all and the master threw his eyes round the desks generally and gave another emphatic stroke with the cane that you concern yourselves with your legitimate business not with mine Gerald did not like the reproof or the news He remained silent and sullen until the conclusion of school and then went tearing home A pretty block you have made of me he uttered bursting into the presence of Lady Augusta who had just returned home and sat fanning herself on a sofa before an open window Why what has taken you returned her ladyship It s a shame mother Filling me up with the news that I was to be senior And now Pye goes and announces that I m a fool for supposing so and that it s to go in regular rotation Pye does not mean it said my lady There hold your tongue Gerald I am too hot to talk I know that every fellow in the school will have the laugh at me if I am to be made a block of like this grumbled Gerald CHAPTER XXXV THE EARL OF CARRICK On a fine afternoon in August and the month was now drawing towards its close the two point twenty five train from London steamed into the station at Helstonleigh eight minutes behind time and came to a standstill Amongst the passengers who alighted was a gentleman of middle age as it is called in point of fact he had entered his fiftieth year as the peerage would have told any curious inquirer As he stepped out of a first class carriage several eyes were drawn towards him for he was of notable height towering above every one even above Roland Yorke who was of good height himself and stood on the platform waiting for him It was the Earl of Carrick brother to Lady Augusta Yorke and much resembling her a pleasant high cheek boned easy face betraying more of good humour than of high or keen intellect and nothing of pride The pride of the young Yorkes was sometimes talked of in Helstonleigh but it came from their father s side not from Lady Augusta s The earl spoke with a slight brogue and shook both Roland s hands heartily as soon as he found that it was to Roland they belonged Sure then but I didn t know ye Roland If ye had twenty years more on to ye re head I should have thought it was ye re father Have I grown like him Uncle Carrick Ye ve grown out of knowledge me boy And how s ye re mother and how are the rest of ye Stunning responded Roland They are all outside She would bring up the whole caravan The last time the lot came to the station the two young ones got upon the line to dance a hornpipe on the rails so she has kept them by her and is making Gerald and Tod look after them Where s your luggage Uncle Carrick Have you brought a servant Not I replied the earl Servants are only troubles in other folk s houses and me bit of luggage isn t so much but I can look after it meself I hope they put it in he continued looking about amid the boxes and portmanteaus and unable to see his own The luggage was found at last and given in charge of a porter and Lord Carrick went out to meet his relatives There were enough of them to meet the whole caravan as Roland had expressed it Lady Augusta sat in her barouche her two daughters and Constance and Annabel Channing with her Little Percy and Frank two most troublesome children were darting in and out amidst the carriages flys and omnibuses and Gerald and Tod had enough to do to keep them out of danger It was so like Lady Augusta bringing them all to the station to welcome their uncle Warm hearted and impulsive she had little more judgment than a child Constance had in vain protested against herself and Annabel being pressed into the company but her lady ship looked upon it as a sort of triumphal expedition and was deaf to remonstrances The earl warm hearted and impulsive also kissed them all Constance included She could not help herself before she was aware of the honour intended her the kiss was given a hearty smack as all the rest had The well meaning simple minded Irishman could not have been made to understand why he should not give a kiss of greeting to Constance as readily as he gave it to his sister or his sister s daughters He protested that he remembered Constance and Annabel well It may be questioned whether there was not more of Irish politeness than of truth in the assertion though he had seen them occasionally during his visit of three years ago How were they all to get home In and on the barouche as all except Roland had come to the gratification of the curious town Lord Carrick wished to walk his long legs were cramped but Lady Augusta would not hear of it and pulled him into the carriage Gerald Percy and Frank were fighting for places on the box beside the driver Tod intending to hang on behind as he had done in coming when the deep toned college bell struck out a quarter to three and the sound came distinctly to their ears borne from the distance It put a stop to the competition so far as Gerald was concerned He and Tod startled half out of their senses for they had not observed the lapse of time set off on foot as hard as they could go Meanwhile Roland putting aside the two young ones with his strong hand chose to mount the box himself at which they both began to shriek and roar Matters were compromised after a while Percy was taken up by Roland and Frank was by some process of packing stowed away inside Then the cargo started Lady Augusta happy as a princess with her newly met brother and her unruly children and not caring in the least for the gaze of the people who stood in the street or came rushing to their windows and doors to criticise the load Crowded as the carriage was it was pleasanter to be in it on that genial day than to be at work in close rooms dark shops or dull offices Amongst others who were so confined and hard at work was Jenkins at mister Galloway s Poor Jenkins had not improved in health during the week or two that had elapsed since you last saw him His cough was more troublesome still and he was thinner and weaker But Jenkins humble and conscientious thinking himself one who was not worth thinking of at all in comparison with others would have died at his post rather than give in Certainly Arthur Channing had been discharged at a most inopportune moment for mister Galloway as steward to the Dean and Chapter had more to do about Michaelmas than at any other time of the year From that epoch until November when the yearly audit took place there was a good deal of business to be gone through On this afternoon Jenkins was particularly busy mister Galloway was away from home for a day or two on business connected with that scapegrace cousin of his Roland Yorke proclaimed though whether mister Roland had any foundation for the assertion except his own fancy may be doubted and Jenkins had it all upon his own shoulders Jenkins unobtrusive and meek though he was was perfectly competent to manage and mister Galloway left him with entire trust But it is one thing to be competent to manage and another thing to be able to do two persons work in one person s time and that Jenkins was finding this afternoon He had letters to write he had callers to answer he had the general business of the office to attend to he had the regular deeds to prepare and copy The copying of those deeds was the work belonging to Roland Yorke Roland did not seem to be in a hurry to come to them Jenkins cast towards them an anxious eye but Jenkins could do no more for his own work could not be neglected He felt very unwell that afternoon oppressed hot unable to breathe He wiped the moisture from his brow three or four times and then thought he might be the better for a little air and opened the window But the breeze gentle as it was made him cough and he shut it again Of course no one knowing mister Roland Yorke could be surprised at his starting to the station to meet Lord Carrick instead of to the office to do his work He had gone home at one o clock that day as usual Not that there was any necessity for his doing so for the dinner hour was postponed until later and it would have furthered the business of the office had he remained for once at his post Had any one suggested to Roland to do so he would have thought he was going to be worked to death About twenty minutes past three he came clattering in I say Jenkins I want a holiday this afternoon Jenkins albeit the most accommodating spirit in the world looked dubious and cast a glance at the papers on Roland s desk Yes sir But what is to be done about the Uphill farm leases Now Jenkins it s not a bit of good for you to begin to croak If I gave in to you you d get as bad as Galloway When I have my mind off work I can t settle to it again and it s of no use trying Those Uphill deeds are not wanted before to morrow But they are wanted by eleven o clock sir so that they must be finished or nearly finished to night You know sir there has been a fuss about them and early to morrow is the very latest time they must be sent in I ll get up and be here in good time and finish them said Roland Just put it to yourself Jenkins if you had an uncle that you d not seen for seventeen ages whether you d like to leave him the minute he puts his foot over the door sill I dare say I should not sir said good natured Jenkins turning about in his mind how he could make time to do Roland s work His lordship is come then mister Roland His lordship s come bag and baggage returned Roland I say Jenkins what a thousand shames it is that he s not rich He is the best natured fellow alive and would do anything in the world for us if he only had the tin Is he not rich sir Why of course he s not confidentially returned Roland Every one knows the embarrassments of Lord Carrick When he came into the estates they had been mortgaged three deep by the last peer my grandfather an old guy in a velvet skull cap I remember who took snuff incessantly and my uncle on his part had mortgaged them three deep again which made six How Carrick manages to live nobody knows Sometimes he s in Ireland in the tumble down old homestead with just a couple of servants to wait upon him and sometimes he s on the Continent en garcon if you know what that means Now and then he gets a windfall when any of his tenants can be brought to pay up but he is the easiest going coach in life and won t press them Wouldn t I Some of those Irish tenants are very poor sir I have heard Poor be hanged What is a man s own ought to be his own Carrick says there are some years that he does not draw two thousand pounds all told Indeed sir That is not much for a peer It s not much for a commoner let alone a peer said Roland growing fierce If I were no better off than Carrick I d drop the title that s what I d do Why if he could live as a peer ought do you suppose we should be in the position we are One a soldier one and that s me lowered to be a common old proctor one a parson and all the rest of it If Carrick could be as other earls are and have interest with the Government and that we should stand a chance of getting properly provided for Of course he can make interest with nobody while his estates bring him in next door to nothing Are there no means of improving his estates mister Roland asked Jenkins If there were he s not the one to do it And I don t know that it would do him any material good after all acknowledged Roland If he gets one thousand a year he spends two and if he had twenty thousand he d spend forty It might come to the same in the long run so far as he goes we might be the better for it and should be It s a shame though that we should need to be the better for other folk s money if this were not the most unjust world going everybody would have fortunes of their own After this friendly little bit of confidence touching his uncle s affairs Roland prepared to depart I ll be sure to come in good time In the morning Jenkins and set to it like a brick was his parting salutation Away he went Jenkins with his aching head and his harassing cough applied himself diligently as he ever did to the afternoon s work and got through it by six o clock which was later than usual There then remained the copying which mister Roland Yorke ought to have done Knowing the value of Roland s promises and knowing also that if he kept this promise ever so strictly the amount of copying was more than could be completed in time if left to the morning Jenkins did as he had been aware he must do when talking with Roland took it home with him The parchments under his arm he set out on his walk What could be the matter with him that he felt so weak he asked himself as he went along It must be he believed having gone without his dinner Jenkins generally went home to dinner at twelve and returned at one occasionally however he did not go until two according to the exigencies of the office this day he had not gone at all but had cut a sandwich at breakfast time and brought it with him in his pocket He had proceeded as far as the elm trees in the Boundaries for Jenkins generally chose the quiet cloister way for his road home when he saw Arthur Channing advancing towards him With the ever ready respectful cordial smile with which he was wont to greet Arthur whenever he saw him Jenkins quickened his steps But suddenly the smile seemed to fix itself upon his lips and the parchments fell from his arm and he staggered against the palings But that Arthur was at hand to support him he might have fallen to the ground Why what is it Jenkins asked Arthur kindly when Jenkins was beginning to recover himself Thank you sir I don t know what it could have been Just as I was looking at you a mist seemed to come before my eyes and I felt giddy I suppose it was a sort of faintness that came over me I had been thinking that I felt weary Thank you very much sir Take my arm Jenkins said Arthur as he picked up the parchments and took possession of them I ll see you home Oh no sir indeed protested simple hearted Jenkins I d not think of such a thing I should feel quite ashamed sir at the thought of your being seen arm in arm with me in the street I can go quite well alone I can indeed sir Arthur burst out laughing I wish you wouldn t be such an old duffer Jenkins as the college boys have it Do you suppose I should let you go home by yourself Come along Drawing Jenkins s arm within his own Arthur turned with him Jenkins really did not like it Sensitive to a degree was he and to his humble mind it seemed that Arthur was out of place walking familiarly with him You must have been doing something to tire yourself said Arthur as they went along It has been a pretty busy day sir now mister Galloway s away I did not go home to dinner for one thing And mister Roland Yorke absent for another I suppose Only this afternoon sir His uncle Lord Carrick has arrived Oh sir broke off Jenkins stopping in a panic here s his lordship the bishop coming along Whatever shall you do Do returned Arthur scarcely understanding him What should I do To think that he should see you thus with the like of me It amused Arthur exceedingly Poor lowly minded Jenkins The bishop appeared to divine the state of the case for he stopped when he came up Possibly he was struck by the wan hue which overspread Jenkins s face You look ill Jenkins he said nodding to Arthur Channing Keep your hat on Jenkins keep your hat on Thank you my lord replied Jenkins disregarding the injunction touching his hat A sort of faintness came over me just now under the elm trees and this gentleman insisted upon walking home with me in spite of my protestations to Jenkins was stopped by a fit of coughing a long violent fit sounding hollow as the grave The bishop watched him till it was over Arthur watched him I think you should take better care of yourself Jenkins remarked his lordship Is any physician attending you Oh my lord I am not ill enough yet for that My wife made me go to mister Hurst the other day my lord and he gave me a bottle of something But he said it was not medicine that I wanted I should advise you to go to a physician Jenkins A stitch in time saves nine you know the bishop added in his free good humour So it does my lord Thank your lordship for thinking of me added Jenkins as the bishop said good afternoon and pursued his way And then and not till then did Jenkins put on his hat again mister Arthur would you be so kind as not to say anything to my wife about my being poorly asked Jenkins as they drew near to his home She d be perhaps for saying I should not go again yet to the office and a pretty dilemma that would put me in mister Galloway being absent She d get so fidgety too she kills me with kindness if she thinks I am ill The broth and arrowroot and other messes sir that she makes me swallow are untellable All right said Arthur But the intention was frustrated Who should be standing at the shop door but missus Jenkins herself She saw them before they saw her and she saw that her husband looked like a ghost and was supported by Arthur Of course she drew her own conclusions and missus Jenkins was one who did not allow her conclusions to be set aside When Jenkins found that he was seen and suspected he held out no longer but honestly confessed the worst that he had been taken with a giddiness Of course said missus Jenkins as she pushed a chair here and another there partly in temper partly to free the narrow passage through the shop to the parlour I have been expecting nothing less all day Every group of footsteps slower than usual I have thought it was a shutter arriving and you on it dropped dead from exhaustion Would you believe turning short round on Arthur Channing that he has been such a donkey as to fast from breakfast time And with that cough upon him Not quite so fast my dear deprecated Jenkins I ate the paper of sandwiches Paper of rubbish retorted missus Jenkins What good do sandwiches do a weakly man You might eat a ton load and be none the better for it Well Jenkins you may take your leave of having your own way Poor Jenkins might have deferentially intimated that he never did have it missus Jenkins resumed He said he d carry a sandwich with him this morning instead of coming home to dinner I said No And afterwards I was such a simpleton as to yield And here s the effects of it Sit yourself down in the easy chair she added taking Jenkins by the arms and pushing him into it And I ll make the tea now concluded she turning to the table where the tea things were set out There s some broiled fowl coming up for you I don t feel as if I could eat this evening Jenkins ventured to say Not eat she repeated with emphasis You had better eat that s all I don t want to have you falling down exhausted here as you did in the Boundaries And as soon as you have had your tea you should go to bed put in Arthur I can t sir I have three or four hours work at that deed It must be done At this returned Arthur opening the papers he had carried home Oh I see it is a lease I ll copy this for you Jenkins I have nothing to do to night You take your ease and go to bed And in spite of their calls Jenkins s protestations against taking up his time and trouble and missus Jenkins s proffered invitation to partake of tea and broiled fowl Arthur departed carrying off the work CHAPTER XXXVI ELLEN HUNTLEY A pretty time o day this is to deliver the letters It s eleven o clock I can t help it The train broke down and was three hours behind its time I dare say You letter men want looking up that s what it is Coming to folks s houses at eleven o clock when they have been waiting and looking ever since breakfast time It s not my fault I say Take the letter Judith received it with a grunt for it was between her and the postman that the colloquy had taken place A delay had occurred that morning in the delivery and Judith was resenting it feeling half inclined to reject the letter now that it had come The letters from Germany arrived irregularly sometimes by the afternoon post at four sometimes by the morning the only two deliveries in Helstonleigh A letter had been fully expected this morning and when the time passed over they supposed there was none It was directed to Miss Channing Judith who was quite as anxious about her master s health as the children were went off at once with it to Lady Augusta Yorke s just as she was without the ceremony of putting on a bonnet Though she did wear a mob cap and a check apron she looked what she was a respectable servant in a respectable family and the Boundaries so regarded her as she passed through them letter in hand Martha Lady Augusta s housemaid answered the door presenting a contrast to Judith Martha wore a crinoline as big as her lady s and a starched out muslin gown over it with flounces and frillings for Martha was dressed for the day Her arms red and large were displayed beneath her open sleeves and something that looked like a bit of twisted lace was stuck on the back of her head Martha called it a cap Judith was a plain servant and Martha was a fashionable one but I know which looked the better of the two Judith would not give in the letter She asked for the young mistress and Constance came to her in the hall Just open it please Miss Constance and tell me how he is said she anxiously and Constance broke the seal of the letter Borcette Hotel Rosenbad September eighteen My Dear Child Still better and better The improvement which I told you in my last week s letter had begun to take place so rapidly as to make us fear it was only a deceitful one turns out to have been real Will you believe it when I tell you that your papa can walk With the help of my arm he can walk across the room and along the passage and to morrow he is going to try to get down the first flight of stairs None but God can know how thankful I am not even my children If this change has taken place in the first month and it is not yet quite that what may we not expect in the next and the next Your papa is writing to Hamish and will confirm what I say This much Constance read aloud Judith gave a glad laugh It s just as everybody told the master said she A fine strong handsome man like him wasn t likely to be laid down for life like a baby when he was hardly middle aged These doctors here be just so many muffs When I get too old for work I ll go to Germany myself Miss Constance and ask em to make me young again Constance smiled She was running her eyes over the rest of the letter which was a long one She caught sight of Arthur s name There were some loving gentle messages to him and then these words Hamish says Arthur applied at Dove and Dove s for a clerk s place but did not come to terms with them We are glad that he did not Papa says he should not like to have one of his boys at Dove and Dove s And here s a little bit for you Judith Constance said aloud Tell Judith not to be over anxious in her place of trust and not to over work herself but to let Sarah take her full share There is no hurry about the bed furniture Sarah can do it in an evening at her leisure Judith received the latter portion of the message with scorn Tisn t me that s going to let her do it A fine do it would be Miss Constance The first thing I shall see when I go back now will be her head stretched out at one of the windows and the kidney beans left to string and cut themselves in the kitchen Judith turned to depart She never would allow any virtues to her helpmate Sarah who gave about the same trouble to her that young servants of twenty generally give to old ones Constance followed her to the door saying something which had suddenly occurred to her mind about domestic affairs when who should she meet coming in but the reverend William Yorke He had just left the Cathedral after morning prayers and was calling at Lady Augusta s Both were confused both stopped face to face in hesitation Constance grew crimson mister Yorke pale It was the first time they had met since the parting There was an angry feeling against Constance in the mind of mister Yorke he considered that she had not treated him with proper confidence and in his proud nature the Yorke blood was his he was content to resent it He did not expect to lose Constance eventually he thought that the present storm would blow over some time and that things would come right again We are all too much given to trust to that vague some time In Constance s mind there existed a soreness against mister Yorke He had doubted her he had accepted if he had not provoked too readily her resignation of him Unlike him she saw no prospect of the future setting matters right Marry him whilst the cloud lay upon Arthur she would not after he had intimated his opinion and sentiments and that cloud could only be lifted at the expense of another They exchanged a confused greeting neither of them conscious how it passed mister Yorke s attention was then caught by the open letter in her hand by the envelope bearing the foreign post marks How is mister Channing he asked So much better that it seems little short of a miracle replied Constance Mamma says glancing at the letter that he can walk leaning on her arm I am so glad to hear it Hamish told me last week that he was improving I trust it may go on to a cure Thank you replied Constance And she made him a pretty little state curtsey as she turned away not choosing to see the hand he would fain have offered her mister Yorke s voice brought a head and shoulders out at the breakfast room door They belonged to Lord Carrick He and Lady Augusta were positively at breakfast at that hour of the day His lordship s eyes followed the pretty form of Constance as she disappeared up the staircase on her return to the schoolroom William Yorke s were cast in the same direction Then their eyes the peer s and the clergyman s met Ye have given her up I understand Master William Master William vouchsafed no reply He deemed it a little piece of needless impertinence Bad taste continued Lord Carrick If I were only twenty years younger and she d not turn up her nose at me for a big daft of an Irishman you d not get her me lad She s the sweetest little thing I have come across this many a day To which the reverend William Yorke condescended no answer unless a haughty gesture expressive of indignation might be called one as he brushed past Lord Carrick into the breakfast room At that very hour and in a breakfast room also though all signs of the meal had long been removed were mister Huntley and his daughter The same praise just bestowed by Lord Carrick upon Constance Channing might with equal justice be given to Ellen Huntley She was a lovely girl three or four years older than Harry with pretty features and soft dark eyes What is more she was a good girl a noble generous hearted girl although you know no one is perfection with a spice of self will For the latter quality I think Ellen was more indebted to circumstances than to Nature missus Huntley was dead and a maiden sister of mister Huntley s older than himself resided with them and ruled Ellen ruled her with a tight hand not a kind one or a judicious one and that had brought out Miss Ellen s self will Miss Huntley was very starched prim and stiff very unnatural in short and she wished to make Ellen the same Ellen rebelled for she much disliked everything artificial She was truthful honest straightforward not unlike the character of Tom Channing Miss Huntley complained that she was too straightforward to be ladylike Ellen said she was sure she should never be otherwise than straightforward so it was of no use trying Then Miss Huntley would take offence and threaten Ellen with altering her will and that would vex Ellen more than anything Young ladies rarely care for money especially when they have plenty of it and Ellen Huntley would have that from her father As if I cared for my aunt s money she would say I wish she may not leave it to me And she was sincere in the wish Their controversies frequently amused mister Huntley Agreeing in heart and mind with his daughter he would yet make a playful show of taking his sister s part Miss Huntley knew it to be show done to laugh at her and would grow as angry with him as she was with Ellen mister Huntley was not laughing however this morning On the contrary he appeared to be in a very serious not to say solemn mood He slowly paced the room as was his custom when anything disturbed him stopping at moments to reflect buried in thought Ellen sat at a table by the window drawing The house was mister Huntley s own a white villa with a sloping lawn in front It was situated outside the town on a gentle eminence and commanded a view of the charming scenery for which the county was famous Ellen who had glanced up two or three times concerned to see the very stern perplexed look on her father s face at length spoke Is anything the matter papa mister Huntley did not answer He was standing close to the table then apparently looking at Ellen at her white morning dress and its blue ribbons it and she altogether a fair picture Probably he saw neither her nor her dress he was too deeply absorbed You are not ill are you papa Ill he answered rousing himself No Ellen I am not ill Then you have had something to vex you papa I have emphatically replied mister Huntley And the worst is that my vexation will not be confined to myself I believe It may extend to you Ellen mister Huntley s manner was so serious his look so peculiar as he gazed at her that Ellen felt a rush of discomfort and the colour spread itself over her fair face She jumped to the conclusion that she had been giving offence in some way that Miss Huntley must have been complaining of her Has my aunt been telling you about last night papa Harry had two of the college boys here and I unfortunately laughed and talked with them and she said afterwards I had done it on purpose to annoy her But I assure you papa Never mind assuring me child interrupted mister Huntley Your aunt has said nothing to me and if she had it would go in at one ear and out at the other It is worse business than any complaint that she could bring Ellen laid down her pencil and gazed at her father awe struck at his strange tone What is it she breathed But mister Huntley did not answer He remained perfectly still for a few moments absorbed in thought and then without a word of any sort to Ellen turned round to leave the room took his hat as he passed through the hall and left the house Can you guess what it was that was troubling mister Huntley Very probably if you can put as the saying runs this and that together Convinced as he was that Arthur Channing was not could not be guilty of taking the bank note yet puzzled by the strangely tame manner in which he met the charge confounded by the behaviour both of Arthur and Constance relating to it mister Huntley had resolved if possible to dive into the mystery He had his reasons for it A very disagreeable a very improbable suspicion called forth by the facts had darted across his mind therefore he resolved to penetrate to it And he set to work He questioned mister Galloway he questioned Butterby he questioned Jenkins and he questioned Roland Yorke He thus became as thoroughly conversant with the details of the transaction as it was possible for any one except the actual thief to be and he drew his own deductions Very reluctantly very slowly very cautiously were they drawn but very surely The behaviour of Arthur and Constance could only have one meaning they were screening the real culprit And that culprit must be Hamish Channing Unwilling as mister Huntley was to admit it he had no resource but to do so He grew as certain of it as he was of his own life He had loved and respected Hamish in no measured degree He had observed the attachment springing up between him and his daughter and he had been content to observe it None were so worthy of her in mister Huntley s eyes as Hamish Channing in all respects save one wealth and of that Ellen would have plenty mister Huntley had known of the trifling debts that were troubling Hamish and he found that those debts immediately on the loss of the bank note had been partially satisfied That the stolen money must have been thus applied and that it had been taken for that purpose he could not doubt Hamish It nearly made mister Huntley s hair stand on end That he must be silent over it as were Hamish s own family he knew silent for mister Channing s sake And what about Ellen There was the sad very sad grievance Whether Hamish went wrong or whether Hamish went right it was not of so much consequence to mister Huntley but it might be to Ellen in fact he thought it would be He had risen that morning resolved to hint to Ellen that any particular intimacy with Hamish must cease But he was strangely undecided about it Now that the moment was come he almost doubted himself Hamish s guilt All the improbabilities of the case rose up before him in marked colours he lost sight of the condemning facts and it suddenly occurred to him that it was scarcely fair to judge Hamish so completely without speaking to him Perhaps he can account to me for the possession of the money which he applied to those debts thought mister Huntley If so in spite of appearances I will not deem him guilty He went out on the spur of the moment straight down to the office in Guild Street Hamish was alone not at all busy apparently He was standing up by the fireplace his elbow on the mantelpiece a letter from mister Channing no doubt the one alluded to in missus Channing s letter to Constance in his hand He received mister Huntley with his cordial sunny smile spoke of the good news the letter brought spoke of the accident which had caused the delay of the mail and finally read out part of the letter as Constance had to Judith It was all very well but this only tended to embarrass mister Huntley He did not like his task and the more confidential they grew over mister Channing s health the worse it made it for him to enter upon As chance had it Hamish himself paved the way He began telling of an incident which had taken place that morning to the scandal of the town A young man wealthy but improvident had been arrested for debt mister Huntley had not yet heard of it It stopped his day s pleasure laughed Hamish He was going along with his gun and dogs intending to pop at the partridges when he got popped upon himself instead Poor fellow it was too bad to spoil his sport Had I been a rich man I should have felt inclined to bail him out The effect of running in debt remarked mister Huntley By the way Master Hamish is there no fear of a similar catastrophe for you he added in a tone which Hamish might if he liked take for a jesting one For me sir returned Hamish When I left Helstonleigh in June a certain young friend of mine was not quite free from a suspicion of such liabilities rejoined mister Huntley Hamish flushed rosy red Of all people in the world mister Huntley was the one from whom he would if possible have kept that knowledge but he spoke up readily I did owe a thing or two it can t be denied acknowledged he Men better and wiser and richer than I have owed money before me mister Huntley Suppose they serve you as they have served Jenner this morning They will not do that laughed Hamish seeming very much inclined to make a joke of the matter I have squared up some sufficiently to be on the safe side of danger and I shall square up the rest mister Huntley fixed his eyes upon him How did you get the money to do it Hamish Perhaps it was the plain unvarnished manner in which the question was put perhaps it was the intent gaze with which mister Huntley regarded him but certain it is that the flush on Hamish s face deepened to crimson and he turned it from mister Huntley saying nothing Hamish I have a reason for wishing to know To know what sir asked Hamish as if he would temporize or avoid the question Where did you obtain the money that you applied to liquidate or partially to liquidate your debts I cannot satisfy you sir The affair concerns no one but myself I did get it and that is sufficient Hamish had come out of his laughing tone and spoke as firmly as mister Huntley but that the question had embarrassed him was palpably evident mister Huntley said good morning and left the office without shaking hands All his doubts were confirmed He went straight home Ellen was where he had left her still alone mister Huntley approached her and spoke abruptly Are you willing to give up all intimacy with Hamish Channing She gazed at him in surprise her complexion changing her voice faltering Oh papa what have they done Ellen did I say they The Channings are my dear friends and I hope ever to call them such They have done nothing unworthy of my friendship or of yours I said Hamish Ellen rose from her seat unable to subdue her emotion and stood with her hands clasped before mister Huntley Hamish was far dearer to her than the world knew I will leave it to your good sense my dear mister Huntley whispered glancing round as if not caring that even the walls should hear I have liked Hamish very much or you may be sure he would not have been allowed to come here so frequently But he has forfeited my regard now as he must forfeit that of all good men She trembled excessively almost to impede her utterance when she would have asked what it was that he had done I scarcely dare breathe it to you said mister Huntley for it is a thing that we must hush up as the family are hushing it up When that bank note was lost suspicion fell on Arthur Well papa wonderingly resumed Ellen It was not Arthur who took it It was Hamish And Arthur is bearing the stigma of it for his father s sake Ellen grew pale Papa who says it No one says it Ellen But the facts leave no room for doubt Hamish s own manner I have just left him leaves no room for it He is indisputably guilty Then Ellen s anger her straightforwardness broke forth She clasped her hands in pain and her face grew crimson He is not guilty papa I would answer for it with my own life How dare they accuse him how dare they asperse him Is he not Hamish Channing Ellen Ellen Ellen burst into a passionate flood of tears Forgive me papa If he has no one else to take his part I will do it I do not wish to be undutiful and if you bid me never to see or speak to Hamish Channing again I will implicitly obey you but hear him spoken of as guilty I will not I wish I could stand up for him against the world After that Miss Ellen Huntley I think you had better sit down Ellen sat down and cried until she was calm CHAPTER XXXVII THE CONSPIRATORS Nothing of sufficient consequence to record here occurred for some weeks to the Channings or to those connected with them October came in and in a few days would be decided the uncertain question of the seniorship Gaunt would leave the college on the fifth and on the sixth the new senior would be appointed The head master had given no intimation whatever to the school as to which of the three seniors would obtain the promotion and discussion ran high upon the probabilities Some were of opinion that it would be Huntley some Gerald Yorke a very few Tom Channing Countenanced by Gaunt and Huntley as he had been throughout Tom bore on his way amid much cabal but for the circumstance of the senior boy espousing though not very markedly his cause his place would have been unbearable Hamish attended to his customary duties in Guild Street and sat up at night as usual in his bedroom as his candle testified to Judith Arthur tried bravely for a situation and tried in vain he could get nothing given to him no one seemed willing to take him on There was nothing for it but to wait in patience He took the organ daily and copied at home the cathedral music Constance was finding great favour with the Earl of Carrick but you will hear more about that presently Jenkins grew more like a shadow day by day Roland Yorke went on in his impulsive scapegrace fashion mister and missus Channing sent home news hopeful and more hopeful from Germany And Charley unlucky Charley had managed to get into hot water with the college school Thus uneventfully had passed the month of September October was now in and the sixth rapidly approaching What with the uncertainty prevailing the preparation for the examination which on that day would take place and a little private matter upon which some few were entering the college school had just then a busy and exciting time of it Stephen Bywater sat in one of the niches of the cloisters a pile of books by his side Around him in various attitudes were gathered seven of the most troublesome of the tribe Pierce senior George Brittle Tod Yorke Fred Berkeley Bill Simms Mark Galloway and Hurst who had now left the choir but not the school They were hatching mischief Twilight overhung the cloisters the autumn evenings were growing long and this was a gloomy one Half an hour at the very least had the boys been gathered there since afternoon school holding a council of war in covert tones Paid out he shall be by hook or by crook continued Stephen Bywater who appeared to be president if talking more than his confreres constitutes one The worst is how is it to be done One can t wallop him Not wallop him repeated Pierce senior who was a badly disposed boy as well as a mischievous one Why not pray Not to any good said Bywater I can t with that delicate face of his It s like beating a girl That s true assented Hurst No it won t do to go in for beating might break his bones or something I can t think what s the good of those delicate ones putting themselves into a school of this sort A parson s is the place for them eight gentlemanly pupils treated as a private family with a mild usher and a lady to teach the piano The council burst into a laugh at Hurst s mocking tones and Pierce senior interrupted it I don t see why he shouldn t Say she Pierce corrected Mark Galloway She then I don t see why she shouldn t get a beating if she deserves it it will teach her not to try her tricks on again Let her be delicate she ll feel it the more It s all bosh about his being delicate She s not vehemently interrupted Tod Yorke somewhat perplexed in his hurry with the genders Charley Channing s no more delicate than we are It s all in the look As good say that detestable little villain Boulter is delicate because he has yellow curls I vote for the beating I ll vote you out of the business if you show insubordination mister Tod cried Bywater We ll pay out Miss Charley in some way but it shan t be by beating him Couldn t we lock him up in the cloisters as we locked up Ketch and that lot and leave him there all night proposed Berkeley But there d be getting the keys debated Mark Galloway As if we couldn t get the keys if we wanted them scoffingly retorted Bywater We did old Ketch the other time and we could do him again That would not serve the young one out locking him up in the cloisters Wouldn t it though said Tod Yorke He d be dead of fright before morning he s so mortally afraid of ghosts Afraid of what cried Bywater Of ghosts He s a regular coward about them He dare not go to bed in the dark for fear of their coming to him He d rather have five and twenty pages of Virgil to do than he d be left alone after nightfall The notion so tickled Bywater that he laughed till he was hoarse Bywater could not understand being afraid of ghosts Had Bywater met a whole army of ghosts the encounter would only have afforded him pleasure There never was a ghost seen yet as long as any one can remember cried he when he came out of his laughter I d sooner believe in Gulliver s travels than I d believe in ghosts What a donkey you are Tod Yorke It s Charley Channing that s the donkey not me cried Tod fiercely I tell you if we locked him up here for a night we should find him dead in the morning when we came to let him out Let s do it What to find him dead in the morning exclaimed Hurst You are a nice one Tod Oh well I don t mean altogether dead you know acknowledged Tod But he d have had a mortal night of it All his clothes gummed together from fright I ll lay I don t think it would do deliberated Bywater A whole night twelve hours that would be and in a fright all the time if he is frightened Look here I have heard of folks losing their wits through a thing of the sort I won t go in for anything of the kind said Hurst Charley s not a bad lot and he shan t be harmed A bit of a fright or a bit of a whacking not too much of either that ll be the thing for Miss Channing Tod Yorke who told you he was afraid of ghosts demanded Bywater Oh I know it said Tod Annabel Channing was telling my sisters about it for one thing but I knew it before We had a servant once who told us so she had lived at the Channings Some nurse frightened him when he was a youngster and they have never been able to get the fear out of him since What a precious soft youngster he must have been said mister Bywater She used to get a ghost and dress it up and show it off to Miss Charley Get a ghost Tod Bother you know what I mean said Tod testily Get a broom or something of that sort and dress it up with a mask and wings and he is as scared over it now as he ever was I don t care what you say Look here exclaimed Bywater starting from his niche as a bright idea occurred to him Let one of us personate a ghost and appear to him That would be glorious It would give him a precious good fright for the time and no harm done If the boys had suddenly found the philosopher s stone it could scarcely have afforded them so much pleasure as did this idea It was received with subdued shouts of approbation the only murmur of dissent to be heard was from Pierce senior Pierce grumbled that it would not be half serving him out Yes it will said Bywater Pierce senior shall be the ghost he tops us all by a head Hurst is as tall as Pierce senior That he is not interrupted Pierce senior who was considerably mollified at the honour being awarded to him Hurst is not much above the tips of my ears Besides Hurst is fat and you never saw a fat ghost yet Have you seen many ghosts Pierce mocked Bywater A few in pictures Wretched old scarecrows they always are with a cadaverous face and lantern jaws That s the reason you ll do so well Pierce said Bywater You are as thin as a French herring you know with a yard and a half of throat Pierce received the doubtful compliment flatteringly absorbed in the fine vista of mischief opening before him How shall I get myself up Bywater asked he complaisantly With horns and a tail Horns and a tail be bothered returned Hurst It must be like a real ghost all white and ghastly Of course it must acquiesced Bywater I know a boy in our village that they served out like that interposed Bill Simms who was a country lad and boarded in Helstonleigh They got a great big turnip and scooped it out and made it into a man s face and put a light inside and stuck it on a post where he had to pass at night He was so frightened that he died Cram ejaculated Tod Yorke He did though repeated Simms They knew him before for an awful little coward and they did it to have some fun out of him He didn t say anything at the time didn t scream or anything of that sort but after he got home he was taken ill and the next day he died My father was one of the jury on the inquest He was a little chap with no father or mother a plough boy The best thing if you want to make a ghost said Tod Yorke is to get a tin plate full of salt and gin and set it alight and wrap yourself round with a sheet and hold the plate so that the flame lights up your face You never saw anything so ghastly Scooped out turnips are all bosh I could bring a sheet off my bed said Bywater Thrown over my arm they d think at home I was bringing out my surplice And if A wheezing and coughing and clanking of keys interrupted the proceedings It was mister Ketch coming to lock up the cloisters As the boys had no wish to be fastened in themselves they gathered up their books and waited in silence till the porter was close upon them Then with a sudden war whoop they sprang past him very nearly startling the old man out of his senses and calling forth from him a shower of hard words The above conversation puerile and school boyish as it may seem was destined to lead to results all too important otherwise it would not have been related here You very likely may have discovered ere this that this story of the Helstonleigh College boys is not merely a work of imagination but taken from facts of real life Had you been in the cloisters that night with the boys and you might have been and heard Master William Simms who was the son of a wealthy farmer tell the tale of a boy s being frightened to death you would have known it to be a true one if you possessed any knowledge of the annals of the neighbourhood In like manner the project they were getting up to frighten Charles Channing and Charles s unfortunate propensity to be frightened are strictly true Master Tod Yorke s account of what had imbued his mind with this fear was a tolerably correct one Charley was somewhat troublesome and fractious as a young child and the wicked nurse girl who attended upon him would dress up frightful figures to terrify him into quietness She might not have been able to accomplish this without detection but that missus Channing was at that time debarred from the active superintendence of her household When Charley was about two years old she fell into ill health and for eighteen months was almost entirely confined to her room Judith was much engaged with her mistress and with household matters and the baby as Charley was still called was chiefly left to the mercies of the nurse Not content with frightening him practically she instilled into his young imagination the most pernicious stories of ghosts dreams and similar absurdities But foolish as we know them to be they are not the less horrible to a child s vivid imagination At two or three or four years old it is eagerly opening to impressions and things solemnly related by a mother or a nurse become impressed upon it almost as with gospel truth Let the fears once be excited in this terrible way and not a whole lifetime can finally eradicate the evil I would rather a nurse broke one of my children s limbs than thus poison its fair young mind In process of time the girl s work was discovered discovered by Judith But the mischief was done You may wonder that missus Channing should not have been the first to discover it or that it could have escaped her notice at all for she had the child with her often for his early religious instruction but one of the worst phases of this state of things is the shrinking tenacity with which the victim buries the fears within his own breast He dare not tell his parents he is taught not and taught by fear It may not have been your misfortune to meet with a case of this sort I hope you never will missus Channing would observe that the child would often shudder as with terror and cling to her in an unaccountable manner but having no suspicion of the evil she attributed it to a sensitive timid temperament What is it my little Charley she would say But Charley would only bury his face the closer and keep silence When Martha that was the girl s name not the same Martha who was now living at Lady Augusta s came for him he would go with her willingly cordially It was not her he feared On the contrary he was attached to her she had taught him to be so and he looked upon her as a protector from those awful ghosts and goblins Well the thing was in time discovered but the mischief I say was done It could not be eradicated Charles Channing s judgment and good sense told him that all those bygone terrors were only tricks of that wretched Martha s but overcome the fear he could not All consideration was shown to him he was never scolded for it never ridiculed his brothers and sisters observed to him entire silence upon the subject even Annabel and mister and missus Channing had done reasoning lovingly with him now It is not argument that will avail in a case like this In the broad light of day Charley could be very brave would laugh at such tales with the best of them but when night came and he was left alone if he ever was left alone then all the old terror rose up again and his frame would shake and he would throw himself on the bed or on the floor and hide his face afraid of the darkness and of what he might see in it He was as utterly unable to prevent or subdue this fear as he was to prevent his breathing He knew it in the sunny morning light to be a foolish fear utterly without reason but in the lonely night there it came again and he could not combat it Thus it is easy to understand that the very worst subject for a ghost trick to be played upon was Charley Channing It was however going to be done The defect for it really is a defect had never transpired to the College school who would not have spared their ridicule or spared Charley Reared in that point under happier auspices they could have given nothing but utter ridicule to the fear Chattering Annabel in her thoughtless communications to Caroline and Fanny Yorke had not bargained for their reaching the ears of Tod and Tod when the report did reach his ears remembered to have heard the tale before until then it had escaped his memory Charley had got into hot water with some of the boys Bywater had been owing him a grudge for weeks on account of Charley s persistent silence touching what he had seen the day the surplice was inked and now there arose another grudge on Bywater s score and also on that of others There is not space to enter into the particulars of the affair it is sufficient to say that some underhand work touching cribs came to the knowledge of one of the under masters and came to him through Charley Channing Not that Charley went open mouthed and told there was nothing of that disreputable character which the school held in especial dislike the sneak about Charles Channing Charley would have bitten his tongue out first By an unfortunate accident Charles was pinned by the master and questioned and he had no resource but to speak out In honour in truth he could not do otherwise but the consequence was punishment to the boys and they turned against him Schoolboys are not famous for being swayed by the rules of strict justice and they forgot to remember that in Charles Channing s place they would at any rate most of them have felt bound to do the same They visited the accident upon him and were determined as you have heard them express it in their own phrase to serve him out Leaving this decision to fructify let us turn to Constance Lady Augusta Yorke good hearted in the main liberal natured swayed by every impulse as the wind had been particularly kind to Constance and Annabel Channing during the absence of their mother Evening after evening she would insist upon their spending at her house Hamish one of Lady Augusta s lasting favourites probably from his good looks being pressed into the visit with them by my lady Hamish was nothing loth He had given up indiscriminate evening visiting and since the coolness which had arisen in the manner of mister Huntley Hamish did not choose to go much to mister Huntley s where he had been a pretty constant visitor before and he found his evenings hang somewhat heavily on his hands Thus Constance saw a good deal of the Earl of Carrick or it may be more to the purpose to say the earl saw a good deal of her For the earl grew to like her very much indeed He grew to think that if she would only consent to become his wife he should be the happiest man in ould Ireland and one day impulsive in his actions as was ever Lady Augusta he told Constance so in that lady s presence Constance much as we may regret to hear it of her behaved in by no means a dignified manner She laughed over it When brought to understand which took some little time that she was actually paid that high compliment she laughed in the earl s face He was as old as her father and Constance had certainly regarded him much more in the light of a father than a husband I do beg your pardon Lord Carrick she said apologetically but I think you must be laughing at me Laughing at ye said the earl It s not I that would do that I d like ye to be Countess of Carrick to morrow me dear if you can only get over me fifty years and me grey hair Here s me sister she knows that I d like to have ye It s you that are laughing at me Miss Constance at me ould locks No indeed indeed it is not that said Constance while Lady Augusta sat with an impassive countenance I don t know why I laughed It so took me by surprise that was why I think Please do not say any more about it Lord Carrick Ye could not like me as well as ye like William Yorke Is that it child Constance grew crimson Like him as she liked William Yorke Ye re the nicest girl I have seen since Kathleen Blake resumed the straightforward simple earl She promised to have me she said she liked me grey hair better than brown and me fifty years better than thirty but while I was putting the place a bit in order for her she went and married a young Englishman Did ye ever see him Augusta turning to his sister He is a baronet He came somewhere from these parts Lady Augusta intimated stiffly that she had not the honour of the baronet s acquaintance She thought her brother was making a simpleton of himself and had a great mind to tell him so And since Kathleen Blake went over to the enemy I have not seen anybody that I d care to look twice at till I came here and saw you Miss Constance resumed the earl And if ye can only get to overlook the natural impediments on me side and not mind me being poor I d be delighted me dear if ye d say the word You are very kind very generous Lord Carrick said Constance with an impulse of feeling but I can only beg you never to ask me such a thing again Ah well child I see ye re in earnest good naturedly responded the earl as he gave it up I was afraid ye d only laugh at me I knew I was too old And that was the beginning and the ending of Lord Carrick s wooing Scarcely worth recording you will think But there was a reason for doing so CHAPTER XXXVIII THE DECISION The important sixth of October important to the Helstonleigh College boys did not rise very genially On the contrary it rose rather sloppily A soaking rain was steadily descending and the streets presented a continuous scene of puddles The boys dashed through it without umbrellas I never saw one of them carry an umbrella in my life and don t believe the phenomenon ever was seen their clean surplices on their arms on their way to attend ten o clock morning prayers in the cathedral The day was a holiday from school but not from morning service The college bell was beginning to ring out as they entered the schoolroom Standing in the senior s place and calling over the roll was Tom Channing the acting senior for a few brief hours Since Gaunt s departure the previous day Tom Channing had been head of the school it lay in the custom of the school for him so to be Would his place be confirmed or would he lose it Tom looked flurried with suspense It was not so much being appointed senior that he thought of as the disgrace the humiliation that would be his portion were he deposed from it He knew that he deserved the position that it was his by right he stood first on the rolls and he had done nothing whatever to forfeit it He was the school s best scholar and if he was not always a perfect model for conduct there was this much to be said in his favour that none of them could boast of being better The opinion of the school had been veering round for the last few days in favour of Tom I do not mean that he personally was in better odour with it not at all the snow ball touching Arthur had gathered strength in rolling but in favour of his chances of the seniorship Not a breath of intimation had the head master given except that one day in complaining to Gaunt of the neglect of a point of discipline in the school which point was entirely under the control of the senior boy he had turned to Tom and said Remember Channing it must be observed for the future Tom s heart leaped within him as he heard it and the boys looked inquiringly at the master But the master s head was then buried in the deep drawer of his desk hunting for a lost paper Unless he had spoken it in forgetfulness which was not improbable there could be no doubt that he looked upon Tom as Gaunt s successor The school so interpreted it and chose to become amongst themselves sullenly rebellious As to Tom who was nearly as sanguine in temperament as Hamish his hopes and his spirits went up to fever heat One of the last to tear through the street splashing his jacket and splashing his surplice was Harry Huntley He like all the rest took care to be in time that morning There would have been no necessity for his racing however had he not lingered at home talking He was running down from his room whither he had gone again after breakfast to give the finishing brush to his hair I can tell you that some of those college gentlemen were dandies when mister Huntley s voice was heard calling him into the breakfast room Harry said he I don t think that I need enjoin you not to suffer your manner to show triumph towards Tom Channing should you be promoted over him to day I shan t be papa Channing will have the seniorship How do you know that Oh from something Pye let drop We look upon it that Channing is as good as senior mister Huntley remembered the tenor of the private conversation the master had held with him and believed his son would find himself mistaken and that he Harry would be made senior That it would be Gerald Yorke mister Huntley did not believe At any rate Harry take heed to what I say he resumed Be very considerate and courteous towards your friend Channing if you should obtain it Do not let me have to blush for my son s ill feeling There was a tone in mister Huntley s voice which to Harry s ears seemed to intimate that he did not speak without reason Papa it would not be fair for me to go up over Channing he impulsively said No Comparing your merits together Channing is the better man of the two Harry laughed He is not worse at all events Why are you saying this papa Because I fancy that you are more likely to be successful than Tom Channing I wish I may be mistaken I would rather he had it for personally he had done nothing to forfeit it If Harry could accept the seniorship and displace Tom Channing I would not care to call him my brother again interrupted Ellen Huntley with a flashing eye It is not that Ellen you girls don t understand things retorted Harry If Pye displaces Tom from the scholarship he does not do it to exalt me he does it because he won t have him at any price Were I to turn round like a chivalrous Knight Templar and say I d not take it out of regard to my friend Tom where would be the good Yorke would get hoisted over me and I should be laughed at for a duffer But I ll do as you like papa he added turning to mister Huntley If you wish me not to take the honour I ll resign it in favour of Yorke I never expected it to be mine so it will be no disappointment I always thought we should have Channing Your refusing it would do no good to Channing said mister Huntley And I should have grumbled at you Harry had you suffered Yorke to slip over your head Every one in his own right All I repeat to you my boy is behave as you ought to Tom Channing Possibly I may pay the college school a visit this morning Harry opened his eyes to their utmost width You papa Whatever for That is my business laughed mister Huntley It wants only twenty minutes to ten Harry Harry at the hint bounded into the hall He caught up his clean surplice placed there ready for him and stuck his trencher on his head when he was detained by Ellen Harry boy it s a crying wrong against Tom Channing Hamish never did it Hamish interrupted Harry with a broad grin A sign who you are thinking of mademoiselle Mademoiselle turned scarlet You know I meant to say Arthur stupid boy It s a crying wrong Harry upon Tom Channing Looking at it in the worst light he has been guilty of nothing to forfeit his right If you can help him to the seniorship instead of supplanting him be a brave boy and do it God sees all things I shall be late as sure as a gun impatiently returned Harry And away he sped through the rain and mud never slackening speed till he was in the college schoolroom He hung up his trencher flung his surplice on to a bench and went straight up with outstretched hand to Tom Channing who stood as senior unfolding the roll Good luck to you old fellow cried he in a clear voice that rang through the spacious room I hope with all my heart that you ll be in this post for many a day Thank you Huntley responded Tom And he proceeded to call over the roll though his cheek burnt at sundry hisses that came in subdued tones from various parts of the room Every boy was present Not a king s scholar but answered to his name and Tom signed the roll for the first time Channing acting senior Not Channing senior yet It was a whim of mister Pye s that on Sundays and saints day that is whenever the king s scholars had to attend service the senior boy should sign the roll They then put on their surplices and rather damp surplices some of them were The boys most of them disdained bags let the weather be what it might the surplices like themselves went openly through it Ready in their surplices and trenchers Tom Channing gave the word of command and they were on the point of filing out when a freak took Pierce senior to leave his proper place in the ranks and walk by the side of Brittle Halt said Channing Pierce senior take your place I shan t returned Pierce Who is to compel me he added with a mocking laugh We are without a senior for once I will thundered Tom his face turning white at the implied sneer the incipient disobedience I stand here as the school s senior now whatever I may do later and I will be obeyed Return to your proper place There was that in Tom s eye in Tom s tone that somehow over awed mister Pierce and he walked sheepishly to his own place There was no mistaking that Channing would make a firm senior The boys proceeded two and two decorously through the cloisters snatching off their trenchers as they entered the college gates Tom and Huntley walked last Tom bearing the keys The choir gained the two branched off right and left Huntley placing himself at the head of the boys on the left or cantori side Tom assuming his place as acting senior on the decani When they should sit next in that cathedral would their posts be reversed The dean was present also three canons doctor Burrows who was subdean doctor Gardner and mister Mence The head master chanted and in the stall next to him sat Gaunt Gaunt had discarded his surplice with his schoolboy life but curiosity with regard to the seniorship brought him amongst them again that day I hope you ll keep the place Channing he whispered to him as he passed the boys to get to his stall Arthur Channing was at his place at the organ Ere eleven o clock struck service was over and the boys marched back again Not to the schoolroom into the chapter house The examination which took place once in three years was there held It was conducted quite in a formal manner mister Galloway as chapter clerk being present to call over the roll The dean the three prebendaries who had been at service the head and other masters of the school all stood together in the chapter house and the king s scholars wearing their surplices still were ranged in a circle before them The dean took the examination doctor Burrows asked a question now and then but the dean chiefly took it There is neither space nor time to follow it in detail here and no one would care to read it if it were given As a whole the school acquitted itself well doing credit to its masters One of the chapter it was doctor Gardner and the only word he spoke throughout remarked that the head boy was a sound scholar meaning Tom Channing The business over the dean s words of commendation spoken then the head master took a step forward and cleared his throat He addressed himself to the boys exclusively for what he had to say had reference to them and himself alone it was supposed not to concern the clergy As to the boys those who were of an excitable temperament looked quite pale with suspense now the long expected moment was come Channing Huntley Yorke which of the three would it be The praise bestowed upon you gentlemen by the Dean and Chapter has been if possible more gratifying to myself than to you It would be superfluous in me to add a word to the admonition given you by the Very Reverend the Dean as to your future conduct and scholarly improvement I can only hope with him that they may continue to be such as to afford satisfaction to myself and to those gentlemen who are associated with me as masters in the collegiate school A pause and a dead silence The head master cleared his throat again and went on The retirement of William Gaunt from the school renders the seniorship vacant I am sorry that circumstances to which I will not more particularly allude prevent my bestowing it upon the boy whose name stands first upon the rolls Thomas Ingram Channing I regret this the more that it is not from any personal fault of Channing s that he is passed over and this fact I beg may be most distinctly understood Next to Channing s name stands that of Henry Huntley and to him I award the seniorship Henry Huntley you are appointed senior of Helstonleigh Collegiate School Take your place The dead silence was succeeded by a buzz a murmur suppressed almost as soon as heard Tom Channing s face turned scarlet then became deadly white It was a cruel blow Huntley with an impetuous step advanced a few paces and spoke up bravely addressing the master I thank you sir for the honour you have conferred upon me but I have no right to it either by claim or merit I feel that it is but usurping the place of Channing Can t you give it to him please sir instead of to me The speech begun formally and grandly enough for a royal president at a public dinner and ending in its schoolboy fashion drew a smile from more than one present No was all the answer vouchsafed by mister Pye but it was spoken with unmistakable emphasis and he pointed his finger authoritatively to the place already vacated by Tom Channing Huntley bowed and took it and the next thing seen by the boys was mister Galloway altering the roll He transposed the names of Channing and Huntley The boys bowing to the clergy filed out and proceeded to the schoolroom the masters following them Tom Channing was very silent Huntley was silent Yorke feeling mad with everyone was silent In short the whole school was silent Channing delivered the keys of the school to Huntley and mister Pye with his own hands took out the roll and made the alteration in the names For the roll belonging to the chapter house was not as you may have thought the every day roll of the schoolroom Take care what you are about Huntley said the master A careless senior never finds favour with me Very well sir replied Huntley But he was perfectly conscious as he spoke that his chief fault as senior would be that of carelessness And Gaunt who was standing by and knew it also telegraphed a significant look to Huntley The other masters went up to Huntley shook hands and congratulated him for that was the custom of the school indeed it was for that purpose only that the masters had gone into the schoolroom where they had that day no business Gaunt followed suit next in shaking hands and congratulating and the school afterwards Gerald Yorke doing his part with a bad grace Thank you all said Harry Huntley But it ought to have been Tom Channing Poor Tom s feelings during all this may be imagined The king s scholars were slinging their surplices on their arms to depart for they had full holiday for the remainder of the day when they were surprised by the entrance of mister Huntley He went straight up to the head master nodding pleasantly to the boys right and left Well and who is your important senior he gaily demanded of the master Henry Huntley mister Huntley drew in his lips For another s sake I am sorry to hear it But I can only express my hope that he will do his duty I have just been telling him so observed the master What brings me here is this sir continued mister Huntley to the master Knowing there was a doubt as to which of the three senior boys would be chosen I wished should it prove to be my son to speak a word about the Oxford exhibition which I believe generally accompanies the seniorship It falls due next Easter Yes said mister Pye Then allow me to decline it for my son replied mister Huntley He will not need it and therefore should not stand in the light of any other boy I deemed it well sir to state this at once Thank you warmly responded the head master He knew that it was an unselfish not to say generous act mister Huntley approached Tom Channing He took his hand he shook it heartily with every mark of affection and respect You must not allow this exaltation of Harry to lessen the friendship you and he entertain for each other he said in tones that reached every pair of ears present and not one but was turned up to listen You are more deserving of the place than he and I am deeply sorry for the circumstances which have caused him to supplant you Never mind Tom bear on bravely lad and you ll outlive vexation Continue to be worthy of your noble father continue to be my son s friend there is no boy living whom I would so soon he took pattern by as by you The hot tears rushed into Tom s eyes and his lip quivered But that he remembered where he was he might have lost his self control Thank you sir he answered in a low tone Whew whistled Tod Yorke as they were going out A fine friend he is A thief s brother A thief s brother A thief s brother was the echo But he s not our senior Ha ha that would have been a good joke He s not our senior And down the steps they clattered and went splashing home as they had come they and their surplices through the wet streets and the rain CHAPTER XXXIX THE GHOST The moon was high in the heavens Lighting up the tower of the cathedral illuminating its pinnacles glittering through the elm trees bringing forth into view even the dark old ivy on the prebendal houses A fair night all too fair for the game that was going to be played in it When the Helstonleigh College boys resolved upon what they were pleased to term a lark and to do them justice they regarded this their prospective night s work in no graver light they carried it out artistically with a completeness a skill worthy of a better cause Several days had they been hatching this laying their plans arranging the details it would be their own bungling fault if it miscarried But the college boys were not bunglers Stripped of its details the bare plot was to exhibit a ghost in the cloisters and to get Charley Charming to pass through them The seniors knew nothing of the project Huntley it was the day following his promotion would have stopped it at once careless as he was Tom Channing would have stopped it Gerald Yorke might or might not but Tod had taken care not to tell Gerald And Griffin who was burning to exercise in any way his newly acquired power would certainly have stopped it They had been too wise to allow it to come to the knowledge of the seniors The most difficult part of the business had been old Ketch but that was managed The moonlight shone peacefully on the Boundaries and the conspirators were stealing up by ones and twos to their place of meeting round the dark trunks of the elm trees Fine as it was overhead it was less so under foot The previous day you may remember had been a wet one the night had been wet and also the morning of the present day Schoolboys are not particularly given to reticence and a few more than the original conspirators had been taken into the plot They were winding up now in the weird moonlight for the hour was approaching Once more we must pay a visit to mister Ketch in his lodge at his supper hour mister Ketch had changed his hour for that important meal Growing old with age or with lumbago he found early rest congenial to his bones as he informed his friends so he supped at seven and retired betimes Since the trick played him in the summer he had taken to have his pint of ale brought to him deeming it more prudent not to leave his lodge and the keys to fetch it This was known to the boys and it rendered their plans a little more difficult mister Ketch I say sat in his lodge having locked up the cloisters about an hour before sneezing and wheezing for he was suffering from a cold caught the previous day in the wet He was spelling over a weekly twopenny newspaper borrowed from the public house by the help of a flaring tallow candle and a pair of spectacles of which one glass was out Cynically severe was he over everything he read as you know it was in the nature of mister Ketch to be As the three quarters past six chimed out from the cathedral clock his door was suddenly opened and a voice called out Beer mister Ketch s ale had arrived But the arrival did not give that gentleman pleasure and he started up in what but for the respect we bear him we might call a fury Dashing his one eyed glasses on the table he attacked the man What d ye mean with your beer at this time o night It wants a quarter to seven Haven t you no ears haven t you no clock at your place D ye think I shall take it in now Well it just comes to this said the man who was the brewer at the public house and made himself useful at odd jobs in his spare time if you don t like to take it in now you can t have it at all of my bringing I m going up to t other end of the town and shan t be back this side of ten mister Ketch with much groaning and grumbling took the ale and poured it into a jug of his own a handsome jug that had been in the wars and lost its spout and handle giving back the other jug to the man You serve me such a imperant trick again as to bring my ale a quarter of a hour aforehand that s all snarled he The man received the jug and went off whistling he had the pleasure of knowing mister Ketch and his temper well That gentleman closed his door with a bang and proceeded to take out his customary bread and cheese Not that he had any great love for a bread and cheese supper as a matter of fancy he would very much have preferred something more dainty only dainties and mister Ketch s pocket did not agree They want to be took down a notch that public sending out a man s beer a quarter afore seven when it ain t ordered to come till seven strikes Much they care if it stops a waiting and flattening Be I a slave that I should be forced to swallow my supper afore I want it just to please them They have a sight too much custom that s what it is He took a slight draught of the offending ale and was critically surveying the loaf before applying to it that green handled knife of his whose elegance you have heard of when a second summons was heard at the door a very timid one this time mister Ketch flung down the bread and the knife What s the reason I can t get a meal in quiet Who is it There was no response to this beyond a second faint tapping Come in roared out he Pull the string o the latch But nobody came in in spite of this lucid direction and the timid tapping which seemed to proceed from very small knuckles was repeated again mister Ketch was fain to go and open it A young damsel of eight or so in a tattered tippet and a large bonnet probably her mother s stood there curtseying Please sir mister Ketch is wanted mister Ketch was rather taken to at this strange address and surveyed the messenger in astonishment Who be you and who wants him growled he Please sir it s a gentleman as is waiting at the big green gates was the reply mister Ketch is to go to him this minute he told me to come and say so and if you didn t make haste he should be gone Can t you speak plain snarled Ketch Who is the gentleman Please sir I think it s the bishop This put Ketch in a flutter The big green gates could only have reference to the private entrance to the bishop s garden which entrance his lordship used when attending the cathedral That the bishop was in Helstonleigh Ketch knew he had arrived that day after a short absence what on earth could he want with him Never doubting in his hurry the genuineness of the message Ketch pulled his door to and stepped off the young messenger having already decamped The green gates were not one minute s walk from the lodge though a projecting buttress of the cathedral prevented the one from being in sight of the other and old Ketch gained them and looked around Where was the bishop The iron gates the garden the white stones at his feet the towering cathedral all lay cold and calm in the moonlight but of human sight or sound there was none The gates were locked when he came to try them and he could not see the bishop anywhere He was not likely to see him Stephen Bywater who took upon himself much of the plot s performance of which to give him his due he was boldly capable had been on the watch in the street near the cathedral for a messenger that would suit his purpose Seeing this young damsel hurrying along with a jug in her hand possibly to buy beer for her home supper he waylaid her Little ninepins would you like to get threepence asked he You shall have it if you ll carry a message for me close by Little ninepins had probably never had a whole threepence to herself in her young life She caught at the tempting suggestion and Bywater drilled into her his instructions finding her excessively stupid in the process Perhaps that was all the better Now you mind you are not to say who wants mister Ketch unless he asks repeated he for about the fifth time as she was departing to do the errand If he asks say you think it s the bishop So she went and delivered it But had old Ketch s temper allowed him to go into a little more questioning he might have discovered the trick Bywater stealthily followed the child near to the lodge screening himself from observation and as soon as old Ketch hobbled out of it he popped in snatched the cloister keys from their nail and deposited a piece of paper folded as a note on Ketch s table Then he made off Back came Ketch after a while He did not know quite what to make of it but rather inclined to the opinion that the bishop had not waited for him He might have wanted me to take a errand round to the deanery soliloquized he And this thought had caused him to tarry about the gates so that he was absent from his lodge quite ten minutes The first thing he saw on entering was the bit of paper on his table He seized and opened it grumbling aloud that folks used his house just as they pleased going in and out without reference to his presence or his absence The note written in pencil purported to be from Joseph Jenkins It ran as follows My old father is coming up to our place to night to eat a bit of supper and he says he should like you to join him which I and missus J shall be happy if you will at seven o clock It s tripe and onions Yours J JENKINS Now if there was one delicacy known to this world more delicious to old Ketch s palate than another it was tripe seasoned with onions His mouth watered as he read He was aware that it was to use the phraseology of Helstonleigh tripe night On two nights in the week tripe was sold in the town ready dressed This was one of them and Ketch anticipated a glorious treat In too great a hurry to cast so much as a glance round his lodge crafty Bywater had been deep not stopping even to put up the bread and cheese away hobbled Ketch as fast as his lumbago would allow him locking safely his door and not having observed the absence of the keys He ain t a bad sort that Joe Jenkins allowed he conciliated beyond everything at the prospect the invitation held out and talking to himself as he limped away towards the street He don t write a bad hand neither It s a plain un not one o them new fangled scrawls that you can t read Him and his wife have held up their heads a cut above me oh yes they have though for all Joe s humbleness but the grand folks be a coming to Old Jenkins has always said we d have a supper together some night him and me I suppose this is it I wonder what made him take and have it at Joe s If Joe don t soon get better than he have looked lately The first chime of the cathedral clock giving notice of the hour seven Old Ketch broke out into a heat and tried to hobble along more quickly Seven o clock What if through being late his share of supper should be eaten Peering out every now and then from the deep shade cast by one of the angles of the cathedral and as swiftly and cautiously drawn back again was a trencher apparently watching Ketch As soon as that functionary was fairly launched on his way the trencher came out completely and went flying at a swift pace round the college to the Boundaries It was not worn by Bywater Bywater by the help of the stolen keys was safe in the cloisters absorbed with his companions in preparations for the grand event of the night In point of fact they were getting up Pierce senior Their precise mode of doing that need not be given They had requisites in abundance having disputed among themselves which should be at the honour of the contribution and the result was an undue prodigality of material There s seven exclaimed Bywater in an agony as the clock struck Make haste Pierce the young one was to come out at a quarter past If you re not ready it will ruin all I shall be ready and waiting if you don t bother was the response of Pierce I wonder if old Ketch is safely off What a stunning fright Ketch would be in if he came in here and met the ghost exclaimed Hurst He d never think it was anything less than the Old Gentleman come for him A chorus of laughter which Hurst himself hushed It would not do for noise to be heard in the cloisters at that hour There was nothing to which poor Charley Channing was more sensitive than to ridicule on the subject of his unhappy failing his propensity to fear and there is no failing to which schoolboys are more intolerant Of moral courage that is of courage in the cause of right Charles had plenty of physical courage little Apart from the misfortune of having had supernatural terror implanted in him in childhood he would never have been physically brave Schoolboys cannot understand that this shrinking from danger I speak of palpable danger which they call cowardice nearly always emanates from a superior intellect Where the mental powers are of a high order the imagination unusually awakened danger is sure to be keenly perceived and sensitively shrunk from In proportion will be the shrinking dread of ridicule Charles Channing possessed this dread in a remarkable degree you may therefore judge how he felt when he found it mockingly alluded to by Bywater On this very day that we are writing of Bywater caught Charles and imparted to him in profound confidence an important secret a choice few of the boys were about to play old Ketch a trick obtain the keys and have a game in the cloisters by moonlight A place in the game he said had been assigned to Charles Charles hesitated Not because it might be wrong so to cheat Ketch Ketch was the common enemy of the boys of Charley as of the rest but because he had plenty of lessons to do This was Bywater s opportunity he chose to interpret the hesitation differently So you are afraid Miss Charley Ho ho Do you think the cloisters will be dark that the moon won t keep the ghosts away I say it can t be true what I heard the other day that you dare not be in the dark lest ghosts should come and run away with you Nonsense Bywater returned Charley changing colour like a conscious girl Well if you are not afraid you ll come and join us sarcastically returned Bywater We shall have stunning good sport There ll be about a dozen of us Rubbish to your lessons you need not be away from them more than an hour It won t be dark Miss Channing After this fearing their ridicule nothing would have kept Charley away He promised faithfully to be in the cloisters at a quarter past seven Accordingly the instant tea was over he got to his lessons Tom at one side of the table who had more in proportion to do than Charles he at the other Thus were they engaged when Hamish entered What sort of a night is it Hamish asked Charles thinking of the projected play Fine replied Hamish Where are they all Constance is in the drawing room giving Annabel her music lesson Arthur s there too I think copying music Silence was resumed Hamish stood over the fire in thought Tom and Charles went on with their studies Oh dear presently exclaimed the latter in a tone of subdued impatience Hamish turned his eyes upon him He thought the bright young face looked unusually weary What is it Charley boy It s this Latin Hamish I can t make it come right And Tom has no time to tell me Bring the Latin here Charles carried his difficulties to Hamish It won t come right repeated he Like missus Dora Copperfield s figures I expect that wouldn t add up said Hamish as he cast his eyes over the exercise book Halloa young gentleman what s this You have been cribbing He had seen in the past leaves certain exercises so excellently well done as to leave no doubt upon the point Charles turned crimson Cribs were particularly objectionable to mister Channing who had forbidden their use so far as his sons were concerned I could not help it Hamish I used the cribs for about a week The desk made me Made you Well confessed Charley there has been a row about the cribbing The rest had cribbed and I had not and somehow through that it came out to the second master He asked me a lot of questions and I was obliged to tell It made the desk savage and they said I must do as they did Which you complied with Nice young gentlemen all of you Only for five or six days Hamish You may see that if you look I am doing my lessons on the square now as I did before And don t go off the square again if you please sir repeated Hamish or you and I may quarrel If mister Channing is not here I am You don t know how tyrannical the college boys are Don t I said Hamish I was a college boy rather longer than you have yet been Master Charley He sat down to the table and so cleared Charley s difficulties that the boy soon went on swimmingly and Hamish left him How do you get on Tom Hamish asked Better than I need was Tom s answer delivered somewhat roughly After the injustice done me yesterday it does not much matter how I get on Hamish turned himself round to the fire and said no more neither attempting to console nor remonstrate Charles s ears were listening for the quarter past seven and the moment it chimed out he left his work took his trencher from the hall and departed saying nothing to any one He went along whistling past doctor Gardner s house past the deanery they and the cathedral tower rising above them looked grey in the moonlight He picked up a stone and sent it right into one of the elm trees some of the birds disturbed from their roost flew out croaking over his head In the old days of superstition it might have been looked upon as an evil omen coupled with what was to follow Ah Charley if you could only foresee what is before you If missus Channing from her far off sojourn could but know what grievous ill is about to overtake her boy Poor Charley suspected nothing He was whistling a merry tune laughing boy like at the discomfiture of the rooks and anticipating the stolen game he and his friends were about to enjoy on forbidden ground Not a boy in the school loved play better than did Master Charles Channing A door on the opposite side of the Boundaries was suddenly opened to give admittance to one who sprung out with a bound It was Gerald Yorke and Charley congratulated himself that they were on opposite sides for he had been warned that this escapade was to be kept from the seniors At that moment he saw a boy come forth from the cloisters and softly whistle to him as if in token that he was being waited for Charley answered the whistle and set off at a run Which of the boys it was he could not tell the outline of the form and the college cap were visible enough in the moonlight but not the face When he gained the cloister entrance he could no longer see him but supposed the boy had preceded him into the cloisters On went Charley groping his way down the narrow passage Where are you he called out There was no answer Once in the cloisters a faint light came in from the open windows overlooking the graveyard A very faint light indeed for the buildings all round it were so high as almost to shut out any view of the sky you must go quite to the window frame before you could see it I s a a y roared Charley again at the top of his voice where are you all Is nobody here There came neither response nor sign of it One faint sound certainly did seem to strike upon his ear from behind it was like the click of a lock being turned Charley looked sharply round but all seemed still again The low dark narrow passage was behind him the dim cloisters were before him he was standing at the corner formed by the east and south quadrangles and the pale burial ground in their midst with its damp grass and its gravestones looked cold and lonely in the moonlight The strange silence it was not the silence of daylight struck upon Charles with dismay You fellows there he called out again in desperation What s the good of playing up this nonsense The tones of his voice died away in the echoes of the cloisters but of other answer there was none At that instant a rook no doubt one of the birds he had disturbed came diving down and flapped its wings across the burial ground The sight of something moving there almost startled Charles out of his senses and the matter was not much mended when he discovered it was only a bird He turned and flew down the passage to the entrance quicker than he had come up it but instead of passing out he found the iron gate closed What could have shut it There was no wind And if there had been ever so boisterous a wind it could scarcely have moved that little low gate for it opened inwards Charles seized it to pull it open It resisted his efforts He tried to shake it but little came of that for the gate was fastened firmly Bit by bit stole the conviction over his mind that he was locked in Then terror seized him He was locked in the ghostly cloisters close to the graves of the dead on the very spot where as idle tales went the monks of bygone ages came out of those recording stones under his feet and showed themselves at midnight Not a step could he take round the cloisters but his foot must press those stones To be locked in the cloisters had been nothing from this point of view for brave grown sensible men such as the bishop Jenkins and Ketch and they had been three in company besides but for many a boy it would have been a great deal and for Charles Channing it was awful That he was alone he never doubted He believed as fully as belief or any other feeling could flash into his horrified mind that Bywater had decoyed him into the cloisters and left him there in return for his refusal to disclose what he knew of the suspicions bearing upon the damaged surplice All the dread terrors of his childhood rose up before him To say that he was mad in that moment might not be quite correct but it is certain that his mind was not perfectly sane His whole body his face his hair grew damp in an instant as of one in mortal agony and with a smothered cry which was scarcely like that of a human being he turned and fled through the cloisters in the vague hope of finding the other gate open It may be difficult for some of you to understand this excessive terror albeit the situation was not a particularly desirable one A college boy in these enlightened days laughs at supernatural tales as the delusions of ignorance in past ages but for those who have had the misfortune to be imbued in infancy with superstition as was Charles Channing the terror still exists college boys though they may be He could not have told had he been collected enough to tell anything what his precise dread was as he flew through the cloisters None can do so at these moments A sort of vampire rises in the mind and they shrink from it though they see not what its exact nature may be but it is a vampire that can neither be faced nor borne Feeling as one about to die feeling as if death in that awful moment might be a boon rather than the contrary Charles sped down the east quadrangle and turned into the north At the extremity of the north side forming the angle between it and the west commenced the narrow passage similar to the one he had just traversed which led to the west gate of entrance A faint glimmering of the white flagged stones beyond this gate gave promise that it was open A half uttered sound of thankfulness escaped him and he sped on Ah but what was that What was it that he came upon in the middle of the north quadrangle standing within the niches A towering white form with a ghastly face telling of the dead a mysterious supernatural looking blue flame lighting it up round about It came out of the niche and advanced slowly upon him An awful cry escaped from his heart and went ringing up to the roof of the cloisters Oh that the good dean sitting in his deanery close to the chapter house could have heard that helpless cry of anguish that doctor Burrows still nearer could have heard it and gone forth into the cloisters with the succour of his presence No no there could be no succour for a spot supposed to be empty and closed Back to the locked gate with perhaps the apparition following him or forward past IT to the open door Which was it to be In these moments there can be no reason to guide the course but there is instinct and instinct took that ill fated child to the open door How he flew past the sight it is impossible to tell Had it been right in front of his path he never would have passed it But it had halted just beyond the niche not coming out very far With his poor hands stretched out and his breath leaving him Charles did get by and made for the door the ghost bringing up the rear with a yell while those old cloister niches when he was fairly gone grew living with moving figures which came out of their dark corners and shrieked aloud with laughter Away he knew not whither away as one who is being pursued by an unearthly phantom deep catchings of the breath as will follow undue bodily exertion telling of something not right within wild low abrupt sounds breaking from him at intervals thus he flew turning to the left which led him towards the river Anywhere from the dreaded cloisters anywhere from the old grey ghostly edifice anywhere in his dread and agony He dashed past the boat house down the steps turning on to the river pathway and Whether the light hung at the boat house deceived his sight whether the slippery mud caused him to lose his footing whether he was running too quickly and could not stop himself in time or whether in his irrepressible fear he threw himself unconsciously in to escape what might be behind him will never be known Certain it is that the unhappy boy went plunge into the river another and a last wild cry escaping him as the waters closed over his head

none	none	mister KETCH S EVENING VISIT 
6904_262305_000002_000000	train-clean-360	It were surely a breach of politeness on our part not to attend mister Ketch in his impromptu evening visit 
6904_262305_000002_000001	train-clean-360	He shuffled along at the very top of his speed his mouth watering while the delicious odour of tripe and onions appeared to be borne on the air to his olfactory nerves so strong is the force of fancy 
6904_262305_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Arrived at his destination he found the shop closed 
none	none	It was missus Jenkins s custom to close at seven from October to April and the shutters had now just been put up 
6904_262305_000002_000004	train-clean-360	mister Ketch seized the knocker on the shop door there was no other entrance to the house and brought it down with a force that shook the first floor sitting room and startled mister Harper the lay clerk almost out of his armchair as he sat before the fire 
none	none	missus Jenkins s maid a young person of seventeen very much given to blacking her face opened it
6904_262305_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Be I in time demanded Ketch his voice shaking 
6904_262305_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 In time for what responded the girl 
6904_262305_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Why for supper said Ketch penetrating into the shop which was lighted by a candle that stood on the counter the one the girl had brought in her hand 
none	none	Is old Jenkins the bedesman come yet
6904_262305_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Old Jenkins ain t here said she 
6904_262305_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 You had better go into the parlour if you re come to supper 
6904_262305_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Ketch went down the shop sniffing curiously 
6904_262305_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Sharp as fancy is he could not say that he was regaled with the scent of onions but he supposed the saucepan lid might be on 
none	none	For as was known to mister Ketch and to other of the initiated in tripe mysteries it was generally thought advisable by good housewives to give the tripe a boil up at home lest it should have become cold in its transit from the vendor s The girl threw open the door of the small parlour and told him he might sit down if he liked sh did not overburden the gentleman with civility Missis ll be here soon said she 
6904_262305_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Ketch entered the parlour and sat down 
6904_262305_000008_000001	train-clean-360	There was a fire in the grate but no light and there were not so far as Ketch could see any preparations yet for the entertainment 
6904_262305_000008_000002	train-clean-360	 They re going to have it downstairs in the kitchen soliloquized he 
6904_262305_000008_000003	train-clean-360	 And that s a sight more comfortabler 
6904_262305_000008_000004	train-clean-360	She s gone out to fetch it I shouldn t wonder he continued alluding to missus Jenkins and sniffing again strongly but without result 
6904_262305_000008_000005	train-clean-360	 That s right she won t let em serve her with short onions she won t she has a tongue of her own 
none	none	I wonder how much beer there ll be He sat on pretty patiently for him about half an hour and then took the liberty of replenishing the fire from a coal box that stood there Another quarter of an hour was passed much more impatiently when Ketch began to grow uneasy and lose himself in all sorts of grave conjectures Could she have arrived too late and found the tripe all sold and so had stopped out to supper herself somewhere 
6904_262305_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Such a thing as a run on the delicacy had occurred more than once to Ketch s certain knowledge and tardy customers had been sent away disappointed to wait in longing anticipations for the next tripe night 
6904_262305_000009_000002	train-clean-360	He went into a cold perspiration at the bare idea 
6904_262305_000009_000003	train-clean-360	And where was old Jenkins all this time that he had not come in 
6904_262305_000009_000004	train-clean-360	And where was Joe 
6904_262305_000009_000005	train-clean-360	A pretty thing to invite a gentleman out to an impromptu supper and serve him in this way 
6904_262305_000009_000006	train-clean-360	What could they mean by it 
6904_262305_000010_000000	train-clean-360	He groped his way round the corner of the shop to where lay the kitchen stairs whose position he pretty well knew and called 
6904_262305_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 Here Sally Betty whatever your name is ain t there nobody at home 
6904_262305_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The girl heard and came forth the same candle in hand 
6904_262305_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 Who be you calling to I d like to know 
6904_262305_000011_000002	train-clean-360	My name s Lidyar if you please 
none	none	Where s your missis responded Ketch suffering the name to drop into abeyance Is she gone out for the tripe
6904_262305_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Gone out for what tripe asked the girl 
6904_262305_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 What be you talking of 
6904_262305_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 The tripe for supper said Ketch 
6904_262305_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 There ain t no tripe for supper replied she 
6904_262305_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 There is tripe for supper persisted Ketch 
6904_262305_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 And me and old Jenkins are going to have some of it 
6904_262305_000016_000002	train-clean-360	There s tripe and onions 
6904_262305_000017_000000	train-clean-360	The girl shook her head 
6904_262305_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 I dun know nothing about it 
6904_262305_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Missis is upstairs fixing the mustard 
6904_262305_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Oh come this gave a promise of something 
6904_262305_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Old Ketch thought mustard the greatest condiment that tripe could be accompanied by in conjunction with onions 
6904_262305_000018_000002	train-clean-360	But she must have been a long time fixing the mustard whatever that might mean 
6904_262305_000018_000003	train-clean-360	His spirits dropped again and he grew rather exasperated 
6904_262305_000018_000004	train-clean-360	 Go up and ask your missis how long I be to wait he growled 
none	none	I was told to come here at seven for supper and now it s a most eight 
6904_262305_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The girl possibly feeling a little curiosity herself came up with her candle 
none	none	Master ain t so well to night remarked she
6904_262305_000019_000002	train-clean-360	 He s gone to bed and missis is putting him a plaster on his chest 
6904_262305_000020_000000	train-clean-360	The words fell as ice on old Ketch 
6904_262305_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 A mustard plaster shrieked he 
6904_262305_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 What else but a mustard plaster she retorted 
6904_262305_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 Did you think it was a pitch 
6904_262305_000021_000002	train-clean-360	There s a fire lighted in his room and she s making it there 
6904_262305_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Nothing more certain 
6904_262305_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Poor Jenkins who had coughed more than usual the last two days perhaps from the wet weather and whose chest in consequence was very painful had been ordered to bed this night by his wife when tea was over 
6904_262305_000022_000002	train-clean-360	She had gone up herself as soon as her shop was shut to administer a mustard plaster 
6904_262305_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Ketch was quite stunned with uncertainty 
6904_262305_000022_000004	train-clean-360	A man in bed with a plaster on his chest was not likely to invite company to supper 
6904_262305_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Before he had seen his way out of the shock or the girl had done staring at him missus Jenkins descended the stairs and joined them having been attracted by the conversation 
none	none	She had slipped an old buff dressing gown over her clothes in her capacity of nurse and looked rather en deshabille certainly not like a lady who is about to give an entertainment
6904_262305_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 He says he s come to supper tripe and onions said the girl unceremoniously introducing mister Ketch and the subject to her wondering mistress 
6904_262305_000025_000000	train-clean-360	missus Jenkins not much more famous for meekness in expressing her opinions than was Ketch turned her gaze upon that gentleman 
none	none	What do you say you have come for asked she
6904_262305_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I have come for supper that s what I have come for shrieked Ketch trembling 
6904_262305_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Jenkins invited me to supper tripe and onions and I d like to know what it all means and where the supper is 
6904_262305_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 You are going into your dotage said missus Jenkins with an amount of scorn so great that it exasperated Ketch as much as the words themselves 
6904_262305_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 You ll be wanting a lunatic asylum next 
6904_262305_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Tripe and onions If Jenkins was to hint at such a thing as a plate of tripe coming inside my house I d tripe him 
none	none	There s nothing I have such a hatred to as tripe and he knows it
6904_262305_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Is this the way to treat a man foamed Ketch disappointment and hunger driving him almost into the state hinted at by missus Jenkins 
6904_262305_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Joe Jenkins sends me down a note an hour ago to come here to supper with his old father and it was to be tripe and onions 
none	none	It is tripe night he continued rather wandering from the point of argument as tears filled his eyes You can t deny as it s tripe night
6904_262305_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Here Lydia open the door and let him out cried missus Jenkins waving her hand imperatively towards it 
6904_262305_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 And what have you been at with your face again continued she as the candle held by that damsel reflected its light 
6904_262305_000029_000002	train-clean-360	 One can t see it for colly 
6904_262305_000029_000003	train-clean-360	If I do put you into that mask I have threatened you won t like it girl 
6904_262305_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Hold your tongue old Ketch or I ll call mister Harper down to you 
6904_262305_000029_000005	train-clean-360	Write a note 
none	none	What else 
6904_262305_000029_000007	train-clean-360	He has wrote no note he has been too suffering the last few hours to think of notes or of you either 
none	none	You are a lunatic it s my belief
6904_262305_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall be drove one sobbed Ketch 
6904_262305_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 I was promised a treat of 
none	none	Is that door open Lydia There Take yourself off 
6904_262305_000031_000003	train-clean-360	My goodness me disturbing my house with such a crazy errand And taking old Ketch by the shoulders who was rather feeble and tottering from lumbago and age missus Jenkins politely marshalled him outside and closed the door upon him 
6904_262305_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Insolent old fellow she exclaimed to her husband to whom she went at once and related the occurrence 
6904_262305_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 I wonder what he ll pretend he has next from you 
6904_262305_000032_000002	train-clean-360	A note of invitation indeed 
6904_262305_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear said Jenkins revolving the news and speaking as well as his chest would allow him it must have been a trick played him by the young college gentlemen 
6904_262305_000033_000001	train-clean-360	We should not be too hard upon the poor old man 
6904_262305_000033_000002	train-clean-360	He s not very agreeable or good tempered I m afraid it must be allowed but I d not have sent him away without a bit of supper my dear 
6904_262305_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I dare say you d not retorted missus Jenkins 
6904_262305_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 All the world knows you are soft enough for anything 
6904_262305_000034_000002	train-clean-360	I have sent him away with a flea in his ear that s what I have done 
6904_262305_000035_000000	train-clean-360	mister Ketch had at length come to the same conclusion the invitation must be the work of the college gentlemen 
none	none	Only fancy the unhappy man standing outside missus Jenkins s inhospitable door 
6904_262305_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Deceived betrayed fainting for supper done out of the delicious tripe and onions he leaned against the shutters and gave vent to a prolonged and piteous howl 
6904_262305_000035_000003	train-clean-360	It might have drawn tears from a stone 
6904_262305_000036_000000	train-clean-360	In a frame of mind that was not enviable he turned his steps homeward clasping his hands upon his empty stomach and vowing the most intense vengeance upon the college boys 
6904_262305_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The occurrence naturally caused him to cast back his thoughts to that other trick the locking him into the cloisters in which Jenkins had been a fellow victim and he doubled his fists in impotent anger 
6904_262305_000036_000002	train-clean-360	 This comes of their not having been flogged for that he groaned 
6904_262305_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Engaged in these reflections of gall and bitterness old Ketch gained his lodge unlocked it and entered 
6904_262305_000037_000001	train-clean-360	No wonder that he turned his eyes upon the cloister keys the reminiscence being so strong within him 
6904_262305_000038_000000	train-clean-360	But to say he turned his eyes upon the cloister keys is a mere figure of speech 
6904_262305_000038_000001	train-clean-360	No keys were there 
6904_262305_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Ketch stood a statue transfixed and stared as hard as the flickering blaze from his dying fire would allow him 
6904_262305_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Seizing a match box he struck a light and held it to the hook 
none	none	The keys were not there 
6904_262305_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Ketch was no conjuror and it never occurred to him to suspect that the keys had been removed before his own departure 
6904_262305_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 How had them wicked ones got in he foamed 
6904_262305_000039_000002	train-clean-360	 Had they forced his winder had they took a skeleton key to his door had they come down the chimbley 
none	none	They were capable of all three exploits and the more soot they collected about em in the descent the better they d like it 
6904_262305_000039_000004	train-clean-360	He didn t think they d mind a little fire 
6904_262305_000039_000005	train-clean-360	It was that insolent Bywater or that young villain Tod Yorke or that undaunted Tom Channing or perhaps all three leagued together 
none	none	Nothing wouldn t tame them 
6904_262305_000040_000000	train-clean-360	He examined the window he examined the door he cast a glance up the chimney 
6904_262305_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Nothing however appeared to have been touched or disturbed and there was no soot on the floor 
6904_262305_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Cutting himself a piece of bread and cheese lamenting at its dryness and eating it as he went along he proceeded out again locking up his lodge as before 
none	none	Of course he bent his steps to the cloisters going to the west gate And there perhaps to his surprise perhaps not he found the gate locked just as he might have left it himself that very evening and the keys hanging ingeniously by means of the string from one of the studded nails right over the keyhole
6904_262305_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 There ain t a boy in the school but what ll come to be hung danced old Ketch in his rage 
6904_262305_000043_000000	train-clean-360	He would have preferred not to find the keys but to go to the head master with a story of their theft 
6904_262305_000043_000001	train-clean-360	It was possible it was just possible that going keys in hand the master might refuse to believe his tale 
6904_262305_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Away he hobbled and arrived at the house of the head master 
none	none	Check the first The master was not at home He had gone to a dinner party 
6904_262305_000044_000003	train-clean-360	The other masters lived at a distance and Ketch s old legs were aching What was he to do 
6904_262305_000044_000004	train-clean-360	Make his complaint to some one he was determined upon 
6904_262305_000044_000005	train-clean-360	The new senior Huntley lived too far off for his lumbago so he turned his steps to the next senior s Tom Channing and demanded to see him 
6904_262305_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Tom heard the story which was given him in detail 
6904_262305_000045_000001	train-clean-360	He told Ketch and with truth that he knew nothing about it but would make inquiries in the morning 
6904_262305_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Ketch was fain to depart and Tom returned to the sitting room and threw himself into a chair in a burst of laughter 
6904_262305_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 What is the matter they asked 
6904_262305_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 The primest lark returned Tom 
6904_262305_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 Some of the fellows have been sending Ketch an invitation to sup at Jenkins s off tripe and onions and when he arrived there he found it was a hoax and missus Jenkins turned him out again 
6904_262305_000047_000002	train-clean-360	That s what Master Charley must have gone after 
none	none	Hamish turned round Where is Charley by the way
6904_262305_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Gone after it there s no doubt replied Tom 
6904_262305_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 Here s his exercise not finished yet and his pen left inside the book 
none	none	Oh yes that s where he has gone CHAPTER XLI THE SEARCH Tom where is Charles He is not in my pocket responded Tom Charming who was buried in his studies as he had been for some hours Thomas that is not the proper way to answer me resumed Constance in a tone of seriousness for it was from her the question had proceeded It is strange he should run out in the abrupt way you describe and remain out so long as this It is half past nine I am waiting to read The boys are up to some trick to night with mister Calcraft Constance and he is one of them said Tom He is sure to be in soon Constance remained silent not satisfied A nameless undefined sort of dread was creeping over her Engaged with Annabel until eight o clock when she returned to the general sitting room she found Charles absent much to her surprise Expecting him to make his appearance every moment the time may have seemed to her long and his absence all the more unaccountable It had now gone on to half past nine and still he was not come in and his lessons were not done It was his hour for bed time Tom had more than usual to do that night and it was nearly ten when he rose from his books Constance watched him put them aside and stretch himself Then she spoke Tom you must go and find Charles I begin to feel uneasy Something must have happened to keep him out like this The feeling uneasy rather amused Tom Previsions of evil are not apt to torment schoolboys I expect the worst that has happened may be a battle royal with old Ketch said he However the young monkey had no business to cut short his lessons in the middle and go off in this way so I ll just run after him and march him home Tom took his trencher and flew towards the cathedral He fully expected the boys would be gathered somewhere round it not a hundred miles from old Ketch s lodge But he could not come upon them anywhere The lodge was closed was dark and silent showing every probability that its master had retired for the night to sleep away his discomfiture The cloisters were closed and the Boundaries lay calm in the moonlight undisturbed by a single footstep There was no sign of Charles or of any other college boy Tom halted in indecision Where can he have gone to I wonder I m sure I don t know where to look for him I ll ask at Yorke s If there s any mischief up Tod s sure to know of it He crossed the Boundaries and rang at Lady Augusta s door Tod himself opened it Probably he thought it might be one of his friends the conspirators certainly he had not expected to find Tom Channing there and he looked inclined to run away again Tod Yorke do you know anything of Charles Law how should I know anything of him returned Tod taking courage and putting a bold face upon it Is he lost He is not lost I suppose but he has disappeared somewhere Were you in the game with old Ketch to night What game inquired Tod innocently But at this moment Gerald hearing Tom s voice came out of the sitting room Gerald Yorke had a little cooled down from his resentment against Tom Since the decision of the previous day nearly all Gerald s wrath had been turned upon mister Pye because that gentleman had not exalted him to the seniorship So great was it that he had no room to think of Tom Besides Tom was a fellow sufferer and had been passed over equally with himself What s the row asked Gerald Tom explained stating what he had heard from Ketch of the trick the boys had played him and Charley s absence Gerald who really was not cognizant of it in any way listened eagerly making his own comments and enjoying beyond everything the account of Ketch s fast in the supper department Both he and Tom exploded with mirth and Tod who said nothing but listened with his hands in his pockets dancing first on one leg then on the other nearly laughed himself into fits What did they take out the cloister keys for demanded Gerald Who s to know said Tom I thought Tod was sure to be in it Don t I wish I had been responded that gentleman turning up the whites of his eyes to give earnestness to the wish Gerald looked round at Tod a faint suspicion stealing over him that the denial was less genuine than it appeared In point of fact mister Tod s had been the identical trencher spoken of as having watched the effect of the message upon old Ketch I say Tod you were off somewhere to night for about two hours said Gerald I ll declare you were I know I was said Tod readily I had an appointment with Mark Galloway and I went to keep it If you skinned me alive Channing I couldn t tell you where Miss Charley is or where he s likely to be True enough in the abstract Tom Channing stopped talking a short time longer and then ran home Is Charley in yet was his first question No Charley was not in and the household now became seriously concerned It was past ten By leaving his lessons half done and his pen inside his exercise book of which exercise he had not left many words to complete but he had other studies to do it was evident to them that he had not gone out intending to remain away Indeed if he wanted to go out in an evening he always asked leave and mentioned where he was going Haven t you found him exclaimed Judith coming forward as Tom entered Where in the world can the child be Oh he s safe somewhere said Tom Don t worry your old head Judy It s fit that somebody should worry their heads retorted Judith sharply to Tom He never stopped out like this before never Pray Heaven there s no harm come nigh him Well done Judy was Tom s answer Harm What harm is likely to have come to him Helstonleigh has not been shaken by an earthquake to night to swallow him up and I don t suppose any greedy kite has descended from the skies and carried him off in her talons You ll make a simpleton of that boy till he s twenty Judith who truth to say did look very much after Charley loved him and indulged him wasted no more words on infidel Tom but went straight up to Hamish s room and knocked at the door Hamish was in it at his writing table as usual and Judith heard a drawer opened and shut before he came to her mister Hamish it s very queer about the child said Judith I don t half like it What Has he not come in No he s not And just to look how he has left his books and his lessons about is enough to prove that something or other must have kept him I declare my heart s all in a quake Master Tom has been out and can find no traces of him though it s hard to tell whether he troubled himself to look much Boys are as careless one of another as so many young animals I will come down directly Judith He shut the door right in front of Judith s inquisitive nose which was peering in to ascertain what there might be to see Judith s curiosity in reference to her young master s night employment had increased rather than abated Every night night after night as Hamish came home with the account books of the office under his arm and carried them straight to his bedroom Judith watched him go up with jealous eyes Constance also watched him watched him in a far more uneasy frame of mind than could be Judith s Bringing home those books now in mister Channing s absence was only too plain a proof to Constance that his night work must be connected with them and a perfectly sick feeling would rush over her Surely there could be nothing wrong with the accounts Hamish closed the door shutting out Judy She heard him putting things away heard a lock turned and the keys removed Then he came forth and went down with Judith The difficulty was where to look for Charles It was possible that he might have gone to the houses of any one of the schoolboys and be staying there if not very likely still it was by no means impossible Tom was despatched to mister Pye s who had some half dozen of the king s scholars boarding in his house and thence to other houses in the neighbourhood All with the same result all denied knowledge of Charles The college bell struck eleven the sound booming out in the silence of the night on their listening ears and with that sound Hamish grew alarmed They went out different ways Hamish Arthur Tom and Judith Sarah was excessively anxious to make one of the searching party but Judith imperatively ordered her to stop at home and mind her own business Judy ran round and about the college like any one wild nothing extra on her shoulders and the border of her mob cap flying But the old red walls were high silent and impenetrable revealing nothing of Charles Channing She stopped at the low wall extending from the side of the boat house to some of the prebendal residences and glanced over at the river The water was flowing tranquilly between its banks giving no sign that a young child was drowning or had been drowned there not many hours before No said Judy to herself rejecting the doubt which had come over her as improbable he can t have got in there We should have heard of it She turned and took a survey around She did not know what to do or where to look Still cold shadowy it all lay the cathedral the old houses the elm trees with their birds at rest now Where can he have got to exclaimed Judith with a touch of temper One thing was certain it was of no use to wait where she was and Judith went herself home again Just beyond the house of Lady Augusta Yorke she encountered the head master who was walking towards his home He said Good night to Judith as he passed her but she arrested him We are in a fine way sir We can t find Master Charles Not find Master Charles repeated mister Pye How do you mean Why it happened in this way sir said Judith He was at his lessons as usual with Master Tom and he suddenly gets up and leaves them and goes out without saying a word to nobody That was at seven or a bit later and he has never come in again He must be staying somewhere remarked mister Pye So we all thought sir till it got late He s not likely to be staying anywhere now Who d keep him till this hour terrifying of us all into fits Ketch Holloa Judy Any luck The interruption came from Tom Channing He had discerned Judy s cap from the other side of the Boundaries and now came running across unconscious that her companion was the head master Judy went on with her communication Ketch the porter came to Master Tom an hour or two ago complaining that the college boys had been serving him a trick to night They had pretended to invite him out somewhere to supper and stole his cloister keys while he was gone Now sir I d not like to say too much against that surly tempered brown bear went on Judy but if he has had anything to do with keeping the child out he ought to be punished Tom was up now saw it was the master and touched his trencher Have you found your brother asked the master No sir It is very strange where he can have got to What tricks have the boys been playing Ketch to night resumed mister Pye Your servant tells me that he has been round to you to complain of them Tom went into a white heat Judy ought to have kept her mouth shut It was not his place to inform against the school privately to the master Y es he hesitatingly said for an untruth he would not tell What was the complaint continued mister Pye Could this disappearance of your brother s be connected with it No sir I don t see that it could replied Tom You don t see Perhaps you ll allow me to see and judge What had the boys been doing Channing firmly spoke the master perceiving his hesitation I insist upon knowing Tom was at his wits ends He might not defy the master on the one hand on the other he knew the school would send him to Coventry for ever and a day if he spoke as he himself would have sent any other boy in it doing the same thing He heartily wished Judy had been in Asia before she had spoken of it and her tongue with her Were you in the affair yourself pray asked the master No sir indeed I was not and I do not know a single boy who was I have heard nothing of it except from Ketch Then what is your objection to tell me Well sir you know the rules we hold amongst ourselves said Tom blurting out the truth in his desperation I scarcely dare tell you Yes you dare Channing when I command you to do so was the significant answer Tom had no resource left and very unwillingly Ketch s details were drawn from him bit by bit The sham invitation the disappointment touching the tripe and onions the missing the cloister keys when he reached home and the finding them outside the west door Did he enter the cloisters and examine them said the master speaking hastily A possibility had struck him which had not struck any of the Channings and it was curious that it had not done so I think not sir replied Tom Then that s where Charles is locked up in the cloisters said the master the recollection of the former locking up no doubt helping him to the conclusion The fact of the keys having been left hanging outside the cloister door might have been sufficient to direct your suspicions Tom felt the force of the words and was wondering how it was he had not thought of it when a cry burst from Judith If he is there he will never come out alive Oh sir what will become of us The master was surprised He knew it was not a desirable situation for any young boy but never come out alive were strong terms Judy explained them She poured into the master s ears the unhappy story of Charles having been frightened in childhood of his propensity still to supernatural fears Make haste round we must have the cloisters opened immediately exclaimed the master as all the full truth of the dread imparted by Judith became clear to him Channing you have light heels run on and knock up Ketch Tom tore off never a lighter pair of heels than his to night and the master and the old servant followed The master s sympathies nay his lively fears were strongly awakened and he could not leave the affair in this stage late though the hour was They arrived to find Tom pummelling at Ketch s door But to pummel was one thing and to arouse mister Ketch was another mister Ketch chose to remain deaf I ll try the window said Tom He must hear his bed is close at hand He knocked sharply and it at length elicited an answer from the drowsy gentleman composed of growls and abuse Get up called out Tom The keys of the cloisters are wanted Then they may be wanted responded old Ketch in a muffled tone as if he were speaking from under the bed clothes I ll see you all furder before you get the keys from me Ketch produce the keys this instant interposed the master You know my voice mister Pye s How dare you I ll dare you all if you don t go away raved old Ketch mistaking or pretending to mistake the disturbers for his enemies the college boys It s a second edition of the trick you played me this evening is it I ll go to the dean with the first glimmer o daylight Ketch I am the head master I have come for the cloister keys There s a boy locked in the cloisters Is there Praise be given up for that I wouldn t unlock him for a mint o diaments If you don t be off I ll call the police Fire fire shouted Judy in a shrill tone putting her mouth to the keyhole for she despaired of gaining Ketch by any other means What an idiot you are old Ketch Do you want to be burnt up alive Fire shouted Tom in stentorian tones Fire fire And Ketch whether he was really alarmed or whether he recognized the head master s voice and thought it imprudent to hold out any longer tumbled out of bed opened the door and appeared before them in attire more airy than elegant Another minute and impetuous Tom would have burst the window in Beg pardon said Ketch ungraciously to the master Them boys play me up such tricks that I m always thinking of em Where s the fire I don t think it s anywhere said the master The cloister keys Ketch and make haste Which of the boys played you that trick to night Ketch gave a yell for the point was a sore one I never set eyes on one of em They re too cunning for me Was my brother Charles one asked Tom while mister Pye hastened away with the cloister keys I tell ye I never see d one Can t you believe Tom did believe and went after the master and Judy They entered the cloisters and shouted for Charles Nothing answered them but the echoes To see whether he was there was impossible Judy thought he might be lying somewhere insensible from fright and she ran up and down feeling into niches as one demented mister Pye sent Tom back to old Ketch s for a light which was not supplied without difficulty He was turning away with it when Hamish came up Hamish had been with all speed to mister Huntley s to question Harry as senior of the school whether he knew what the trick of the night had been and what boys were in it Harry however who was in bed assured Hamish of his complete ignorance But for mister Huntley s veto he would have got up and gone out to join in the search and enjoyed it amazingly They carried the candle to every nook and corner of the cloisters no result arising from it Hamish and Tom climbed over and searched the burial ground He was not there No signs for their keen eyes or for any others remained of the night s work the college boys were cautious A couple of matches half burnt lay on the ground in the north quadrangle but they told nothing The boys were often lighting matches as the master knew I really think you must be mistaken in supposing Charles s absence has to do with this trick played upon old Ketch whatever it may have been he observed It does not appear that the boys have been in the cloisters Had any of them been locked in here here they would be still There was no denying it and they left the cloisters and closed them The keys were conveyed to Ketch who had to get out of bed again to receive them which he did with a great amount of wrath mister Pye thought it would be proved that Charles must be at the house of one of the boys carelessness or accident having detained him And then he wished them good night and went home Completely at a loss were they Hamish ever hopeful thought Charles had perhaps returned home and they bent their steps thither No no Constance Arthur and curious Sarah were all outside looking every way Constance was too agitated to remain indoors Arthur had just returned home He had been to the houses of some of the college boys those with whom Charles was most intimate but could obtain no tidings of him Constance burst into tears She grew excessively alarmed when Judy mentioned the doubt lest he had been shut in the cloisters But that fear is done away with said Hamish We have searched them thoroughly Do not distress yourself Constance There goes midnight exclaimed Judy Ugh shivered Sarah I feel just as if somebody was walking over my grave Judith If they were walking over you it mightn t be amiss reprimanded Judith Don t talk such stuff as that girl in the young mistress s ears The words died away into silence and they stood listening to the strokes of the deep toned cathedral bell With the last twelve another day had dawned upon the world What would it bring forth for them I shall go to the police station said Hamish Constance my dear you had better not remain outside Go indoors It was well to say Go indoors but in the agitation and suspense at that moment overwhelming Constance indoors was not so easy to bear Hamish strode off Tom following him Arthur remained with his sister waiting and watching still And so they waited and watched through the livelong night Hamish was at work the police were at work Tom was at work but neither sign nor trace could be found of Charles Channing CHAPTER XLII AN OFFICIAL CEREMONY INTERRUPTED A grey dusky morning enveloped in fog succeeded to the fine night Before seven o clock so watchful and alert are boys when mischief is afloat most of those who had been in the conspiracy were assembled and waiting round the schoolroom doors Generally they could tear up at the twelfth moment They would not have missed the sight of Charles Channing s arrival for half a crown apiece so curious were they to see how he looked after his fright As it happened it was not at any of their homes that inquiries had been made the previous night not one of them was to say intimate with Charley they were most of them older than he Consequently they knew nothing of the search Tod Yorke who did know of it had not yet arrived Of all the king s scholars none were marked late more frequently than Master Tod The senior boy had gone to the head master s for the keys as usual and now came down the cloisters clanking them in his hand Has Charles Channing turned up he called out before he was well abreast of them Pierce senior choked away his inclination to laughter which the sound of the name excited and saucy Bywater answered Where should he turn up from Huntley Has he been swallowed Hamish Channing came to our house last night ages after I was in bed saying they couldn t find him replied Huntley What was in the wind last night with old Calcraft The boys looked at him demurely and Huntley receiving no reply unlocked the schoolroom and entered it They remained behind winking at each other and waiting still for Charles It wanted yet a few minutes to seven I say what d ye think whispered Bywater After I had got our sheet smuggled in all right and was putting it on the bed I found two big holes burnt in it Won t there be a commotion when my old aunt finds it out She ll vow I have been reading in bed That was you Pierce senior I m sure I never burnt it retorted Pierce It was the flame did it if anything Here comes Bill Simms exclaimed Bywater when their smothered laugh was over What has he been doing to himself He s as white as the ghost mister Bill Simms assuredly did look white He had a pale face at the best of times and it was embellished with straw coloured hair But at the present moment it had turned ghastly and his frame seemed shaking as he came along What on earth has taken you Simms demanded Hurst Oh goodness uttered Simms I wish I was well out of this They are saying there s a college boy drowned What cried the boys gathering round him There was a crowd down by the boat house as I came along responded Simms as well as he could speak for his chattering teeth I asked a fellow what it was and he said he didn t rightly know but he thought one of the college boys had been found drowned in the water Some of the gentlemen listeners faces turned as pale as mister Bill Simms s as pale as each conscience Bywater was the first to gather courage It s not obliged to be Charley Channing if there is any one drowned But it s sure to be him chattered Simms his teeth as crazy as his grammar Griffin junior says Arthur Channing went to their house last night at twelve and said they couldn t find Charley The consternation into which this news plunged the guilty ones is not easily described A conviction that it was Charles Channing who was drowned overtook them all Schoolboys are not quite without hearts and they would have given all they possessed in that moment to see Charles come flying amongst them as usual Some of them began to wish they were without necks for if Charles had come to an untimely end through their work they might stand a chance of furnishing employment to the veritable mister Calcraft on their own score Tod Yorke came leaping up in delight Oh wasn t it good The young one Hold your noise Tod They are saying he s dead Who s dead wondered Tod Charley Channing A college boy was found in the river drowned Oh that be hanged exclaimed Tod half in mocking disbelief half in awful fear It can t be you know Who says it There s seven We must go in or Huntley will be on to us Mind added Pierce senior for he was the speaker we must all keep each other s counsel and be in one tale that we know nothing at all about it They slunk into school But that the senior boy was occupied with his new duty the calling over of the roll he might have observed that something was wrong To play up a bit of mischief is the legitimate privilege of college boys but to have led to a companion s death is a terror striking affair and their countenances betrayed that it was so Before the roll was finished the head master was in school Tom Channing it was late for him entered afterwards The master beckoned to him Is Charles found No sir We cannot learn any tidings of him at all We have not been to bed any of us and the police are searching also Had Tom Channing come from the other side of the Boundaries near the boat house perhaps he might have been able to give a different account The master made no comment then He motioned Tom to his desk and gave the word for prayers As the boys were rising from their knees Hamish Channing entered the school attended by mister Ketch Hamish approached the master who shook hands with him Ketch remained snarling and grinning defiance at the door shaking his fist and his old teeth covertly at the boys If looks could have blown up a room the college school had certainly gone aloft then I hear you have not found the boy said the master to Hamish It is very singular We have not found him mister Pye continued Hamish gravely I come to demand of your courtesy an immediate investigation into the doings of the college boys last night That the disappearance of Charles is in some measure connected with it we cannot do otherwise than believe I have brought Ketch with me that he may tell his own tale Ketch was marshalled forward and ordered to tell his tale and the business of the school was suspended Ketch told it distinctly enough but he could not forbear enlarging upon his cruel disappointment over the tripe and onions and it sent the school into convulsions In the midst of it Tom Channing breathed freely Ketch s preferring the complaint did away with the unpleasantness he had feared might arise through having been forced to disclose it to the master I should be sorry to have displeasure visited upon the boys resumed Hamish Indeed I should esteem it a favour sir if you will not punish them for any disclosure that may arise through this step which I have taken I dare say he added turning his laughing gaze upon them that I should have been one of the ringleaders myself in my school days therefore it would not be fair for me to bring punishment upon them I only wish to know which of the school were in it that I may make inquiries of them whether Charles was one of them or not and if he was what they know of his movements afterwards The address was fair and candid so was Hamish s face and some of the conspirators in their good feeling might have freely confessed but for the something just whispered to them by Simms That closed their lips Do you hear said the master speaking sharply for he had rather ten times over that the school frankly avowed mischief when brought to book he was never half so severe if they were so Why are you silent Bill Simms who had the bump of conscientiousness largely developed with a wholesome dread of consequences besides being grievously timid felt that he could not hold out long Oh murder he groaned to Mark Galloway next to whom he sat let s tell and have done with it Mark turned cold with fear You re a pretty fellow he uttered giving him a tremendous kick on the shins Would you like us all to be tried for our lives A suggestion which made matters worse and Bill Simms s hair began to stand on end Huntley have you any cognizance of this demanded mister Pye None sir And so said the three seniors under him Boys said the master bringing his cane down upon the desk in a manner he was accustomed to do when provoked I will come to the bottom of this business That several of you were in it I feel sure Is there not one of you sufficiently honest to speak when required so to do Certain of the boys drooped their conscious faces and their eyelids As to Bill Simms he felt ready to faint What have you done with Charles Channing thundered the master Where have you put him Where is he gone I command you to speak Let the senior of those who were in it speak or the consequences be upon your own heads The threat sounded ominous in the ears of Bill Simms he saw himself in prospective exposed to all the horrors of a dungeon and to something worse With a curious noise something between a bark and a groan he flung himself with his face on the floor and lay there howling mister Simms said the master what has taken you Were you the chief actor in this matter All considerations had disappeared from mister Simms s mind except the moment s terror He forgot what would be his own position in the school if he told or as they would have expressed it turned sneak Impelled by fear he was hardly conscious of his words hardly responsible for them It wasn t me he howled They all know I didn t want the trick played upon him I told them that it had killed a boy down by our farm and it might kill Channing They know I told them The master paused Walk here Simms Simms picked himself up from the ground and walked there A miserable object he looked his eyes red his teeth chattering his face white and his straw coloured hair standing on end The master leaned his arms upon his desk and brought his face almost into contact with the frightened one What trick did you play upon Charles Channing Twasn t me sir sobbed Simms I didn t want it done I say O o o o o o h I didn t What trick was played upon him It was a ghost dressed up to frighten him and he passed through the cloisters and saw it It wasn t me I ll never speak another word if it was me A ghost repeated the master in astonishment while Ketch stretched his old neck forward and the most intense interest was displayed by the school They did it with a sheet and a blue flame went on Simms who now that the ice was broken tried to make a clean breast of it and grew more alarmed every moment It wasn t me I didn t want it done and I never lent a hand to the dressing up If little Channing is dead it won t be fair to hang me Who was in the plot was the next question of the master And Simms enumerated them The master stern and grim beckoned to the several gentlemen to walk up and to range themselves before him The lad has run some distance in his terror observed the master aside to Hamish as he remembered what Judith had told him the previous night You will see him home in the course of the day I trust we may replied Hamish with marked emphasis Bit by bit word by word the master drew the whole truth from the downcast lads Pierce senior looked dogged and obstinate he was inwardly vowing unheard of revenge against mister Simms Probably most of them were doing the same I knowed it was them I knowed it couldn t be nobody but them broke forth old Ketch summarily interrupting the proceedings You sees now sir what incorrigible Silence said the master raising his hand I can deal with this without your assistance Ketch Hurst who concocted this infamous plot Hurst who was the senior of the conspirators with regard to his position in the school though not so old as Pierce senior could not answer it definitively It was concocted between them he said not by one more than by another Did you not know that a trick such as this has deprived men of reason continued the master And you play it upon a young and defenceless boy I am at a loss how to express my sense of your conduct If any ill shall have happened to him through it you will carry it on your consciences for ever Remembering what they had just heard the boys consciences had begun to suffer already Who personated the ghost continued the master Pierce senior The answer came from Simms The others would not have given it I might have guessed that was the remark of the master who had no great love for the gentleman named I might have known that if there was a boy in the college school who would delight to put himself forward to trample on one younger and more sensitive than himself it would be Pierce senior I ll give you something to remember this work by mister Pierce Yorke Gerald Yorke knew what he was called for He was the tallest and strongest of all The school knew also and a murmur of excitement went round Pierce senior was going to be hoisted Only in very flagrant cases was the extreme punishment of flogging resorted to by the present master It had been more common with his predecessor Of course its rarity made it all the more impressive when it did come Make ready said the master to Pierce senior unlocking his desk and taking out a birch as big as a besom Pierce turned green and white without help from any blue flame and slowly began to obey There might be no resistance The school hushed itself into suspense and mister Ketch s legs were on the point of taking a dance of ecstasy A minute or two and the group formed the centre of the upper part of the room Yorke supported the great boy whose back was bared while the daunted faces and eager eyes were strained eagerly from around The head master took his place and his birch was raised in the air to come down with a heavy stroke when a commotion was heard at one of the desks and Stephen Bywater rushed forward Stop sir he said to the master If you will let Pierce go I will take the punishment The master s arm with its weapon dropped by his side and he turned his astonished gaze upon Bywater I had more to do with planning the trick than Pierce had sir so it s only just that I should be the scapegoat We fixed upon Pierce to personate the ghost because he was tall and lanky And a flogging is not much to my skin added honest impudent Bywater So you were the planner of it were you mister Bywater demanded the angry master In a great measure I was sir If I do go in for mischief it shall not be said that I let others suffer for it Little Channing had offended me and I wished to serve him out But I never thought to do him harm In the perplexity of deciding what he ought to do when official proceedings were interrupted in this unprecedented way the master hesitated What he would have done is uncertain flogged Pierce first and Bywater afterwards perhaps but at that moment there occurred another interruption and a more serious one Diggs the man who lived at the boat house had entered the school and was asking to speak to the head master Catching sight of the signs of the ceremony about to be performed he waited for no permission but went forward at once a college cap in his hand and his voice trembling with excitement Its excitement was not lessened when he recognized Hamish Channing I am the bearer of bad news gentlemen he said addressing them both I fear one of the young college lads was drowned last night by my boat house We have picked up his cap this morning It was poor little Master Channing Hamish controlled his emotion better than did the reverend mister Pye The latter turned his eyes on the horrified school himself equally horrified and then signified to Pierce senior to dress himself to Bywater to retire to his place The affair has become serious he observed and must be dealt with differently Poor child Poor little Channing And the boys in their emotion broke into an echoing wail Poor little Channing poor little Channing CHAPTER XLIII DRAGGING THE RIVER The echoes of lamentation were dying away in the high roof of the college school Hamish Channing pale but calm and self controlled stood perfectly ready to investigate the account brought by the boat house keeper of the drowning of Charles The feelings of those who had had a hand in the work may be imagined perhaps but certainly cannot be described Bill Simms choked and sobbed and pulled his lanky straw coloured hair and kicked his legs about and was altogether beside himself The under masters looked on with stern countenances and lowering brows while old Ketch never had had such a disappointment in all his life the one grand disappointment of last night excepted as he was feeling now at the deferred flogging Diggs the boat house keeper was a widower with one child a girl of ten years old His mother lived with him an aged woman confined to her bed of late with rheumatic fever from which she was slowly recovering On the previous night Diggs was out and the girl had been sent on an errand missus Diggs being left in the house alone She was lying quietly still as was the air outside when sudden sounds broke that stillness and smote upon her ear Footsteps young steps they seemed were heard to come tearing down on the outside gravel from the direction of the cathedral and descend the steps Then there was a startling cry and a plunge into the river The old woman echoed the cry but there were none to hear it and she was powerless to aid That a human soul was struggling in the water was certain and she called and called but called in vain She was shut up in the house unable to move and there were none outside to hear her In her grief and distress she at length pulled the bed clothes over her ears that she might hear no more if more was to be heard of the death agony Twenty minutes or so and then the girl came in The old woman brought her head from under the clothes and stated what had occurred and the girl went and looked at the river But it was flowing along peacefully showing no signs that anything of the sort had happened Not a creature was on the path on either side so far as her eyes could see in the moonlight and she came to the conclusion that her grandmother must have been mistaken She has odd fancies said the child to herself and thinks she hears things that nobody else never hears At ten o clock Diggs came home Now this man had a propensity for yielding to an infirmity to which many others also yield that of drinking too freely It is true that this did not often occur but when it did happen it was usually at a time when his services were especially required It is very much the case in this world we often do things whether good ones or bad ones just at the wrong moment Diggs arrived at home stupid His old mother called him to her room and told him what she had heard but she could make little impression upon him As his young daughter had done he took a survey of the river but only from the windows of his house the girl had gone on to the bank and then he tumbled into bed and slept heavily until the morning Up betimes he remembered what had been told to him and went out of doors half expecting possibly to see something floating on the surface I was detained out last night on an errand explained he to some three or four stragglers who had gathered round him and when I got in my old mother told me a cock and bull story of a cry and a splash as if somebody had fallen into the river It don t look much like it though A dead dog maybe suggested one of the idlers They re always throwing rubbish into this river on the sly Who is sharply asked Diggs They had better let me catch em at it Lots of folks was the response But if it was a dead dog it couldn t well have cried out Diggs went indoors to his mother s chamber What time was it this tale of yours asked he It was about half past seven she answered The half hour chimed out from the college just before or just after I forget which And then she related again what she knew he could not clearly comprehend over night the fact of the fleet sounding footsteps and that they appeared to be young footsteps If I didn t know the cloisters were shut at that hour I should have thought they come direct from the west door The words were interrupted by a call from below and the man hastened down A boy s cap known from its form to belong to one of the collegiate scholars had just been found under the lower bank lodged in the mud Then some one had been drowned and it was a college boy Where does a crowd collect from I don t believe any one can tell Not three minutes after that trencher was picked up people were gathering thick and threefold retired though the spot was and it was at this time that mister Bill Simms had passed and heard the tale which turned his heart sick and his face white Some time given to supposition to comments and to other gossip indigenous to an event of the sort and then mister Diggs started for the college school with the cap Another messenger ran to the Channings house the name in the cap proving to whom it had belonged Diggs related the substance of this to the master suppressing certain little points bearing upon himself mister Pye took the cap in his hand and looked inside The name C Channing was in missus Channing s writing and in the sprawling hand of one of the schoolboys it looked like Bywater s Miss had been added Charley had scratched the addition over with strokes from a pen but the word might still be read The river must be dragged Diggs said Hamish Channing The drags are being got ready now sir They ll be in by the time I get back Hamish strode to the door Tom came up from his desk showing some agitation and looked at the master You will allow me to go sir I can do no good at my lessons in this suspense Yes replied the master He was going himself The school rose with one accord The under masters rose To think of study in this excitement was futile and in defiance of all precedent the boys were allowed to leave the room and troop down to the river It was a race which should get there first masters and boys ran together The only one who walked pretty soberly was the head master who had to uphold his dignity The drags were already in the river and the banks were lined police friends spectators gentlemen mob and college boys jostled each other Arthur Channing pale and agitated came running from his home The old vergers and bedesmen came some of the clergy came Judy came and the dean came Hamish outwardly self possessed and giving his orders with quiet authority was inwardly troubled as he had never been The boy had been left to his charge and how should he answer for this to his father and mother He went in and saw the old woman as did the renowned mister Butterby who had appeared with the rest She related to them she had heard the previous night I could have told without having heard it now that it was the steps of a college boy she said I don t listen so often to em that I need mistake He seemed to be coming from the west door o the cloisters only that the cloisters are shut at night so he may have come round by the front o the college Desperate quick he ran and leapt down the steps and a minute after there was a cry and a splash and the footsteps were heard no more One might fancy that in turning the corner to run along the towing path he had turned too quick and so fell over the bank Did you hear no noise afterwards questioned Hamish I didn t I called out but nobody came nigh to answer it and then I hid my ears I was afraid ye see They left the old woman s bedside and returned to the crowd on the bank The dean quietly questioned Hamish about the facts and shook his head when put in possession of them I fear there is little hope he said Very little My father and mother s absence makes it the more distressing I know not mister Dean how Who was this pushing vehemently up to the discomfiture of every one elbowing the dean with as little ceremony as he might have elbowed Ketch thrusting Hamish aside and looking down on the river with flashing eyes Who should it be but Roland Yorke For that was his usual way of pushing through a crowd as you have heard before Is it true he gasped Is Charles Channing in the water sent there through the tricks of the college boys of Tod There is little doubt of its truth Roland was the answer of Hamish Roland said no more Off went his coat off went his waistcoat off went other garments leaving him nothing but his drawers and his shirt and in he leaped impetuously before any one could stop him and dived below searching after Charles paying no heed to the shouts that the drags would get hold of him But neither drags nor Roland could find Charles The drags were continued but without result Very few had expected that there would be any result the probability being that the current had carried the body down the stream Hamish had been home to soothe the grief of his sisters or rather to attempt to soothe it and then he came back again Roland his ardour cooled had likewise been home to exchange his wet things for dry ones This done he was flying out again when he came upon the Reverend William Yorke who was hastening down to the scene in some agitation Is the boy found Roland do you know How did it happen Did he fall in Considering the light in which you regard the family William Yorke I wonder you should waste your breath to ask about it was Roland s touchy answer delivered with as much scorn as he could call up mister Yorke said no more but quickened his pace towards the river Roland kept up with him and continued talking It s a good thing all the world s not of your opinion William Yorke You thought to put a slight upon Constance Channing when you told her she might go along for you It has turned out just the best luck that could have happened to her Be silent sir said mister Yorke his pale cheek flushing I have already told you that I will not permit you to mention Miss Channing s name to me You have nothing to do with her or with me You have nothing to do with her at any rate cried aggravating Roland She ll soon belong to your betters William Yorke mister Yorke turned his flashing eye upon him plainly asking the explanation that he would not condescend to ask in words It gave Roland an advantage and he went on swimmingly with his mischief Lord Carrick has seen the merits of Constance if you have not and I don t mind telling it you in confidence has resolved to make her his wife He says she s the prettiest girl he has seen for ages It is not true said mister Yorke haughtily Not true returned Roland You ll see whether it s true or not when she s Countess of Carrick Lady Augusta was present when he made her the offer He was half afraid to make it for some time he told us as he was getting on in years and had grey hair Halloa you are turning pale William Yorke She can t be anything to you You threw her away you know William Yorke vouchsafing no reply broke away from his tormentor He probably did look pale certainly he felt so Roland indulged in a quiet laugh He had been waiting for this opportunity ever since he became cognizant of what had taken place between the earl and Constance The earl had made no secret of his intention and its defeat I ll have some fun over it with mister William had been Roland s thought A sudden noise Cries and shouts on the banks of the river and the dense crowd swayed about with excitement mister Yorke and Roland set off at a run each from his own point and the cries took a distinct sound as they neared them They have found the body It was being laid upon the bank Those who could get near tried to obtain a glimpse of it The college boys with white faces and terror stricken consciences fought for a place Roland Yorke fought for it the head master fought for it I am not sure that the bishop who had seen the commotion from his palace windows and came up to know what it meant did not fight for it A false alarm so far as the present object was concerned A little lad who had been drowned more than a week before had turned up now He had incautiously climbed the parapet of the bridge whence he fell into the water and their search for him had hitherto been fruitless He was not a pleasant sight to look upon as he lay there but the relief to certain of the college boys when they found it was not Charles was immeasurable Bywater s spirits went up to some of their old impudence In looking for one thing you find another quoth he Very true mister Bywater Sometimes we find more than we bargain for The drags were thrown in again and the excited crowd jostled each other as before their faces hanging over the brink Hush Hark Another prize What is it coming up now A rare prize this time The drags pulled and tugged and the men cried Heave ho and a hundred and one voices echoed it Heave ho heave ho Hush Hush sh sh A breathless moment of suspense and up it comes Amidst straw and tangled weeds and mud and the odds and ends that a river will collect something hard and clanking was thrown upon the bank and wondering eyes and faces peered over it Nothing but two keys A pair of large rusty keys tied together with string Bywater and Hurst and young Galloway and one or two more cast significant glances together and were nearly choking with fright and suppressed laughter One standing there conspicuous for his dress which amongst other items comprised an apron turned a significant glance on them Bold Bywater met it and looked a little less bold than usual But the prelate had kept counsel and meant to keep it and he looked away again Once more were the drags thrown into the water Once more the mob gentle and simple crowded its brink When the college bell tolled out for morning prayers those whose duty it was to attend the cathedral drew themselves away unwillingly Arthur Channing was one of them Whatever might be his grief and suspense engagements must be fulfilled Later in the day when the search was over for it was thought useless to continue it and when hope was over a council was held at mister Channing s house mister and missus Channing must be acquainted with this sad business but how was it to be done By letter by telegraph or by a special messenger Constance had suggested writing and silently hoped that Hamish would take the task upon himself for she felt unequal to it in her dire distress mister Galloway who had been in and out all the morning suggested the telegraph Hamish approved of neither but proposed to despatch Arthur to make the communication in person I cannot leave Helstonleigh myself he said therefore it must devolve upon Arthur Of course his journey will be an expense but there are times when expense must not be regarded I consider this one of them A letter would go more quickly said mister Galloway Scarcely in these days of travelling was Hamish s reply But that is not the question A letter let it be ever so explanatory will only leave them in suspense As soon as they have read it five hundred questions will suggest themselves that they will wish to ask and to wait to have them satisfied will be intolerable especially to my mother Arthur s going will obviate this He knows as much as we know and can impart his knowledge to them There is a great deal in what you say mused mister Galloway I am sure there is spoke Constance through her tears though it did not strike me before In mamma s anxiety and suspense she might start for home to learn further details And I think it is what she would do said Hamish if not my father also It will be better that Arthur should go He can tell them all they would learn if they returned and so far as it is possible that would be satisfactory They were interrupted by the entrance of mister Huntley and his daughter Ellen had begged her father when she found he was going to the Channings to allow her to accompany him and see Constance in her distress mister Huntley readily acquiesced The drowning of poor Charley was a serious affliction in contemplation of which he forgot the inexpediency of her meeting Hamish Hamish did not appear to perceive any inexpediency in the matter He was the first to take Ellen s hand in his and bend upon her his sweet smile of welcome Knowing what Ellen knew of mister Huntley s sentiments and that he was looking on it rendered her manner confused and her cheeks crimson She was glad to turn to Constance and strive to say a few words of sympathy Had Harry been one of those wicked thoughtless boys to join in this ghost trick I could never have forgiven him she impulsively exclaimed hot tears running down her cheeks The subject under consideration was referred to mister Huntley and his opinion requested more as a form of courtesy than anything else for Hamish had made up his mind upon the point A thoroughly affectionate and dutiful son was Hamish Channing and he believed that the tidings could be rendered more bearable to his father and mother by a messenger than by any other mode of communication The excuse that Constance and Arthur had throughout found for Hamish in their hearts was that he had taken the bank note out of latent affection to mister and missus Channing You are wrong every one of you said mister Huntley when he had listened to what they had to say You must send neither letter nor messenger It will not do Hamish looked at him Then what can we send sir Don t send at all Not send at all repeated Hamish Certainly not said mister Huntley You have no positive proof as yet that the child is dead It will be alarming them unnecessarily mister Huntley said Constance Is it possible that you see any ground for hope Honestly my dear I do not see much ground for hope he replied But on the other hand there are no positive grounds for despair So long as these grounds are not furnished I say keep it from mister and missus Channing Answer me one thing What good end would it serve to tell them Is it not a duty I do not see it said mister Huntley Were the poor boy s fate known beyond uncertainty it would be a different matter If you send to them what would come of it The very suspense the doubt would have a bad effect upon mister Channing It might bring him home and the good already effected might be destroyed his time purse hopes all that he has given to the journey wasted On the other hand allowing that he still remained the news might delay his cure No my strong advice to you is Suffer them for the present to remain in ignorance of what has happened Hamish began to think mister Huntley might be right I know I am right said mister Huntley If putting them in possession of the facts could produce any benefit to themselves to you or to Charles I would go off myself with Arthur this hour But it could effect nothing and to them it might result in great evil Until we know something more certain ourselves let us keep it from them Yes I see it said Hamish warmly It will be best so Constance felt her arm touched and coloured with emotion when she found it was mister William Yorke In this day of distress people seemed to come in and go out without ceremony mister Yorke had entered with Tom Channing He completely accepted the new view of the matter and strongly advised that it should not be allowed to reach the ears of mister and missus Channing mister Galloway when he was departing beckoned Constance into the hall It was only to give her a word of friendly sympathy of advice not to be overwhelmed but to cling to hope She thanked him but it was with an aching heart for Constance could not feel this hope Will you grant me the favour of a minute s private interview asked mister Yorke stiffly meeting her in the hall Constance hesitated a moment He was asking what she felt he had no right to ask She coloured bowed and stepped towards the drawing room mister Yorke threw open the door for her and followed her in Then he became agitated Whatever his pride or his temper may have been whether the parting between them was his fault or Constance s it was certain that he loved her with an enduring love Until that morning he had never contemplated losing Constance he had surely looked forward to some indefinite future when she should be his and the words spoken by Roland had almost driven him mad Which was precisely what mister Roland hoped they would do I would not speak to you to day when you are in distress when you may deem it an unfitting time for me to speak he began but I cannot live in this suspense Let me confess that what brought me here was to obtain this interview with you quite as much as this other unhappy business You will forgive me mister Yorke I do not know what you can have to speak about she answered with dignity My distress is great but I can hear what you wish to say I heard I heard he spoke with emotion and went plunging abruptly into his subject I heard this morning that Lord Carrick was soliciting you to become his wife Constance could have laughed but for her own distress agitated though he was Well sir she coldly said in a little spirit of mischief Constance you cannot do it he passionately retorted You cannot so perjure yourself mister Yorke Have you the right to tell me I shall or shall not marry Lord Carrick You can t do it Constance he repeated laying his hand upon her shoulder and speaking hoarsely You know that your whole affection was given to me It is mine still I feel that it is You have not transferred it to another in this short time You do not love and forget so lightly Is this all you have to say to me No it is not all he answered with emotion I want you to be my wife Constance not his I want you to forget this miserable estrangement that has come between us and come home to me at Hazledon Listen mister Yorke she said but it was with the utmost difficulty she retained her indifferent manner and kept back her tears she would have liked to be taken then to his sheltering arms never to have left them The cause which led to our parting was the suspicion that fell upon Arthur coupled with something that you were not pleased with in my own manner relating to it That suspicion is upon him still and my course of conduct would be precisely the same were it to come over again I am sorry you should have reaped up this matter for it can only end as it did before Will you not marry me he resumed No So long as circumstances look darkly on my brother Constance that may be for ever Yes she sadly answered knowing what she did know they may never be brighter than they are now Were I tempted to become your wife you might reproach me afterwards for allying you to disgrace and that I think would kill me I beg you not to speak of this again And you refuse me for Lord Carrick You will go and marry him exclaimed mister Yorke struggling between reproach affection and temper You must allow me to repeat that you have no right to question me she said moving to the door When our engagement was forfeited that right was forfeited with it She opened the door to leave the room mister Yorke might have wished further to detain her but Judy came bustling up Lady Augusta s here Miss Constance Lady Augusta Yorke met Constance in the hall and seized both her hands I had a bad headache and lay in bed and never heard of it until an hour ago she uttered with the same impulsive kindness that sometimes actuated Roland Is it true that he is drowned Is it true that Tod was in it Gerald says he was William are you here Constance took Lady Augusta into the general sitting room into the presence of the other guests Lady Augusta asked a hundred questions at the least and they acquainted her with the different points so far as they were cognizant of them She declared that Tod should be kept upon bread and water for a week and she would go to the school and request mister Pye to flog him She overwhelmed Constance with kindness wishing she and Annabel would come to her house and remain there for a few days Constance thanked her and found some difficulty in being allowed to refuse Here is his exercise book observed Constance tears filling her eyes here is the very place in which he laid his pen Every other moment I think it cannot be true that he is gone that it must be all a dream Lady Augusta took up the pen and kissed it it was her impulsive way of showing sympathy mister Huntley smiled Where s William gone to asked Lady Augusta The Reverend William Yorke had quitted the house shaking the dust from his shoes in anger as he crossed the threshold Anger as much at himself for having ever given her up as at Constance Channing and still most at the Right Honourable the Earl of Carrick CHAPTER XLIV mister JENKINS IN A DILEMMA I don t know what you will say to me for introducing you into the privacy of mister and missus Jenkins s bed chamber but it is really necessary to do so We cannot very well get on without it A conjugal dispute had occurred that morning when missus Jenkins got up She was an early riser as was Jenkins also in a general way but since his illness he had barely contrived to come down in time for breakfast On this morning which was not the one following the application of mustard to his chest but one about a week after that medicinal operation missus Jenkins on preparing to descend peremptorily ordered him to remain in bed Nothing need be recorded of the past week except two facts Charles Channing had not been discovered either in life or in death and the Earl of Carrick had terminated his visit and left Helstonleigh I ll bring up your breakfast said missus Jenkins It is of no use to say that Jenkins ventured meekly to remonstrate You know I must get up I say you shall not get up Here you are growing weaker and worse every day and yet you won t take care of yourself Where s the use of your taking a bottle a day of cough mixture where s the use of your making the market scarce of cod liver oil where s the use of wasting mustard if it s all to do you no good Does it do you any good I am afraid it has not as yet confessed Jenkins And never will so long as you give your body and brains no rest Out you go by nine o clock in all weathers ill or well and there you are at your business till evening stooping yourself double over the writing dancing abroad on errands wearing out your lungs with answers to callers There s no sense in it But my dear the office must be attended to said Jenkins with much deference There s no must in the case as far as you are concerned If I say you shan t go to it why you shan t What s the office pray in comparison with a man s life But I am not so ill as to remain away I can still go and do my work You d be for going if you were in your coffin was missus Jenkins s wrathful answer Could you do any good then pray But I am not in my coffin mildly suggested Jenkins Don t I say you d go if you were reiterated missus Jenkins who sometimes in her heat lost sight of the precise point under dispute You know you would you know there s nothing in the whole world that you think of but that office Office office office it is with you from morning till night When you are in your coffin through it you ll be satisfied But it is my duty to go as long as I can my dear It s my duty to do a great many things that I don t do was the answer and one of my duties which I haven t done yet is to keep you indoors for a bit and nurse you up I shall begin from to day and see if I can t get you well that way But Hold your tongue Jenkins I never say a thing but you are sure to put in a but You lie in bed this morning do you hear and I ll bring up your breakfast missus Jenkins left the room with the last order and that ended the discussion Had Jenkins been a free agent free from work he had been only too glad to obey her In his present state of health the duties of the office had become almost too much for him it was with difficulty that he went to it and performed them Even the walk short as it was in the early morning was almost beyond his strength even the early rising was beginning to tell upon him And though he had little hope that nursing himself up indoors would prove of essential service he felt that the rest it brought would be to him an inestimable boon But Jenkins was one who thought of duty before he thought of himself and therefore to remain away from the office if he could drag himself to it appeared to him little less than a sin He was paid for his time and services fairly paid liberally paid some might have said and they belonged to his master But it was not so much from this point of view that Jenkins regarded the necessity of going conscientious though he was as at the thought of what the office would do without him for there was no one to replace him but Roland Yorke Jenkins knew what he was and so do we To lie in bed or remain indoors under these circumstances Jenkins felt to be impossible and when his watch gave him warning that the breakfast hour was approaching up he got Behold him sitting on the side of the bed trying to dress himself trying to do it Never had Jenkins felt weaker or less able to battle with his increasing illness than on this morning and when missus Jenkins dashed in for her quick ears had caught the sounds of his stirring he sat there still stockings in hand unable to help himself So you were going to trick me were you Are you not ashamed of yourself Jenkins Jenkins gasped twice before he could reply A giddiness seemed to be stealing over him as it had done that other evening under the elm trees My dear it is of no use your talking I must go to the office he panted You shan t go if I lock you up There Jenkins was spared the trouble of a reply The giddiness had increased to faintness his sight left him and he fell back on to the bed in a state of unconsciousness missus Jenkins rather looked upon it as a triumph She put him into bed and tucked him up This comes of your attempting to disobey me said she when he had come round again I wonder what would become of you poor soft mortals of men if you were let have your own way There s no office for you to day Jenkins Very peremptorily spoke she But lest he should attempt the same again she determined to put it out of his power Opening a closet she thrust every article of his clothing into it not leaving him so much as a waistcoat turned the key and put it into her pocket Poor Jenkins watched her with despairing eyes not venturing to remonstrate There said she speaking amiably in her glow of satisfaction you can go to the office now if you like I ll not stop you but you ll have to march through the streets leaving your clothes in that closet Under these difficulties Jenkins did not quite see his way to get there missus Jenkins went instead catching mister Roland Yorke just upon his arrival What s up that Jenkins is not here began Roland before she could speak Jenkins is not in a fit state to get out of his bed and I have come to tell mister Galloway so replied she Roland Yorke s face grew to twice its usual length at the news I say though that will never do missus Jenkins What s to become of this office The office must do the best it can without him He s not coming to it I can t manage it said Roland in consternation I should go dead if I had to do Jenkins s work and my own as well He ll go dead unless he takes some rest in time and gets a little good nursing I should like to know how I am to nurse him if he is down here all day That s not the question returned Roland feeling excessively blank The question is how the office and I and Galloway are to get on without him Couldn t he come in a sedan Yes he can if he likes to come without his clothes retorted missus Jenkins I have taken care to lock them up Locked his clothes up repeated Roland in wonder What s that for Because as long as he has a bit of life in him he ll use it to drag himself down here answered missus Jenkins tartly That s why He was getting up to come this morning defying me and every word I said against it when he fell down on the bed in a fainting fit I thought it time to lock his things up then Upon my word I don t know what s to be done resumed Roland growing quite hot with dismay and perplexity at the prospect of some extra work for himself Look here exhibiting the parchments on Jenkins s desk all so neatly left here s an array Jenkins did not intend to stay away when he left those last night I know He intend to stay away catch him thinking of it retorted missus Jenkins It is as I have just told him that he d come in his coffin And it s my firm belief that if he knew a week s holiday would save him from his coffin he d not take it unless I was at his back to make him It s well he has somebody to look after him that s not quite deficient of common sense Well this is a plague grumbled Roland So it is for me I know if for nobody else was missus Jenkins s reply But there s some plagues in the world that we must put up with and make the best of whether we like em or not and this is one of them You ll tell mister Galloway please it will save me waiting However as missus Jenkins was departing she encountered mister Galloway and told him herself He was both vexed and grieved to hear it grieved on Jenkins s score vexed on his own That Jenkins was growing very ill he believed from his own observation and it could not have happened at a more untoward time Involuntarily mister Galloway s thoughts turned to Arthur Channing and he wished he had him in the office still You must turn over a new leaf from this very hour Roland Yorke he observed to that gentleman when he entered We must both of us buckle to if we are to get through the work It s not possible sir that I can do Jenkins s share and mine said Roland If you only do Jenkins s I ll do yours replied mister Galloway significantly Understand me Roland I shall expect you to show yourself equal to this emergency Put aside frivolity and idleness and apply yourself in earnest Jenkins has been in the habit of taking part of your work upon himself as I believe no clerk living would have done and in return you must now take his I hope in a few days he may be with us again Poor fellow we shall feel his loss mister Galloway had to go out in the course of the morning and Roland was left alone to the cares and work of the office It occurred to him that as a preliminary step he could not do better than open the window that the sight of people passing especially any of his acquaintances with whom he might exchange greetings should cheer him on at his hard work Accordingly he threw it up to its utmost extent and went on with his writing giving alternately one look to his task and two to the street Not many minutes had he been thus spurring on his industry when he saw Arthur Channing pass Hist saint saint called out Roland by way of attracting his attention Come in old fellow will you Here s such a game CHAPTER XLV A NEW SUSPICION Arthur Channing had been walking leisurely down Close Street Time hung heavily on his hands In leaving the cathedral after morning service he had joined mister Harper the lay clerk and went with him talking towards the town partly because he had nothing to do elsewhere partly because out of doors appeared more desirable than home In the uncertain state of suspense they were kept in respecting Charles the minds of all from Hamish down to Annabel were in a constant state of unrest When they rose in the morning the first thought was Shall we hear of Charles to day When they retired at bedtime What may not the river give up this night It appeared to them that they were continually expecting tidings of some sort or other and with this expectation hope would sometimes mingle itself Hope where could it spring from The only faint suspicion of it indulged at first that Charley had been rescued in some providential manner and conveyed to a house of shelter had had time to die out A few houses there were half concealed near the river as there are near to most other rivers of traffic which the police trusted just as far as they could see and whose inmates did not boast of shining reputations but the police had overhauled these thoroughly and found no trace of Charley Nor was it likely that they would conceal a child So long as Charles s positive fate remained a mystery suspense could not cease and with this suspense there did mingle some faint glimmer of hope Suspense leads to exertion inaction is intolerable to it Hamish Arthur Tom all would rather be out of doors now than in there might be something to be heard of some information to be gathered and looking after it was better than staying at home to wait for it No wonder then that Arthur Channing s steps would bend unconsciously towards the town when he left the cathedral morning and afternoon It was in passing mister Galloway s office the window of which stood wide open that Arthur had found himself called to by Roland Yorke What is it he asked halting at the window You are the very chap I wanted to see cried Roland Come in Don t be afraid of meeting Galloway he s off somewhere The prospect of meeting mister Galloway would not have prevented Arthur from entering He was conscious of no wrong and he did not shrink as though he had committed one He went in and mister Harper proceeded on his way Here s a go was Roland s salutation Jenkins is laid up It was nothing but what Arthur had expected He like mister Galloway had observed Jenkins growing ill and more ill How shall you manage without him asked Arthur mister Galloway s dilemma being the first thing that occurred to his mind Who s to know answered Roland who was in an explosive temper I don t If Galloway thinks to put it all on my back it s a scandalous shame I never could do it or the half of it Jenkins worked like a horse when we were busy He d hang his head down over his desk and never lift it for two hours at a stretch you know he would not Fancy my doing that I should get brain fever before a week was out Arthur smiled at this Is Jenkins much worse he inquired I don t believe he s worse at all returned Roland tartly He d have come this morning as usual fast enough only she locked up his clothes Who said Arthur in surprise She That agreeable lady who has the felicity of owning Jenkins She was here this morning as large as life giving an account of her doings without a blush She locked up his things she says to keep him in bed I d be even with her I know were I Jenkins I d put on her flounces but what I d come out if I wanted to Rather short they d be for him though I shall go Roland My being here only hinders you As if that made any difference worth counting Look here piles and piles of parchments I and Galloway could never get through them hindered or not hindered I am not going to work over hours I won t kill myself with hard labour There s Port Natal thank goodness if the screw does get put upon me too much Arthur did not reply It made little difference to Roland whether encouraged or not talk he would I have heard of folks being worked beyond their strength and that will be my case if one may judge by present appearances It s too bad of Jenkins Arthur spoke up he did not like to hear blame even from Roland Yorke cast upon patient hard working Jenkins You should not say it Roland It is not Jenkins s fault It is his fault What does he have such a wife for She keeps Jenkins under her thumb just as Galloway keeps me She locked up his clothes and then told him he might come here without them if he liked my belief is she ll be sending him so some day Jenkins ought to put her down He s big enough He would be sure to come here if he were equal to it said Arthur He Of course he would angrily retorted Roland He d crawl here on all fours but what he d come only she won t let him She knows it too She said this morning that he d come when he was in his coffin I should like to see it arrive Arthur had been casting a glance at the papers They were unusually numerous and he began to think with Roland that he and mister Galloway would not be able to get through them unaided Most certainly they would not at Roland s present rate of work It is a pity you are not a quick copyist he said I dare say it is sarcastically rejoined Roland beginning to play at ball with the wafer box I never was made for work and if You will have to do it though sir thundered mister Galloway who had come up and was enjoying a survey of affairs through the open window mister Roland somewhat taken to dropped his head and the wafer box together and went on with his writing as meekly as poor Jenkins would have done and mister Galloway entered Good day said he to Arthur shortly enough Good day sir was the response mister Galloway turned to his idle clerk Roland Yorke you must either work or say you will not There is no time for playing and fooling no time sir do you hear Who put that window stark staring open I did sir said incorrigible Roland I thought the office might be the better for a little air when there was so much to do in it mister Galloway shut it with a bang Arthur who would not leave without some attempt at a passing courtesy let it be ever so slight made a remark to mister Galloway that he was sorry to hear Jenkins was worse He is so much worse was the response of mister Galloway spoken sharply for the edification of Roland Yorke that I doubt whether he will ever enter this room again Yes sir you may look but it is the truth Roland did look looked with considerable consternation How on earth will the work get done then he muttered With all his grumbling he had not contemplated Jenkins being away more than a day or two I do not know how it will get done considering that the clerk upon whom I have to depend is Roland Yorke answered mister Galloway with severity One thing appears pretty evident that Jenkins will not be able to help to do it mister Galloway more perplexed at the news brought by missus Jenkins than he had allowed to appear for although he chose to make a show of depending upon Roland he knew how much dependence there was in reality to be placed upon him none knew better had deemed it advisable to see Jenkins personally and judge for himself of his state of health Accordingly he proceeded thither and arrived at an inopportune moment for his hopes Jenkins was just recovering from a second fainting fit and appeared altogether so ill so debilitated that mister Galloway was struck with dismay There would be no more work from Jenkins as he believed for him He mentioned this now in his own office and Roland received it with blank consternation An impulse came to Arthur and he spoke upon it If I can be of any use to you sir in this emergency you have only to command me What sort of use asked mister Galloway Arthur pointed to the parchments I could draw out these deeds and any others that may follow them My time is my own sir except the two hours devoted to the cathedral and I am at a loss how to occupy it I have been idle ever since I left you Why don t you get into an office said mister Galloway Arthur s colour deepened Because sir no one will take me Ah said mister Galloway drily a good name is easier lost than won Yes it is freely replied Arthur However sir to return to the question I shall be glad to help you if you have no one better at hand I could devote several hours a day to it and you know that I am thoroughly to be trusted with the work I might take some home now Home returned mister Galloway Did you mean that you could do it at home Certainly sir I did not think of doing it here was the pointed reply of Arthur I can do it at home just as well as I could here perhaps better for I should shut myself up alone and there would be nothing to interrupt me or to draw off my attention It cannot be denied that this was a most welcome proposition to mister Galloway indeed his thoughts had turned to Arthur from the first Arthur would be far better than a strange clerk looked for and brought in on the spur of the moment one who might answer well or answer badly according to chance Yet that such must have been his resource mister Galloway knew It will be an accommodation to me your taking part of the work he frankly said But you had better come to the office and do it No sir I would rather Do Charming cried out Roland Yorke springing up as if he were electrified The office will be bearable if you come back again I would prefer to do it at home sir continued Arthur to mister Galloway while that gentleman pointed imperiously to Yorke as a hint to him to hold his tongue and mind his own business You may come back here and do it said mister Galloway Thank you I cannot come back was the reply of Arthur Of course you can t said angry Roland who cared less for mister Galloway s displeasure than he did for displaying his own feelings when they were aroused You won t you mean I d not show myself such a duffer as you Channing if I were paid for it in gold You ll get paid in something presently Roland Yorke but it won t be in gold reproved mister Galloway You will do a full day s work to day sir if you stop here till twelve o clock at night Oh of course I expect to do that sir retorted Roland tartly Considering what s before me on this desk and on Jenkins s there s little prospect of my getting home on this side four in the morning They needn t sit up for me I can go in with the milk I wonder who invented writing I wish I had the fingering of him just now Arthur turned to the parchments He was almost as much at home with them as Jenkins mister Galloway selected two that were most pressing and gave them to him with the requisite materials for copying You will keep them secure you know he remarked Perfectly so sir I shall sit quite alone He carried them off with alacrity mister Galloway s face cleared as he looked after him and he made a remark aloud expressive of his satisfaction There s some pleasure in giving out work when you know it will be done No play no dilatoriness finished to the minute that it s looked for You should take a leaf out of his book Yorke Yes sir freely answered Roland When you drove Arthur Channing out of this office you parted with the best clerk you ever had Jenkins is all very well for work but he is nothing but a muff in other things Arthur s a gentleman and he d have served you well Jenkins himself says so He is honourable he is honest he I know enough of your sentiments with respect to his honesty interrupted mister Galloway We need not go over that tale again I hope every one knows them rejoined Roland I have never concealed my opinion that the accusation was infamous that of all of us in this office from its head down to Jenkins none was less likely to finger the note than Arthur Channing But of course my opinion goes for nothing You are bold young man I fear it is my nature to be so cried Roland If it should ever turn up how the note went you ll be sorry no doubt for having visited it upon Arthur mister Channing will be sorry the precious magistrates will be sorry that blessed dean who wanted to turn him from the college will be sorry Not a soul of them but believes him guilty and I hope they ll be brought to repentance for it in sackcloth and ashes Go on with your work said mister Galloway angrily Roland made a show of obeying But his tongue was like a steam engine once set going it couldn t readily be stopped and he presently looked up again I am not uncharitable at least to individuals I always said the post office helped itself to the note and I d lay my last half crown upon it But there are people in the town who think it could only have gone in another way You d go into a passion with me sir perhaps if I mentioned it mister Galloway it has been before mentioned that he possessed an unbounded amount of curiosity and also a propensity to gossip so far forgot the force of good example as to ask Roland what he meant Roland wanted no further encouragement Well sir there are people who weighing well all the probabilities of the case have come to the conclusion that the note could only have been abstracted from the letter by the person to whom it was addressed None but he broke the seal of it Do you allude to my cousin mister Robert Galloway ejaculated mister Galloway as soon as indignation and breath allowed him to speak Others do said Roland I say it was the post office How dare you repeat so insolent a suspicion to my face Roland Yorke I said I should catch it cried Roland speaking partly to himself I am sure to get in for it one way or another do what I will It s not my fault sir if I have heard it whispered in the town Apply yourself to your work sir and hold your tongue If you say another word Roland Yorke I shall feel inclined also to turn you away as one idle and incorrigible of whom nothing can be made Wouldn t it be a jolly excuse for Port Natal exclaimed Roland but not in the hearing of his master who had gone into his own room in much wrath Roland laughed aloud there was nothing he enjoyed so much as to be in opposition to mister Galloway it had been better for the advancement of that gentleman s work had he habitually kept a tighter rein over his pupil It was perfectly true however that the new phase of suspicion regarding the loss of the note had been spoken of in the town and Roland only repeated what he had heard Apparently mister Galloway did not like this gratuitous suggestion He presently came back again A paper was in his hand and he began comparing it with one on Roland s desk Where did you hear that unjustifiable piece of scandal he inquired as he was doing it The first person I heard speak of it was my mother sir She came home one day from calling upon people and said she had heard it somewhere And it was talked of at Knivett s last night He had a bachelors party and the subject was brought up Some of us ridiculed the notion others thought it might have grounds And pray which did you favour sarcastically asked mister Galloway I I said then as I have said all along that there was no one to thank for it but the post office If you ask me sir who first set the notion afloat in the town I cannot satisfy you All I know is the rumour is circulating If I could discover the primary author of it I would take legal proceedings against him warmly concluded mister Galloway I d help said undaunted Roland Some fun might arise out of that mister Galloway carried the probate of a will to his room and sat down to examine it But his thoughts were elsewhere This suspicion mentioned by Roland Yorke had laid hold of his mind most unpleasantly in spite of his show of indignation before Roland He had no reason to think his cousin otherwise than honest it was next to impossible to suppose he could be guilty of playing him such a trick but somehow mister Galloway could not feel so sure upon the point as he would have wished His cousin was a needy man one who had made ducks and drakes of his own property and was for ever appealing to mister Galloway for assistance mister Galloway did not shut his eyes to the fact that if this should have been the case Robert Galloway had had forty pounds from him instead of twenty a great help to a man at his wits ends for money He had forwarded a second twenty pound note upon receiving information of the loss of the first What he most disliked looking at it from this point of view was not the feeling that he had been cleverly deceived and laughed at but that Arthur Channing should have suffered unjustly If the lad was innocent why how cruel had been his own conduct towards him But with these doubts came back the remembrance of Arthur s unsatisfactory behaviour with respect to the loss his non denial his apparent guilt his strange shrinking from investigation Busy as mister Galloway was that day he could not confine his thoughts to his business He would willingly have given another twenty pound note out of his pocket to know beyond doubt whether or not Arthur was guilty Arthur meanwhile had commenced his task He took possession of the study where he was secure from interruption and applied himself diligently to it How still the house seemed How still it had seemed since the loss of Charles Even Annabel and Tom were wont to hush their voices ever listening as it were for tidings to be brought of him Excepting the two servants Arthur was alone in it Hamish was abroad at his office Constance and Annabel were at Lady Augusta s Tom was in school and Charles was not Judith s voice would be heard now and then wafted from the kitchen regions directing or reproving Sarah but there was no other sound Arthur thought of the old days when the sun had shone when he was free and upright in the sight of men when Constance was happy in her future prospects of wedded life when Tom looked forth certainly to the seniorship when Charley s sweet voice and sweeter face might be seen and heard when Hamish oh bitter thought of all when Hamish had not fallen from his pedestal It had all changed changed to darkness and to gloom and Arthur may be pardoned for feeling gloomy with it But in the very midst of this gloom there arose suddenly without effort of his certain words spoken by the sweet singer of Israel and Arthur knew that he had but to trust to them For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye and in his pleasure is life heaviness may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning CHAPTER XLVI A LETTER FOR mister GALLOWAY Morning passed into afternoon and afternoon was drawing towards its close Roland Yorke had contrived to struggle through it and be still living in spite of the amount of work which was pressed upon him mister Galloway had put on his spectacles and copied out several pages himself a thing he rarely attempted But he had gone out now and had carried with him some letters to post Yes grumbled Roland He can stretch his legs but he takes good care I shall not stretch mine Why couldn t he send me with those letters It s my place to post them it s not his Write write write till my fingers are cramped and my feet have no more feeling in them than the stool has Why I wouldn t stop by myself in this horrid musty parchmented old place Oh it s you is it This was addressed to the postman who came in with the afternoon delivery of letters Two He handed them to Roland and departed Of course Roland immediately began to scrutinize them turning them over critically guessing at the senders playing with them at pitch and toss anything to while away the time and afford him some cessation from his own work By these means he contrived to pass five minutes rather agreeably estimating things by comparison when mister Galloway s servant entered Is my master in mister Roland Of course he s not said Roland He s gone gallivanting somewhere He has all the pleasure of it and I have all the work Will you please to give him this letter then said the man The post has just left it at our house so I brought it round What s it brought round here for asked Roland Because he ordered it to be done He said he expected a letter would be delivered at the house by the afternoon post and if it came I was to bring it to him at once Good afternoon sir This little bit of information was quite enough for Roland He seized the letter as he had done the others and subjected it to the same scrutiny The address was written in a singular hand in large print looking letters Roland satisfied his curiosity so far as the outside of the letter could do it and then rose from his stool and laid the three letters upon mister Galloway s desk in his private room A short time and that gentleman entered Anything by the post was his first question Two letters sir replied Roland And John brought round one which was addressed to the house He said you expected it mister Galloway went into his private room He glanced casually at the addresses on the letters and then called Roland Yorke Where is the letter John brought round he inquired somewhat testily Roland pointed it out That was it sir That mister Galloway bent on it a keener glance which probably satisfied him that it bore his private address Was this the only one he brought added he and from his manner and words Roland inferred that it was not the letter he had expected That was all sir Roland returned to his own room and mister Galloway sat down and opened his letters The first two were short communications relative to business the last was the one brought by John What did it contain For one thing It contained a bank note for twenty pounds But the contents mister Galloway gazed at it and rubbed his brow and gazed again He took off his spectacles and put them on he looked at the bank note and he read and re read the letter for it completely upset the theory and set at nought the data he had been going upon especially the data of the last few hours The finder of that lost twenty pound note sends it back to mister Galloway His motive in doing so is that the wrongly suspected may be cleared He who was publicly accused of the offence was innocent as were all others upon whom suspicion though not acted upon may have fallen The writer of this alone took the note and now restores it Abrupt and signatureless such was the letter When mister Galloway had sufficiently overcome his surprise to reason rationally it struck him as being a singular coincidence that this should come to him on the day when the old affair had been renewed again Since its bustle had died out at the time of the occurrence mister Galloway did not remember to have voluntarily spoken of it until that morning with Roland Yorke He took up the bank note Was it the one actually taken the same note kept possibly in fear and now returned He had no means of knowing He thought it was not the same His recollection of the lost note had seemed to be that it was a dirty note which must have passed through many hands but he had never been quite clear upon that point This note was clean and crisp Who had taken it Who had sent it back It quite disposed of that disagreeable suspicion touching his cousin Had his cousin so far forgotten himself as to take the note he would not have been likely to return it he knew nothing of the proceedings which had taken place in Helstonleigh for mister Galloway had never mentioned them to him The writer of this letter was cognizant of them and had sent it that they might be removed At the first glance it of course appeared to be proof positive that Arthur Channing was not guilty But mister Galloway was not accustomed to take only the superficial view of things and it struck him as it would strike others that this might be after all a refined bit of finessing on Arthur s own part to remove suspicion from himself True the cost of doing so was twenty pounds but what was that compared with the restoration of his good name The letter bore the London post mark There was not a doubt that it had been there posted That betrayed nothing Arthur or any one else could have a letter posted there if wishing to do it Where there s a will there s a way thought mister Galloway But again where was Arthur Channing to procure twenty pounds from mister Galloway did not think that he could procure this sum from anywhere or that he possessed himself a twentieth part of it So far the probability was against Arthur s being the author mister Galloway quite lost himself in conjectures Why should it have been addressed to his residence and not to the office He had been expecting a letter from one that afternoon who always did address to his residence and that letter it appeared had not arrived However that had nothing to do with this Neither paper nor writing afforded any clue to the sender and the latter was palpably disguised He called in Roland Yorke for the purpose of putting to him a few useless questions as a great many of us do when we are puzzled questions at any rate that could throw no light upon the main subject What did John say when he brought this letter Only what I told you sir That you expected a letter addressed to the house and ordered him to bring it round But this is not the letter I expected tapping it with his finger and looking altogether so puzzled and astonished that Roland stared in his turn It s not my fault returned he Shall I run round sir and ask John about it No testily answered mister Galloway Don t be so fond of running round This letter There s some one come into the office he broke off Roland turned with alacrity but very speedily appeared again on his best behaviour bowing as he showed in the Dean of Helstonleigh mister Galloway rose and remained standing The dean entered upon the business which had brought him there a trifling matter connected with the affairs of the chapter This over mister Galloway took up the letter and showed it to him The dean read it and looked at the bank note I cannot quite decide in what light I ought to take it sir remarked mister Galloway It either refutes the suspicion of Arthur Channing s guilt or else it confirms it In what way confirms it I do not understand you said the dean It may have come from himself mister Dean A wheel within a wheel The dean paused to revolve the proposition and then shook his head negatively It appears to me to go a very great way towards proving his innocence he observed The impression upon my own mind has been that it was not he who took it as you may have inferred mister Galloway by my allowing him to retain his post in the cathedral But sir if he is innocent who is guilty continued mister Galloway in a tone of remonstrance That is more than I can say replied the dean But for the circumstances appearing to point so strongly to Arthur Channing I never could have suspected him at all A son of mister Channing s would have been altogether above suspicion in my mind and as I tell you for some time I have not believed him to be guilty If he is not guilty mister Galloway paused the full force of what he was about to say pressing strongly upon his mind If he is not guilty mister Dean there has been a great deal of injustice done not only to himself A great deal of injustice is committed every day I fear quietly remarked the dean Tom Channing will have lost the seniorship for nothing went on mister Galloway in a perturbed voice not so much addressing the dean as giving vent to his thoughts aloud Yes was the answer spoken calmly and imparting no token of what might be the dean s private sentiments upon the point You will see to that matter the dean continued referring to his own business there as he rose from his chair I will not forget it mister Dean said mister Galloway And he escorted the dean to the outer door as was his custom when honoured by that dignitary with a visit and bowed him out Roland just then looked a pattern of industry He had resumed his seat after rising in salutation as the dean passed through the office and was writing away like a steam engine mister Galloway returned to his own room and set himself calmly to consider all the bearings of this curious business The great bar against his thinking Arthur innocent was the difficulty of fixing upon any one else as likely to have been guilty Likely he might almost have said as possible to have been guilty I have a very great mind he growled to himself to send for Butterby and let him rake it all up again The uncertainty vexed him and it seemed as if the affair was never to have an end What if I show Arthur Channing the letter first and study his countenance as he looks at it I may gather something from that I don t fancy he d be an over good actor as some might be If he has sent this money I shall see it in his face Acting upon the moment s impulse he suddenly opened the door of the outer office and there found that mister Roland s industry had for the present come to an end He was standing before the window making pantomimic signs through the glass to a friend of his Knivett His right thumb was pointed over his shoulder towards the door of mister Galloway s private room no doubt to indicate a warning that that gentleman was within and that the office consequently was not free for promiscuous intruders A few sharp words of reprimand to mister Roland ensued and then he was sent off with a message to Arthur Channing It brought Arthur back with Roland mister Galloway called Arthur into his own room closed the door and put the letter into his hand in silence He read it twice over before he could understand it indeed he did not do so fully then His surprise appeared to be perfectly genuine and so mister Galloway thought it Has this letter been sent to you sir Has any money been sent to you This has been sent to me replied mister Galloway tossing the twenty pound note to him Is it the one that was taken Channing How can I tell sir said Arthur in much simplicity And mister Galloway s long doubts of him began to melt away You did not send the money to clear yourself Arthur looked up in surprise Where should I get twenty pounds from he asked I shall shortly have a quarter s salary from mister Williams but it is not quite due yet And it will not be twenty pounds or anything like that amount mister Galloway nodded It was the thought which had struck himself Another thought however was now striking Arthur a thought which caused his cheek to flush and his brow to lower With the word salary had arisen to him the remembrance of another s salary due about this time that of his brother Hamish Had Hamish been making this use of it to remove the stigma from him The idea received additional force from mister Galloway s next words for they bore upon the point This letter is what it purports to be a missive from the actual thief or else it comes from some well wisher of yours who sacrifices twenty pounds to do you a service Which is it mister Galloway fixed his eyes on Arthur s face and could not help noting the change which had come over it over his bearing altogether The open candour was gone and in its place reigned the covert look the hesitating manner the confusion which had characterized him at the period of the loss All I can say sir is that I know nothing of this he presently said It has surprised me as much as it can surprise any one Channing impulsively exclaimed mister Galloway your manner and your words are opposed to each other as they were at the time The one gives the lie to the other But I begin to believe you did not take it I did not returned Arthur And therefore as I don t like to be played with and made sport of like a cat tormenting a mouse I think I shall give orders to Butterby for a fresh investigation It startled Arthur mister Galloway s curiously significant tone his piercing gaze upon his face also startled him It would bring no satisfaction sir he said Pray do not I would far rather continue to bear the blame A pause A new idea came glimmering into the mind of mister Galloway Whom are you screening he asked But he received no answer Is it Roland Yorke Roland Yorke repeated Arthur half reproachfully No indeed I wish every one had been as innocent of it as was Roland Yorke In good truth mister Galloway had only mentioned Roland s name as coming uppermost in his mind He knew that no suspicion attached to Roland Arthur resumed in agitation Let the matter drop sir Indeed it will be better It appears now that you have the money back again and for the rest I am willing to take the blame as I have done If I have the money back again I have not other things back again crossly repeated mister Galloway There s the loss of time it has occasioned the worry the uncertainty who is to repay me all that My portion in it has been worse than yours sir said Arthur in a low deep tone Think of my loss of time my worry and uncertainty my waste of character my anxiety of mind they can never be repaid to me And whose the fault If you were truly innocent you might have cleared yourself with a word Arthur knew he might But that word he had not dared to speak At this juncture Roland Yorke appeared Here s Jenner s old clerk come in sir said he to his master He wants to see you he says He can come in replied mister Galloway Are you getting on with that copying he added to Arthur as the latter was going out Yes sir The gentleman whom Roland Yorke designated as Jenner s old clerk was shut in with mister Galloway and Roland who appeared to be on the thorns of curiosity arrested Arthur I say what is it that s agate He has been going into fits pretty near over some letter that came asking me five hundred questions about it What have you to do with it What does he want with you Some one has been sending him back the money Roland It came in a letter Roland opened his eyes What money The money that was lost A twenty pound note has come He asked me whether it was the veritable note that was taken A twenty pound note come repeated puzzled Roland It s quite true Roland It purports to be sent by the stealer of the money for the purpose of clearing me Roland stood for a few moments profound surprise on his face and then began to execute a triumphant hornpipe amidst the desks and stools of the office I said it would come right some time over and over again I said it Give us your hand old fellow He s not such a bad trump after all that thief Hush Roland you ll be heard It may not do me much good Galloway seems to doubt me still Doubt you still cried Roland stopping short in his dance and speaking in a very explosive tone Doubt you still Why what would he have I don t know sighed Arthur I have assured him I did not send it but he fancies I may have done it to clear myself He talks of calling in Butterby again My opinion then is that he wants to be transported if he is to turn up such a heathen as that stamped Roland What would he have I ask Another twenty given him for interest Arthur dear old fellow let s go off together to Port Natal and leave him and his office to it I ll find the means if I rob his cash box to get them But Arthur was already beyond hearing having waved his adieu to Roland Yorke and his impetuous but warm hearted championship Anxious to get on with the task he had undertaken he hastened home Constance was in the hall when he entered having just returned from Lady Augusta Yorke s His confidant throughout his gentle soother and supporter his ever ready adviser Arthur drew her into one of the rooms and acquainted her with what had occurred A look of terror rose to her face as she listened Hamish has done it she uttered in a whisper This puts all doubt at an end There are times they have been times she burst into tears as she spoke when I have fondly tried to cheat myself that we were suspecting him wrongfully Arthur others suspect him Arthur s face reflected the look that was upon hers I trust not But they do Ellen Huntley dropped a word inadvertently which convinces me that he is in some way doubted there She caught it up again in evident alarm ere it was well spoken and I dared not pursue the subject It is Hamish who has sent this money You speak confidently Constance Listen I know that he has drawn money papa s salary and his own he mentioned it incidentally A few days ago I asked him for money for housekeeping purposes and he handed me a twenty pound note in mistake for a five pound He discovered the mistake before I did and snatched it back again in some confusion I can t give you that he said in a laughing manner when he recovered himself That has a different destination Arthur that note rely upon it was going to mister Galloway When was this asked Arthur Last week Three or four days ago Trifling as the incident was it seemed to bear out their suspicions and Arthur could only come to the same conclusion as his sister the thought had already crossed him you remember Do not let it pain you thus Constance he said for her tears were falling fast He may not call in Butterby Your grieving will do no good I cannot help it she exclaimed with a burst of anguish How God is trying us Ay even as silver which must be seven times purified ere it be sufficiently refined CHAPTER XLVII DARK CLOUDS Constance Channing sat her forehead buried in her hands How God was trying them The sentence wrung from her in the bitterness of her heart but expressed the echo of surrounding things Her own future blighted Arthur s character gone Tom lost the seniorship Charley not heard of dead or alive There were moments and this was one of them when Constance felt almost beyond the pale of hope The college school meanwhile existed in a state of constant suspense the sword of terror ever hanging over its head Punishment for the present was reserved and what the precise punishment would be when it came none could tell Talkative Bywater was fond of saying that it did not matter whether Miss Charley turned up or not so far as their backs were concerned they would be made to tingle either way Arthur after communicating to Constance the strange fact of the return of the money to mister Galloway shut himself up in the study to pursue his copying Tea time arrived and Sarah brought in the tea things But neither Hamish nor Tom had come in and Constance sat alone deep in unpleasant thoughts That it was Hamish who had now returned the money to mister Galloway Constance could not entertain the slightest doubt It had a very depressing effect upon her It could not render worse what had previously happened indeed it rather mended it insomuch as that it served to show some repentance some good feeling but it made the suspicion against Hamish a certainty and there had been times when Constance had been beguiled into thinking it only a suspicion And now came this new fear of mister Butterby again Hamish s own footstep in the hall Constance roused herself He came in books under his arm as usual and his ever gay face smiling There were times when Constance almost despised him for his perpetual sunshine The seriousness which had overspread Hamish at the time of Charley s disappearance had nearly worn away In his sanguine temperament he argued that not finding the body was a proof that Charley was yet alive and would come forth in a mysterious manner one of these days Have I kept you waiting tea Constance began he I came home by way of Close Street and was called into Galloway s by Roland Yorke and then got detained further by mister Galloway Where s Arthur He has undertaken some copying for mister Galloway and is busy with it replied Constance in a low tone Hamish raising her eyes to his face as she gathered resolution to speak of the affair have you heard what has happened That some good fairy has forwarded a bank note to Galloway on the wings of the telegraph Roland Yorke would not allow me to remain in ignorance of that mister Galloway did me the honour to ask whether I had sent it You uttered Constance regarding the avowal only from her own point of view He asked whether you had sent it He did She gazed at Hamish as if she would read his very soul And what did what did you answer Told him I wished a few others would suspect me of the same and count imaginary payments for real ones Hamish she exclaimed the complaint wrung from her how can you be so light so cruel when our hearts are breaking Hamish in turn was surprised at this I cruel In what manner Constance My dear I repeat to you that we shall have Charley back again I feel sure of it and it has done away with my fear Some inward conviction or presentiment call it which you like tells me that we shall and I implicitly trust to it We need not mourn for him It is not for Charley I do not speak of Charley now she sadly reiterated You are straying from the point Hamish have you no love left for Arthur I have plenty of love for every one said mister Hamish Then how can you behave like this Arthur is not guilty you know he is not And look what he has to bear I believe you would laugh at the greatest calamity Sending back this money to mister Galloway has has sadly distressed me Hamish turned his smiling eyes upon her but his tone was grave Wait until some great calamity occurs Constance and then see whether I laugh Did I laugh that dreadful night and day that succeeded to Charley s loss Sending back the money to mister Galloway is not a cause for sadness It most certainly exonerates Arthur And you are gay over it She would have given anything to speak more plainly I am particularly gay this afternoon acknowledged Hamish who could not be put out of temper by any amount of reproach whatever I have had great news by the post Constance From Germany she quickly cried Yes from Germany he answered taking a letter from his pocket and spreading it open before Constance It contained the bravest news great news as Hamish expressed it It was from mister Channing himself and it told them of his being so far restored that there was no doubt now of his ability to resume his own place at his office They intended to be home the first week in November The weather at Borcette continued warm and charming and they would prolong their stay there to the full time contemplated It had been a fine autumn everywhere There was a postscript added to the letter as if an afterthought had occurred to mister Channing When you see mister Huntley tell him how well I am progressing I remember by the way that he hinted at being able to introduce you to something should I no longer require you in Guild Street In the delight that the news brought Constance partially lost sight of her sadness It is not all gloom she whispered to herself If we could only dwell on God s mercies as we do on His chastisement if we could only feel more trust we should see the bright side of the cloud oftener than we do But it was dark dark in many ways and Constance was soon to be reminded again of it forcibly She had taken her seat at the tea table when Tom came in He looked flushed stern and he flung his Gradus and one or two other books in a heap on the side table with more force than was necessary and himself into a chair ditto Constance I shall leave the school Constance in her dismay dropped the sugar tongs into the sugar What Tom I shall leave the school he repeated his tone as fiery as his face I wouldn t stop in it another month if I were bribed with gold Things are getting too bad there Oh Tom Tom Is this your endurance Endurance he exclaimed That s a nice word in theory Constance but just you try it in practice Who has endured if I have not I thought I d go on and endure it as you say at any rate until papa came home But I can t I can t What has happened more than usual inquired Hamish It gets worse and worse said Tom turning his blazing face upon his brother I wouldn t wish a dog to live the life that I live in the college school They call me a felon and treat me as one they send me to Coventry they won t acknowledge me as one of their seniors My position is unbearable Live it down Tom said Hamish quietly Haven t I been trying to live it down returned the boy suppressing his emotion It has lasted now these two months and I have borne it daily At the time of Charley s loss I was treated better for a day or two but that has worn away It is of no use your looking at me reproachfully Constance I must complain What other boy in the world has ever been put down as I I was head of the school next to Gaunt looking forward to be the head and what am I now The seniorship taken from me in shame Huntley exalted to my place my chance of the exhibition gone Huntley does not take the exhibition interrupted Constance But Yorke will I shan t be allowed to take it Now I know it Constance and the school knows it Let a fellow once go down and he s kept down every dog has a fling at him The seniorship s gone the exhibition is going I might bear that tamely you may say and of course I might for they are negative evils but what I can t and won t bear are the insults of every day life Only this afternoon they Tom stopped for his feelings were choking him and the complaint he was about to narrate was never spoken Before he had recovered breath and calmness Arthur entered and took his seat at the tea table Poor Tom allowing one of his unfortunate explosions of temper to get the better of him sprang from his chair and burst forth with a passionate reproach to Arthur whom he regarded as the author of all the ill Why did you do it Why did you bring this disgrace upon us But for you I should not have lost caste in the school Tom interposed Hamish in a severe tone mister Tom brave college boy that he was manly as he coveted to be thought actually burst into tears Tears called forth not by contrition I fear but by remembered humiliation by vexation by the moment s passion Never had Tom cast a reproach openly to Arthur whatever he may have felt he buried it within himself but that his opinion vacillated upon the point of Arthur s guilt was certain Constance went up to him and laid her hand gently and soothingly upon his shoulder Tom dear boy your troubles are making you forget yourself Do not be unjust to Arthur He is innocent as you Then if he is innocent why does he not speak out like a man and proclaim his innocence retorted Tom sensibly enough but with rather too much heat That s what the school cast in my teeth more than anything again Don t preach up your brother s innocence to us they cry if he did not take it wouldn t he say so Look at Arthur now and Tom pointed his finger at him he does not even here to me assert that he is innocent Arthur s face burnt under the reproach He turned it upon Hamish with a gesture almost as fiery quite as hasty as any that had been vouchsafed them by Tom Plainly as look could speak it said Will you suffer this injustice to be heaped upon me Constance saw the look and she left Tom with a faint cry and bent over Arthur afraid of what truth he might give utterance to Patience yet Arthur she whispered Do not let a moment s anger undo the work of weeks Remember how bravely you have borne Ay Heaven forgive my pride Tom Arthur added turning to him calmly I would clear you or rather clear myself in the eyes of the school if I could but it is impossible However you have less to blame me for than you may think Hamish advanced He caught Tom s arm and drew him to a distant window Now lad he said let me hear all about this bugbear I ll see if it can be in any way lightened for you Hamish s tone was kindly his manner frank and persuasive and Tom was won over to speak of his troubles Hamish listened with an attentive ear Will you abide by my advice he asked him when the catalogue of grievances had come to an end Perhaps I will replied Tom who was growing cool after his heat Then as I said to you before so I say now Live it down It is the best advice I can give you Hamish you don t know what it is Yes I do I can enter into your trials and annoyances as keenly as if I had to encounter them I do not affect to disparage them to you I know that they are real trials real insults but if you will only make up your mind to bear them they will lose half their sharpness Your interest lies in remaining in the college school more than that your duty lies in it Tom don t let it be said that a Channing shrunk from his duty because it brought him difficulties to battle with I don t think I can stop in it Hamish I d rather stand in a pillory and have rotten eggs shied at me Yes you can In fact my boy for the present you must Disobedience has never been a fault amongst us and I am sure you will not be the one to inaugurate it Your father left me in charge in his place with full control and I cannot sanction any such measure as that of your leaving the school In less than a month s time he will be home and you can then submit the case to him and abide by his advice With all Tom s faults he was not rebellious neither was he unreasonable and he made up his mind not without some grumbling to do as Hamish desired him He drew his chair with a jerk to the tea table which of course was unnecessary I told you that the young Channings admirably as they had been brought up had their faults as you have yours and I have mine It was a silent meal Annabel who was wont to keep them alive whatever might be their troubles had remained to take tea at Lady Augusta Yorke s with Caroline and Fanny Had Constance known that she was in the habit of thoughtlessly chattering upon any subject that came uppermost including poor Charles s propensity to be afraid of ghosts she had allowed her to remain with them more charily Hamish took a book and read Arthur only made a show of taking anything and soon left them to resume his work Tom did not even make a show of it but unequivocally rejected all good things How could he be hungry he asked when Constance pressed him An unsociable meal it was almost as unpleasant as were their inward thoughts They felt for Tom in the midst of their graver griefs but they were all at cross purposes together and they knew it therefore they could only retain an uncomfortable reticence one with another Tom laid the blame to the share of Arthur Arthur and Constance to the share of Hamish To whom Hamish laid it was only known to himself He Hamish rose as the tea things were carried away He was preparing for a visit to mister Huntley s His visits there as already remarked had not been frequent of late He had discovered that he was not welcome to mister Huntley And Hamish Channing was not one to thrust his company upon any one even the attraction of Ellen could not induce that But it is very probable that he was glad of the excuse mister Channing s letter afforded him to go there now He found Miss Huntley alone a tall stiff lady who always looked as if she were cased in whalebone She generally regarded Hamish with some favour which was saying a great deal for Miss Huntley You are quite a stranger here she remarked to him as he entered I think I am replied Hamish mister Huntley is still in the dining room I hear mister Huntley is said the lady speaking as if the fact did not give her pleasure though Hamish could not conceive why My niece has chosen to remain with him she added in a tone which denoted dissatisfaction I am quite tired of talking to her I tell her this is proper and the other is improper and she goes and mixes up my advice in the most extraordinary way leaving undone what she ought to do and doing what I tell her she ought not Only this very morning I read her a sermon upon Propriety and the fitness of things It took me just an hour an hour by my watch I assure you mister Hamish Channing and what is the result I retired from the dinner table precisely ten minutes after the removal of the cloth according to my invariable custom and Ellen in defiance of my warning her that it is not lady like stays there behind me I have not finished my grapes aunt she says to me And there she stays just to talk with her father And he encourages her What will become of Ellen I cannot imagine she will never be a lady It s very sad replied Hamish coughing down a laugh and putting on the gravest face he could call up Sad repeated Miss Huntley who sat perfectly upright her hands cased in mittens crossed upon her lap It is grievous mister Hamish Channing She what do you think she did only yesterday One of our maids was going to be married and a dispute or some unpleasantness occurred between her and the intended husband Would you believe that Ellen actually wrote a letter for the girl a poor ignorant thing who never learnt to read let alone to write but an excellent servant to this man that things might be smoothed down between them My niece Miss Ellen Huntley lowering herself to write a a I can scarcely allow my tongue to utter the word mister Hamish a love letter Miss Huntley lifted her eyes and her mittens Hamish expressed himself inexpressibly shocked inwardly wishing he could persuade Miss Ellen Huntley to write a few to him And I receive no sympathy from any one pursued Miss Huntley None I spoke to my brother and he could not see that she had done anything wrong in writing or pretended that he could not Oh dear how things have altered from what they were when I was a young girl Then My master says will you please to walk into the dining room sir interrupted a servant at this juncture And Hamish rose and followed him mister Huntley was alone Hamish threw his glance to the four corners of the room but Ellen was not in it The meeting was not very cordial on mister Huntley s side What can I do for you he inquired as he shook hands Which was sufficient to imply coldly You must have come to my house for some particular purpose What is it But Hamish could not lose his sunny temperament his winning manner I bring you great news mister Huntley We have heard from Borcette and the improvement in my father s health is so great that all doubts as to the result are over I said it would be so replied mister Huntley They continued talking some little time and then Hamish mentioned the matter alluded to in the postscript of the letter Is it correct that you will be able to help me to something he inquired when my father shall resume his own place in Guild Street It is correct that I told your father so answered mister Huntley I thought then that I could And is the post gone I assume that it was a situation of some sort It is not gone The post will not be vacant until the beginning of the year Have you heard that there is to be a change in the joint stock bank No replied Hamish looking up with much interest mister Bartlett leaves He is getting in years his health is failing and he wishes to retire As one of the largest shareholders in the bank I shall possess the largest voice in the appointment of a successor and I had thought of you Indeed I have no objection to say that there is not the slightest doubt you would have been appointed otherwise I should not have spoken confidently to mister Channing It was an excellent post there was no doubt of that The bank was not an extensive one it was not the principal bank of Helstonleigh but it was a firmly established thoroughly respectable concern and mister Bartlett who had been its manager for many years enjoyed many privileges and a handsome salary A far larger salary than was mister Channing s The house a good one attached to the bank was used as his residence and would be when he left the residence of his successor I should like it of all things cried Hamish So would many a one young sir who is in a better position than you drily answered mister Huntley I thought you might have filled it Can I not sir No Hamish did not expect the answer He looked inquiringly at mister Huntley Why can I not Because I cannot now recommend you to it was the reply But why not exclaimed Hamish When I spoke of you as becoming mister Bartlett s successor I believed you would be found worthy to fulfil his duties I can fulfil them said Hamish Possibly But so much doubt has arisen upon that point in my own mind that I can no longer recommend you for it In fact I could not sanction your appointment What have I done inquired Hamish Ask your conscience If that does not tell you plainly enough I shall not My conscience accuses me of nothing that need render me unfit to fill the post and to perform my duties in it mister Huntley I think otherwise But to pursue the subject will be productive of no benefit so we will let it drop I would have secured you the appointment could I have done so conscientiously but I cannot and the matter is at an end At least you can tell me why you will not said Hamish speaking with some sarcasm in the midst of his respect I have already declined to do so Ask your own conscience Hamish The worst criminal has a right to know his accusation mister Huntley Otherwise he cannot defend himself It will be time enough for you to defend yourself when you are publicly accused I shall say no more upon the point I am sorry your father mentioned the thing to you necessitating this explanation so far I have also been sorry for having ever mentioned it to him My worst explanation will be with your father for I cannot enter into cause and effect any more than I can to you I have for some little time been conscious of a change in your manner towards me mister Huntley Ay no doubt Sir you ought to tell me what has caused it I might explain away any prejudice or wrong impression There that will do interrupted mister Huntley It is neither prejudice nor wrong impression that I have taken up And now I have said the last word upon the matter that I shall say But sir No more I say peremptorily interrupted mister Huntley The subject is over Let us talk of other things I need not ask whether you have news of poor Charley you would have informed me of that at once You see I was right in advising silence to be kept towards them All this time of suspense would have told badly on mister Channing Hamish rose to leave He had done little good it appeared by his visit certainly he could not wish to prolong it There was an unsealed scrap of paper slipped inside my father s letter he said It was from my mother to Charley This is it It appeared to have been written hastily perhaps from a sudden thought at the moment of mister Channing s closing his letter mister Huntley took it in his hand MY DEAR LITTLE CHARLEY How is it you do not write to mamma Not a message from you now not a letter I am sure you are not forgetting me Poor boy exclaimed mister Huntley handing it back to Hamish Poor mother I did not show it to Constance observed Hamish It would only distress her Good night sir By the way added Hamish turning as he reached the door mister Galloway has received that money back again What money cried mister Huntley That which was lost A twenty pound note came to him in a letter by this afternoon s post The letter states that Arthur and all others who may have been accused are innocent Oh indeed cried mister Huntley with cutting sarcasm as the conviction flashed over him that Hamish and no other had been the sender The thief has come to his senses at last has he So far as to render lame justice to Arthur Hamish left the room The hall had not yet been lighted and Hamish could hardly see the outline of a form crossing it from the staircase to the drawing room He knew whose it was and he caught it to him Ellen he whispered what has turned your father against me Of course she could not enlighten him she could not say to Hamish Channing He suspects you of being a thief Her whole spirit would have revolted from that as much as it did from the accusation The subject was a painful one she was flurried at the sudden meeting the stealthy meeting it may be said and she burst into tears I am quite afraid to say what mister Hamish did this being a sober story When he left the hall Ellen Huntley s cheeks were glowing and certain sweet words were ringing changes in her ears Ellen they shall never take you from me CHAPTER XLVIII MUFFINS FOR TEA A week or two passed by and November was rapidly approaching Things remained precisely as they were at the close of the last chapter nothing fresh had occurred no change had taken place Tom Channing s remark though much cannot be said for its elegance was indisputable in point of truth that when a fellow was down he was kept down and every dog had a fling at him It was being exemplified in the case of Arthur The money so mysteriously conveyed to mister Galloway had proved of little service towards clearing him in fact it had the contrary effect and people openly expressed their opinion that it had come from himself or his friends He was down and it would take more than that to lift him up again mister Galloway kept his thoughts to himself or had put them into his cash box with the note for he said nothing Roland Yorke did not imitate his example he was almost as explosive over the present matter as he had been over the loss It would have pleased him that Arthur should be declared innocent by public proclamation Roland was in a most explosive frame of mind on another score and that was the confinement to the office In reality he was not overworked for Arthur managed to get through a great amount of it at home which he took in regularly morning after morning to mister Galloway Roland however thought he was and his dissatisfaction was becoming unbearable I do not think that Roland could have done a hard day s work To sit steadily to it for only a couple of hours appeared to be an absolute impossibility to his restless temperament He must look off he must talk he must yawn he must tilt his stool he must take a slight interlude at balancing the ruler on his nose or at other similar recreative and intellectual amusements but apply himself in earnest he could not Therefore there was little fear of mister Roland s being overcome with the amount of work on hand But what told upon Roland was the confinement I don t mean upon his health you know but his temper It had happened many a day since Jenkins s absence that Roland had never stirred from the office except for his dinner He must be there in good time in the morning at the frightfully early hour of nine and he often was not released until six When he went to dinner at one mister Galloway would say You must be back in half an hour Yorke I may have to go out Once or twice he had not gone to dinner until two or three o clock and then he was half dead with hunger All this chafed poor Roland nearly beyond endurance Another cause was rendering Roland s life not the most peaceful one He was beginning to be seriously dunned for money Careless in that as he was in other things improvident as was ever Lady Augusta Roland rarely paid until he was compelled to do so A very good hand was he at contracting debts but a bad one at liquidating them Roland did not intend to be dishonest Were all his creditors standing around him and a roll of bank notes before him he would freely have paid them all very probably in his openheartedness have made each creditor a present over and above for his trouble But failing the roll of notes he only staved off the difficulties in the best way he could and grew cross and ill tempered on being applied to His chief failing was his impulsive thoughtlessness Often when he had teased or worried Lady Augusta out of money to satisfy a debt for which he was being pressed that very money would be spent in some passing folly arising with the impulse of the moment before it had had time to reach the creditor There are too many in the world like Roland Yorke Roland was late in the office one Monday evening he and a lamp sharing it between them He was in a terrible temper and sat kicking his feet on the floor as if the noise for it might be heard in the street would while away the time He had nothing to do the writing he had been about was positively finished but he had to remain in waiting for mister Galloway who was absent but had not left the office for the evening He would have given the whole world to take his pipe out of his pocket and begin to smoke but that pastime was so firmly forbidden in the office that even Roland dared not disobey There goes six of em he uttered as the cathedral clock rang out the hour and his boots threatened to stave in the floor If I stand this life much longer I ll be shot It s enough to take the spirit out of a fellow to wear the flesh off his bones to afflict him with nervous fever What an idiot I was to let my lady mother put me here Better have stuck to those musty old lessons at school and gone in for a parson Why can t Jenkins get well and come back He s shirking it that s my belief And why can t Galloway have Arthur back He might if he pressed it Talk of solitary confinement driving prisoners mad at their precious model prisons what else is this I wish I could go mad for a week if old Galloway might be punished for it It s worse than any prison this office At four o clock he went out and now it s six and I have not had a blessed soul put his nose inside the door to say How are you getting on I m a regular prisoner and nothing else Why doesn t he The complaint was cut short by the entrance of mister Galloway Unconscious of the rebellious feelings of his clerk he passed through the office to his own room Roland s rat tat to having ceased at his appearance To find Roland drumming the floor with his feet was nothing unusual rather moderate for him mister Galloway had found him doing it with his head Two or three minutes elapsed and mister Galloway came out again You can shut up Roland And then take these letters to the post Put the desks straight first what a mess you get them into Is that will engrossed Yes sir Very well Be here in time in the morning Good night Good night sir responded Roland Yes it s all very fine he went on as he opened the desks and shoved everything in with his hands indiscriminately en masse which was his way of putting things straight Be here in time Of course No matter what time I am let off the previous evening If I stand this long Roland finished his sentence by an emphatic turn of the key of the office door which expressed quite as much as words could have done for he was already out of the room his hat on his head and the letters in his hand Calling out lustily for the housekeeper he flung the key to her and bounded off in the direction of the post office His way lay past missus Jenkins s shop which the maid had for the hour been left to attend to She was doing it from a leaf taken out of Roland s own book standing outside the door and gazing all ways It suddenly struck Roland that he could not do better than pay Jenkins a visit just to ascertain how long he meant to absent himself In he darted with his usual absence of hesitation and went on to the parlour There was no hurry for the letters the post did not close until nine The little parlour dark by day looked very comfortable now A bright fire a bright lamp and a well spread tea table at which missus Jenkins sat More comfortable than Jenkins himself did who lay back in his easy chair white and wan meekly enjoying a lecture from his wife He started from it at the appearance of Roland bowing in his usual humble fashion and smiling a glad welcome I say Jenkins I have come to know how long you mean to leave us to ourselves was Roland s greeting It s too bad you know How d ye do missus Jenkins Don t you look snug here It s a nasty cutting night and I have to tramp all the way to the post office Free and easy Roland drew a chair forward on the opposite side of the hearth to Jenkins missus Jenkins and her good things being in the middle and warmed his hands over the blaze Ugh he shivered I can t bear these keen easterly winds It s fine to be you Jenkins basking by a blazing fire and junketing upon plates of buttered muffins Would you please to condescend to take a cup of tea with us sir was Jenkins s answer It is just ready I don t care if I do said Roland There s nothing I like better than buttered muffins We get them sometimes at home but there s so many to eat at our house that before a plate is well in a dozen hands are snatching at it and it s emptied Lady Augusta knows no more about comfort than a cow does and she will have the whole tribe of young ones in to meals You ll find these muffins different from what you get at home said missus Jenkins in her curt snappish but really not inhospitable way as she handed the muffins to Roland I know what it is when things are left to servants as they are at your place they turn out uneatable soddened things with rancid butter nine times out of ten instead of good wholesome fresh Servants cooking won t do for Jenkins now and it never did for me These are good though exclaimed Roland eating away with intense satisfaction Have you got any more downstairs missus Jenkins don t I wish you could always toast muffins for me Is that some ham His eyes had caught a small dish of ham in delicate slices put there to tempt poor Jenkins But he was growing beyond such tempting now for his appetite wholly failed him It was upon this point he had been undergoing missus Jenkins s displeasure when Roland interrupted them The question led to an excellent opportunity for renewing the grievance and she was too persistent a diplomatist to let it slip Catching up the dish and leaving her chair she held it out before Roland s eyes Young mister Yorke do you see anything the matter with that ham Please to tell me I see that it looks uncommonly good replied Roland Do you hear sharply ejaculated missus Jenkins turning short round upon her husband My dear I never said a word but what it was good I never had any other thought returned he with deprecation I only said that I could not eat it I can t indeed I can t My appetite is gone missus Jenkins put the dish down upon the table with a jerk That s how he goes on said she to Roland It s enough to wear a woman s patience out I get him muffins I get him ham I get him fowls I get him fish I get him puddings I get him every conceivable nicety that I can think of and not a thing will he touch All the satisfaction I can get from him is that his stomach turns against food I wish I could eat interposed Jenkins mildly I have tried to do it till I can try no longer I wish I could Will you take some of this ham young mister Yorke she asked He won t He wants to know what scarcity of food is I ll take it all if you like said Roland If it s going begging missus Jenkins accommodated him with a plate and knife and fork and with some more muffins Roland did ample justice to the whole despatching it down with about six cups of good tea well sugared and creamed Jenkins looked on with satisfaction and missus Jenkins appeared to regard it in the light of a personal compliment as chief of the commissariat department And now said Roland turning back to the fire when are you coming out again Jenkins Jenkins coughed more in hesitation for an answer than of necessity I am beginning to think sir that I shall not get out again at all he presently said Holloa I say Jenkins don t go and talk that rubbish was Roland s reply You know what I told you once about that dropsy I heard of a man that took it into his head to fancy himself dead And he ordered a coffin and lay down in it and stopped in it for six days only getting up at night to steal the bread and cheese His folks couldn t think at first where the loaves went to You ll be fancying the same if you don t mind If I could only get a little stronger sir instead of weaker I should soon be at my duty again I am anxious enough sir as you may imagine for there s my salary sir coming to me as usual and I doing nothing for it It s just this Jenkins that if you don t come back speedily I shall take French leave and be off some fine morning I can t stand it much longer I can t tell you how many blessed hours at a stretch am I in that office with no one to speak to I wish I was at Port Natal Sir said Jenkins thinking he would say a word of warning in his kindly spirit I have heard that there s nothing more deceptive than those foreign parts that people flock to when the rage arises for them Many a man only goes out to starve and die Many a muff you mean returned self complaisant Roland I say Jenkins isn t it a shame about Arthur Channing Galloway has his money back from the very thief himself as the letter said and yet the old grumbler won t speak out like a man and say Shake hands old fellow and I know you are innocent and come back to the office again Arthur would return if he said that See if I don t start for Port Natal I wish mister Arthur was back again sir It would make me easier He sits and stews and frets and worries his brains about that office and how it gets on without him tartly interposed missus Jenkins A sick man can t expect to grow better if he is to fret himself into fiddlestrings I wish repeated poor Jenkins in a dreamy sort of mood his eyes fixed on the fire and his thin hands clasped upon his knees I do wish mister Arthur was back In a little while he d quite replace me and I should not be missed Hear him uttered missus Jenkins That s how he goes on Well concluded Roland rising and gathering up his letters which he had deposited upon a side table if this is not a nice part of the world to live in I don t know what is Arthur Channing kept down under Galloway s shameful injustice Jenkins making out that things are all over with him and I driven off my head doing everybody s work Good night Jenkins Good night missus J That was a stunning tea I ll come in again some night when you have toasted muffins CHAPTER XLIX A CHATEAU EN ESPAGNE A keen wind blowing from the east was booming through the streets of Helstonleigh striking pitilessly the eyes and cheeks of the wayfarers cutting thin forms nearly in two and taking stout ones off their legs Blinded by the sharp dust giving hard words to the wind to the cold to the post office for not being nearer to anything and everything Roland Yorke dashed along suffering nothing and no one to impede his progress He flung the letters into the box at the post office when he reached that establishment and then set off at the same pace back again Roland was in a state of inward commotion He thought himself the most injured the most hard worked the most to be pitied fellow under the sun The confinement in the office with the additional work he had to get through there was his chief grievance and a grievance it really was to one of Roland s temperament When he had Arthur Channing and Jenkins for his companions in it to whom he could talk as he pleased and who did all the work allowing Roland to do all the play it had been tolerably bearable but that state of things was changed and Roland was feeling that he could bear it no longer Another thing that Roland would perhaps be allowed to bear no longer was immunity from his debts They had grown on him latterly as much as the work had Careless Roland saw no way out of that difficulty any more than he did out of the other except by an emigration to that desired haven which had stereotyped itself on the retina of his imagination in colours of the brightest phantasy Port Natal For its own sake Roland was hurrying to get to it as well as that it might be convenient to do so Look here said he to himself as he tore along even if Carrick were to set me all clear and straight and I dare say he might if I told him the bother I am in where would be the good It would not forward me I wouldn t stop at Galloway s another month to be made into a royal duke If he d take back Arthur with honours and Jenkins came out of his cough and his thinness and returned I don t know but I might do violence to my inclination and remain I can t as it is I should go dead with the worry and the work Roland paused fighting for an instant with a puff of wind and dust Then he resumed I d pay my debts if I could but if I can t what am I to do but leave them unpaid Much better get the money from Carrick to start me off to Port Natal and set me going there Then when I have made enough I ll send the cash to Arthur and get him to settle up for me I don t want to cheat the poor wretches out of their money I d rather pay em double than do that Some of them work hard enough to get it almost as hard as I do at Galloway s and they have a right to their own In three months time after landing I shall be able to do the thing liberally I ll make up my mind from to night and go I know it will be all for the best Besides there s the other thing What the other thing might mean mister Roland did not state more explicitly He came to another pause and then went on again That s settled I ll tell my lady to night and I ll tell Galloway in the morning and I ll fix on the time for starting and be off to London and see what I can do with Carrick Let s see I shall want to take out lots of things I can get them in London When Bagshaw went he told me of about a thousand I think I dotted them down somewhere I must look Rum odds and ends they were I know frying pans were amongst them Carrick will go with me to buy them if I ask him and then he ll pay if it s only out of politeness Nobody sticks out for politeness more than Carrick He Roland s castles in the air were suddenly cut short He was passing a dark part near the cathedral when a rough hand rough in texture not in motion was laid upon his shoulder and a peculiar piece of paper thrust upon him The assailant was Hopper the sheriff s officer Roland flew into one of his passions He divined what it was perfectly well nothing less than one of those little mandates from our Sovereign Lady the Queen which a short time back had imperilled Hamish Channing He repaid Hopper with a specimen of his tongue and flung the writ back at him Now sir where s the good of your abusing me as if it was my fault returned the man in a tone of remonstrance I have had it in my pocket this three weeks mister Yorke and not a day but I could have served it on you but I m loth to trouble young gentlemen such as you as I m sure many of you in this town could say I have got into displeasure with our folk about the delay in this very paper and in short sir I have not done it till I was obliged You old preacher foamed Roland I have not tipped you with half a crown lately and therefore you can see me mister Yorke said the man earnestly if you had filled my hands with half crowns yesterday I must have done this to day I tell you sir I have got into a row with our people over it and it s the truth Why don t you sir if I may presume to give advice tell your little embarrassments to your mother the Lady Augusta She d be sure to see you through them How dare you mention the Lady Augusta to me thundered haughty Roland Is it fitting that the Lady Augusta s name should be bandied in such transactions as these Do you think I don t know what s due to her better than that If I have got into embarrassment I shall not drag my mother into it Well sir you know best I did not mean to offend you but the contrary Mind mister Roland Yorke added Hopper pointing to the writ which still lay where it had been flung you can leave it there if you choose sir but I have served it upon you Hopper went his way Roland caught up the paper tore it to pieces with his strong hands and tossed them after the man The wind took up the quarrel and scattered the pieces indiscriminately right and left Roland strode on What a mercy that there s a Port Natal to be off to was his comment Things were not particularly promising at home when Roland entered looking at them from a quiet sociable point of view Lady Augusta was spending the evening at the deanery and the children from Gerald downwards were turning the general parlour into a bear garden Romping quarrelling shouting and screaming they were really as unrestrained as so many young bears It would often be no better when Lady Augusta was at home How Gerald and Tod contrived to do their lessons amidst it was a marvel to every one Roland administered a few cuffs to enjoin silence and then went out again he did not much care where His feet took him to the house of his friend Knivett with whom he spent a pleasant evening the topics of conversation turning chiefly upon the glories of Port Natal and Roland s recent adventure with Hopper Had anything been wanted to put the finishing touch to Roland s resolution that little adventure would have supplied it It was past ten when he returned home The noisy throng had dispersed then all except Gerald Gerald had just accomplished his tasks and was now gracefully enjoying a little repose before the fire his head on the back of my lady s low embroidered chair and his feet extended on either hob What s for supper asked Roland turning his eyes on the cloth which bore traces that a party and not a scrupulously tidy one had already partaken of that meal Bones said Gerald Bones echoed Roland Bones rejoined Gerald They made a show of broiling some downstairs but they took good care to cut off the meat first Where all the meat goes to in this house I can t think If a good half of the leg of mutton didn t go down from dinner to day I possessed no eyes They are not going to put me off with bones said Roland ringing the bell When a man s worked within an ace of his life he must eat Martha when the maid appeared I want some supper There s no meat in the house sir There were some broiled bo You may eat the bones yourself interrupted Roland I never saw such a house as this Loads of provisions come into it and yet there s rarely anything to be had when it s wanted You must go and order me some oysters Get four dozen I am famished If I hadn t had a substantial tea supplied me out of charity I should be fainting before this It s a shame I wonder my lady puts up with you two incapable servants There are no oysters to be had at this time mister Roland returned Martha who was accustomed to these interludes touching the housekeeping The shop shuts up at ten Roland beat on the floor with the heel of his boot Then he turned round fiercely to Martha Is there nothing in the house that s eatable There s an apple pie sir Bring that then And while I am going into it the cook can do me some eggs and ham Gerald had turned round at this angry in his turn If there s an apple pie Martha why could you not have produced it for our supper You know we were obliged to put up with cheese and butter Cook told me not to bring it up Master Gerald My lady gave no orders Cook says if she made ten pies a day they d get eaten once you young gentlemen knew of their being in the house Well said Gerald She doesn t provide them out of her own pocket Roland paid his court to the apple pie Gerald joining him After it was finished they kept the cook employed some time with the eggs and ham Then Gerald who had to be up betimes for morning school went to bed and I only hope he did not suffer from nightmare Roland took up his place before the fire in the same chair and position vacated by Gerald Thus he waited for Lady Augusta It was not long before she came in Come and sit down a bit good mother said Roland I want to talk to you My dear I am not in a talking humour she answered My head aches and I shall be glad to get to bed It was a stupid humdrum evening She was walking to the side table to light her bed candle but Roland interposed He drew the couch close to the fire settled his mother in it and took his seat with her She asked him what he had to say so particularly that night I am going to tell you what it is But don t you fly out at me mother dear he coaxingly added I find I can t get along here at all mother and I shall be off to Port Natal Lady Augusta did fly out with a scream and a start from her seat Roland pulled her into it again Now mother just listen to me quietly I can t bear my life at Galloway s I can t do the work If I stopped at it I m not sure but I should do something desperate You wouldn t like to see your son turn jockey and ride in a pink silk jacket and yellow breeches on the race course and you wouldn t like to see him enlist for a soldier or run away for a sailor Well worse than that might come if I stopped at Galloway s Taking it at the very best I should only be worked into my grave I will not hear another word Roland interrupted Lady Augusta How can you be so wicked and ungrateful What is there wicked in it asked Roland Besides you don t know all I can t tell you what I don t owe in Helstonleigh and I ve not a sixpence to pay it with You wouldn t like to see me marched off to prison mother Lady Augusta gave another shriek And there s a third reason why I wish to be away went on Roland drowning the noise But I ll not go into that because it concerns myself alone Of course the announcement that it concerned himself alone only made my lady the more inquisitive to hear it She peremptorily ordered Roland to disclose it to her But Roland could be as peremptory as she and he declined in positive terms to explain further It would not afford you any pleasure mother he said and I should not have mentioned it but as an additional reason why I must be off You unhappy boy You have been doing something dreadful It s not over good acknowledged Roland Perhaps I ll write you word all about it from London I ve not smothered William Yorke or set old Galloway s office on fire and those respected gentlemen are my two betes noires So don t look so scared mother Roland uttered Lady Augusta as the fact struck her if you go off in this manner all the money that was paid with you to mister Galloway will be lost I might as well have sent it down the gutter So I said at the time answered cool Roland Never mind that mother What s that paltry hundred or two compared with the millions I shall make And as to these folks that I owe money to They ll be coming upon me interposed Lady Augusta Heaven knows I have enough to pay They will do nothing of the sort said Roland You have no legal right to pay my debts Not one of them but has been contracted since I was of age If they come to you tell them so Roland Lord Carrick gave you money once or twice when he was here resumed Lady Augusta I know he did What have you done with it all Money melts responded Roland Upon my word of honour I do believe it must melt at times it vanishes so quickly My lady could not cavil at the assertion She was only too much given to the same belief herself Roland continued In a little while about three months as I calculate after my arrival at Port Natal I shall be in a position to send funds home to pay what I owe and be assured I will faithfully send them There is the finest opening mother at Port Natal Fortunes are being made there daily In a few years time I shall come home with my pockets lined and shall settle down by you for life If I could only think the prospect was so good a one exclaimed Lady Augusta It is good said Roland emphatically Why mother Port Natal is all the rage hundreds are going out Were there no reasons to urge me away you would be doing the most unwise thing possible to stand in the light of my going If I were at something that I liked that I was not worked to death at if I did not owe a shilling if my prospects here in short were first rate and my life a bower of rose leaves I should do well to throw it all up for Port Natal But in what manner are these great fortunes made wondered Lady Augusta Of course I shall acquire all that information Stuck in this know nothing Helstonleigh I can only state the fact that they are made I dare say I can find an opening for one or two of the boys out there Lady Augusta persuadable as ever was a child began to look upon the plan with less prejudiced eyes as Roland would have styled it As to Roland so fully had he become imbued with the golden harvest to be gathered at Port Natal that had an angel descended to undeceive him he would have refused to listen There will be the losing you Roland said Lady Augusta hesitating whether she should scold or cry Law what s that returned Roland slightingly You ll get over that in a day and return thanks that there s one source of trouble less Look here If I were in the luck of having a good commission given me in some crack Indian regiment would you not say Oh be joyful and start me off at once What are you the worse for George s being away Mother he added somewhat passionately would you like to see me tied down for life to an old proctor s office But Roland you cannot go out without money There ll be your outfit and your passage and you can t land with empty pockets As to an outfit said Roland you must not run your head upon such a one as George had A few new shirts and a pair or two of waterproof boots that will be about all I shall want I remember shirts and waterproof boots were mentioned by Bagshaw What I shall chiefly want to buy will be tools and household utensils frying pans and items of that sort Frying pans ejaculated Lady Augusta I am sure frying pans were mentioned answered Roland Perhaps it was only one though for private use I ll hunt up Bagshaw s list and look it over And where s the money to come from repeated my lady I shall get it of Lord Carrick I know he ll give me what I want I often talked to him about Port Natal when he was here I had a letter from him to day said Lady Augusta He will be returning to Ireland next week Will he though uttered Roland aroused by the information I have no time to lose then Well Roland I must hear more about this to morrow and consider it over said my lady rising to retire I have not said yet you are to go mind I shall go whether you say it or not replied frank Roland And when I come home with my pockets lined a rich man for life the first thing I ll buy shall be a case of diamonds for you Stupid boy said she laughing I shall be too old to wear diamonds then Oh no you won t My lady gave him a hearty kiss and went to bed and to sleep Roland s visions were not without their effect upon her and she had a most delightful dream of driving about in a charming city whose streets were paved with malachite marble brilliant to look upon How many times Roland had dreamt that Port Natal was paved with gold he alone knew Had Roland been troubled with over sensitiveness in regard to other people s feelings and felt himself at a loss how to broach the matter to mister Galloway he might have been pleased to find that the way was in a degree paved to him On the following morning mister Galloway was at the office considerably before his usual hour consequently before Roland Yorke Upon looking over Roland s work of the previous day he found that a deed a deed that was in a hurry too had been imperfectly drawn out and would have to be done over again The cause must have been sheer carelessness and mister Galloway naturally felt angered When the gentleman arrived he told him what he thought of his conduct winding up the reproaches with a declaration that Roland did him no service at all and would be as well out of the office as in it I am glad of that sir was Roland s answer What I was about to tell you will make no difference then I wish to leave sir Do you retorted mister Galloway I am going to leave sir added Roland rather improving upon the assertion I am going to Port Natal mister Galloway was a little taken aback Going to where cried he To Port Natal To Port Natal echoed mister Galloway in the most unbounded astonishment for not an inkling of Roland s long thought of project had ever reached him What on earth should you want there To make my fortune replied Roland Oh said mister Galloway When do you start It is quite true sir continued Roland Of course I could not go without informing you Do you start to day repeated mister Galloway in the same mocking tone No I don t said Roland But I shall start sir before long and I beg you to believe me I have talked Lady Augusta over to the plan and I shall get the money for it from Lord Carrick I might drum on here all my life and never rise to be anything better than a proctor besides having my life worked out of me whereas if I can get to Port Natal my fortune s made Hundreds and thousands of enterprising spirits are emigrating there and they are all going to make their fortunes Had mister Galloway not been angry he would have laughed out right Yorke said he did you ever hear of a sickness that fell suddenly upon this kingdom some years ago It was called the gold fever Hundreds and thousands as you phrase it caught the mania and flocked out to the Australian gold diggings to make their fortunes by picking up gold Boy laying his hand on Roland s shoulder how many of those think you instead of making their fortunes only went out TO DIE That was not Port Natal sir It was not But unless some of you wild young men come to your senses we shall have a second edition of the Australian madness at Port Natal Nothing can be more futile than these visionary schemes Roland Yorke they are like the apples of Sodom fair and promising to the eye ashes to the taste Do not you be deceived by them One must get on at Port Natal sir If one does not get off returned mister Galloway in a cynical tone that chafed Roland s ear The stream that flocked out to the gold diggings all thought they should get on each individual was fully persuaded that he should come home in a year or two with a plum in each of his breeches pockets Where one made his way Roland made wealth many starved died vanished it was not known how were never heard of by their friends or saw old England again What good do you suppose you could do at Port Natal I intend to do a great deal said Roland But suppose you found you could do none suppose it I say what would become of you out in a strange place without money and without friends Well returned Roland who was never at a loss for an answer if such an impossible thing as a failure were to turn up I should come back to my Uncle Carrick and make him start me in something else Ah mockingly observed mister Galloway a rolling stone gathers no moss Meanwhile mister Roland Yorke suppose you come down from the clouds to your proper business Draw out this deed again and see if you can accomplish it to a little better purpose than you did yesterday Roland liking the tone less and less sat down and grew sullen Don t say I did not give you notice sir he observed But mister Galloway vouchsafed no reply Indeed it may be questioned if he heard the remark for he went into his own room at the moment Roland spoke and shut the door after him Mocking old caterpillar grumbled angry Roland No fortunes at Port Natal I d go off if it was only to tantalize him CHAPTER L REALLY GONE missus Jenkins had many virtues Besides the cardinal one which has been particularly brought under the reader s notice that of keeping her husband in due subjection she also possessed in an eminent degree the excellent quality of being a most active housewife In fact she had the bump of rule and order and personally superintended everything with hands and tongue Amongst other careful habits was that of never letting any one put a finger on her best sitting room for the purpose of cleaning it except herself She called it her drawing room a small pretty room over the shop very well furnished It was let to mister Harper with the bedroom behind it Had Lydia dared even to wipe the dust off a table it might have cost her her place missus Jenkins was wont to slip her old buff dressing gown over her clothes after she was dressed in a morning and take herself to this drawing room Twice a week it was carefully swept and on those occasions a large green handkerchief tied cornerwise upon missus Jenkins s head to save her cap from dust was added to her costume On the morning following Roland s communication to mister Galloway missus Jenkins was thus occupied a dust pan in one hand a short hand broom in the other for you may be sure she did not sweep her carpets with those long slashing tear away brooms that wear out a carpet in six months and the green kerchief adjusted gracefully over her ears when she heard a man s footsteps clattering up the stairs In much astonishment as to who could have invaded the house at that hour missus Jenkins rose from her knees and flung open the door It was Roland Yorke coming up at full speed with a carpet bag in his hand Whatever do you want exclaimed she Is anything the matter The matter is that I want to say a word to Jenkins replied Roland I know he must be in bed so I just ran straight through the shop and came up I m sure you are very polite exclaimed missus Jenkins For all you knew I might have been in the room So you might cried easy Roland I never thought of that I should not have swallowed you missus Jenkins Take care I have hardly a minute to spare I shall lose the train On he went up the second flight of stairs without the slightest hesitation and into Jenkins s room ignoring the ceremony of knocking Poor Jenkins who had heard the colloquy and recognized Roland s voice was waiting for him with wondering eyes I am off Jenkins said Roland advancing and bending over the bed I wouldn t go without just saying a word to you Off where sir returned Jenkins who could not have looked more bewildered had he been suddenly aroused from sleep To Port Natal I am sick and tired of everything here so I m off at last Jenkins was struck dumb Of course the first thought that passed through his mind was mister Galloway s discomfiture unless he was prepared for it This is very sudden sir he cried when speech came to him Who is replacing you at the office No one replied Roland That s the primest bit in the whole play Galloway will know what work is now I told him yesterday morning that I should go but he went into a tantrum and didn t take it in earnest He pointed out to me about sixty things as my day s work to day when he left the office last night errands to go upon and writings to do and answers to give and the office to mind A glorious commotion there ll be when he finds it s all thrown upon his own hands He ll see how he likes work Jenkins could do nothing but stare Roland went on I have just slipped round there now to leave a message with my compliments It will turn his hair green when he hears it and finds I am really gone Do you feel any better Jenkins The question was put in a different tone a soft gentle tone one in which Roland rarely spoke He had never seen Jenkins look so ill as he was looking now I shall never feel any better in this world sir Well give us your hand Jenkins I must be off You are the only one old fellow that I have said good bye to You have been a good lot Jenkins and done things for me that other clerks would not Good luck to you old chap whether you go into the next world or whether you stop in this God bless you mister Roland God bless you everywhere Roland leapt down the stairs missus Jenkins stood at the drawing room door Good bye said he to her You see I should not have had time to eat you What d ye call that thing you have got upon your head missus Jenkins Only wear it to church next Sunday and you ll set the fashion Away he tore to the station The first person he saw there officials excepted was Hamish Channing who had gone to it for the purpose of seeing a friend off by the train The second was Lady Augusta Yorke Hamish he saw first as he was turning away from getting his ticket Hamish said he you ll tell Arthur that I did not come round to him for a last word I shall write it from London Roland and Hamish spoke more gravely than was his wont you are starting upon a wild goose scheme It is not said Roland why do you preach up nonsense If the worst came to the worst I should come back to Carrick and he d set me on my legs again I tell you Hamish I have a hundred reasons to urge me away from Helstonleigh Is this carpet bag all your luggage All I am taking with me The rest will be sent afterwards Had I despatched the bellman about the town to announce my departure I might have been stopped so I have told no one except poor harmless Jenkins Of course it never occurred to proud and improvident Roland that it was possible to travel in any carriage but a first class one A first class ticket he took and a first class compartment he entered Fortunately it was an empty one Hamish was filling up the door talking to him when sounds of distress were heard coming swiftly along the platform Before Hamish had time to see what caused them they were close upon his ear and he found himself vehemently pushed aside just as Roland himself might have pushed him He turned with surprise Panting breathless in tears wailing out that she should never see her darling son again stood the Lady Augusta Yorke What could be the cause of her appearing there in that state The cause was Roland On the previous day he had held a second conversation with his mother picturing the glories of Port Natal in colours so vivid that the thought nearly crossed my lady s mind couldn t she go too and make her fortune She then inquired when he meant to start Oh answered Roland carelessly between now and a week s time The real fact was that he contemplated being away on the following morning before my lady was up Roland s motive was not an unfilial one He knew how she excited herself over these partings the violent if short grief to which she gave the reins he remembered what it had been on the departure of his brother George One other motive also held weight with him and induced reticence It was very desirable remembering that he was not perfectly free from claims upon his purse that he should depart if not absolutely sub rosa still without its being extensively known and that he knew would be next door to an impossibility were the exact period confided to my lady Lady Augusta Yorke could not have kept a secret for a single hour had it been to save her life Accordingly she retired to rest in blissful ignorance and in ignorance she might have remained until he was fairly off but for Roland s own want of caution Up with daylight and daylight you know does not surprise us too early when the dark days of November are at hand Roland began turning over his drawers and closets to pick out the few articles he meant to carry with him the rest would be packed afterwards This aroused his mother whose room was underneath his and she angrily wondered what he could be doing Not for some time until after the noise had ceased did the faintest suspicion of the truth break upon her and it might not then have done so but for the sudden remembrance which rose in her mind of Roland s particularly affectionate farewell the night before Lady Augusta rang her bell Do you know what mister Roland is about in his room she inquired when Martha answered it mister Roland is gone out my lady was Martha s reply He came down to the kitchen and drank a cup of coffee and then went out with a carpet bag Lady Augusta became excited Where s he gone she wildly asked Somewhere by rail I think my lady He said as he drank his coffee that he hoped our heads wouldn t ache till he saw us again Cook and me couldn t think what he meant my lady My lady divined only too well She gave a prolonged series of shrieks jumped out of bed flung on any clothes that came uppermost and started in pursuit of him to the intense wonder of Martha and to the astonishment of Helstonleigh as she flew wildly through the streets to the station The sight of Hamish at a carriage door guided her to her runagate son She sprang into the carriage it was well I say that it was empty and overwhelmed him with a torrent of reproaches all the while kissing and hugging him Not two minutes could be given to their farewell for the time was up and Lady Augusta had to descend again weeping bitterly Take care of her home Hamish said Roland putting his head out Mother dear you ll live to say I have done well yet You ll see me come home one of these fine days with a covered waggon after me bringing the bags of gold Poor Roland The train steamed off and Lady Augusta to the discomfiture of Hamish and the admiration of the porters and station boys set off at full speed after it wringing her hands and tearing her hair and sobbing and shrieking out that She d go she d go with it that she should never see her darling boy again With some difficulty Hamish soothed her down to tolerable calmness and put her into a fly They were scarcely beyond the station when she suddenly bent forward to Hamish who sat on the seat opposite to her and seized his hands Is it true that every one gets rich who goes to Port Natal The question was a poser for sunny Hamish He liked to scatter flowers in his path rather than thorns How could he tell that grieving woman that Roland careless lazy improvident Roland would be almost sure to return in a worse plight than he had gone I have heard of people doing well at Port Natal he answered and Roland is young and strong and has years before him I cannot think how so much money can be made continued my lady beginning to dry her tears There are no gold fields there are there I think not said Hamish They must trade then I suppose And goodness me what does Roland know about trading Nothing He talks of taking out tools and frying pans Frying pans repeated Hamish struck with the item I am sure he said frying pans Oh dear sobbed Lady Augusta what a relief it would be if folks never had any children or if boys did not possess wills of their own Hamish you have never given sorrow to your mother I feel that you have not Hamish smiled at her Now you know Lady Augusta that your children are your dearest treasures cried he soothingly You would be the most unhappy woman living if you had none Ah you can t judge mister Hamish Channing You have no children of your own No said Hamish laughing but my turn may come some day Dear Lady Augusta if Roland has his faults he has his good qualities Look on the bright side of things Look forward with hope to the time that you shall see him home safe and well again It will be sure to come You speak as if you believed it would Of course I do said Hamish And every one finds me a true prophet They were then passing the Hazledon Charity At the iron gates of the inclosure talking to an old man stood the reverend William Yorke Roland left a message for him exclaimed Hamish half mockingly as his eyes fell upon the clergyman Lady Augusta impulse all over suddenly put her head out at the window and stopped the fly William Yorke looking surprised to see who were its inmates advanced to the door The lady s tears flowed afresh He is gone William My darling self willed troublesome boy is gone and I shall perhaps never see him more till I am an old woman Who is gone returned mister Yorke Roland Never was a mother so tried as I He will soon be on the sea ploughing his way to Port Natal I wish there was no sea no Port Natals He went off without saying a word to me and he is GONE mister Yorke bewildered turned his eyes on Hamish for explanation He had never heard of the Port Natal project Hamish nodded in confirmation The best place for him said mister Yorke He must work for his bread there before he eats it Lady Augusta shrieked How cruelly hard you are William Not hard Lady Augusta kind he gently said If your boys were brought up to depend upon their own exertions they would make better men You said you had a message for him from Roland resumed Lady Augusta looking at Hamish Hamish smiled significantly Not much of one he said and his lips as he bent towards William Yorke assumed an expression of sarcastic severity He merely requested me after he was in the train to give his love to the reverend William Yorke as a parting legacy Either the words or the tone probably the latter struck on the reverend William Yorke s self esteem and flushed his cheek crimson Since the rupture with Constance Hamish though not interfering in the remotest degree had maintained a tone of quiet sarcasm to mister Yorke And though mister Yorke did not like it he could not prevent it When does mister Channing return he abruptly asked of Hamish We shall be expecting him shortly now Lady Augusta gave the signal for the fly to drive on William Yorke put his hand over the door and took hers as the man began to whip up his horse Do not grieve too much after him Lady Augusta It may prove to be the best day s work Roland ever did God has given him hands and brains and a good heart as I verily believe If he shall only learn their value out there let his lines be ever so hard he may come home a wise and a good man One of my poor pensioners here said to me not ten minutes ago I was brought to know my Saviour sir through hard lines Lady Augusta those hard lines are never sent in vain CHAPTER LI AN ARRIVAL IN A FLY Was any one ever so ill used as that unfortunate mister Galloway On the morning which witnessed his troublesome clerk s departure he set rather longer than usual over his breakfast never dreaming of the calamity in store for him That his thoughts were given to business there was no doubt for his newspaper lay untouched In point of fact his mind was absorbed by the difficulties which had arisen in his office and the ways and means by which those difficulties might be best remedied That it would be impossible to get on with Roland Yorke alone he had said to himself twenty times and now he was saying it again little supposing poor unconscious man that even Roland bad as he was had taken flight He had never intended to get along with only Roland but circumstances had induced him to attempt doing so for a time In the first place he had entertained hopes until very recently that Jenkins would recover in the second place failing Jenkins there was no one in the wide world he would so soon have in his office as Arthur Channing provided that Arthur could prove his innocence With Arthur and Roland he could go on very well or with Jenkins and Roland but poor Jenkins appeared to be passing beyond hope and Arthur s innocence was no nearer the light than it had been in spite of that strange restitution of the money Moreover Arthur had declined to return to the office even to help with the copying preferring to take it home All these reflections were pressing upon mister Galloway s mind I ll wait no longer said he as he brought them to a conclusion I ll go this very day after that young Bartlett I think he might suit with some drilling If he turns out a second Yorke I shall have a nice pair upon my hands But he can t well turn out as bad as Roland he comes of a more business like stock This point settled mister Galloway took up the Times Something in its pages awoke his interest and he sat longer over it than had been his wont since the departure of Jenkins It was twenty minutes past nine by his watch when he started for his office Now I wonder how I shall find that gentleman soliloquized he when he drew near Amusing himself as usual of course He ll have made a show of putting out the papers and there they will be lying unopened He ll be at Aunt Sally with the letters or dancing a quadrille with the stools or stretched three parts out of the window saluting the passengers I never thought he d do me much good and should not have taken him but for the respect I owed the late doctor Yorke Now for it It was all very well for mister Galloway to say Now for it and to put his hand stealthily upon the door handle with the intention of pouncing suddenly upon his itinerant pupil But the door would not open mister Galloway turned and turned and shook the handle as our respected friend mister Ketch did when he was locked up in the cloisters but he turned it to no purpose He has not come yet wrathfully exclaimed mister Galloway All the work of the office on his shoulders and mine the most busy time of the whole year and here s half past nine and no appearance of him If I live this day out I ll complain to Lady Augusta At this moment the housekeeper s little maid came running forward Where s mister Yorke thundered the proctor in his anger as if the child had the keeping of him Please sir he s gone to Port Natal Gone to what uttered mister Galloway She was unlocking the door and then stood back to curtsey while mister Galloway entered following in after him an intelligent child for her years Please sir mister Yorke came round this morning while me and missis was a dusting of the place and he said we was to tell mister Galloway when he come that he had gone to Port Natal and left his compliments It is not true cried mister Galloway How dare he play these tricks he added to himself Please sir missis said she thought it was true cause he had a carpet bag returned the young servant mister Galloway stared at the child You go round at once to Lady Augusta s said he and ask what mister Yorke means by being so late I desire that he will come immediately The child flew off and mister Galloway hardly knowing what to make of matters proceeded to do what he ought to have found done He and Jenkins had duplicate keys to the desks letter box et cetera Since Jenkins s illness his keys had been in the possession of Roland Presently the child came back again Please sir her ladyship s compliments and mister Roland have gone to Port Natal The consternation that this would have caused mister Galloway had he believed it might have been pitiable An intimation that our clerk who was in the office last night pursuing his legitimate work has gone to Port Natal as we might say of some one who goes to make a morning call at the next door is not very credible Neither did mister Galloway give credence to it Did you see her ladyship he asked Please sir I saw one of the servants and she went to her ladyship and brought out the message The young messenger retired leaving mister Galloway to his fate He persisted in assuming that the news was too absurd to be correct but a dreadful inward misgiving began to steal over him The question was set at rest by the Lady Augusta Feeling excessively vexed with Roland for not having informed mister Galloway of his intended departure as from the message it would appear he had not done she determined to go round and did so following closely on the heels of the maid Her ladyship had already wonderfully recovered her spirits They were of a mercurial nature liable to go up and down at touch and Hamish had contrived to cheer her greatly What does all this mean Where s Roland began mister Galloway showing little more deference to her ladyship in his flurry than he might have shown to Roland himself Did you not know he was going she asked I know nothing Where is he gone He has started for Port Natal that is he has started for London on his way to it He went by the eight o clock train mister Galloway sat down in consternation My lady allow me to inquire what sort of behaviour you call this Whether it is good or bad right or wrong I can t help it was the reply of Lady Augusta I m sure I have enough to bear she added melting into tears Of course he ought to have informed you of his intention mister Galloway I thought he did He told me he had done so A reminiscence of Roland s communication crossed mister Galloway s mind of his words Don t say I did not give you notice sir He had paid no heed to it at the time He is just another of my headstrong boys grumbled Lady Augusta They are all specimens of wilfulness I never knew that it was this morning he intended to be off until he was gone and I had to run after him to the station Ask Hamish Channing He must be mad exclaimed mister Galloway He says great fortunes are made out at Port Natal I don t know whether it is so Great fortunes made irascibly responded mister Galloway Pittances that folks go out with are lost when they are such as he That s what it is Harem scarem chaps who won t work can do no good at Port Natal Great fortunes made indeed I wonder that you can be led away by notions so wild and extravagant Lady Augusta I am not led away by them peevishly returned Lady Augusta a recollection of her own elation on the point darting unpleasantly to her mind Where would have been the use of my holding out against it when he had set his heart upon the thing He would have gone in spite of me Do you not think fortunes are made there mister Galloway I am sure they are not by such as Roland was the reply A man who works one hour in the day and plays eleven would do less good at Port Natal than he would in his own country A business man thoroughly industrious and possessing some capital may make something at Port Natal as he would at any other port In the course of years he might realize a fortune in the course of years I say Lady Augusta This was not precisely the prospect Roland had pictured to Lady Augusta or to which her own imagination had lent its hues and she stood in consternation almost equal to mister Galloway s What on earth will he do then when he gets there ejaculated she Find out his mistake my lady and come home without a coat to his back as hundreds have done before him and worked their passage home to get here It is to be hoped he will have to do the same It will teach him what work is There never was such an unhappy mother as I am bewailed my lady They will do just as they like and always would from George downwards they won t listen to me Poor dear boy reduced perhaps to live on brown bread and pea soup And lucky to get that cried angry mister Galloway But the present question Lady Augusta is not what he may do when he gets to Port Natal but what am I to do without him here Look at the position it has placed me in Lady Augusta could give neither help nor counsel In good truth it was not her fault But she saw that mister Galloway seemed to think it was hers or that it was partially hers She departed home again feeling cross with Roland feeling damped about his expedition and beginning to fancy that Port Natal might not after all bring her diamonds to wear or offer her streets paved with malachite marble mister Galloway sat down and reiterated the question in relation to himself which Lady Augusta had put regarding Roland when he should arrive at Port Natal What on earth was he to do He could not close his office he could not perform its various duties himself he could not be out of doors and in at one and the same time unless indeed he cut himself in two What was he to do It was more than mister Galloway could tell He put his two hands upon his knees and stared in consternation feeling himself grow hot and cold alternately Could Roland then whirling along in the train reclining at his ease his legs up on the opposite cushion as he enjoyed a luxurious pipe to the inestimable future benefit of the carriage have taken a view of mister Galloway and his discomfiture his delight would have been unbounded Incorrigible as he was he was better than nobody ejaculated mister Galloway rubbing up his flaxen curls He could keep office if he did not do much in it he received and answered callers he went out on hasty messages and upon a pinch he did accomplish an hour or so s copying I am down on my beam ends and no mistake What a simpleton the fellow must be Port Natal indeed for him If Lord Carrick were not own brother to my lady he might have the sense to stop it Why Arrival the first and no one to answer it but mister Galloway A fly had driven up and stopped at the door No one appeared to be getting out of it so mister Galloway perforce proceeded to see what it wanted It might contain one of the chapter or the dean himself But by the time he reached the pavement the inmates were descending A short lady in a black bonnet and short black skirts had let herself out on the opposite side and had come round to assist somebody out on this Was it a ghost or was it a man His cheeks were hollow and hectic his eyes were glistening as with fever his chest heaved He had a fur boa wrapped round his neck and his overcoat hung loosely on his tall attenuated form which seemed too weak to support itself or to get down the fly steps without being lifted Now don t you be in a hurry the lady was saying in a cross tone You ll come pitch into the mud with your nose Can t you wait It s my belief you are wanting to do it Here let me get firm hold of you you know you are as weak as ever was a rat You may recognize the voice as belonging to missus Jenkins and that poor shadow could be no one but Jenkins himself for there certainly was not another like it in all Helstonleigh mister Galloway stood in astonishment wondering what this new move could mean The descent accomplished Jenkins was conducted by his wife through the passage to the office He went straight to his old place at his desk and sat down on his stool his chest palpitating his breath coming in great sighs Laying his hat beside him he turned respectfully to mister Galloway who had followed him in speaking with all his native humility I have come sir to do what I can for you in this emergency And there he stopped coughing panting shaking looking like a man more fit to be lying on his death bed than to be keeping office mister Galloway gazed at him with compassion He said nothing Jenkins at that moment could neither have heard nor answered and missus Jenkins was out paying the driver The paroxysm was not over when she came in She approached Jenkins slightly shook him her mode of easing the cough dived in his pockets for his silk handkerchief with which she wiped his brow took off the fur from his neck waited until he was quiet and began I hope you are satisfied If you are not you ought to be Who s to know whether you ll get back alive I don t What did he come for asked mister Galloway Ah said missus Jenkins that s just what I want to know As if he could do any good in the state he is Look at him sir Poor Jenkins who was indeed a sight to be looked at turned his wan face upon mister Galloway I cannot do much sir I know I wish I could but I can sit in the office at least I hope I can just to take care of it while you are out sir until you can find somebody to replace mister Roland How did you know he was gone off demanded mister Galloway It was in this way interposed missus Jenkins ages before poor Jenkins could gain breath to answer I was on my hands and knees brushing the fluff off my drawing room carpet this morning when I heard something tearing up the stairs at the rate of a coach and six Who should it be but young mister Yorke on his way to Jenkins in bed without saying so much as With your leave or By your leave A minute or two and down he came again gave me a little touch of his impudence and was gone before I could answer Well sir I kept on at my room and when it was done I went downstairs to see about the breakfast never suspecting what was going on with him pointing her finger at Jenkins I was pouring out his tea when it was ready to take up to him and putting a bit of something on a plate which I intended to make him eat when I heard somebody creeping down the stairs stumbling and panting and coughing and out I rushed There stood he he mister Galloway dressed and washed as you see him now he that has not got up lately till evening and me dressing him then Have you took leave of your senses said I to him No said he my dear but I must go to the office to day I can t help myself Young mister Yorke s gone away and there ll be nobody And good luck go with him for all the use he s of here getting you out of your bed said I If Jenkins were as strong as he used to be mister Galloway I should have felt tempted to treat him to a shaking and then perhaps he d have remembered it mister Roland told me he was going away sir and that you had nobody to replace him indeed I gathered that you were ignorant of the step struck in the quiet meek voice of poor Jenkins I could not stay away sir knowing the perplexity you would be put to No it s my belief he could not tartly chimed in Jenkins s lady He would have tantalized himself into a fever Why mister Galloway had I marched him back to his bed and turned the key upon him he d have been capable of letting himself down by a cord from his window in the face and eyes of all the street Now Jenkins I ll have none of your contradiction you know you would My dear I am not contradicting I am not well enough to contradict panted poor Jenkins He would have come off there and then all by himself he would mister Galloway as I am a living sinner she hotly continued It s unbeknown how he d have got here holding on by the wall like a snail or fastening himself on to the tail of a cart but try at it in some way he would Be quiet Jenkins How dare you attempt to interrupt Poor Jenkins had not thought to interrupt he was only making a movement to pull off his great coat missus Jenkins resumed No said I to him if you must go you shall be conveyed there but you don t start without your breakfast So I sat him down in his chair mister Galloway and gave him his breakfast such as it was If there s one thing that Jenkins is obstinate in above all others it s about eating Then I sent Lydia for a fly and wrapped up his throat in my boa and that he wanted to fight against and here he is I wished to get here sir before you did cried Jenkins meekly I knew the exertion would set me coughing at first but if I had sat awhile before you saw me I should not have seemed so incapable I shall be better presently sir What are you at with that coat tartly asked missus Jenkins I declare your hands are never at rest Your coat s not to come off Jenkins The office is colder than our parlour and you ll keep it on Jenkins humbly obeying began to turn up the cuffs I can do a little writing sir he said to mister Galloway Is there anything that is in a hurry Jenkins said mister Galloway I could not suffer you to write I could not keep you here Were I to allow you to stop in the state you are just to serve me I should lay a weight upon my conscience missus Jenkins looked up in triumph You hear Jenkins What did I tell you I said I d let you have your way for once twas but the cost of the fly but that if mister Galloway kept you here once he set eyes on your poor creachy body I d eat him Jenkins my poor fellow said mister Galloway gravely you must know that you are not in a state to exert yourself I shall not forget your kindness but you must go back at once Why the very draught from the frequent opening of the door would do you an injury the exertion of speaking to answer callers would be too much for you Didn t I tell you so Jenkins just in them very words interrupted the lady I am aware that I am not strong sir acknowledged Jenkins to mister Galloway with a deprecatory glance towards his wife to be allowed to speak But it is better I should be put to a trifle of inconvenience than that you should sir I can sit here sir while you are obliged to be out or occupied in your private room What could you do sir left entirely alone I don t know what I can do returned mister Galloway with an acidity of tone equal to that displayed by missus Jenkins for the question recalled all the perplexity of his position Sacrifice yourself to me Jenkins you shall not What absurd folly can have taken off Roland Yorke he added Do you know No sir I don t When mister Roland came in this morning and said he was really off you might have knocked me down with a feather He would often get talking about Port Natal but I never supposed it would come to anything mister Roland was one given to talk He had some tea at our house the other night and was talking about it then struck in missus Jenkins He said he was worked to death Worked to death satirically repeated mister Galloway I m afraid sir that through my unfortunate absence he has found the work heavier and he grew dissatisfied said Jenkins It has troubled me very much You spoilt him Jenkins that s the fact observed mister Galloway You did his work and your own Idle young dog He ll get a sickener at Port Natal There s one thing to be thankful for sir said patient Jenkins that he has his uncle the earl to fall back upon Hark at him interrupted missus Jenkins That s just like him He d be thankful to hear that his worst enemy had an uncle to fall back upon That s Jenkins all over But now what is to be the next movement she sharply demanded I must get back to my shop Is he to come with me or to stop here a spectacle for every one that comes in But at this moment before the question could be decided though you may rest assured missus Jenkins would only allow it to be decided in her own way hasty footsteps were heard in the passage and the door was thrown open by Arthur Charming CHAPTER LII A RELIC FROM THE BURIAL GROUND When Hamish Charming joined the breakfast table at home that morning at nine o clock he mentioned his adventure at the station with Lady Augusta Yorke It was the first intimation they had received of Roland s departure indeed the first that some of them had heard of his intention to depart Arthur laid down his knife and fork To him alone could the full consequences of the step present themselves as regarded mister Galloway Hamish he cannot actually have gone That he is actually off by the train to London I can certify was the reply of Hamish Whether he will be off to Port Natal is another thing He desired me to tell you Arthur that he should write his adieu to you from town He might have come to see me observed Arthur a shade of resentment in his tone I never thought he would really go I did said Hamish funds permitting him If Lord Carrick will supply those he ll be off by the first comfortable ship that sails His mind was so completely bent upon it What can he think of doing at Port Natal inquired Constance wonderingly Making his fortune But Hamish laughed as he said it Wherever I may have met him latterly his whole talk has been of Port Natal Lady Augusta says he is going to take out frying pans to begin with Hamish She said so Constance I have no doubt Roland said so to her I should like to see the sort of cargo he will lay in for the start What does mister Galloway say to it I wonder exclaimed Arthur that gentleman s perplexities presenting themselves to his mind above everything else I cannot think what he will do I have an idea that mister Galloway is as yet unaware of it said Hamish Roland assured me that no person whatever knew of his departure except Jenkins He called upon him on his way to the station Unaware of it Arthur fell into consternation great as mister Galloway s as he repeated the words Was it possible that Roland had stolen a march on mister Galloway He relapsed into silence and thought What makes you so sad Constance asked of Arthur later when they were dispersing to their several occupations I am not sad Constance only thoughtful I have been carrying on an inward battle he added half laughingly With your conscience With my spirit It is a proud one yet in spite of all I have had to tame it a great deal more rebellious than I like it to be Why what is the matter Arthur Constance I think I ought to come forward and help mister Galloway out of this strait I think my duty lies in doing it To return to his office you mean Yes until he can see his way out of the wood But it goes against the grain Arthur dear I know you will do it she gently said Were our duty always pleasant to us where would be the merit in fulfilling it I shall do it he answered To that I have made up my mind The difficulty is Constance to do it with a good grace She looked at him with a loving smile Only try A firm will Arthur will conquer even a rebellious spirit Arthur knew it He knew how to set about it And a little later he was on his way to Close Street with the best grace in the world Not only in appearance mind you but inwardly It is a GREAT thing reader to conquer the risings of a proud spirit To bring it from its haughty rebellious pedestal down to cordiality and love Have you learnt the way Some parchments under his arm for he had stayed to collect them together Arthur bounded in to mister Galloway s The first object his eyes fell on was that shadowy form coughing and panting Oh Jenkins he involuntarily uttered what do you do out of your house Anxiety for me has brought him out said mister Galloway How can I scold him I could not rest sir knowing my master was alone in his need cried Jenkins to Arthur What is to become of the office sir with no one in it But he is not alone said Arthur and if he had wanted a reward for coming forward that moment would have supplied it in satisfying poor Jenkins If you will allow me sir Arthur added turning frankly to mister Galloway I will take my place here until you shall be suited Thank you emphatically replied mister Galloway It will relieve me from a serious embarrassment Arthur went to his old desk and sat down on his old stool and began settling the papers and other things on it just as though he had not been absent an hour I must still attend the cathedral as usual sir he observed to mister Galloway but I can give you the whole of my remaining time I shall be better for you than no one I would rather have you here than any one else Channing he laying his hand on Jenkins s shoulder excepted I offered that you should return before I know you did sir replied Arthur in a brief tone one that seemed to intimate he would prefer not to pursue the subject And now are you satisfied struck in missus Jenkins to her husband I am more than satisfied answered Jenkins clasping his hands With mister Arthur in the office I shall have no fear of its missing me and I can go home in peace to die Please just to hold your tongue about dying reprimanded missus Jenkins Your business is to get well if you can And now I am going to see after a fly A pretty dance I should have had here if he had persisted in stopping bringing him messes and cordials every half hour Which would have worn out first I wonder the pavement or my shoes Channing said mister Galloway let us understand each other Have you come here to do anything there may be to do out of doors as well as in In short to be my clerk as heretofore Of course I have sir until Arthur spoke very distinctly you shall be able to suit yourself not longer Then take this paper round to Deering s office and get it signed You will have time to do it before college Arthur s answer was to put on his hat and vault away with the paper Jenkins turned to mister Galloway as soon as they were alone Oh sir keep him in your office he earnestly said He will soon be of more value to you than I have ever been That he will not Jenkins Nor any one else Yes he will sir He will be able to replace you in the chapter house upon any emergency and I never could do that you know sir not being a gentleman When you have him to yourself alone sir you will see his value and I shall not be missed He is steady and thoughtful beyond his years sir and every day will make him older You forget the charge against him Jenkins Until he shall be cleared of that if he can be cleared of it he will not be of great value to any one certainly not to me Sir said Jenkins raising his wan face its hectic deepening find his eye lighting while his voice sunk to a whisper so deep as to savour of solemnity that time will come He never did it and he will as surely be cleared as that I am now saying it Sir I have thought much about this accusation it has troubled me in sleep but I know that God will bring the right to light for those who trust in Him If any one ever trusted in God it is mister Arthur Channing I lie and think of all this sir I seem to be so near God now Jenkins went on dreamily that I know the right must come to light that it will come in God s own good time And I believe I shall live to see it You have certainly firm faith in his innocence Jenkins How then do you account for his very suspicious manner It does not weigh with me sir I could as soon believe a good wholesome apple tree would bring forth poison as that mister Arthur would be guilty of a deliberately bad action Sometimes I have thought sir when puzzling over it that he may be screening another There s no telling how it was I hear sir that the money has been returned to you Yes Was it he who told you It was mister Roland Yorke who told me sir mister Roland is another sir who has had firm faith in his innocence from the first Much his faith goes for ejaculated mister Galloway as he came back from his private room with a letter which he handed to Jenkins who was skilled in caligraphy What do you make of it he asked It is the letter which came with the returned money It is a disguised hand sir there s no doubt of that replied Jenkins when he had surveyed it critically I do not remember to have seen any person write like it mister Galloway took it back to his room and presently a fly drove up with missus Jenkins inside it Jenkins stood at the office door hat in hand his face turned upon the room missus Jenkins came up and seized his arm to marshal him to the fly I was but taking a farewell of things sir he observed to mister Galloway I shall never see the old spot again Arthur arrived just as Jenkins was safely in He put his hand over the door Make yourself easy Jenkins it will all go on smoothly here Good bye old fellow I ll come and see you very soon How he breaks does he not sir exclaimed Arthur to mister Galloway Ay he s not long for this world The fly proceeded on its way missus Jenkins with her snappish manner though really not unkind heart lecturing Jenkins on his various shortcomings until it drew up at their own door As Jenkins was being helped down from it one of the college boys passed at a great speed a railroad was nothing to it It was Stephen Bywater Something legitimate or illegitimate had detained him and now the college bell was going He caught sight of Jenkins and hurried as he was much of punishment as he was bargaining for it had such an effect upon him that he pulled up short Was it Jenkins or his ghost Bywater had never been so struck with any sight before The most appropriate way in which it occurred to him to give vent to his surprise was to prop his back against the shop door and indulge in a soft prolonged whistle He could not take his eyes from Jenkins s face Is it you or your shadow Jenkins he asked making room for the invalid to pass It s myself sir thank you I hope you are well sir Oh I m always jolly replied Bywater and then he began to whistle again He followed mister and missus Jenkins into the shop with his eyes that is they followed Jenkins Bywater had heard as a matter of necessity of Jenkins s illness and had given as much thought to it as he would have done if told Jenkins had a headache but to fancy him like this had never occurred to Bywater Now somewhere beneath Bywater s waistcoat there really was a little bit of heart and as he thus looked a great fear began to thump against it He followed Jenkins into the parlour missus Jenkins after divesting Jenkins of his coat and her boa planted him right before the fire in his easy chair with a pillow at his back and was now whisking down into the kitchen regardless of certain customers waiting in the shop to be served Bywater unasked sat himself in a chair near to poor Jenkins and his panting breath and indulged in another long stare I say Jenkins said he what s the matter with you Jenkins took the question literally I believe it may be called a sort of decline sir I don t know any other name for it Shan t you get well Oh no sir I don t look for that now The fear thumped at Bywater s heart worse than before A past vision of locking up old Ketch in the cloisters through which pastime Jenkins had come to a certain fall was uncomfortably present to Bywater just then He had been the ringleader What brought it on asked he Well sir I suppose it was to come meekly replied Jenkins I have had a bad cough spring and autumn for a long while now Master Bywater My brother went off just the same sir and so did my mother Bywater pushed his honest red face forward but it did not look quite so impudent as usual Jenkins said he plunging headlong into the fear DID THAT FALL DO IT Fall sir What fall That fall down from the organ loft Because that was my fault I had the most to do with locking up the cloisters that night Oh bless you sir no Never think that Master Bywater lowering his voice till it was as grave as Bywater s that fall did me good good sir instead of harm How do you make out that asked Bywater drawing his breath a little easier Because sir in the few days quiet that I had in bed my thoughts seemed in an unaccountable manner to be drawn to thinking of heaven I can t rightly describe sir how or why it could have been I remember his lordship the bishop talked to me a little bit in his pleasant affable way about the necessity of always being prepared and my wife s Bible lay on the drawers by my bed s head and I used to pick up that But I don t think it was either of those causes much I believe sir that it was God Himself working in my heart I believe He sent the fall in His mercy After I got up I seemed to know that I should soon go to Him and I hope it is not wrong to say it I seemed to wish to go Bywater felt somewhat puzzled I am not speaking about your heart and religion and all that Jenkins I want to know if the fall helped to bring on this illness No sir it had nothing to do with it The fall hurt my head a little nothing more and I got well from it directly This illness which has been taking me off must have been born with me Hoo Bywater s shout as he tossed up his trencher was broken in upon by missus Jenkins She had been beating up an egg with sugar and wine and now brought it in in a tumbler My dear said Jenkins I don t feel to want it Not want it said missus Jenkins resolutely And in two seconds she had taken hold of him and it was down his throat I can t stop parleying here all day with my shop full of customers Bywater laughed and she retreated If I could eat gold sir she d get it for me said Jenkins but my appetite fails She s a good wife Master Bywater Stunning acquiesced Bywater I wouldn t mind a wife myself if she d feed me up with eggs and wine But for her care sir I should not have lasted so long She has had great experience with the sick Bywater did not answer Rising to go his eyes had fixed themselves upon some object on the mantelpiece as pertinaciously as they had previously been fixed upon Jenkins s face I say Jenkins where did you get this he exclaimed That sir Oh I remember My old father brought it in yesterday He had cut his hand with it Where now did he say he found it In the college burial ground I think Master Bywater It was part of a small broken phial of a peculiar shape which had once apparently contained ink an elegant shape it may be said not unlike a vase Bywater began turning it about in his fingers he was literally feasting his eyes upon it Do you want to keep it Jenkins Not at all sir I wonder my wife did not throw it away before this I ll take it then said Bywater slipping it into his pocket And now I m off Hope you ll get better Jenkins Thank you sir Let me put the broken bottle in paper Master Bywater You will cut your fingers if you carry it loose in your pocket Oh that be bothered answered Bywater Who cares for cut fingers He pushed himself through missus Jenkins s customers with as little ceremony as Roland Yorke might have used and went flying towards the cathedral The bell ceased as he entered The organ pealed forth and the dean and chapter preceded by some of the bedesmen were entering from the opposite door Bywater ensconced himself behind a pillar until they should have traversed the body crossed the nave and were safe in the choir Then he came out and made his way to old Jenkins the bedesman The old man in his black gown stood near the bell ropes for he had been one of the ringers that day Bywater noticed that his left hand was partially tied up in a handkerchief Holloa old Jenkins said he sotte voce what have you done with your hand I gave it a nasty cut yesterday sir just in the ball of the thumb I wrapped my handkerchief round it just now for fear of opening it again while I was ringing the bell See said he taking off the handkerchief and showing the cut to Bywater What an old muff you must be to cut yourself like that But I didn t do it on purpose returned the old man We was ordered into the burial ground to put it a bit to rights and I fell down with my hand on a broken phial I ain t as active as I was I say though sir do you know that service has begun Let it begin returned careless Bywater This was the bottle you fell over was it not I found it on Joe s mantelpiece just now Ay that was it It must have laid there some time A good three months I know Bywater nodded his head He returned the bottle to his pocket and went to the vestry for his surplice Then he slid into college under the severe eyes of the Reverend mister Pye which were bent upon him from the chanting desk and ascended his stall just in time to take his part in the Venite exultemus Domino CHAPTER LIII THE RETURN HOME It almost seemed to mister Channing s grateful heart as if the weather had prolonged its genial warmth on purpose for him A more charming autumn had never been known at Borcette and up to the very hour of mister Channing s departure there were no signs of winter Taking it as a whole it had been the same at Helstonleigh Two or three occasional wet days two or three cold and windy ones but they soon passed over and people remarked to each other how this fine weather would shorten the winter Never did November turn out a more lovely day than the one that was to witness mister Channing s return The sun shone brightly the blue sky was without a cloud All Nature seemed to have put on a smiling face to give him welcome And yet to what was he returning For once in his life Hamish Channing shrank from meeting his father and mother How should he break the news to them They were arriving full of joy of thankfulness at the restoration to health of mister Channing how could Hamish mar it with the news regarding Charles Told it must be and he must be the one to do it In good truth Hamish was staggered at the task His own hopeful belief that Charley would some day turn up was beginning to die out for every hour that dragged by without bringing him certainly gave less and less chance of it And even if Hamish had retained hope himself it was not likely he could impart it to mister or missus Channing I shall get leave from school this afternoon Tom suddenly exclaimed that morning at breakfast For what purpose inquired Hamish To go up to the station and meet them No Tom You must not go to the station Who says so sharply cried Tom I do replied Hamish I dare say that s good returned Tom speaking in his hasty spirit You know you are going yourself Hamish and yet you would like to deprive me of the same pleasure Why I wouldn t miss being there for anything Don t say Hamish that you are never selfish Hamish turned upon him with a smile but his tone changed to sadness I wish with all my heart Tom that you or some one else could go and meet them instead of myself and undertake what I shall have to do I can tell you I never had a task imposed upon me that I found so uncongenial as the one I must go through this day Tom s voice dropped a little of its fierce shade But Hamish there s no reason why I should not meet them at the station That will not make it the better or the worse for you I will tell you why I think you should not replied Hamish why it will be better that you should not It is most desirable that they should be home here in this house before the tidings are broken to them I should not like them to hear of it in the streets or at the station especially my mother Of course not assented Tom And were you at the station quietly went on Hamish to him the first question would be Where s Charley If Tom Channing can get leave of absence from school Charley can I could say Well said Hamish for Tom had stopped I don t know what I could say acknowledged Tom Nor I My boy I have thought it over and the conclusion I come to if you appear at the station is this either that the tidings must be told to them then and there or else an evasion bordering upon an untruth If they do not see you there they will not inquire particularly after Charles they will suppose you are both in school I declare I never set my mind upon a thing but something starts in to frustrate it cried Tom in vexation But he relinquished his intention from that moment Chattering Annabel threw up her head As soon as papa and mamma come home we shall put on mourning shall we not Constance was talking about it with Lady Augusta Do not talk of mourning child returned Hamish I can t give him up if you do Afternoon came and Hamish proceeded alone to the station Tom listening to the inward voice of reason was in school and Arthur was occupied in the cathedral the expected hour of their arrival was towards the close of afternoon service Hamish had boasted that he should walk his father through Helstonleigh for the benefit of beholders if happily he came home capable of walking but like poor Tom and his plan that had to be relinquished In the first half dozen paces they would meet half a dozen gossipers and the first remark from each after congratulations would be What a sad thing this is about your little Charles Hamish lived in doubt whether it might not by some untoward luck come out at the station in spite of his precaution in keeping away Tom But so far all went well The train came in to its time and Hamish his face lighted with excitement saw his father once more in possession of his strength descending without assistance from the carriage walking alone on the platform Not in the full strength and power of old that might never be again He stooped slightly and moved slowly as if his limbs were yet stiff limping a little But that he was now in a sound state of health was evident his face betrayed it Hamish did not know whose hands to clasp first his or his mother s Can you believe that it is myself Hamish asked mister Channing when the first few words of thankful greeting had passed I should hide my head for ever as a false prophet if it could be any one else was the reply of Hamish You know I always said you would so return I am only in doubt whether it is my mother What is the matter with me Hamish asked missus Channing Because you would make about two of the thin pale careworn missus Channing who went away cried he turning his mother round to look at her deep love shining out from his gay blue eyes I hope you have not taken to rouge your cheeks ma am but I am bound to confess they look uncommonly like it missus Channing laughed merrily It has done me untold good Hamish as well as papa it seems to have set me up for years to come Seeing him grow better day by day would have effected it without any other change mister Channing had actually gone himself to see after the luggage How strange it seemed Hamish caught him up If you can give yourself trouble now sir there s no reason that you should do so while you have your great lazy son at your elbow Hamish boy I am proud of doing it It was soon collected Hamish hastily if not carelessly told a porter to look to it took mister Channing s arm and marched him to the fly which missus Channing had already found Hamish was in lively dread of some officious friend or other coming up who might drop a hint of the state of affairs Shall I help you in father I can help myself now Hamish I remember you promised me I should have no fly on my return You have thought better of it Yes sir wishing to get you home before bed time which might not be the case if you were to show yourself in the town and stop at all the interruptions mister Channing stepped into the fly Hamish followed first giving the driver a nod The luggage The luggage exclaimed missus Channing as they moved off The porter will bring it mother He would have been a month putting it on to the fly How could they suppose anything was the matter Not a suspicion of it ever crossed them Never had Hamish appeared more light hearted In fact in his self consciousness Hamish a little overdid it Let him get them home before the worst came We find you all well I conclude said missus Channing None of them came up with you Arthur is in college I suppose and Tom and Charles are in school It was Arthur s hour for college remarked Hamish ignoring the rest of the sentence But he ought to be out now Arthur is at Galloway s again he added He did not write you word I believe as you were so shortly expected home mister Channing turned a glance on his son quick as lightning Cleared Hamish In my opinion yes In the opinion of others I fear not much more than he was before And himself asked mister Channing What does he say now He does not speak of it to me Hamish put his head out at the window nodding to some one who was passing A question of mister Channing s called it in again Why has he gone back to Galloway s Hamish laughed Roland Yorke took an impromptu departure one fine morning for Port Natal leaving the office and mister Galloway to do the best they could with each other Arthur buried his grievances and offered himself to mister Galloway in the emergency I am not quite sure that I should have been so forgiving Hamish He has nothing to forgive mister Galloway It is on the other side I am uncharitable I suppose remarked Hamish I cannot like mister Galloway s treatment of Arthur But what is it you say about Roland Yorke and Port Natal interposed missus Channing I do not understand Roland is really gone mother He has been in London these ten days and it is expected that every post will bring news that he has sailed Roland has picked up a notion somewhere that Port Natal is an enchanted land converting poor men into rich ones and he is going to try what it will do for him Lord Carrick fitting him out Poor Jenkins is sinking fast Changes changes remarked mister Channing Go away only for two or three months and you must find them on return Some gone some dying some Some restored who were looked upon as incurable interrupted Hamish My dear father I will not have you dwell on dark things the very moment of your arrival the time for that will come soon enough Judy nearly betrayed all and Constance s aspect might have betrayed it had the travellers been suspicious She Constance came forward in the hall white and trembling When missus Channing shook hands with Judy she put an unfortunate question Have you taken good care of your boy Judy knew it could only allude to Charles and for answer there went up a sound between a cry and a sob that might have been heard in the far off college schoolroom Hamish took Judy by the shoulders bidding her go out and see whether any rattletraps were left in the fly and so turned it off They were all together in the sitting room mister and missus Channing Hamish Constance Arthur and Annabel united happy as friends are and must be when meeting after a separation talking of this and of that giving notes of what had occurred on either side Hamish showed himself as busy as the rest but Hamish felt all the while upon a bed of thorns for the hands of the timepiece were veering on for five and he must get the communication over before Tom came in At length missus Channing went up to her room accompanied by Constance Annabel followed And now came Hamish s opportunity Arthur had gone back to mister Galloway s and he was alone with his father He plunged into it at once indeed there was no time for delay Father he exclaimed with deep feeling his careless manner changing as by magic I have very grievous news to impart to you I would not enter upon it before my mother though she must be told of it also and at once mister Channing was surprised more surprised than alarmed He never remembered to have seen Hamish betray so much emotion A thought crossed his mind that Arthur s guilt might have been brought clearly to light Not that said Hamish It concerns Father I do not like to enter upon it I shrink from my task It is very bad news indeed You my children are all well cried mister Channing hastily speaking the words as a fact not as a question What other very bad news can be in store for me You have not seen us all was Hamish s answer And mister Channing alarmed now looked inquiringly at him It concerns Charles An an accident has happened to him mister Channing sat down and shaded his eyes He was a moment or two before he spoke One word Hamish is he dead Hamish stood before his father and laid his hand affectionately upon his shoulder Father I wish I could have prepared you better for it he exclaimed with emotion We do not know whether he is dead or alive Then he explained explained more in summary than in detail touching lightly upon the worst features of the case enlarging upon his own hopeful view of it Bad enough it was at the best and mister Channing found it so He could feel no hope In the revulsion of grief he turned almost with resentment upon Hamish My son I did not expect this treatment from you I have taken enough blame to myself I know he was left in my charge sadly replied Hamish but indeed I do not see how I could have helped it Although I was in the room when he ran out of it I was buried in my own thoughts and never observed his going I had no suspicion anything was astir that night with the college boys Father I would have saved his life with my own I am not blaming you for the fact Hamish blame is not due to you Had I been at home myself I might no more have stopped his going out than you did But you ought to have informed me of this instantly A whole month and I to be left in ignorance We did it for the best Father I assure you that not a stone has been left unturned to find him alive or or dead You could not have done more had you hastened home and it has been so much suspense and grief spared to you mister Channing relapsed into silence Hamish glanced uneasily to that ever advancing clock Presently he spoke My mother must be told before Tom comes home It will be better that you take the task upon yourself father Shall I send her in mister Channing looked at Hamish as if he scarcely understood the meaning of the words From Hamish he looked to the clock Ay go and send her Hamish went to his mother s room and returned with her But he did not enter He merely opened the door and shut her in Constance with a face more frightened than ever came and stood in the hall Annabel stood there also Judy wringing her hands and sending off short ejaculations in an undertone came to join them and Sarah stood peeping out from the kitchen door They remained gazing at the parlour door dreading the effect of the communication that was going on inside If it had been that great big Tom it wouldn t matter so much wailed Judith in a tone of resentment The missis would know that he d be safe to turn up some time or other a strong fellow like him A sharp cry within the room The door was flung open and missus Channing came forth her face pale her hands lifted It cannot be true It cannot be Hamish Judith Where is he Hamish folded her hands in his and gently drew her in again They all followed No reason why they should not now that the communication was made Almost at the same moment mister Huntley arrived Of course the first thought that had occurred to the minds of mister and missus Channing was that had they been at home to direct affairs in the search Charley would have been found It is the thought that would occur to us all we never give others credit for doing as much as we should have done This might have been tried and the other might have been tried It makes little difference when told that they have been tried for then we fall back upon some other suggestion missus Channing reproached Hamish with keeping it from them My dear lady you must blame me not him interposed mister Huntley Left to himself Hamish would have started Arthur off to you post haste It was I who suggested the desirability of keeping you in ignorance it was I who brought Hamish to see it and I know that when the brunt of your grief shall have passed you will acknowledge that it was the best the wisest and the kindest course But there are so many things that we could have suggested that perhaps none but a father or mother would think of urged missus Channing lifting her yearning face They wished they could see her weep You could have suggested nothing that has not been done returned mister Huntley Believe me dear missus Channing We have had many good counsellors Butterby has conducted the search mister Channing turned to them He was standing at the far window I should like to see Butterby He will be here in an hour s time said Hamish I knew you would wish to see him and I requested him to come The worst feature of the whole put in Judith with as much acrimony as ever was displayed by mister Ketch is that them boys should not have got their deserts They have not as much as had a birching and I say that the college masters ought to be hooted I d ghost em The punishment lies in abeyance for the present explained Hamish A different punishment from any the head master could inflict will be required should should Hamish stopped He did not like to say in the presence of his mother should the body be found Some of them are suffering pretty well as it is he continued after a brief pause Master Bill Simms lay in bed for a week with fright and they were obliged to have mister Hurst to him Report goes that Hurst soundly flogged his son by way of commencing his share A pushing open of the outer door a bang and hasty footsteps in the hall Tom had arrived Tom with his sparkling eyes his glowing face They sparkled for his father only in that first moment his father who turned and walked to meet him Oh papa What baths those must be cried honest Tom If ever I get rich I ll go over there and make them a present of a thousand pounds To think that nothing else should have cured you I think something else must have had a hand in curing me Tom Tom looked up inquiringly Ah papa You mean God Yes my boy God has cured me The baths were only instruments in His hands CHAPTER LIV THE SHIP S DROWNED Rejecting all offers of refreshment the meal which Constance had planned and Judith prepared both with so much loving care mister Channing resolved to seek out Butterby at once In his state of suspense he could neither wait nor eat nor remain still it would be a satisfaction only to see Butterby and hear his opinion mister Huntley accompanied him scarcely less proud than Hamish would have been to walk once more arm in arm with mister Channing But as there is not the least necessity for our going to the police station for mister Butterby could tell us no more than we already know we will pay a short visit to mister Stephen Bywater That gentleman stood in the cloisters into which he had seduced old Jenkins the bedesman having waited for the twilight hour that he might make sure no one else would be there Ever since the last day you saw old Jenkins in the cathedral he had been laid up in his house with a touch of what he called his rheumatiz Decrepit old fellows were all the bedesmen monopolizing enough rheumatiz between them for half the city If one was not laid up another would be especially in winter However old Jenkins had come out again to day to the gratification of mister Bywater who had been wanting him The cloisters were all but dark and mister Ketch must undoubtedly be most agreeably engaged or he would have shut up before Now then old Jenkins Bywater was saying You show me the exact spot and I ll give you sixpence for smoke Old Jenkins hobbled to one of the mullioned windows near to the college entrance and looked over into the dim graveyard Twas about four or five yards off here said he But I want to know the precise spot returned Bywater Get over and show me The words made old Jenkins laugh Law sir me get over there You might as well ask me to get over the college How am I to do it I ll hoist you up said Bywater No no answered the man My old bones be past hoisting now I should never get back alive once I were propelled over into that graveyard Bywater felt considerably discomfited What a weak rat you must be old Jenkins Why it s nothing I know it ain t for you college gents Twouldn t have been much for me when I was your age Skin and clothes weren t of much account to me then Oh it s that is it returned Bywater contemptuously Look here old Jenkins if your things come to grief I ll get my uncle to look you out some of his old ones I ll give you sixpence for baccy I say The old bedesman shook his head If you give me a waggin load of baccy I couldn t get over there You might just as good put a babby in arms on the ground and tell it to walk Here get out of the way for an old muff was Bywater s rejoinder and in a second he had mounted the window frame and dropped into the burial ground Now then old Jenkins I ll go about and you call out when I come to the right spot By these means Bywater arrived at a solution of the question where the broken phial was found old Jenkins pointing out the spot to the best of his ability Bywater then vaulted back again and alighted safe and sound in the cloisters Old Jenkins asked for his sixpence Why you did not earn it said Bywater You wouldn t get over A sixpence is always useful to me said the old man and some of you gents has em in plenty I ain t paid much and Joe he don t give me much Tain t him he d give away his head and always would it s her Precious close she is with the money though she earns a sight of it I know at that shop of her n and keeps Joe like a king Wine and all the rest of it she s got for him since he was ill There s a knife and fork for ye whenever ye like to come she says to me in her tart way But deuce a bit of money will she give If it weren t for one and another friend giving me an odd sixpence now and then Master Bywater I should never hardly get any baccy There don t bother said Bywater dropping the coin into his hand Why bless my heart who s this a prowling in the cloisters at this hour exclaimed a well known cracked voice advancing upon them with shuffling footsteps What do you do here pray You would like to know wouldn t you mister Calcraft said Bywater Studying architecture There Old Ketch gave a yell of impotent rage and Bywater decamped as fast as his legs would carry him through the west door Arrived at his home or rather his uncle s where he lived for Bywater s paternal home was in a far away place over the sea he went straight up to his own room where he struck a match and lighted a candle Then he unlocked a sort of bureau and took from it the phial found by old Jenkins and a smaller piece which exactly fitted into the part broken He had fitted them in ten times before but it appeared to afford him satisfaction and he now sat down and fitted them again Yes soliloquized he as he nursed one of his legs his favourite attitude it s as sure as eggs And I d have had it out before if that helpless old muff of a Jenkins had been forthcoming I knew it was safe to be somewhere near the college gates but it was as Well to ask He turned the phial over and over between his eye and the candle and resumed And now I ll give mister Ger a last chance I told him the other day that if he d only speak up like a man to me and say it was an accident I d drop it for good But he won t And find it out I will I have said I would from the first just for my own satisfaction and if I break my word may they tar and feather me Ger will only have himself to thank if he won t satisfy me in private I ll bring it against him in public I suspected mister Ger before not but that I suspected another but since Charley Channing Oh bother though I don t want to get thinking of him Bywater locked up his treasures and descended to his tea That over he had enough lessons to occupy him for a few hours and keep him out of mischief Meanwhile mister Channing s interview with the renowned mister Butterby had brought forth nothing and he was walking back home with mister Huntley mister Huntley strove to lead his friend s thoughts into a different channel it seemed quite a mockery to endeavour to whisper hope for Charley You will resume your own place in Guild Street at once he observed To morrow please God They walked a few steps further in silence and then mister Channing entered upon the very subject which mister Huntley was hoping he would not enter upon I remember you spoke at Borcette of having something in view for Hamish should I be able to attend to business again What is it I did said mister Huntley and I am sorry that I did I spoke prematurely I suppose it is gone Well no it is not gone replied mister Huntley who was above equivocation I do not think Hamish would suit the place mister Channing felt a little surprised There were few places that Hamish might not suit if he chose to exercise his talents You thought he would suit then he remarked But circumstances have since induced me to alter my opinion said mister Huntley My friend he more warmly added to mister Channing you will oblige me by allowing the subject to drop I candidly confess to you that I am not so pleased with Hamish as I once was and I would rather not interfere in placing him elsewhere How has he offended you What has he done Nay that is all I will say I could not help giving you a hint to account for what you might have thought caprice Hamish has not pleased me and I cannot take him by the hand There let it rest mister Channing was content to let it rest In his inmost heart he entertained no doubt that the cause of offence was in some way connected with mister Huntley s daughter Hamish was poor Ellen would be rich therefore it was only natural that mister Huntley should consider him an ineligible parti for her mister Channing did not quite see what that had to do with the present question but he could not in delicacy urge it further They found quite a levee when they entered the Reverend mister Pye mister Galloway who had called in with Arthur upon leaving the office for the night and William Yorke All were anxious to welcome and congratulate mister Channing and all were willing to tender a word of sympathy respecting Charles Possibly mister Yorke had also another motive if so we shall come to it in due time mister Pye stayed only a few minutes He did not say a word about the seniorship neither did mister Channing to him What indeed could either of them say The subject was unpleasant on both sides therefore it was best avoided Tom however thought differently Papa he exclaimed plunging into it the moment mister Pye s back was turned you might have taken the opportunity to tell him that I shall leave the school It is not often he comes here But you are not going to leave the school said mister Channing Yes I am replied Tom speaking with unmistakable firmness Hamish made me stay on until you came home and I don t know how I have done it It is of no use papa I cannot put up with the treatment the insults I receive It was bad enough to lose the seniorship but that is as nothing to the other And to what end should I stop when my chance of the exhibition is gone It is not gone Tom mister Huntley as word was written to me at Borcette has declined it for his son It is not the less gone for me papa Let me merit it as I will I shall not be allowed to receive it any more than I did the seniorship I am out of favour both with master and boys and you know what that means in a public school If you witnessed the way I am served by the boys you would be the first to say I must leave What do they do asked mister Channing They do enough to provoke my life out of me said Tom falling into a little of his favourite heat Were it myself only that they attacked I might perhaps stop and brave it out but it is not so They go on against Arthur in a way that would make a saint mad Pooh pooh interposed mister Galloway who was standing by If I am content to accept Arthur s innocence surely the college school may be mister Channing turned to the proctor Do you now believe him innocent I say I am content to accept his innocence was the reply of mister Galloway and Arthur who was within hearing could only do as he had had to do so many times before school his spirit to patience Content to accept and open exculpation were essentially different things Let me speak with you a minute Galloway said mister Channing taking the proctor s arm and leading him across the hall to the drawing room Tom he added looking back you shall tell me of these grievances another time The drawing room door closed upon them and mister Channing spoke with eagerness Is it possible that you still suspect Arthur to have been guilty Channing I am fairly puzzled returned mister Galloway His own manner relating to it has not changed and that manner is not compatible with innocence You made the same remark yourself at the time But you have had the money returned to you I understand I know I have Well that surely is a proof that the thief could not have been Arthur Pardon me replied mister Galloway It may be a proof as much against him as for him it may have come from himself Nay where was Arthur to find twenty pounds to send to you There are two ways in which he might find it But mister Galloway broke off abruptly I do not like to urge these things on you they can only inflict pain Not greater pain than I have already undergone was mister Channing s answer Tell me I pray you all your thoughts all you suspect just as though you were speaking to any indifferent friend It is right that I should know it Yes come in Huntley mister Channing added for mister Huntley at that moment opened the door unconscious that any private conference was going forward I have no secrets from you Come in We are talking of Arthur I was observing that there are two means by which the money could have come from Arthur resumed mister Galloway when mister Huntley had entered The one by his never having used the note originally taken the other by getting a friend to return it for him Now my opinion is that he did not pursue the first plan I believe that if he took the note he used it I questioned him on the evening of its arrival and at the first moment his manner almost convinced me that he was innocent He appeared to be genuinely surprised at the return of the money and ingenuously confessed that he had not possessed any to send But his manner veered again suddenly strangely veered round to all its old unsatisfactory suspiciousness and when I hinted that I should recall Butterby to my counsels he became agitated as he had done formerly My firm belief mister Galloway added laying his hand impressively upon mister Channing my firm belief is that Arthur did get the money sent back to me through a friend But what friend would be likely to do such a thing for him debated mister Channing not in the least falling in with the argument I know of none I think and mister Galloway dropped his voice that it came from Hamish From Hamish was mister Channing s echo in a strong accent of dissent That is nonsense Hamish would never screen guilt Hamish has not twenty pounds to spare He might spare it in the cause of a brother and for a brother s sake he might even screen guilt pursued mister Galloway Honourable and open as Hamish is I must still express my belief that the twenty pounds came from him Honourable and open as Hamish is the words grated on mister Huntley and a cynical expression rose to his face mister Channing observed it What do you think of it he involuntarily asked I have never had any other opinion but that the money did come from Hamish drily remarked mister Huntley And mister Channing in his utter astonishment could not answer Hamish happened to call in at my office the afternoon that the money was received resumed mister Galloway It was after I had spoken to Arthur I had been thinking it over and came to the conclusion that if it had come from Arthur Hamish must have done it for him In the impulse of the moment I put the question to him Had he done it to screen Arthur And Hamish s answer was a mocking one A mocking one repeated mister Channing A mocking careless answer one that vexed me I know at the time The next day I told Arthur point blank that I believed the money came from Hamish I wish you could have seen his flush of confusion and deny it he did not Altogether my impression against Arthur was rather confirmed than the contrary by the receipt of the money though I am truly grieved to have to say it And you think the same mister Channing exclaimed to mister Huntley Never mind what I think was the answer Beyond the one opinion I expressed I will not be drawn into the discussion I did not intend to say so much it was a slip of the tongue mister Huntley was about to leave the room as he spoke perhaps lest he should make other slips but mister Channing interposed and drew him back Stay Huntley he said we cannot rest in this uncertainty Oblige me by remaining one instant while I call Hamish Hamish entered in obedience He appeared somewhat surprised to see them assembled in conclave looking so solemn but he supposed it related to Charles mister Channing undeceived him Hamish we are speaking of Arthur Both these gentlemen have expressed a belief I beg your pardon interrupted mister Huntley I said that I should be obliged if you would leave me out of the discussion What does it signify returned mister Channing his tone one of haste Hamish mister Galloway has expressed to me a belief that you have so far taken part with Arthur in that unhappy affair as to send back the money to him Oh indeed said Hamish and his manner was precisely what mister Galloway had described it to have been at the time light mocking careless mister Galloway did me the honour to express something of the same belief I remember Did you send it Hamish asked his father a severe look crossing his face No sir I did not emphatically replied Hamish And mister Huntley turned and bent his keen eye upon him In his heart of hearts he believed it to be a deliberate falsehood I did not send the money and I do not know who did send it went on Hamish But as we are upon the subject perhaps I may be allowed to express my opinion that if there were as much labour taken to establish Arthur s innocence as it seems to me there is to prove him guilty he might have been cleared long ago That the remark was aimed at mister Galloway there was no doubt mister Huntley answered it and had they been suspicious they might have detected a covert meaning in his tone You at any rate must hold firm faith in his innocence Firm and entire faith distinctly assented Hamish Father he added impulsively turning to mister Channing put all notion of Arthur s guilt from you at once and for ever I would answer for him with my life Then he must be screening some one cried mister Galloway It is one thing or the other Hamish it strikes me you know Who is it A red flush mounted to Hamish s brow but he lapsed into his former mocking tone Nay said he I can tell nothing about that He left the room as he spoke and the conference broke up It appeared that no satisfactory solution could be come to if they kept it on till midnight mister Galloway took leave and hastened home to dinner I must be going also remarked mister Huntley Nevertheless he returned with mister Channing to the other room You told me at Borcette that you were fully persuaded of Arthur s innocence you were ready to ridicule me for casting a doubt upon it mister Channing remarked to him in a low tone as they crossed the hall I have never been otherwise than persuaded of it said mister Huntley He is innocent as you or as I And yet you join mister Galloway in assuming that he and Hamish sent back the money The one assertion is incompatible with the other mister Huntley laid his hand upon mister Channing s shoulder My dear friend all that you and I can do is to let the matter rest We should only plunge into shoals and quicksands and lose our way in them were we to pursue it They had halted at the parlour door to speak Judith came bustling up at that moment from the kitchen a letter in her hand looking as if in her hurry she might have knocked them over had they not made way for her to enter Bad luck to my memory then It s getting not worth a button Here Master Arthur The postman gave it me at the door just as I had caught sight of the fly turning the corner with the master and missis I slipped it into my pocket and never thought of it till this minute So it has come at last has it cried Arthur recognising Roland Yorke s handwriting Is he really off inquired Tom Yes he is really off replied Arthur opening the letter and beginning to glance over the contents He has sailed in the ship Africa Don t talk to me Tom What a long letter They left him to read it in peace Talking together mister and missus Channing mister Huntley William Yorke Hamish Constance all were in a group round the fire paying no attention to him No attention until an exclamation caused them to turn An exclamation half of distress half of fear Arthur had risen from his chair and stood the picture of excitement his face and lips blanching What is the matter they exclaimed Roland the ship Roland and there Arthur stopped apparently unable to say more Oh it s drowned it s drowned cried quick Annabel The ship s drowned and Roland with it And Arthur sank back in his chair again and covered his face with his hands CHAPTER LV NEWS FROM ROLAND You will like to look over Arthur s shoulder as he reads the letter just received from Roland Yorke DEAR OLD CHUM By the time you get this letter I shall be ploughing the waves of the briny deep in the ship Africa You will get the letter on Wednesday night That is you ought to get it for I have desired Carrick to post it accordingly and I m sure he ll do it if he does not forget And old Galloway will get a letter at the same time and Lady Augusta will get one I shall have been off more than twenty four hours for we leave Gravesend on Tuesday at noon Carrick has behaved like a trump He has bought me all the things I asked him and paid my passage money and given me fifty pounds in my pocket to land with so I am safe to get on The only thing he stood out about was the frying pans He couldn t see of what use they d be he said So we made a compromise and I am taking out only four and twenty instead of the forty dozen that I had thought of I could not find Bagshaw s list and the frying pans are about all I am taking in the shape of utensils except a large tool chest which they palmed off upon Carrick for it was as dear as fire s hot I dare say you have been vowing vengeance upon me for not coming round to see you before I started but I stopped away on purpose for I might have let out something that I did not care to let out then and that s what I am writing for Old fellow I have been fit to kill myself All that bother that they laid upon you about the bank note ought to have fallen upon me for it was I who took it There the confession s made And now explode at me for ten minutes with all your energy and wrath before you read on It will be a relief to your feelings and to mine Perhaps if you d go out of the way to swear a bit it mightn t be amiss It was at this juncture that Arthur had started up so wildly causing Annabel to exclaim that the ship was drowned In his access of bewilderment the first shadowy thought that overpowered him was a dreadful feeling of grief for Roland s sake He had liked Roland with all his faults he had liked him much and it was as if some cherished statue had fallen and been dashed to pieces Wild joyful beatings of relief that Hamish was innocent were mingling with it thumping against his heart soon to exclude all else and fill it to bursting But as yet this was indistinct and the first clear idea that came to him was Was Roland telling truth or was he only playing a joke upon him Arthur read on I was awfully hard up for money I was worse than Hamish and he was pretty hard up then though he seems to have staved off the fellows since he best knows how I told him one day I should like to borrow the receipt and he laughed and said he d give it to me with all the pleasure in life if it were transferable Ask him if he remembers saying it When Galloway was sending the money that day to the cousin Galloway I thought what a shame it was as I watched him slip the bank note into the letter That cousin Galloway was always having money sent him and I wished Galloway would give it me instead Then came that row with Mad Nance and as you and Galloway turned to see what was up I just pulled open the envelope that instant wet and stuck down took out the money pressed the gum down again and came and stood at your back at the window leaning out It did not take me half a minute and the money was in my pocket and the letter was empty But now look here I never meant to steal the note I am not a Newgate thief yet I was in an uncommon fix just then over a certain affair and if I could not stop the fellow s mouth there d have been the dickens to pay So I took the money for that stop gap never intending to do otherwise than replace it in Galloway s desk as soon as I could get it I knew I should be having some from Lord Carrick It was all Lady Augusta s fault She had turned crusty and would not help me I stopped out all that afternoon with Knivett if you remember and that placed me beyond suspicion when the stir came though it was not for that reason I stayed for I never had a thought that the row would fall upon us in the office I supposed the loss would be set down to the letter carriers as of course it ought to have been I stayed out the bank note burning a hole all the while in my waistcoat pocket and sundry qualms coming over me whether I should not put it back again I began to wonder how I could get rid of it safely not knowing but that Galloway might have the number and I think I should have put it back what with that doubt and my twitchings of conscience but for a thing that happened After I parted with Knivett I ran home for something I wanted and Lady Augusta heard me and called me into her bedroom Roland said she I want you to get me a twenty pound note from the bank I have occasion to send one to Ireland Now Arthur I ask you was ever such encouragement given to a fellow in wrong doing Of course my note that is Galloway s note went to Ireland and a joyful riddance it seemed as thoroughly gone as if I had despatched it to the North Pole Lady Augusta handed me twenty sovereigns and I made believe to go to the bank and exchange them for a note She put it into a letter and I took it to the post office at once No wonder you grumbled at my being away so long Next came the row And when I found that suspicion fell upon you I was nearly mad If I had not parted with the money I should have gone straight to Galloway and said Here it is I took it Not a soul stood up for you as they ought Even mister Channing fell into the suspicion and Hamish seemed indifferent and cool as a cucumber I have never liked Galloway since and I long to this day to give Butterby a ducking How I kept my tongue from blurting out the truth I don t know but a gentleman born does not like to own himself a thief It was the publicity given to it that kept me silent and I hope old Galloway and Butterby will have horrid dreams for a week to come now they know the truth I was boiling over always I don t know how I managed to live through it and that soft calf of a Jenkins was always defending Galloway when I flew out about him Nobody could do more than I did to throw the blame upon the post office and it was the most likely thing in the world for the post office to have done but the more I talked the more old Galloway brought up that rubbish about his seals I hope he ll have horrid dreams for a month to come I d have prosecuted the post office if I had had the cash to do it with and that might have turned him Well old chap it went on and on you lying under the cloud and I mad with every one I could do nothing to clear you unless I had confessed except sending back the money to Galloway s with a letter to say you did not do it It was upon my mind night and day I was always planning how to accomplish it but for some time I could not find the money When Carrick came to Helstonleigh he was short himself and I had to wait I told him I was in an awful mess for the want of twenty pounds And that was true in more senses than one for I did not know where to turn to for money for my own uses At last Carrick gave it me he had given me a trifle or two before of five pounds or so of no use and then I had to wait an opportunity of sending it to London to be posted Carrick s departure afforded that I wrote the note to Galloway with my left hand in print sort of letters put the money into it and Carrick promised to post it in London I told him it was a Valentine to old Galloway flattering him on his youthful curls and Carrick laughed till he was hoarse at the notion Deuce take his memory he had been pretty nearly a week in London before he thought of the letter and then putting his hand into his pocket he found it I had given it up by that time and thought no one in the world ever had such luck as I At last it came and all I can say is I wish the post office had taken that before it ever did come Of all the crying shames that was the worst The old carp got the money and yet would not clear you I shall never forgive Galloway for that and when I come back from Port Natal rolling in wealth I ll not look at him when I pass him in the street which will cork him uncommonly and I don t care if you tell him so Had I wavered about Port Natal before that would have decided me Clear you I would and I saw there was no way to do it but by telling the truth which I did not care to do while I was in Helstonleigh And now I am off and you know the truth and Galloway knows it for he ll have his letter when you have yours and I hope it will be a pill for him and all Helstonleigh will know it and you are cleared dear old Arthur The first person that I shall lavish a little of my wealth upon when I return will be poor Jenkins if he should be still in the land of the living We all know that he has as much in him as a gander and lets that adorable missus J I wish you could have seen her turban the morning I took leave be mistress and master but he has done me many a good turn and what s more he stood up for you When Galloway Butterby and company were on at it discussing proofs against you Jenkins s humble voice would be heard I am sure gentlemen mister Arthur never did it Many a time I could have hugged him and he shall have some of my good luck when I reach home You shall have it too Arthur I shall never make a friend to care for half as much as I care for you and I wish you would have been persuaded to come out with me and make your fortune but as you would not you shall share mine Mind I should have cleared you just the same if you had come And that s all I have to tell And now you see why I did not care to say Good bye for I don t think I could have said it without telling all Remember me to the folks at your house and I hope mister Channing will come home stunning I shall look to you for all the news mind If a great wind blows the cathedral down or a fire burns the town up it s you who must write it no one else will Direct to me Post office Port Natal until I send you an address which I shall do the first thing Have you any news of Charley I had almost forgotten that bright kinsman of mine the chaplain of Hazledon Pray present my affectionate compliments to him and say he has not the least idea how very much I revere him I should like to see his face when he finds it was I who was the delinquent Constance can turn the tables on him now But if she ever forgives him she ll deserve to be as henpecked as Jenkins is and tell her I say so I meant to have told you about a spree I have had since I came to London but there s no room so I ll conclude sentimentally as a lady does Yours for ever and ever ROLAND YORKE You must not think that Arthur Channing read this letter deliberately as you have been able to read it He had only skimmed it skimmed it with straining eye and burning brow taking in its general sense its various points but of its words none In his overpowering emotion his perplexed confusion he started up with wild words Oh father he is innocent Constance he is innocent Hamish Hamish forgive forgive me I have been wicked enough to believe you guilty all this time To say that they stared at him to say that they did not understand him would be weak words to express the surprise that fell upon them and seemed to strike them dumb Arthur kept on reiterating the words as if he could not sufficiently relieve his overburdened heart Hamish never did it Constance we might have known it Constance what could so have blinded our reason He has been innocent all this time mister Huntley was the first to find his tongue Innocent of what asked he What news have you received there pointing to the letter It is from Roland Yorke He says Arthur hesitated and lowered his voice that bank note lost by mister Galloway Well they uttered pressing round him It was Roland who took it Then arose a Babel of voices questions to Arthur references to the letter and explanations mister Channing amidst his deep thankfulness gathered Arthur to him with a fond gesture My boy there has been continual conflict waging in my heart he said appearances versus my better judgment But for your own doubtful manner I should have spurned the thought that you were guilty Why did you not speak out boldly Father how could I believing that it was Hamish Hamish dear Hamish say you forgive me Hamish was the only one who had retained calmness Remarkably cool was he He gazed upon them with the most imperturbable self possession rather inclined to be amused than otherwise Suspect me cried he raising his eyebrows We did indeed Bien oblige responded mister Hamish Perhaps you shared the honour of the doubt he mockingly added turning to mister Huntley I did replied that gentleman Ellen did not he added losing his seriousness in a half laugh Miss Ellen and I have been at daggers drawn upon the point Hamish actually blushed like a schoolgirl Ellen knows me better was all he said speaking very quietly I should have thought some of the rest of you had known me better also Hamish said mister Huntley I think we were all in for a host of blunders mister Channing had listened in surprise missus Channing in indignation Her brave good Hamish her best and dearest I cannot see how it was possible to suspect Hamish observed mister Channing But before any more could be said they were interrupted by mister Galloway an open letter in his hand Here s a pretty repast for a man he exclaimed I go home expecting to dine in peace and I find this pill upon my plate Pill was the very word Roland had used They understood naturally what the pill was Especially Arthur who had been told by Roland himself that he was writing to mister Galloway You see sir said Arthur with a bright smile that I was innocent I do see it replied mister Galloway laying his hand on Arthur s shoulder Why could you not speak openly to my face and tell me so Because I am ashamed sir now to confess why We were all at cross purposes together it seems He suspected that it was all in the family mister Galloway cried Hamish in his gay good humour It appears that he laid the charge of that little affair to me Nonsense said mister Galloway We both did exclaimed Constance coming forward with tears in her eyes Do you think that the mere fact of suspicion being cast upon him publicly though it was made could have rendered us as cowardly miserable as it did Hamish how shall we atone to you The question is how shall I atone to you my old friend for the wrong done your son exclaimed mister Galloway seizing mister Channing s hand Arthur you and I shall have accounts to make up together If reparation for unjust suspicion is to be the order of the day I think I ought to have some of it said laughing Hamish with a glance at mister Huntley A sudden thought seemed to strike mister Channing Huntley he impulsively cried was this the cause of displeasure that you hinted had been given you by Hamish That and nothing else was mister Huntley s answer I suppose I must take him into favour again make reparation as he says A saucy smile crossed the lips of Hamish It as good as said I know who will if you don t But mister Galloway was interrupting The most extraordinary thing of the whole is he observed with unwonted emphasis that we never suspected Roland Yorke knowing him as we did know him It will be a caution to me as long as I live never to go again by appearances Careless thoughtless impulsive conscienceless Roland Yorke Of course Who else would have been likely to help themselves to it I wonder what scales were before our eyes mister Channing turned to his son Tom who had been seated astride on the arm of a sofa in a glow of astonishment now succeeded by satisfaction Tom my boy There ll be no particular hurry for leaving the college school will there Tom slid off his perch and went straight up to Arthur Arthur I beg your pardon heartily for the harsh words and thoughts I may have given you I was just a fool or I should have known you could not be guilty Were you screening Roland Yorke No said Arthur I never suspected him for a moment As to any one s begging my pardon I have most cause to do that for suspecting Hamish You ll be all right now Tom But now in the midst of this demonstration from all sides I will leave you to judge what were the feelings of that reverend divine William Yorke You may remember that he was present He had gone to mister Channing s house ostensibly to welcome mister Channing home and congratulate him on his restoration Glad in truth was he to possess the opportunity to do that but mister Yorke s visit also included a purpose less disinterested Repulsed by Constance in the two or three appeals he had made to her he had impatiently awaited the return of mister Channing to solicit his influence Remembering the past listening to this explanation of the present you may imagine if you can what his sensations must have been He who had held up his head in his haughty Yorke spirit ready to spurn Arthur for the suspicion cast upon him ready to believe that he was guilty resenting it upon Constance had now to stand and learn that the guilt lay in his family not in theirs No wonder that he stood silent grave his lips drawn in to sternness mister Galloway soon departed again He had left his dinner untouched upon his table mister Huntley took the occasion to leave with him and in the earnestness of discussion they all went out with them to the hall except Constance This was mister Yorke s opportunity His arms folded his pale cheek flushed to pain he moved before her and stood there drawn to his full height speaking hoarsely Constance will it be possible for you to forgive me What a fine field it presented for her to play the heroine To go into fierce declamations that she never could and never would forgive him but would hold herself aloof from him for ever and a day condemning him to bachelorhood Unfortunately for these pages Constance Channing had nothing of the heroine in her composition She was only one of those simple truthful natural English girls whom I hope you often meet in your every day life She smiled at William Yorke through her glistening eye lashes and drew closer to him Did he take the hint He took her took her to that manly breast that would henceforth be her shelter for ever Heaven knows how I will strive to atone to you my darling It was a happy evening chequered though it necessarily must be with thoughts of Charles And mister Channing in the midst of his deep grief and perplexity thanked God for His great mercy in restoring the suspected to freedom My boy he exclaimed to Arthur how bravely you have borne it all Not always very bravely said Arthur shaking his head There were times when I inwardly rebelled It could not have been done without one thing resumed mister Channing firm trust in God Arthur s cheek kindled That had ever been present with him When things would wear their darkest aspect I used to say to myself Patience and hope and trust in God But I never anticipated this bright ending he added I never thought that I and Hamish should both be cleared I cannot conceive how you could have suspected Hamish mister Channing repeated after a pause Of all the wonders that fact seemed to have taken most hold of his mind Arthur made a slight answer but did not pursue the topic There were circumstances connected with it regarding Hamish not yet explained He could not speak of them to mister Channing Neither were they to be explained as it seemed to Arthur At any rate not at present When they retired to rest Hamish came into his room as he had done that former night months ago when suspicion had just been thrown upon Arthur They went up together and Hamish instead of turning into his own room followed Arthur to his He set down the candle on the table and turned to Arthur with his frank smile How is it that we can have been playing at these cross purposes Arthur Why did you not tell me at the time that you were innocent I think I did tell you so Hamish if my memory serves me rightly Well I am not sure it may have been so but in a very undemonstrative sort of manner if you did at all That sort of manner from you Arthur would only create perplexity Arthur smiled Don t you see believing that you had taken it I thought you must know whether I was innocent or guilty And for your sake I did not dare to defend myself to others Had only a breath of suspicion fallen upon you Hamish it might have cost my father his post What induced you to suspect me Surely not the simple fact of being alone for a few minutes with the letter in Galloway s office Not that That alone would have been nothing but coupled with other circumstances it assumed a certain weight Hamish I will tell you Do you remember the trouble you were in at the time owing money in the town A smile parted Hamish s lips he seemed half inclined to make fun of the reminiscence I remember it well enough What of that You contrived to pay those debts or partially pay them at the exact time the note was taken and we knew you had no money of your own to do it with We saw you also with gold in your purse through Annabel s tricks do you remember and we knew that it could not be yours legitimately yours I mean Hamish s smile turned into a laugh Stop a bit Arthur The money with which I paid up and the gold you saw was mine legitimately mine Don t speak so fast old fellow But where did it come from Hamish It did not come from Galloway s office and it did not drop from the skies laughed Hamish Never mind where else it came from Arthur boy I wish you had been candid and had given me a hint of your suspicion We were at cross purposes as you observe repeated Arthur Once plunge into them and there s no knowing when enlightenment will come perhaps never But you were not very open with me I was puzzled replied Hamish You may remember that my seeing a crowd round the Guildhall was the first intimation I received of the matter When they told me in answer to my questions that my brother Arthur Channing was taken up on suspicion of stealing a bank note and was then under examination I should have laughed in their faces but for my inclination to knock them down I went into that hall Arthur trusting in your innocence as implicitly as I trusted in my own boiling over with indignation against all who had dared to accuse you ready to stand up for you against the world I turned my eyes upon you as you stood there and your gaze met mine Arthur what made you look so I never saw guilt or perhaps I would rather say shame conscious shame shine out more palpably from any countenance than it did from yours then It startled me it cowed me and in that moment I did believe you guilty Why did you look so I looked so for your sake Hamish Your countenance betrayed your dismay and I read it for signs of your own guilt and shame Not until then did I fully believe you guilty We were at cross purposes you see throughout the piece Cross purposes indeed repeated Hamish Have you believed me guilty until now No replied Hamish After a few days my infatuation wore off It was an infatuation and nothing less ever to have believed a Channing guilty I then took up another notion and that I have continued to entertain What was it That you were screening Roland Yorke Arthur lifted up his eyes to Hamish I did indeed Roland s excessive championship of you his impetuous agitation when others brought it up against you first aroused my suspicions that he himself must have been guilty and I came to the conclusion that you also had discovered his guilt and were generously screening him I believed that you would not allow a stir be made in it to clear yourself lest it should bring it home to him Cross purposes again you will say Ah yes Not so much as an idea of suspecting Roland Yorke ever came across me All my fear was that he or any one should suspect you Hamish laughed as he placed his hands upon Arthur s shoulders The best plan for the future will be to have no secrets one from the other otherwise it seems hard to say what labyrinths we may not get into What do you say old fellow You began the secrets first Hamish Did I Well let us thank Heaven that the worst are over Ay thank Heaven Most sincerely was Arthur Channing doing that The time to give thanks had come Meanwhile mister Huntley had proceed home He found Miss Huntley in the stiffest and most uncompromising of moods and no wonder for mister Huntley had kept dinner waiting I am afraid to say how long Harry who was to have dined with them that day had eaten his and flown off to the town again to keep some appointment with the college boys Miss Huntley now ate hers in dignified displeasure but mister Huntley sitting opposite to her appeared to be in one of his very happiest moods Ellen attributed it to the fact of mister Channing s having returned home well She asked a hundred questions about them of their journey their arrival and mister Huntley never seemed tired of answering Barely was the cloth removed when Miss Huntley rose mister Huntley crossed the room to open the door for her and bow her out Although he was her brother she would never have forgiven him had he omitted that little mark of ceremony Ellen was dutifully following She could not always brave her aunt mister Huntley however gave Ellen a touch as she was passing him drew her back and closed the door upon his sister Ellen I have been obliged to take mister Hamish into favour again Ellen s cheeks became glowing She tried to find an answer but none came I find Hamish had nothing to do with the loss of the bank note Then she found words Oh papa no How could you ever have imagined such a thing You might have known the Channings better They are above suspicion I did know them better at one time or else you may be sure young lady mister Hamish would not have been allowed to come here as he did However it is cleared up and I suppose you would like to tell me that I was just a donkey for my pains Ellen shook her head and laughed She would have liked to ask whether mister Hamish was to be allowed to come again on the old familiar footing had she known how to frame the question But it was quite beyond her courage When I told him this evening that I had suspected him She clasped her hands and turned to mister Huntley her rich colour going and coming Papa you told him Ay And I was not the only one to suspect him or to tell him I can assure you that Miss Ellen What did he say How did he receive it Told us he was much obliged to us all I don t think Hamish could be put out of temper Then you do not dislike him now papa she said timidly I never have disliked him When I believed what I did of him I could not dislike him even then try as I would There you may go to your aunt now And Ellen went feeling that the earth and air around her had suddenly become as Eden CHAPTER LVI THE BROKEN PHIAL That broken phial you have heard of was burning a hole in Bywater s pocket as Roland Yorke had said the bank note did in his He had been undecided about complaining to the master strangely so for Bywater The fact was he had had a strong suspicion from the very first that the boy who did the damage to the surplice was Pierce senior At least his suspicions had been divided between that gentleman and Gerald Yorke The cause of suspicion against Pierce need not be entered into since it was misplaced In point of fact mister Pierce was so far as that feat went both innocent and unconscious But Bywater could not be sure that he was and he did not care to bring the accusation publicly against Gerald should he be innocent You saw Bywater a chapter or two back fitting the broken pieces together in his bedroom On the following morning it was also the morning following the arrival of the important letter from Roland Yorke Bywater detained Gerald Yorke when the boys tore down the schoolroom steps after early school I say Yorke I said I d give you a last chance and now I am doing it he began If you ll acknowledge the truth to me about that surplice affair I ll let it drop I will upon my honour I ll never say another word about it Gerald flew into a rage Now look you here mister Bywater was his angry retort You bother me again with that stale fish and I ll put you up for punishment It s Gerald stopped Tom Channing was passing close to them and mister Gerald had never cared to be heard when talking about the surplice At that moment a group of boys who were running out of the cloisters the opposite road to Tom Channing turned round and hissed him Tod Yorke adding some complimentary remark about stolen notes As usual it was a shaft launched at Arthur Not as usual did Tom receive it There was nothing of fierce defiance now in his demeanour nothing of half subdued rage Tom halted took off his trencher with a smile of suavity that might have adorned Hamish and thanked them with as much courtesy as if it had been real especially Tod Gerald Yorke and Bywater looked on with surprise They little dreamt of the great secret that Tom now carried within him He could afford to be calm Why it s four months good since that surplice was damaged resumed Gerald in a tone of irritation to Bywater as soon as they were alone again One would think it was of rare value by your keeping up the ball in this way Every now and then you break out afresh about that surplice Was it made of gold It was made of Irish linen returned Bywater who generally contrived to retain his coolness whoever might grow heated I tell you that I have a fresh clue Yorke one I have been waiting for I thought it would turn up some time If you say you did it by accident or how you like I ll let it drop If you don t I ll bring it before Pye after breakfast Bring it retorted Gerald Mind you I mean what I say I shall bring the charge against you and I have the proofs Bring it I say fiercely repeated Gerald Who cares for your bringings Mind your bones afterwards that s all He pushed Bywater from him with a haughty gesture and raced home to breakfast hoping there would be something good to assuage his hunger But Bywater was not to be turned from his determination Never a boy in the school less likely than he He went home to his breakfast and returned to school to have his name inscribed on the roll and then went into college with the other nine choristers and took his part in the service And the bottle I say was burning a hole in his pocket The Reverend William Yorke was chanting and Arthur Channing sat at the organ Would the Very Reverend the Dean of Helstonleigh standing in his stall so serenely placid his cap resting on the cushion beside him ever again intimate a doubt that Arthur was not worthy to take part in the service But the dean did not know the news yet Back in the school room Bywater lost no time He presented himself before the master and entered upon his complaint schoolboy fashion Please sir I think I have found out who inked my surplice The master had allowed the occurrence to slip partially from his memory At any rate it was some time since he had called it up Oh indeed said he somewhat cynically to Bywater after a pause given to revolving the circumstances Think you have found out the boy do you Yes sir I am pretty sure of it I think it was Gerald Yorke Gerald Yorke One of the seniors repeated the master casting a penetrating gaze upon Bywater The fact was mister Pye at the time of the occurrence had been somewhat inclined to a secret belief that the real culprit was Bywater himself Knowing that gentleman s propensity to mischief knowing that the destruction of a few surplices more or less would be only fun to him he had felt an unpleasant doubt upon the point Did you do it yourself he now plainly asked of Bywater Bywater for once was genuinely surprised I had no more to do with it sir than this desk had touching the master s I should not have spent many an hour since trying to ferret it out if I had done it Well what have you found out On the day it happened sir when we were discussing it in the cloisters little Channing suddenly started up with a word that caused me to think he had seen something connected with it in which Gerald Yorke was mixed up But the boy recollected himself before he had said much and I could get no more from him Once afterwards I heard him tell Yorke that he had kept counsel about the inked surplice Is that all asked the master while the whole school sat with tingling ears for Bywater was not making his complaint in private Not quite sir Please to look at this Bywater had whipped the broken phial out of his pocket and was handing the smaller piece towards the master mister Pye looked at it curiously As I was turning over my surplice sir in the vestry when I found it that day I saw this bit of glass lying in the wet ink I thought it belonged to a small ornamental phial which Gerald Yorke used to keep about that time in his pocket full of ink But I couldn t be sure So I put the bit of glass into my pocket thinking the phial would turn up some day if it did belong to it And so it has You can put the piece into it sir and see whether it fits Gerald Yorke left his place and joined Bywater before the head master He looked white and haughty Is it to be borne sir that he should tell these lies of me Are they lies returned mister Pye who was fitting the piece into the bottle I have told no lies yet said Bywater And I have not said for certain you did it I say I think so You never found that bottle upon the surplice I don t believe it foamed Gerald I found the little piece of glass I put it into my trousers pocket wet with ink as it was and here are the stains of ink still added Bywater turning out that receptacle for the benefit of mister Pye It was this same pair of trousers I had on that day Bywater said the master why did you not say at the time that you found the piece of glass Because sir the bit by itself would have told nothing I thought I d wait till the bottle itself turned up Old Jenkins the bedesman found it a few days ago in the college burial ground pretty near to the college gates just in the spot where it most likely would be sir if one came out of the college in a fright and dashed it over Does this belong to you Yorke inquired the master scrutinizing that gentleman s countenance as he had previously scrutinized Bywater s Gerald Yorke took the phial in his hand and examined it He knew perfectly well that it was his but he was asking himself whether the school apart from Bywater could contradict him if he said it was not He feared they might I had a phial very much like this sir turning it over and over in his hand apparently for the purpose of a critical inspection I am not sure that this is the same I don t think it is I lost mine sir somebody stole it out of my pocket I think When did you lose it demanded mister Pye About the time that the surplice got inked sir a day or two before it Who is telling lies now cried bold Bywater He had the bottle that very day sir at his desk here in this schoolroom The upper boys know he had it and that he was using it Channing turning round and catching Tom s eye the first he did catch you can bear witness that he was using it that morning Don t call upon me replied Tom stolidly I decline to interfere with mister Yorke for or against him It is his bottle and he had it that morning and I say that I think he must have broken it over the surplice persisted Bywater with as much noise as he dared display in the presence of the master Otherwise how should a piece out of the bottle be lying on the surplice The master came to the conclusion that the facts were tolerably conclusive He touched Yorke Speak the truth boy he said with a tone that seemed to imply he rather doubted Gerald s strict adherence to truth at all times and seasons Gerald turned crusty I don t know anything about it sir Won t I pummel you for this he concluded in an undertone to Bywater Besides that sir went on Bywater pushing Gerald aside with his elbow as if he were nobody Charles Channing I say saw something that led him to suspect Gerald Yorke I am certain he did I think it likely that he saw him fling the bottle away after doing the mischief Yorke knows that I have given him more than one chance to get out of this If he had only told me in confidence that it was he who did it whether by accident or mischief I d have let it drop Yorke said the master leaning his face forward and speaking in an undertone do you remember what I promised the boy who did this mischief Not for the feat itself but for braving me when I ordered him to speak out and he would not Yorke grew angry and desperate Let it be proved against me sir if you please before you punish I don t think even Bywater rancorous as he is can prove me guilty At this moment who should walk forward but mister Bill Simms much to the astonishment of the head master and of the school in general Since mister Simms s confession to the master touching the trick played on Charles Channing he had not led the most agreeable of lives Some of the boys treated him with silent contempt some worried his life out of him and all hated him He could now enjoy a little bit of retaliation on one of them at any rate Please sir the day the surplice was inked I saw Gerald Yorke come out of the college just before afternoon service and chuck a broken ink bottle over into the burial ground You saw it exclaimed the master while Gerald turned his livid face his flashing eye on the young tell tale Yes sir I was in the cloisters inside one of the niches and saw it Charley Channing was in the cloisters too but he didn t see me and I don t think mister Yorke saw either of us Why did you not tell me this at the time mister Bill Simms stood on his heels and stood on his toes and pulled his lanky straw coloured hair and rubbed his face ere he spoke I was afraid sir I knew mister Yorke would beat me Cur ejaculated Gerald below his breath The head master turned his eyes upon him Yorke I A commotion at the door and mister Pye stopped There burst in a lady with a wide extent of crinoline but that was not the worst of the bustle Her cheeks were flushed her hands lifted her eyes wild altogether she was in a state of the utmost excitement Gerald stared with all his might and the head master rose to receive her as she sailed down upon him It was Lady Augusta Yorke CHAPTER LVII A GHOST AGAIN Minds are differently constituted as was exemplified in the case under our immediate notice While one of mister Galloway s first thoughts on the receipt of Roland Yorke s letter was to rush round to Lady Augusta s with the news half in anger half in a reproachful humour Arthur Channing was deliberating how they could contrive to keep it from her The one was actuated by an angry the other by a generous spirit mister Galloway at length concluded his long delayed dinner that evening Then he put on his hat and with Roland s letter safe in his pocket went out again to call on Lady Augusta It happened however that Lady Augusta was not at home She had gone to dine at Colonel Joliffe s a family who lived some distance from Helstonleigh necessitating an early departure from home if she would be in time for their six o clock dinner hour It had thus occurred that when the afternoon s post arrived Lady Augusta was in the bustle and hurry of dressing and Lady Augusta was one of those who are and must be in a bustle even if they are only going to a friendly dinner party Martha was busily assisting and the cook brought up two letters Both for my lady she said giving them to Martha I have no time for letters now called out my lady Put them into my drawer Martha Martha did as she was bid and Lady Augusta departed She returned home pretty late and the letters remained in their receptacle untouched Of course to retire to rest late necessitated with Lady Augusta Yorke rising late the next morning About eleven o clock she came down to breakfast A letter on the breakfast table brought to her remembrance the letters of the previous night and she sent Martha for them Looking at their addresses she perceived one of them to be from Roland the other from Lord Carrick and she laid them by her to be opened presently mister Galloway called last night my lady observed Martha Oh did he said Lady Augusta He said he wanted to see your ladyship particularly But I said you were gone to Colonel Joliffe s Barely had Lady Augusta tasted her coffee the letters still lying unopened at her side when William Yorke entered having just left the cathedral This is a terrible blow Lady Augusta he observed as he sat down What s a blow returned Lady Augusta Will you take some coffee William Have you not heard of it he replied declining the coffee with a gesture I thought it probable that you would have received news from Roland A letter arrived from Roland last night she said touching the letter in question What is the matter Is there bad news in it What have you heard anything mister Yorke had not the slightest doubt that the letter before him must contain the same confession which had been conveyed to Arthur and to mister Galloway He thought it better that she should hear it from him than read it unprepared He bent towards her and spoke in a low tone of compassion I fear that the letter does contain bad news very bad news indeed Ro Good heavens what has happened to him she interrupted falling into excitement just as Roland himself might have done Is he ill Has he got hurt Is he killed Now pray calm yourself Lady Augusta Roland is well in health and has sailed for Port Natal under what he considers favourable auspices He Then why in the world do you come terrifying me out of my wits with your tales William Yorke she broke forth I declare you are no better than a child Nay Lady Augusta you terrified yourself jumping to conclusions Though Roland is safe and sound there is still some very disagreeable news to be told concerning him He has been making a confession of bad behaviour Oh cried Lady Augusta in a tone which seemed to say Is that all as if bad behaviour and Roland might have some affinity for each other William Yorke bent his head nearer and dropped his voice lower In that mysterious affair of the bank note when Arthur Channing was accused Well well she hastily repeated for he had made a slight pause and a tone of dread as a shadow of evil might be detected in her accents It was Roland who took the note Lady Augusta jumped up She would not receive it It is not true it cannot be true she reiterated How dare you so asperse him William Yorke Thoughtless as Roland is he would not be guilty of dishonour He has written full particulars both to Arthur Channing and to mister Galloway said mister Yorke calmly I have no doubt that that letter to you also relates to it He confesses that to clear Arthur was a great motive in taking him from Helstonleigh Lady Augusta seized the letter and tore it open She was too agitated to read calmly but she saw enough to convince her that Roland and no other had appropriated the money This must have been the matter he had obscurely hinted at in one of his last conversations with her The letter was concluded very much after Roland s own fashion Now mother if you care that anything in the shape of honour should ever shine round me again you ll go off straight to the college school and set Tom Channing right with it and with the masters And if you don t and I get drowned on my voyage I ll not say but my ghost will come again and haunt every one who has had to do with the injustice Ghosts were not agreeable topics to Lady Augusta and she gave a shriek at the bare thought But that was as nothing compared with her anger Honourable in the main hot hasty impulsive losing all judgment all self control when these fits of excitement came upon her it is more than probable that her own course would have been to fly to the college school unprompted by Roland A sense of justice was strong within her and in setting Tom right she would not spare Roland her own son though he was Before William Yorke knew what she was about she had flown upstairs and was down again with her things on Before he could catch her up she was across the Boundaries entering the cloisters and knocking at the door of the college school There she broke in upon that interesting investigation touching the inked surplice Bywater who seemed to think she had arrived for the sole purpose of setting at rest the question of the phial s ownership and not being troubled with any superfluous ideas of circumlocution eagerly held out the pieces to her when she was yards from his desk Do you know this Lady Augusta Isn t it Gerald s Yes it is Gerald s replied she He took it out of my desk one day in the summer though I told him not and I never could get it back again Have you been denying that it was yours she sternly added to Gerald Bad luck to you then for a false boy You are going to take a leaf out of your brother Roland s pattern are you Haven t I had enough of you bad boys on my hands but there must something fresh come up about one or the other of you every day that the sun rises mister Pye I have come by Roland s wish and by my own to set the young Channings right with the school You took the seniorship from Tom believing that it was his brother Arthur who robbed mister Galloway Not but that I thought some one else would have had that seniorship you know In Lady Augusta s present mood had any one of her sons committed a murder she must have proclaimed it though it had been to condemn him to punishment She had not come to shield Roland and she did not care in her anger how bad she made him out to be or whether she did it in Irish or English The head master could only look at her with astonishment He also believed her visit must have reference to the matter in hand It is true Lady Augusta But for the suspicion cast upon his brother Channing would not have lost the seniorship said the master ignoring the hint touching himself And all of ye turning round to face the wondering school have been ready to fling ye re stones at Tom Channing like the badly brought up boys that ye are I have heard of it And my two Gerald and Tod the worst of ye at the game You may look mister Tod but I ll be after giving ye a jacketing for ye re pains Let me tell ye all that it was not Tom Channing s brother took the bank note it was their brother Gerald s and Tod s It was my ill doing boy Roland who took it No one knew where to look Some looked at her ladyship some at the head master some at the Reverend William Yorke who stood pale and haughty some at Gerald and Tod some at Tom Channing Tom did not appear to regard it as news he seemed to have known it before the excessive astonishment painted upon every other face was absent from his But half the school did not understand Lady Augusta None understood her fully I beg your ladyship s pardon said the head master I do not comprehend what it is that you are talking about Not comprehend repeated her ladyship Don t I speak plainly My unhappy son Roland has confessed that it was he who stole the bank note that so much fuss has been made about and that Arthur Channing was taken up for You two may look and frown nodding to Gerald and Tod but it was your own brother who was the thief Arthur Channing was innocent I m sure I shan t look a Channing in the face for months to come Tell them about it in a straightforward way William Yorke mister Yorke thus called upon stated in a few concise words the facts to the master His tone was low but the boys caught the sense that Arthur was really innocent and that poor Tom had been degraded for nothing The master beckoned Tom forward Did you know of this Channing Yes sir since the letter came to my brother Arthur last night Lady Augusta rushed up impulsively to Tom She seized his hands and shook them heartily Tom never afterwards was sure that she didn t kiss him You ll live to be an honour to your parents yet Tom she said when my boys are breaking my heart with wilfulness Tom s face flushed with pleasure not so much at the words as at the yearning repentant faces cast at him from all parts of the room There was no mistaking that they were eager to offer reparation Tom Channing innocent all this time How should they make it up to him He turned to resume his seat but Huntley slipped out of the place he occupied as the head of the school and would have pushed Tom into it There was some slight commotion and the master lifted his spectacles Silence there Huntley what are you about Keep your seat No sir said Huntley advancing a step forward I beg your pardon sir but the place is no longer mine I never have considered it mine legally and I will with your permission resign it to its rightful owner The place is Channing s I have only occupied it for him He quietly pushed Tom into it as he spoke and the school finding their voices and ignoring the presence of the master and of Lady Augusta sprang from their desks at one bound and seized upon Tom wishing him luck asking him to be a good old fellow and forgive them Long live Tom Channing the senior of Helstonleigh school shouted bold Bywater and the boys thus encouraged took up the shout and the old walls echoed it Long live Tom Channing the senior of Helstonleigh school Before the noise had died away Lady Augusta was gone and another had been added to the company in the person of mister Huntley Oh he said taking in a rapid glance of affairs I see it is all right Knowing how thoughtless Harry is I feared he might not recollect to do an act of justice That he would be the first to do it if he remembered I knew As if I should forget that sir responded mister Harry Why I could no more live with Channing under me now than I could let any one of the others be above me And I am not sorry added the young gentleman sotto voce If the seniorship is a great honour it is also a great bother Here Channing take the keys He flung them across the desk as he spoke he was proceeding to fling the roll also and two or three other sundries which belong to the charge of the senior boy but was stopped by the head master Softly Huntley I don t know that I can allow this wholesale changing of places and functions Oh yes you can sir said Harry with a bright look If I committed any unworthy act I should be degraded from the seniorship and another appointed The same thing can be done now without the degradation He deserves a recompense said mister Huntley to the master But this will be no recompense it is Channing s due He will make you a better senior than Harry mister Pye And now added mister Huntley improving upon the whole there will be no necessity to separate the seniorship from the Oxford exhibition It was rather a free and easy mode of dealing with the master s privileges and mister Pye relaxed into a smile In good truth his sense of justice had been inwardly burning since the communication made by Lady Augusta Tom putting aside a little outburst or two of passion had behaved admirably throughout the whole season of opprobrium there was no denying it And mister Pye felt that he had done so Will you do your duty as senior Channing unnecessarily asked the master I will try sir Take your place then mister Huntley was the first to shake his hand when he was in it I told you to bear up bravely my boy I told you better days might be in store Continue to do your duty in single hearted honesty under God as I truly believe you are ever seeking to do it and you may well leave things in His hands God bless you Tom Tom was a little overcome But mister Bywater made a divertisement He seized the roll with which it was no business of his to meddle and carried it to mister Pye The names have to be altered sir In return for which mister Pye sternly motioned him to his seat and Bywater favoured the school with a few winks as he lazily obeyed Who could possibly have suspected Roland Yorke exclaimed the master talking in an undertone with mister Huntley Nay if we are to compare merits he was a far more likely subject for suspicion than Arthur was mister Huntley s reply He was taking them comparatively What I meant to imply was that one could not have suspected that Roland knowing himself guilty would suffer another to lie under the stigma Roland has his good points if that may be said of one who helps himself to bank notes concluded the master Ay he is not all bad Witness sending back the money to Galloway witness his persistent championship of Arthur and going away partly to clear him as he no doubt has done I was as sure from the first that Arthur Channing was not guilty as that the sun shines in the heavens Did you suspect Roland No I had a peculiar theory of my own upon the matter said mister Huntley smiling and apparently examining closely the grain of the master s desk A theory however which has proved to be worthless as so many theories which obtain favour in this world often are But I will no longer detain you mister Pye You must have had enough hindrance from your legitimate business for one morning The hindrance is not at an end yet was the master s reply as he shook hands with mister Huntley I cannot think what has possessed the school lately we are always having some unpleasant business or other to upset it mister Huntley went out nodding cordially to Tom as he passed his desk and the master turned his eyes and his attention on Gerald Yorke Lady Augusta had hastened from the college school as impetuously as she had entered it Her errand now was to the Channings She was eager to show them her grieved astonishment her vexation to make herself the amende for Roland so far as she could do so She found both mister and missus Channing at home The former had purposed being in Guild Street early that morning but so many visitors had flocked in to offer their congratulations that he had hitherto been unable to get away Constance also was at home Lady Augusta had insisted upon it that she should not come to the children on that the first day after her father and mother s return They were alone when Lady Augusta entered Lady Augusta s first movement was to fling herself into a chair and burst into tears What am I to say to you she exclaimed What apology can I urge for my unhappy boy Nay dear Lady Augusta do not let it thus distress you said mister Channing You are no more to be held responsible for what Roland has done than we were for Arthur when he was thought guilty Oh I don t know she sobbed Perhaps if I had been more strict with him always he would never have done it I wish I had made a point of giving them a whipping every night all round from the time they were two years old she continued emphatically Would that have made my children turn out better do you think missus Channing could not forbear a smile It is not exactly strictness that answers with children Lady Augusta Goodness me I don t know what does answer with them then I have been indulgent enough to mine as every one else knows and see how they are turning out Roland to go and take a bank note And as if that were not bad enough to let the odium rest upon Arthur You will never forgive him I am certain that you never can or will forgive him And you and all the town will visit it upon me When Lady Augusta fell into this tearful humour of complaint it was better to let it run its course as mister and missus Channing knew by past experience They both soothed her telling her that no irreparable wrong had been done to Arthur nothing but what would be now made right It all turns contrary together exclaimed my lady drying up her tears over the first grievance and beginning upon another I suppose Constance you and William Yorke will be making it up now Constance s self conscious smile and her drooping eyelids might have told without words that that was already done And the next thing of course will be your getting married continued Lady Augusta When is it to be I suppose you have been settling the time The question was a direct and pointed one and Lady Augusta waited for an answer missus Channing came to the relief of Constance It would have been very soon indeed Lady Augusta but for this dreadful uncertainty about Charles In any case it will not be delayed beyond early spring Oh to be sure I knew that Everything goes contrary and cross for me What am I to do for a governess I might pay a thousand a year and not find another like Constance They are beginning to improve under you they are growing more dutiful girls to me and now it will all be undone again and they ll just be ruined Constance looked up with her pretty timid blush William and I have been thinking Lady Augusta that if you approved of it they had better come for a few months to Hazledon House I should then have them constantly under my own eye and I think I could effect some good We used to speak of this in the summer and last night we spoke of it again Lady Augusta flew into an ecstasy as great as her late grief had been Oh it would be delightful she exclaimed Such a relief to me and I know it would be the making of them I shall thank you and William for ever Constance and I don t care what I pay you I d go without shoes to pay you liberally Constance laughed As to payment she said I shall have nothing to do with that on my own score when once I am at Hazledon Those things will lie in William s department not in mine I question if he will allow you to pay him anything Lady Augusta We did not think of it in that light but in the hope that it might benefit Caroline and Fanny Lady Augusta turned impulsively to missus Channing What good children God has given you Tears rushed into missus Channing s eyes she felt the remark in all its grateful truth She was spared a reply she did not like to contrast them with Lady Augusta s ever so tacitly and say they were indeed good for Sarah entered and said another visitor was waiting in the drawing room As mister Channing withdrew Lady Augusta rose to depart She took missus Channing s hand How dreadful for you to come home and find one of your children gone she uttered How can you bear it and be calm Emotion rose then and missus Channing battled to keep it down The same God who gave me my children has taught me how to bear she presently said For the moment yesterday I really was overwhelmed but it passed away after a few hours struggle When I left home I humbly committed my child to God s good care in perfect trust and I feel that whether dead or alive that care is still over him I wish to goodness one could learn to feel as you do uttered Lady Augusta Troubles don t seem to touch you and mister Channing you rise superior to them but they turn me inside out And now I must go And I wish Roland had never been born before he had behaved so You must try to forgive him missus Channing you must promise to try and welcome him should he ever come back again Oh yes missus Channing answered with a bright smile The one will be as easy as the other has been He is already forgiven Lady Augusta I have done what I could in it I have been to the college school and told them all and Tom is put into his place as senior It s true indeed and I hope every boy will be flogged for putting upon him Gerald and Tod amongst the rest And now good bye Sarah was holding the street door open for Lady Augusta Lady Augusta who generally gave a word of gossip to every one even as Roland had her head turned towards the girl as she passed out of it and thereby nearly fell over a boy who at the moment was seeking to enter being led by a woman as if he had no strength to walk alone A tall thin white faced boy with great eyes and little hair and a red handkerchief tied over his head to hide the deficiency but a beautiful boy in spite of all for he bore a strange resemblance to Charles Channing Was it Charles Or was it his shadow My lady turned again to the hall startling the house with her cries that Charley s ghost had come and bringing forth its inmates in consternation CHAPTER LVIII BYWATER S DANCE Not Charley s shadow not Charley s ghost but Charley himself in real flesh and blood One knew him if the rest did not and that was Judith She seized upon him with sobs and cries and sat down on the hall bench and hugged him to her But Charley had seen some one else and he slipped from Judith to the arms that were held out to shelter him his warm tears breaking forth Mamma mamma missus Channing s tears fell fast as she received him She strained him to her bosom and held him there and they had to hold her for her emotion was great It is of no use endeavouring to describe this sort of meeting When the loved who have been thought dead are restored to life all description must fall short of reality if it does not utterly fail Charley whom they had mourned as lost was with them again traces of sickness of suffering were in his face in his attenuated form but still he was in life You must imagine what it was mister and missus Channing Lady Augusta Constance the servants and the Bishop of Helstonleigh for no less a personage than that distinguished prelate had been the visitor to mister Channing come to congratulate him on his cure and his return The woman who had accompanied Charley stood apart a hard featured woman in a clean cotton gown and clean brown apron whose face proclaimed that she lived much in the open air Perhaps she lived so much in it as to disdain bonnets for she wore none a red cotton handkerchief fellow to the one on Charley s head being pinned over her white calico cap Many unexpected meetings take place in this life A casual acquaintance whom we have met years ago but whom we never expected to see again may come across our path to morrow You my reader did not I am sure expect to meet that woman again whom you saw hanging up linen in a boat as it glided beneath the old cathedral walls under the noses of Bywater and a few more of his tribe the morning they were throwing away those unlucky keys which they fondly thought were never to be fished up again But here is that very woman before you now come to pay these pages as unexpected a visit as the keys paid to the college boys Not more unlooked for and not more strange than some of our meetings in actual life Mamma I have been ill I have been nearly dying and she has nursed me through it and been kind to me missus Channing leaned forward and grasped the woman s hand gratitude shining in her wet eyes mister Channing and Judith had a fight which should grasp the other Lady Augusta laid hold of her behind Sarah assailed her in front There appeared to be no room left for Constance and the Bishop or they might have assisted at the demonstration as the French say It was soon explained That same barge had been passing down stream again that night when Charley fell into the water The man heard the splash called to his horse to stop leaped overboard and saved him A poor little boy with a wound in his head quite senseless it proved to be when they had him on board and laid him on the bench for inspection Meanwhile the docile horse went on of its own accord and before the knotty question was decided as to whether the man should bring to and get him on shore and try and discover to whom he belonged the barge was clear of the town for the current was strong It had been nearly clear of it when it passed the cathedral wall and the splash occurred The man thought it as well that it was so his voyage this journey was being made against time and he dared not linger Had the boat house keeper s mother not put her head under the bed clothes and kept it there she might possibly have heard sounds of the rescue So they kept Charley on board He had evidently struck his head against something which had caused the wound and stunned him It may have been it is just possible that it may have been against the projecting wall of the boat house as he turned the corner in his fright and hurry If so that no doubt caused his fall and his stumble into the water The woman she had children of her own that great girl whom you saw scraping potatoes was one and she had two others still younger washed the wound and tried to bring Charley round But she could not awaken him to full consciousness His mind appeared to be wandering and ere another day had passed he was in strong delirium Whether it was the blow or the terrible fright which had preceded it or and this was most probable both combined Charles Channing was attacked with brain fever The woman nursed him through it she applied her own simple remedies She cut off his hair and kept wet linen constantly to his head and hot bricks wrapped round with wet steaming flannels to his feet and she gave him a certain herb tea to drink which in her firm belief and experience had never yet failed to subdue fever Perhaps Charley did as well without a doctor as he would have done with one By the time they reached their destination the malady was subsiding but the young patient was so prostrated and weak that all he could do was to lie quite still scarcely opening his eyes scarcely moving his hands When he became able to talk they were beginning to move up stream again as the woman called it Charley told her all about himself about his home his dear mamma and Judith his papa s ill health and hopes of restoration his college schoolboy life It was delicious to lie there in the languor of returning health and talk of these things The kindly woman won his love and confidence but when she asked him how he came to fall into the river he could never remember In the social atmosphere of companionship in the bright sunlight Charley could look back on the ghost in the cloisters and draw his own deductions His good sense told him it was no ghost that it was all a trick of Bywater s and others of the college boys The woman s opinion was that if they did do such a thing to frighten him they ought to be whipped but she was inclined to view it as a delusion of Charley s imagination a relic left by the fever Your folks ll be fine and pleased to see you again dear she would say to him My master ll moor the barge to the side when we gets to the place and I ll take ye home to um How Charley longed for it he alone could tell pleasant as it was now he was better to lie on deck on a rude bed made of sacks and glide peacefully along on the calm river between the green banks the blue sky above the warm sun shining on him Had Charley been placed on that barge in health he would have thought it the nastiest place he had ever seen confined dirty monotonous But waking to it from fever when he did not care where he lay so that he could only lie he grew reconciled to it Indeed Charley began to like the boat but he was none the less eager for the day that would see him leave it That day came at last The barge was brought to and here you see Charley and his protector Charley s clothes looked a mile too small for him he had so grown in his illness and Charley was minus a cap and the handkerchief did duty for one But it was Charley in spite of all and I say that you must imagine the meeting You must imagine their heartfelt thanks to the woman and their more substantial recompense Charley darling if you could only have written to us what dreadful distress you would have saved exclaimed Constance He write miss interposed the woman He couldn t have writ to save his life And we was a moving up stream again before he was well enough to tell us anything about himself My husband might have writ a word else I ain t no hand at a pen myself We have got quite used to the little gentleman and shall miss him now Constance tell her Is it not true about the ghost I am sure you must have heard of it from the boys She thinks I dreamt it she says Judith broke out volubly before Constance could answer testifying that it was true and relating the ill doings of the boys that night rather more at length than she need have done She and the woman appeared to be in perfect accord as to the punishment merited by those gentlemen The bishop leaned over Charley You hear what a foolish trick it was he said Were I you I would be upon good terms with such ghosts in future There are no other sorts of ghosts my boy I know there are not answered Charles Indeed my lord I do know there are not he repeated more earnestly And I knew it then only somehow I got frightened I will try and learn to be as brave in the dark as in the light That s my sensible boy said the bishop For my part Charley I rather like being in the dark God seems all the nearer to me The woman was preparing to leave declining all offers that she should rest and take refreshment Our turn both down and up was hurried this time she explained and I mayna keep the barge and my master a waiting I ll make bold when we are past the town again to step ashore and see how the young gentleman gets on Charley clung to her You shall not go till you promise to stay a whole day with us he cried And you must bring the children for mamma to see She will be glad to see them The woman laughed A whole day a whole day s pleasure was na for the likes of them she answered but she d try and spare a bit longer to stop than she could spare now With many kisses to Charles with many hand shakes from all she took her departure The Bishop of Helstonleigh high and dignified prelate that he was and she a poor hard working barge woman took her hand into his and shook it as heartily as the rest mister Channing went out with her He was going to say a word of gratitude to the man The bishop also went out but he turned the other way As he was entering Close Street the bishop encountered Arthur The latter raised his hat and was passing onwards but the bishop arrested him Channing I have just heard some news from your father You are at length cleared from that charge You have been innocent all this time Arthur s lips parted with a smile Your lordship may be sure that I am thankful to be cleared at last Though I am sorry that it should be at the expense of my friend Yorke Knowing yourself innocent you might have proclaimed it more decisively What could have been your motive for not doing so The ingenuous flush flew into Arthur s cheek The truth is my lord I suspected some one else Not Roland Yorke he pointedly added But it was one against whom I should have been sorry to bring a charge And so and so I went on bearing the blame Well Channing I must say and I shall say to others that you have behaved admirably showing a true Christian spirit mister Channing may well be happy in his children What will you give me added the bishop releasing Arthur s hand which he had taken and relapsing into his free pleasant manner for some news that I can impart to you Arthur wondered much What news could the bishop have to impart which concerned him The little lost wanderer has come home Not Charles uttered Arthur startled to emotion Charles and not dead Not dead certainly smiled the bishop considering that he can talk and walk He will want some nursing though Good bye Channing This take it for all in all must be a day of congratulation for you and yours To leap into mister Galloway s with the tidings to make but a few bounds thence home did not take many minutes for Arthur He found Charles in danger of being kissed to death missus Channing Lady Augusta Constance and Judith each taking her turn I fear Arthur only made another Why Charley you have grown out of your clothes he exclaimed How thin and white you are The remarks did not please Judith Thin and white she resentfully repeated Did you expect him to come home as red and fat as a turkey cock and him just brought to the edge of the grave with brain fever One would think Master Arthur that you d rejoice to see him if he had come back a skeleton when it seemed too likely you d never see him at all And what if he have outgrown his clothes They can be let out or replaced with new ones I have hands and there s tailors in the place I hope The more delighted felt Judith the more ready was she to take up remarks and convert them into grievances Arthur knew her and only laughed A day of rejoicing indeed as the bishop had said A day of praise to God Charley had been whispering to his mother He wanted to go to the college schoolroom and surprise it He was longing for a sight of his old companions That happy moment had been pictured in his thoughts fifty times as he lay in the boat it was almost as much desired as the return home Charley bore no malice and he was prepared to laugh with them at the ghost You do not appear strong enough to walk even so far as that said missus Channing Dear mamma let me go I could walk it for that if it were twice as far Yes let him go interposed Arthur divining the feeling I will help him along Charley s trencher the very trencher found on the banks was brought forth and he started with Arthur Mind you bring him back safe this time called out Judy in a tone of command as she stood at the door to watch them along the Boundaries Arthur said the boy were they punished for playing me that ghost trick They have not been punished yet they are to be The master waited to see how things would turn out You may remember that Diggs the boat house keeper when he took news of Charles s supposed fate to the college school entered it just in time to interrupt an important ceremony which was about to be performed on the back of Pierce senior In like manner and the coincidence was somewhat remarkable Charles himself now entered it when that same ceremony was just brought to a conclusion only that the back instead of being Pierce senior s was Gerald Yorke s Terrible disgrace for a senior and Gerald wished Bywater s surplice had been at the bottom of the river before he had meddled with it He had not done it purposely He had fallen in the vestry ink bottle in hand which had broken and spilt its contents over the surplice In an unlucky moment Gerald had determined to deny all knowledge of the accident never supposing it would be brought home to him Sullen angry and resentful he was taking his seat again and the head master rather red and hot with exertion was locking up the great birch when the door was opened and Arthur Channing made his appearance a boy carrying the college cap with him The school were struck dumb The head master paused birch in hand But that he was taller and thinner and that the bright colour and auburn curls were gone they would have said at once it was Charley Channing The master let fall the birch and the lid of his desk Channing he uttered as the child walked up to him Is it really you What has become of you all this time Where have you been I have been a long way in a barge sir The barge man saved me And I have had brain fever He looked round for Tom and Tom in the wild exuberance of his delight took Charley in his arms and tears dropped from his eyes as he kissed him as warmly as Judith could have done And then brave Tom could have eaten himself up in mortification at having been so demonstrative in sight of the college school But the school were not in the humour to be fastidious just then Some of them felt more inward relief at sight of Charles than they cared to tell they had never experienced anything like it in their lives and probably never would again In the midst of the murmur of heartfelt delight that was arising a most startling interruption occurred from mister Bywater That gentleman sprang from his desk to the middle of the room turned a somersault and began dancing a hornpipe on his head Bywater uttered the astounded master Are you mad Bywater finished his dance and then brought himself to his feet I am so glad he has turned up all right sir I forgot you were in school I should think you did significantly returned the master But Charles interrupted him You will not punish them sir now I have come back safe he pleaded But they deserve punishment said the master I know they have been sorry Arthur says they have urged Charley Please do not punish them now sir it is so pleasant to be back again Will you promise never to be frightened at their foolish tricks again said the master Not that there is much danger of their playing you any this has been too severe a lesson I am surprised that a boy of your age Charles could allow himself to be alarmed by ghosts You do not suppose there are such things surely No sir but somehow that night I got too frightened to think You will forgive them sir won t you Yes There Go and shake hands with them said mister Pye relaxing his dignity It is worth something Charley to see you here again The school seemed to think so and I wish you had heard the shout that went up from it the real true if somewhat noisy delight that greeted Charles Charley we ll never dress up a ghost again We ll never frighten you in any way they cried pressing affectionately round him Only forgive us Why are you sitting in the senior s place Tom asked Arthur Because it is his own said Harry Huntley with a smile of satisfaction Lady Augusta came in and set things right for you and Tom is made senior at last Hurrah Arthur cleared Tom senior Charley back and Gerald flogged Hurrah Hurrah If Pye were worth a dump he d give us a holiday echoed bold Bywater CHAPTER LIX READY The glorious surprise of Charley s safety greeted Hamish on his return home to dinner In fact he was just in time having come in somewhat before one o clock to witness Charley s arrival from the college schoolroom escorted by the whole tribe from the first to the last Even Gerald Yorke made one as did mister William Simms Gerald the smart over thought it best to put a light careless face upon his punishment disgraceful though it was considered to be for a senior To give Gerald his due his own share in the day s exploits faded into insignificance compared with the shock of mortification which shook him when he heard the avowal of his mother respecting Roland He and Tod had been the most eager of all the school to cast Arthur s guilt in Tom Channing s cheek they had proclaimed it as particularly objectionable to their feelings that the robbery should have taken place in an office where their brother was a pupil and now they found that Tom s brother had been innocent and their own brother guilty It was well that Gerald s brow should burn But she d no cause to come here and blurt it out to the lot right in one s face soliloquized Gerald alluding to Lady Augusta They d have heard it soon enough without that mister William Simms I have said also attended Charles mister William was hoping that the return of Charley would put him upon a better footing with the school He need not have hoped it his offence had been one that the college boys never forgave Whether Charley returned dead or alive or had never returned at all Simms would always remain a sneak in their estimation Sneak Simms he had been called since the occurrence and he had come to the resolution in his own mind of writing word home to his friends that the studies in Helstonleigh college school were too much for him and asking to be removed to a private one I think he would have to do so still Hamish lifted Charley to him with an eager fond movement A weight was taken from his mind Although really irresponsible for the disappearance of Charles he had always felt that his father and mother might inwardly attach some blame to him might think him to have been wanting in care Now all was sunshine Dinner over mister Channing walked with Hamish to the office They were some time in getting there Every other person they met stopped mister Channing to congratulate him It seemed that the congratulations were never to end It was not only mister Channing s renewed health that people had to speak of Helstonleigh from one end to the other was ringing with the news of Arthur s innocence and Charley s return was getting wind They reached Guild Street at last mister Channing entered and shook hands with his clerks and then took his own place in his private room Where are we to put you now Hamish he said looking at his son with a smile There s no room for you here You will not like to take your place with the clerks again Perhaps I had better follow Roland Yorke s plan and emigrate replied Hamish demurely I wish mister Huntley By the way Hamish it would only be a mark of courtesy if you stepped as far as mister Huntley s and told him of Charles s return broke off mister Channing the idea occurring to him with mister Huntley s name None have shown more sympathy than he and he will be rejoiced to hear that the child is safe I ll go at once said Hamish Nothing loth was he on his own part to pay a visit to mister Huntley s Hamish overtook mister Huntley close to his own home He was returning from the town Had he been home earlier he would have heard the news from Harry But Harry had now had his dinner and was gone again He did not dine at the later hour I have brought you some news sir said Hamish as they entered together News again It cannot be very great by the side of what we were favoured with last night from mister Roland was the remark of mister Huntley But indeed it is Greater news even than that We have found Charley mister Huntley mister Huntley sprang from the chair he was taking Found Charley Have you really Where has he Hamish I see by your countenance that the tidings are good He must be alive He is alive and well At least well comparatively speaking A barge was passing down the river at the time he fell in and the man leaped overboard and saved him Charley has been in the barge ever since and has had brain fever And how did he come home wondered mister Huntley when he had sufficiently digested the news The barge brought him back It is on its way up again Charley arrived under escort of the barge woman a red handkerchief on his head in lieu of his trencher which you know he lost that night added Hamish laughing Lady Augusta who was going out of the house as he entered was frightened into the belief that it was his ghost and startled them all with her cries to that effect including the bishop who was with my father in the drawing room Hamish it is like a romance said mister Huntley Very nearly taking one circumstance with another My father s return cured Roland s letter and now Charley s resuscitation Their all happening together renders it the more remarkable Poor Charley does look as much like a ghost as anything and his curls are gone They had to cut his hair close in the fever mister Huntley paused Do you know Hamish he presently said I begin to think we were all a set of wiseacres We might have thought of a barge If we had thought of a barge we should never have thought the barge would carry him off objected Hamish However we have him back now and I thank God I always said he would turn up you know I must come and see him said mister Huntley I was at the college school this morning therefore close to your house but I did not call I thought your father would have enough callers without me Hamish laughed He has had a great many The house I understand has been like a fair He is in Guild Street this afternoon It looks like the happy old times to see him at his post again What are you going to do now your place is usurped asked mister Huntley Subside into a clerk again and discharge the one who was taken on in your stead when you were promoted That s the question what is to be done with me returned Hamish in his joking manner I have been telling my father that I had perhaps better pay Port Natal a visit and join Roland Yorke I told your father once that when this time came I would help you to a post I am aware you did sir But you told me afterwards that you had altered your intention I was not eligible for it Believing you were the culprit at Galloway s Hamish raised his eyebrows The extraordinary part of that sir is how you could have imagined such a thing of me Hamish I shall always think so myself in future But I have this justification that I was not alone in the belief Some of your family who might be supposed to know you better than I entertained the same opinion Yes Constance and Arthur But are you sure sir that it was not their conduct that first induced you to suspect me Right lad Their conduct I should rather say their manner was inexplicably mysterious and it induced me to ferret out its cause That they were screening some one was evident and I could only come to the conclusion that it was you But Master Hamish there were circumstances on your own part which tended to strengthen the belief added mister Huntley his tone becoming lighter Whence sprang that money wherewith you satisfied some of your troublesome creditors just at that same time Once more as when it was alluded to before a red flush dyed the face of Hamish Certainly it could not be a flush of guilt while that ingenuous smile hovered on his lips But Hamish seemed attacked with sudden shyness Your refusal to satisfy me on this point when we previously spoke of it tended to confirm my suspicions continued mister Huntley I think you might make a confidant of me Hamish That money could not have dropped from the clouds and I am sure you possessed no funds of your own just then But neither did I steal it mister Huntley raising his eyes to that gentleman s face how closely you must have watched me and my affairs mister Huntley drew in his lips Perhaps I had my own motives for doing so young sir I earned the money said Hamish who probably penetrated into mister Huntley s motives at any rate he hoped he did so I earned it fairly and honourably by my own private and special industry mister Huntley opened his eyes Private and special industry Have you turned shoemaker Not shoemaker laughed Hamish Book maker The truth is mister Huntley But will you promise to keep my secret Ay Honour bright I don t want it to be known just yet The truth is I have been doing some literary work Martin Pope gave me an introduction to one of the London editors and I sent him some papers They were approved of and inserted but for the first I received no pay I threatened to strike and then payment was promised The first instalment I chiefly used to arrest my debts the second and third to liquidate them That s where the money came from mister Huntley stared at Hamish as if he could scarcely take in the news It was however only the simple truth When Martin Pope paid a visit to Hamish one summer night frightening Hamish and Arthur who dreaded it might be a less inoffensive visitor frightening Constance for that matter for she heard more of their dread than was expedient his errand was to tell Hamish that in future he was to be paid for his papers payment was to commence forthwith You may remember the evening though it is long ago You may also remember Martin Pope s coming hurriedly into the office in Guild Street telling Hamish some one was starting by the train when both hastened to the station leaving Arthur in wonder That was the very London editor himself He had been into the country and was taking Helstonleigh on his way back to town had stayed in it a day or two for the purpose of seeing Martin Pope who was an old friend and of being introduced to Hamish Channing That shy feeling of reticence which is the characteristic of most persons whose genius is worth anything had induced Hamish to bury all this in silence But when have you found time to write exclaimed mister Huntley unable to get over his surprise You could not find it during office hours Certainly not I have written in the evening and at night I have been a great rake stopping up later than I ought at this writing Do they know of it at home Some of them know that I sit up but they don t know what I sit up for By way of a blind I suppose it may be called a justifiable deceit said Hamish gaily I have taken care to carry the office books into my room that their suspicions may be confined to the accounts Judy s keen eyes detected my candle burning later than she considered it ought to burn and her rest has been disturbed with visions of my setting the house on fire I have counselled her to keep the water butt full under her window so that she may be safe from danger And are you earning money now In one sense I am I am writing for it My former papers were for the most part miscellaneous essays and that sort of thing but I am about a longer work now to be paid for on completion When it is finished and appears I shall startle them at home with the news and treat them to a sight of it When all other trades fail sir I can set up my tent as an author mister Huntley s feelings glowed within him None more than he knew the value of silent industry the worth of those who patiently practise it His heart went out to Hamish I suppose I must recommend you to Bartlett s post after all said he affecting to speak carelessly his eye betraying something very different Is it not gone asked Hamish No it is not gone And the appointment rests with me How would you like it Nay said Hamish half mockingly the question is should I be honest enough for it mister Huntley shook his fist at him If you ever bring that reproach up to me again I ll I ll You had better keep friends with me you know sir on other scores Hamish laughed I should like the post very much indeed sir And the house also I suppose you would make no objection to nodded mister Huntley None in the world I must work away though if it is ever to be furnished How can you tell but that some good spirit might furnish it for you cried mister Huntley quaintly They were interrupted before anything more was said Ellen who had been out with her aunt came running in in excitement Oh papa such happy news Charles Channing is found and She stopped when she saw that she had another auditor Hamish rose to greet her He took her hand released it and then returned to the fire to mister Huntley Ellen stood by the table and had grown suddenly timid You will soon be receiving a visit from my mother and Constance observed Hamish looking at her I heard certain arrangements being discussed in which Miss Ellen Huntley s name bore a part We are soon to lose Constance Ellen blushed rosy red mister Huntley was the first to speak Yorke has come to his senses I suppose Yorke and Constance between them In a short time she is to be transplanted to Hazledon It is more than he deserves emphatically declared mister Huntley I suppose you will be for getting married next mister Hamish when you come into possession of that house we have been speaking of and are your own master I always intended to think of it sir as soon as I could do so returned saucy Hamish And Ellen ran out of the room That same afternoon Arthur Channing was seated at the organ in pursuance of his duty when a message came up from the dean He was desired to change the selected anthem taken from the thirty fifth Psalm for another O taste and see how gracious the Lord is It was not an anthem in the cathedral collection but one recently composed and presented to it by a private individual It consisted of a treble solo and chorus Why had the dean specially commanded it for that afternoon Very rarely indeed did he change the services after they were put up Had he had Arthur in his mind when he decided upon it It was impossible to say Be it as it would the words found a strange echo in Arthur s heart as Bywater s sweet voice rang through the cathedral O taste and see how gracious the Lord is blessed is the man that trusteth in him O fear the Lord ye that are his saints for they that fear him lack nothing The lions do lack and suffer hunger but they who seek the Lord shall want no manner of thing that is good The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers Great are the troubles of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of all The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants and all they that put their trust in him shall not be destitute Every word told upon Arthur s heart sending it up in thankfulness to the Giver of all good He found the dean waiting for him in the nave when he went down at the conclusion of the service doctor Gardner was with him The dean held out his hand to Arthur I am very glad you are cleared he said You have behaved nobly Arthur winced He did not like to take the faintest meed of praise that was not strictly his due The dean might have thought he deserved less did he know that he had been only screening Hamish but Arthur could not avow that tale in public He glanced at the dean with a frank smile You see now sir that I only spoke the truth when I assured you of my innocence I do see it said the dean I believed you then And once more shaking Arthur s hand he turned into the cloisters with doctor Gardner I have already offered my congratulations said the canon good humouredly nodding to Arthur This was correct He had waylaid Arthur as he went into college Arthur suffered them to go on a few steps and then descended to the cloisters Old Ketch was shuffling along What s this I ve been a hearing about that there drownded boy having come back asked he of Arthur in his usual ungracious fashion I don t know what you may have heard Ketch He has come back And he ain t dead nor drownded Neither one nor the other He is alive and well Ketch gave a groan of despair And them horrid young wretches ll escape the hangman I d ha walked ten miles to see em Gracious Sir John what s that you are talking about interrupted Bywater as the choristers trooped up Escaped you so we have for once What an agony of disappointment it must be for you mister Calcraft Such practice for your old hands to topple off a dozen or so of us Besides the pay How much do you charge a head Calcraft Ketch answered by a yell Now don t excite yourself I beg went on aggravating Bywater We are thinking of getting up a petition to the dean to console you for your disappointment praying that he ll allow you to wear a cap we have ordered for you It s made of scarlet cloth with long ears and a set of bells Its device is a cross beam and a cord and we wish you health to wear it out I say let s wish mister Calcraft health What s tripe a pound to day Calcraft The choristers in various stages of delight entered on their aggravating shouts their mocking dance When they had driven mister Ketch to the very verge of insanity they decamped to the schoolroom I need not enlarge on the evening of thankfulness it was at mister Channing s Not one but had special cause for gratitude except perhaps Annabel mister Channing restored to health and strength missus Channing s anxiety removed Hamish secure in his new prospects for mister Huntley had made them certain heaviness removed from the heart of Constance the cloud lifted from Arthur Tom on the pedestal he thought he had lost sure also of the Oxford exhibition Charley amongst them again They could trace the finger of God in all and were fond of doing it Soon after tea Arthur rose I must drop in and see Jenkins he observed He will have heard the items of news from twenty people there s little doubt but he will like me to go to him with particulars No one in Helstonleigh has been more anxious that things should turn out happily than poor Jenkins Tell him he has my best wishes for his recovery Arthur said mister Channing I will tell him replied Arthur But I fear all hope of recovery for Jenkins is past It was more decidedly past than even Arthur suspected when he spoke A young woman was attending to missus Jenkins s shop when Arthur passed through it Her face was strange to him but from a certain peculiarity in the eyes and mouth he inferred it to be missus Jenkins s sister In point of fact that lady finding that her care of Jenkins and her care of the shop rather interfered with each other had sent for her sister from the country to attend temporarily on the latter Lydia went up to Jenkins s sick room and said a gentleman was waiting and missus Jenkins came down Oh it s you quoth she I hope he ll be at rest now He has been bothering his mind over you all day My opinion is he d never have come to this state if he had taken things easy like sensible people Is he in his room inquired Arthur He is in his room and in his bed And what s more young mister Channing hell never get out of it alive Then he is worse He has been worse this four days And I only get him up now to have his bed made I said to him yesterday Jenkins you may put on your things and go down to the office if you like My dear said he I couldn t get up much less get down to the office which I knew was the case before I spoke I wish I had had my wits about me somewhat irascibly went on missus Jenkins I should have had his bed brought down to the parlour here before he was so ill I don t speak for the shop I have somebody to attend to that but it s such a toil and a trapes up them two pair of stairs for every little thing that s wanted I suppose I can go up missus Jenkins You can go up returned she but mind you don t get worrying him I won t have him worried He worries himself without any one else doing it gratis If it s not about one thing it s about another Sometimes it s his master and the office how they ll get along sometimes it s me what I shall do without him sometimes it s his old father He don t need any outside things to put him up I am sorry he is so much worse remarked Arthur So am I said missus Jenkins tartly I have been doing all I could for him from the first and it has been like working against hope If care could have cured him or money could have cured him he d be well now I have a trifle of savings in the bank young mister Channing and I have not spared them If they had ordered him medicine at a guinea a bottle I d have had it for him If they said he must have wine or delicacies brought from the other ends of the earth they should have been brought Jenkins isn t good for much in point of spirit as all the world knows but he s my husband and I have strove to do my duty by him Now if you want to go up you can go added she after an imperceptible pause There s a light on the stairs and you know his room I ll take the opportunity to give an eye to the kitchen I don t care to leave him by himself now Finely it s going on I know missus Jenkins whisked down the kitchen stairs and Arthur proceeded up Jenkins was lying in bed his head raised by pillows Whatever may have been missus Jenkins s faults of manner her efficiency as a nurse and manager could not be called into question A bright fire burnt in the well ventilated though small room the bed was snowy white the apartment altogether thoroughly comfortable But Jenkins Fully occupied with his work for mister Galloway it was several days since Arthur had called on Jenkins and the change he now saw in his face struck him sharply The skin was drawn the eyes were unnaturally bright the cheeks had fallen in certainly there could not be very many hours of life left to Jenkins A smile sat on his parched lips and his eyelashes became moist as he looked up to Arthur and held out his feeble hand I knew you would be cleared sir I knew that God would surely bring the right to light I have been humbly thanking Him for you sir all day Arthur s eyes glistened also as he bent over him You have heard it then Jenkins I thought you would Yes sir I heard it this morning when it was getting towards mid day I had a visit sir from his lordship the bishop I had indeed He came up as he has done before as kindly and with as little ceremony as if he had been a poor body like myself It was he who first told me mister Arthur I am glad he came to see you Jenkins He talked so pleasantly sir It is a journey that we must all take Jenkins he said and for my part I think it matters little whether we take it sooner or later so that God vouchsafes to us the grace to prepare for it For affability sir it was just as if it had been a brother talking to me but he said things different from what any poor brother of mine could have said and they gave me comfort Then he asked me if I had taken the Sacrament lately and I thanked him and said I had taken it on Sunday last our clergyman came round to me after service mister Arthur and poor Jenkins s eyes wore an eager look of gratitude I feel sure that his lordship would have administered it to me with his own hands I wonder whether all bishops are like him Arthur did not answer Jenkins resumed quitting the immediate topic for another And I hear sir that mister Channing has come home restored and that the little boy is found His lordship was so good as to tell me both Oh mister Arthur how merciful God has been We are finding Him so just now fervently spoke Arthur And it is all right again sir with you and mister Galloway Quite right I am to remain in the office I am to be in your place Jenkins You ll occupy a better position in it sir than I ever did But you will not be all alone surely Young Bartlett is coming to be under me mister Galloway has made final arrangements to day We shall go on all right now Ay said Jenkins folding his thin hands upon the counterpane and speaking as in self commune we must live near to God to know His mercy It does seem almost as if I had asked a favour of any earthly person so exactly has it been granted me mister Arthur I prayed that I might live to see you put right with mister Galloway and the town and I felt as sure as I could feel by some inward evidence which I cannot describe but which was plain to me that God heard me and would grant me my wish It seems sir as if I had been let live for that I shan t be long now While there is life there is hope you know Jenkins replied Arthur unable to say anything more cheering in the face of circumstances mister Arthur the hope for me now is to go said Jenkins I would not be restored if I could How can I tell sir but I might fall away from God If the call comes to night sir it will find me ready Oh mister Arthur if people only knew the peace of living close to God of feeling that they are READY Ready for the summons let it come in the second or third watch Jenkins exclaimed Arthur as the thought struck him I have not heard you cough once since I came in Is your cough better Oh sir there s another blessing Now that I have grown so weak that the cough would shatter me tear my frame to pieces it is gone It is nearly a week sir since I coughed at all My death bed has been made quite pleasant for me Except for weakness I am free from pain and I have all things comfortable I am rich in abundance my wife waits upon me night and day she lets me want for nothing before I can express a wish it is done When I think of all the favours showered down upon me and how little I can do or have ever done for God in return I am overwhelmed with shame Jenkins one would almost change places with you to be in your frame of mind cried Arthur his tone impassioned God will send the same frame of mind to all who care to go to Him was the reply Sir and now Jenkins dropped his voice I was grieved to hear about mister Roland I could not have thought it Ay it was unwelcome news for his own sake I never supposed but that the post office must have been to blame I think mister Arthur he must have done it in a dream as one I mean who has not his full faculties about him I hope the Earl of Carrick will take care of him I hope he will live to come back a good brave man If he would only act less on impulse and more on principle it would be better for him Little Master Charles has been ill I hear sir I should like to see him I will bring him to see you replied Arthur Will you sir and Jenkins s face lighted up I should like just to set eyes on him once again But it must be very soon mister Arthur You think so murmured Arthur I know it sir I feel it I do not say it before my wife sir for I don t think she sees herself that I am so near the end and it would only grieve her It will grieve her sir whenever it comes though she may not care to show people that it does I shall see you again I hope mister Arthur That you shall be sure to do I will not miss a day now without coming in It will do me good to see you Jenkins to hear you tell me again of your happy state of resignation It is better than resignation mister Arthur it is a state of hope Not but that I shall leave some regrets behind me My wife will be lone and comfortless and must trust to her own exertions only And my poor old father If I didn t know it If I didn t know that on some subject or other he d be safe to be worrying himself or it would not be him I d put myself into my grave at once if I were you Jenkins As good do it that way as by slow degrees Of course you cannot fail to recognize the voice She entered at that unlucky moment when Jenkins was alluding to his father He attempted a defence an explanation My dear I was not worrying I was only telling mister Arthur Channing that there were some things I should regret to leave My poor old father for one he has looked to me naturally to help him a little bit in his old age and I would rather so far as that goes have been spared to do it But neither that nor anything else can worry me now I am content to leave all to God Was ever the like heard retorted missus Jenkins Not worrying I know If you were not worrying you wouldn t be talking Isn t old Jenkins your father and shan t I take upon myself to see that he does not want You know I shall Jenkins When do I ever go from my word My dear I know you will do what s right returned Jenkins in his patient meekness but the old man will feel it hard my departing before him Are you going sir I must go replied Arthur taking one of the thin hands I will bring Charley in to morrow Jenkins pressed Arthur s hand between his God bless you mister Arthur he fervently said May He be your friend for ever May He render your dying bed happy as He has rendered mine And Arthur turned away never again to see Jenkins in life Blessed are those servants whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching As Jenkins was that night when the message came for him CHAPTER LX IN WHAT DOES IT LIE Had the clerk of the weather been favoured with an express letter containing a heavy bribe a more lovely day could not have been secured than that one in January which witnessed the marriage of Constance Channing to the reverend William Yorke The ceremony was over and they were home again seated at breakfast with their guests But only a few guests were present and they for the most part close friends the Huntleys Lady Augusta Yorke and Gerald mister Galloway and the reverend mister Pye who married them It has since become the fashion to have a superfluity of bridesmaids I am not sure that a young lady would consider herself legally married unless she enjoyed the privilege Constance though not altogether a slave to fashion followed it not in a very extensive degree Annabel Channing Ellen Huntley and Caroline and Fanny Yorke had been the demoiselles d honneur Charley s auburn curls had grown again and Charley himself was in better condition than when he arrived from his impromptu excursion For grandeur no one could approach Miss Huntley her brocade silk stood on end stiff prim and stately as herself Judy in her way was stately too a curiously fine lace cap on her head which had not been allowed to see the light since Charley s christening with a large white satin bow in front almost as large as the cap itself And that was no despicable size The only one who did not behave with a due regard to what might be expected of him was Hamish grievous as it is to have to record it It had been duly impressed upon Hamish that he was to conduct Miss Huntley in to breakfast etiquette and society consigning that lady to his share mister Hamish however chose to misconstrue instructions in the most deplorable manner He left Miss Huntley a prey to whomsoever might pick her up and took in Miss Ellen It might have passed possibly but for Annabel who appeared as free and unconcerned that important morning as at other times Hamish that s wrong It is Miss Huntley you are to take in not Ellen Hamish had grown suddenly deaf He walked on with Ellen leaving confusion to right itself Arthur stepped up in the dilemma and the tips of Miss Huntley s white gloved fingers were laid upon his arm It would take her some time to forgive Hamish favourite though he was Later on Hamish took the opportunity of reading Miss Annabel a private lecture on the expediency of minding her own business Hamish was in his new post now at the bank thoroughly well established He had not yet taken up his abode in the house It was too large he laughingly said for a single man The breakfast came to an end as other breakfasts do and next Constance came down in her travelling dress Now that the moment of parting was come Constance in her agitation longed for it to be over She hurriedly wished them adieu and lifted her tearful face last to her father mister Channing laid his hands upon her May God bless my dear child and be her guide and refuge for ever William Yorke it is a treasure of great price that I have given you this day May she be as good a wife as she has been a daughter mister Yorke murmuring a few heartfelt words put Constance into the carriage and they drove away It will be your turn next whispered Hamish to Ellen Huntley who stood watching the departure from one of the windows What Ellen would have said whether she would have given any other answer than that accorded by her blushing cheeks cannot be told The whisper had not been quite so low as Hamish thought it and it was overheard by mister Huntley There may be two words to that bargain mister Hamish Twenty if you like sir responded Hamish promptly so that they be affirmative ones Ellen whispered mister Huntley would you have him with all his gracelessness Ellen seemed ready to fall and her eyes filled Do not joke now papa was all she said Hamish caught her hand and took upon himself the task of soothing her And mister Huntley relapsed into a smile and did not hinder him But some one else was bursting into tears as the sounds testified It proved to be Lady Augusta Yorke A few tears might well be excused to missus Channing on the occasion of parting with her ever loving ever dutiful child but what could Lady Augusta have to cry about Lady Augusta was excessively impulsive as you have long ago learned The happiness of the Channing family in their social relations to each other the loving gentleness of mister and missus Channing with their children the thorough respect affection duty rendered to them by the children in return had struck her more than ever on this morning She was contrasting the young Channings with her own boys and girls and the contrast made her feel very depressed Thus she was just in a condition to go off when the parting came with Constance and the burst took place as she watched the carriage from the door Had any one asked Lady Augusta why she cried she would have been puzzled to state Tell me she suddenly uttered turning and seizing missus Channing s hands what makes the difference between your children and mine My children were not born bad any more than yours were and yet look at the trouble they give me In what does it lie I think said missus Channing quietly and with some hesitation for it was not pleasant to say anything which might tacitly reflect on the Lady Augusta that the difference in most children lies in the bringing up Children turn out well or ill as they are trained and in accordance with this rule they will become our blessing or our grief Ah yes that must be it acquiesced Lady Augusta And yet I don t know she rejoined doubtingly Do you believe that so very much lies in the training It does indeed Lady Augusta God s laws everywhere proclaim it Take a rough diamond from a mine what is it unless you polish it and cut it and set it Do you see its value its beauty in its original state Look at the trees of our fields the flowers and fruits of the earth what are they unless they are pruned and cared for It is by cultivation alone that they can be brought to perfection And if God so made the productions of the earth that it is only by our constant attention and labour that they can be brought to perfection would He think you have us give less care to that far more important product our children s minds They may be trained to perfectness or they may be allowed to run to waste from neglect Oh dear sighed Lady Augusta But it is a dreadful trouble always to be worrying over children It is a trouble that in a very short time after entering upon it grows into a pleasure said missus Channing I am sure that there is not a mother really training her children to good who will not bear me out in the assertion It is a pleasure that they would not be without Take it from them and the most delightful occupation of their lives is gone And think of the reward Were there no higher end to be looked for it would be found in the loving obedience of the children You talk of the trouble Lady Augusta those who would escape trouble with their children should be careful how they train them I think I ll begin at once with mine exclaimed Lady Augusta brightening up A smile crossed missus Channing s lips as she slightly shook her head None knew better than she that training to bear its proper fruit must be begun with a child s earliest years Meanwhile the proctor was holding a conference with mister Channing Presents seem to be the order of the day he was remarking in allusion to sundry pretty offerings which had been made to Constance I think I may as well contribute my mite Why you have done it You gave her a bracelet you know cried Miss Annabel For which abrupt interruption she was forthwith consigned to a distance and ran away to be teased by Tom and Gerald I have something in my pocket which I wish to give to Arthur which I have been intending for some time to give him resumed mister Galloway taking from his pocket what seemed to be a roll of parchment Will you accept them Arthur What sir Your articles Oh mister Galloway No thanks my boy I am in your debt far deeper than I like to be A trifling thing such as this touching the parchment cannot wipe out the suspicion I cast upon you the disgrace which followed it Perhaps at some future time I may be better able to atone for it I hope we shall be together many years Arthur I have no son to succeed to my business and it may be But I will leave that until the future comes It was a valuable present gracefully offered and mister Channing and Arthur so acknowledged it passing over the more important hint in silence Children said mister Channing as the festivities of the day at an end and the guests departed they were gathered together round their fireside bereft of Constance what a forcible lesson of God s mercy ought these last few months to teach us Six months ago there came to us news that our suit was lost other troubles followed upon it and things looked dark and gloomy But I for one never lost my trust in God it was not for a moment shaken and if you are the children I and your mother have striven to bring up you did not lose yours Tom turning suddenly upon him I fear you were the only impatient one Tom looked contrite I fear I was papa What good did the indulgence of your hasty spirit do you No good but harm frankly confessed Tom I hope it has helped me to some notion of patience though for the future papa Ay said mister Channing Hope on strive on work on and trust on I believe that you made those your watchwords as did I And now in an almost unprecedentedly short time we are brought out of our troubles While others equally deserving have to struggle on for years before the cloud is lifted it has pleased God to bring us wonderfully quickly out of ours to heap mercies and blessings and a hopeful future upon us I may truly say He has brought us to great honour and comforted us on every side I HAVE BEEN YOUNG AND NOW AM OLD AND YET SAW I NEVER THE RIGHTEOUS FORSAKEN NOR HIS SEED BEGGING THEIR BREAD End of the Project Gutenberg
