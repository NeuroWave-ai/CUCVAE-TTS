DUNLAP PUBLISHERS NEW YORK COPYRIGHT nineteen oh three BY STEWART EDWARD WHITE COPYRIGHT nineteen oh two BY CURTIS PUBLISHING COMPANY Published March nineteen oh three R CONJUROR S HOUSE Chapter One The girl stood on a bank above a river flowing north At her back crouched a dozen clean whitewashed buildings Before her in interminable journey day after day league on league into remoteness stretched the stern Northern wilderness untrodden save by the trappers the Indians and the beasts Close about the little settlement crept the balsams and spruce the birch and poplar behind which lurked vast dreary muskegs a chaos of bowlder splits the forest The girl had known nothing different for many years Once a summer the sailing ship from England felt its frozen way through the Hudson Straits down the Hudson Bay to drop anchor in the mighty River of the Moose Once a summer a six fathom canoe manned by a dozen paddles struggled down the waters of the broken Abitibi Once a year a little band of red sashed voyageurs forced their exhausted sledge dogs across the ice from some unseen wilderness trail That was all Before her eyes the seasons changed all grim but one by the very pathos of brevity sad In the brief luxuriant summer came the Indians to trade their pelts came the keepers of the winter posts to rest came the ship from England bringing the articles of use or ornament she had ordered a full year before Within a short time all were gone into the wilderness into the great unknown world The snow fell the river and the bay froze Strange men from the North glided silently to the Factor s door bearing the meat and pelts of the seal Bitter iron cold shackled the northland the abode of desolation Armies of caribou drifted by ghostly under the aurora moose lordly and scornful stalked majestically along the shore wolves howled invisible or trotted dog like in organized packs along the river banks Day and night the ice artillery thundered Night and day the fireplaces roared defiance to a frost they could not subdue while the people of desolation crouched beneath the tyranny of winter Then the upheaval of spring with the ice jams and terrors the Moose roaring by untamable the torrents rising rising foot by foot to the very dooryard of her father s house Strange spirits were abroad at night howling shrieking cracking and groaning in voices of ice and flood Her Indian nurse told her of them all of Maunabosho the good of Nenaubosho the evil in her lisping Ojibway dialect that sounded like the softer voices of the forest At last the sudden subsidence of the waters the splendid eager blossoming of the land into new leaves lush grasses an abandon of sweetbrier and hepatica The air blew soft a thousand singing birds sprang from the soil the wild goose cried in triumph Overhead shone the hot sun of the Northern summer From the wilderness came the brigades bearing their pelts the hardy traders of the winter posts striking hot the imagination through the mysterious and lonely allurement of their callings For a brief season transient as the flash of a loon s wing on the shadow of a lake the post was bright with the thronging of many people The Indians pitched their wigwams on the broad meadows below the bend the half breeds sauntered about flashing bright teeth and wicked dark eyes at whom it might concern the traders gazed stolidily over their little black pipes and uttered brief sentences through their thick black beards Everywhere was gay sound the fiddle the laugh the song everywhere was gay color the red sashes of the voyageurs the beaded moccasins and leggings of the metis the capotes of the brigade the variegated costumes of the Crees and Ojibways Like the wild roses around the edge of the muskegs this brief flowering of the year passed Again the nights were long again the frost crept down from the eternal snow again the wolves howled across barren wastes Just now the girl stood ankle deep in green grasses a bath of sunlight falling about her a tingle of salt wind humming up the river from the bay s offing She was clad in gray wool and wore no hat Her soft hair the color of ripe wheat blew about her temples shadowing eyes of fathomless black The wind had brought to the light and delicate brown of her complexion a trace of color to match her lips whose scarlet did not fade after the ordinary and imperceptible manner into the tinge of her skin but continued vivid to the very edge her eyes were wide and unseeing One hand rested idly on the breech of an ornamented bronze field gun mc donald the chief trader passed from the house to the store where his bartering with the Indians was daily carried on the other Scotchman in the Post Galen Albret her father and the head Factor of all this region paced back and forth across the veranda of the factory caressing his white beard up by the stockade young Achille Picard tuned his whistle to the note of the curlew across the meadow from the church wandered Crane the little Church of England missionary peering from short sighted pale blue eyes beyond the coulee Sarnier and his Indians chock chock chocked away at the seams of the long coast trading bateau The girl saw nothing heard nothing She was dreaming she was trying to remember In the lines of her slight figure in its pose there by the old gun over the old old river was the grace of gentle blood the pride of caste Of all this region her father was the absolute lord feared loved obeyed by all its human creatures When he went abroad he travelled in a state almost mediaeval in its magnificence when he stopped at home men came to him from the Albany the Kenogami the Missinaibe the Mattagami the Abitibi from all the rivers of the North to receive his commands Way was made for him his lightest word was attended In his house dwelt ceremony and of his house she was the princess Unconsciously she had taken the gracious habit of command She had come to value her smile her word to value herself The lady of a realm greater than the countries of Europe she moved serene pure lofty amid dependants And as the lady of this realm she did honor to her father s guests sitting stately behind the beautiful silver service below the portrait of the Company s greatest explorer Sir George Simpson dispensing crude fare in gracious manner listening silently to the conversation finally withdrawing at the last with a sweeping courtesy to play soft melancholy and world forgotten airs on the old piano brought over years before by the Lady Head while the guests made merry with the mellow port and ripe Manila cigars which the Company supplied its servants Then coffee still with her natural Old World charm of the grande dame Such guests were not many nor came often There was McTavish of Rupert s House a three days journey to the northeast Rand of Fort Albany a week s travel to the northwest Mault of Fort George ten days beyond either all grizzled in the Company s service With them came their clerks mostly English and Scotch younger sons with a vast respect for the Company and a vaster for their Factor s daughter Once in two or three years appeared the inspectors from Winnipeg true lords of the North with their six fathom canoes their luxurious furs their red banners trailing like gonfalons in the water Then this post of Conjuror s House feasted and danced undertook gay excursions discussed in public or private conclave weighty matters grave and reverend advices cautions and commands They went Desolation again crept in The girl dreamed She was trying to remember Far off half forgotten visions of brave courtly men of gracious beautiful women peopled the clouds of her imaginings She heard them again as voices beneath the roar of rapids like far away bells tinkling faintly through a wind pitying her exclaiming over her she saw them dim and changing as wraiths of a fog as shadow pictures in a mist beneath the moon leaning to her with bright shining eyes full of compassion for the little girl who was to go so far away into an unknown land she felt them as the touch of a breeze when the night is still fondling her clasping her tossing her aloft in farewell One she felt plainly a gallant youth who held her up for all to see One she saw clearly a dewy eyed lovely woman who murmured loving broken words One she heard distinctly a gentle voice that said God s love be with you little one for you have far to go and many days to pass before you see Quebec again And the girl s eyes suddenly swam bright for the northland was very dreary She threw her palms out in a gesture of weariness Then her arms dropped her eyes widened her head bent forward in the attitude of listening Achille she called Achille Come here The young fellow approached respectfully Mademoiselle he asked Don t you hear she said Faint between intermittent silences came the singing of men s voices from the south Grace a Dieu cried Achille Eet is so Eet is dat brigade He ran shouting toward the factory Chapter Two Men women dogs children sprang into sight from nowhere and ran pell mell to the two cannon Galen Albret reappearing from the factory began to issue orders Two men set about hoisting on the tall flag staff the blood red banner of the Company Speculation excited and earnest arose among the men as to which of the branches of the Moose this brigade had hunted the Abitibi the Mattagami or the Missinaibie The half breed women shaded their eyes missus Cockburn the doctor s wife and the only other white woman in the settlement came and stood by Virginia Albret s side Wishkobun the Ojibway woman from the south country and Virginia s devoted familiar took her half jealous stand on the other It is the same every year We always like to see them come said missus Cockburn in her monotonous low voice of resignation Yes replied Virginia moving a little impatiently for she anticipated eagerly the picturesque coming of these men of the Silent Places and wished to savor the pleasure undistracted Mi di mo yay ka win ni shi shin said Wishkobun quietly Ae replied Virginia with a little laugh patting the woman s brown hand A shout arose Around the bend shot a canoe At once every paddle in it was raised to a perpendicular salute then all together dashed into the water with the full strength of the voyageurs wielding them The canoe fairly leaped through the cloud of spray Another rounded the bend another double row of paddles flashed in the sunlight another crew broke into a tumult of rapid exertion as they raced the last quarter mile of the long journey A third burst into view a fourth a fifth The silent river was alive with motion glittering with color The canoes swept onward like race horses straining against the rider Now the spectators could make out plainly the boatmen It could be seen that they had decked themselves out for the occasion Their heads were bound with bright colored fillets their necks with gay scarves The paddles were adorned with gaudy woollen streamers New leggings of holiday pattern were intermittently visible on the bowsmen and steersmen as they half rose to give added force to their efforts At first the men sang their canoe songs but as the swift rush of the birch barks brought them almost to their journey s end they burst into wild shrieks and whoops of delight All at once they were close to hand The steersman rose to throw his entire weight on the paddle The canoe swung abruptly for the shore Those in it did not relax their exertions but continued their vigorous strokes until within a few yards of apparent destruction Hola hola they cried thrusting their paddles straight down into the water with a strong backward twist The stout wood bent and cracked The canoe stopped short and the voyageurs leaped ashore to be swallowed up in the crowd that swarmed down upon them The races were about equally divided and each acted after its instincts the Indian greeting his people quietly and stalking away to the privacy of his wigwam the more volatile white catching his wife or his sweetheart or his child to his arms A swarm of Indian women and half grown children set about unloading the canoes Virginia s eyes ran over the crews of the various craft She recognized them all of course to the last Indian packer for in so small a community the personality and doings of even the humblest members are well known to everyone Long since she had identified the brigade It was of the Missinaibie the great river whose head waters rise a scant hundred feet from those that flow as many miles south into Lake Superior It drains a wild and rugged country whose forests cling to bowlder hills whose streams issue from deep riven gorges where for many years the big gray wolves had gathered in unusual abundance She knew by heart the winter posts although she had never seen them She could imagine the isolation of such a place and the intense loneliness of the solitary man condemned to live through the dark Northern winters seeing no one but the rare Indians who might come in to trade with him for their pelts She could appreciate the wild joy of a return for a brief season to the company of fellow men When her glance fell upon the last of the canoes it rested with a flash of surprise The craft was still floating idly its bow barely caught against the bank The crew had deserted but amidships among the packages of pelts and duffel sat a stranger The canoe was that of the post at Kettle Portage She saw the stranger to be a young man with a clean cut face a trim athletic figure dressed in the complete costume of the voyageurs and thin brown and muscular hands When the canoe touched the bank he had taken no part in the scramble to shore and so had sat forgotten and unnoticed save by the girl his figure erect with something of the Indian s stoical indifference Then when for a moment he imagined himself free from observation his expression abruptly changed His hands clenched tense between his buckskin knees his eyes glanced here and there restlessly and an indefinable shadow of something which Virginia felt herself obtuse in labelling desperation and yet to which she discovered it impossible to fit a name descended on his features darkening them Twice he glanced away to the south Twice he ran his eye over the vociferating crowd on the narrow beach Absorbed in the silent drama of a man s unguarded expression Virginia leaned forward eagerly In some vague manner it was borne in on her that once before she had experienced the same emotion had come into contact with someone something that had affected her emotionally just as this man did now But she could not place it Over and over again she forced her mind to the very point of recollection but always it slipped back again from the verge of attainment Then a little movement some thrust forward of the head some nervous rapid shifting of the hands or feet some unconscious poise of the shoulders brought the scene flashing before her the white snow the still forest the little square pen trap the wolverine desperate but cool thrusting its blunt nose quickly here and there in baffled hope of an orifice of escape Somehow the man reminded her of the animal the fierce little woods marauder trapped and hopeless but scorning to cower as would the gentler creatures of the forest Abruptly his expression changed again His figure stiffened the muscles of his face turned iron Virginia saw that someone on the beach had pointed toward him His mask was on The first burst of greeting was over Here and there one or another of the brigade members jerked their heads in the stranger s direction explaining low voiced to their companions Soon all eyes turned curiously toward the canoe A hum of low voiced comment took the place of louder delight The stranger finding himself generally observed rose slowly to his feet picked his way with a certain exaggerated deliberation of movement over the duffel lying in the bottom of the canoe until he reached the bow where he paused one foot lifted to the gunwale just above the emblem of the painted star Immediately a dead silence fell Groups shifted drew apart and together again like the slow agglomeration of sawdust on the surface of water until at last they formed in a semicircle of staring whose centre was the bow of the canoe and the stranger from Kettle Portage The men scowled the women regarded him with a half fearful curiosity Virginia Albret shivered in the shock of this sudden electric polarity The man seemed alone against a sullen unexplained hostility The desperation she had thought to read but a moment before had vanished utterly leaving in its place a scornful indifference and perhaps more than a trace of recklessness He was ripe for an outbreak She did not in the least understand but she knew it from the depths of her woman s instinct and unconsciously her sympathies flowed out to this man alone without a greeting where all others came to their own For perhaps a full sixty seconds the new comer stood uncertain what he should do or perhaps waiting for some word or act to tip the balance of his decision One after another those on shore felt the insolence of his stare and shifted uneasily Then his deliberate scrutiny rose to the group by the cannon Virginia caught her breath sharply In spite of herself she could not turn away The stranger s eye crossed her own She saw the hard look fade into pleased surprise Instantly his hat swept the gunwale of the canoe He stepped magnificently ashore The crisis was over Not a word had been spoken Chapter Three Galen Albret sat in his rough hewn arm chair at the head of the table receiving the reports of his captains The long narrow room opened before him heavy raftered massive white with a cavernous fireplace at either end Above him frowned Sir George s portrait at his right hand and his left stretched the row of home made heavy chairs finished smooth and dull by two centuries of use His arms were laid along the arms of his seat his shaggy head was sunk forward until his beard swept the curve of his big chest the heavy tufts of hair above his eyes were drawn steadily together in a frown of attention One after another the men arose and spoke He made no movement gave no sign his short powerful form blotted against the lighter silhouette of his chair only his eyes and the white of his beard gleaming out of the dusk Kern of Old Brunswick House Achard of New Ki wa nee the Indian of Flying Post these and others told briefly of many things each in his own language To all Galen Albret listened in silence Finally Louis Placide from the post at Kettle Portage got to his feet He too reported of the trade so many beaver of tobacco of powder of lead of pork of flour of tea given in exchange so many mink otter beaver ermine marten and fisher pelts taken in return Then he paused and went on at greater length in regard to the stranger speaking evenly but with emphasis When he had finished Galen Albret struck a bell at his elbow Me en gan the bowsman of the Factor s canoe entered followed closely by the young man who had that afternoon arrived He was dressed still in his costume of the voyageur the loose blouse shirt the buckskin leggings and moccasins the long tasselled red sash His head was as high and his glance as free but now the steel blue of his eye had become steady and wary and two faint lines had traced themselves between his brows At his entrance a hush of expectation fell Galen Albret did not stir but the others hitched nearer the long narrow table and two or three leaned both elbows on it the better to catch what should ensue Me en gan stopped by the door but the stranger walked steadily the length of the room until he faced the Factor Then he paused and waited collectedly for the other to speak This the Factor did not at once begin to do but sat impassive apparently without thought while the heavy breathing of the men in the room marked off the seconds of time Finally abruptly Galen Albret s cavernous voice boomed forth Something there was strangely mysterious cryptic in the virile tones issuing from a bulk so massive and inert Galen Albret did not move did not even raise the heavy lidded dull stare of his eyes to the young man who stood before him hardly did his broad arched chest seem to rise and fall with the respiration of speech and yet each separate word leaped forth alive instinct with authority Once at Leftfoot Lake two Indians caught you asleep he pronounced They took your pelts and arms and escorted you to Sudbury They were my Indians Once on the upper Abitibi you were stopped by a man named Herbert who warned you from the country after relieving you of your entire outfit He told you on parting what you might expect if you should repeat the attempt severe measures the severest Herbert was my man Now Louis Placide surprises you in a rapids near Kettle Portage and brings you here During the slow delivering of these accurately spaced words the attitude of the men about the long narrow table gradually changed Their curiosity had been great before but now their intellectual interest was awakened for these were facts of which Louis Placide s statement had given no inkling Before them for the dealing was a problem of the sort whose solution had earned for Galen Albret a reputation in the north country They glanced at one another to obtain the sympathy of attention then back toward their chief in anxious expectation of his next words The stranger however remained unmoved A faint smile had sketched the outline of his lips when first the Factor began to speak This smile he maintained to the end As the older man paused he shrugged his shoulders All of that is quite true he admitted Even the unimaginative men of the Silent Places started at these simple words and vouchsafed to their speaker a more sympathetic attention For the tones in which they were delivered possessed that deep rich throat timbre which so often means power personal magnetism deep from the chest with vibrant throat tones suggesting a volume of sound which may in fact be only hinted by the loudness the man at the moment sees fit to employ Such a voice is a responsive instrument on which emotion and mood play wonderfully seductive strains All of that is quite true he repeated after a second s pause but what has it to do with me Why am I stopped and sent out from the free forest I am really curious to know your excuse This replied Galen Albret weightily is my domain I tolerate no rivalry here Your right demanded the young man briefly I have made the trade and I intend to keep it In other words the strength of your good right arm supplemented the stranger with the faintest hint of a sneer That is neither here nor there rejoined Galen Albret the point is that I intend to keep it I ve had you sent out but you have been too stupid or too obstinate to take the hint Now I have to warn you in person I shall send you out once more but this time you must promise me not to meddle with the trade again He paused for a response The young man s smile merely became accentuated I have means of making my wishes felt warned the Factor Quite so replied the young man deliberately La Longue Traverse At this unexpected pronouncement of that dread name two of the men swore violently the others thrust back their chairs and sat their arms rigidly braced against the table s edge staring wide eyed and open mouthed at the speaker Only Galen Albret remained unmoved What do you mean by that he asked calmly It amuses you to be ignorant replied the stranger with some contempt Don t you think this farce is about played out I do If you think you re deceiving me any with this show of formality you re mightily mistaken Don t you suppose I knew what I was about when I came into this country Don t you suppose I had weighed the risks and had made up my mind to take my medicine if I should be caught Your methods are not quite so secret as you imagine I know perfectly well what happens to Free Traders in Rupert s Land You seem very certain of your information Your men seem equally so pointed out the stranger Galen Albret at the beginning of the young man s longer speech had sunk almost immediately into his passive calm the calm of great elemental bodies the calm of a force so vast as to rest motionless by the very static power of its mass When he spoke again it was in the tentative manner of his earlier interrogatory committing himself not at all seeking to plumb his opponent s knowledge Why if you have realized the gravity of your situation have you persisted after having been twice warned he inquired Because you re not the boss of creation replied the young man bluntly Galen Albret merely raised his eyebrows Illustration THE ARRIVAL OF THE FREE TRADER Scene from the play I ve got as much business in this country as you have continued the young man his tone becoming more incisive You don t seem to realize that your charter of monopoly has expired If the government was worth a damn it would see to you fellows You have no more right to order me out of here than I would have to order you out Suppose some old Husky up on Whale River should send you word that you weren t to trap in the Whale River district next winter I ll bet you d be there You Hudson Bay men tried the same game out west It didn t work You ask your western men if they ever heard of Ned Trent Your success does not seem to have followed you here suggested the Factor ironically The young man smiled This Longue Traverse went on Albret what is your idea there I have heard something of it What is your information Ned Trent laughed outright You don t imagine there is any secret about that he marvelled Why every child north of the Line knows that You will send me away without arms and with but a handful of provisions If the wilderness and starvation fail your runners will not I shall never reach the Temiscamingues alive The same old legend commented Galen Albret in apparent amusement I heard it when I first came to this country You ll find a dozen such in every Indian camp Jo Bagneau Morris Proctor John May William Jarvis checked off the young man on his fingers Personal enmity replied the Factor He glanced up to meet the young man s steady sceptical smile You do not believe me Oh if it amuses you conceded the stranger The thing is not even worth discussion Remarkable sensation among our friends here for so idle a tale Galen Albret considered You will remember that throughout you have forced this interview he pointed out Now I must ask your definite promise to get out of this country and to stay out No replied Ned Trent Then a means shall be found to make you threatened the Factor his anger blazing at last Ah said the stranger softly Galen Albret raised his hand and let it fall The bronzed and gaudily bedecked men filed out Chapter Four In the open air the men separated in quest of their various families or friends The stranger lingered undecided for a moment on the top step of the veranda and then wandered down the little street if street it could be called where horses there were none On the left ranged the square whitewashed houses with their dooryards the old church the workshop To the right was a broad grass plot and then the Moose slipping by to the distant offing Over a little bridge the stranger idled looking curiously about him The great trading house attracted his attention with its narrow picket lane leading to the door the storehouse surrounded by a protective log fence the fort itself a medley of heavy timbered stockades and square block houses After a moment he resumed his strolling Everywhere he went the people looked at him ceasing their varied occupations No one spoke to him no one hindered him To all intents and purposes he was as free as the air But all about the island flowed the barrier of the Moose and beyond frowned the wilderness strong as iron bars to an unarmed man Brooding on his imprisonment the Free Trader forgot his surroundings The post the river the forest the distant bay faded from his sight and he fell into deep reflection There remained nothing of physical consciousness but a sense of the grateful spring warmth from the declining sun At length he became vaguely aware of something else He glanced up Right by him he saw a handsome French half breed sprawled out in the sun against a building looking him straight in the face and flashing up at him a friendly smile Hullo said Achille Picard you mus been sleep I call you two t ree tam The prisoner seemed to find something grateful in the greeting even from the enemy s camp Perhaps it merely happened upon the psychological moment for a response Hullo he returned and seated himself by the man s side lazily stretching himself in enjoyment of the reflected heat You is come off Kettle Portage eh said Achille I t ink so You is come trade dose fur Eet is bad beez ness dis Conjur House Ole man he no lak dat you trade dose fur He s very hard dat ole man Yes replied the stranger he has got to be I suppose This

then urged Ned Trent with some impatience A thousand dollars I ll give you With that you can be rich somewhere else But the man was becoming more and more uneasy glancing furtively from left to right and back again in an evident panic lest the conversation be overheard although the nearest dwelling house was a score of yards distant Hush he whispered You mustn t talk lak dat Dose ole man fin you

Chapter Five Having sat buried in thought for a full five minutes after the traders of the winter posts had left him Galen Albret thrust back his chair and walked into a room long low and heavily raftered strikingly unlike the Council Room Its floor was overlaid with dark rugs a piano of ancient model filled one corner pictures and books broke the wall the lamps and the windows were shaded a woman s work basket and a tea set occupied a large table Only a certain barbaric profusion of furs the huge fireplace and the rough rafters of the ceiling differentiated the place from the drawing room of a well to do family anywhere Galen Albret sank heavily into a chair and struck a bell A tall slightly stooped English servant with correct side whiskers and incompetent watery blue eyes answered To him said the Factor I wish to see Miss Albret A moment later Virginia entered the room Let us have some tea O mi mi requested her father The girl moved gently about preparing and lighting the lamp measuring the tea her fair head bowed gracefully over her task her dark eyes pensive and but half following what she did Finally with a certain air of decision she seated herself on the arm of a chair Father said she Yes A stranger came to day with Louis Placide of Kettle Portage Well He was treated strangely by our people and he treated them strangely in return Why is that Who can tell What is his station Is he a common trader He does not look it He is a man of intelligence and daring Then why is he not our guest Galen Albret did not answer After a moment s pause he asked again for his tea The girl turned away impatiently Here was a puzzle neither the voyageurs nor Wishkobun her nurse nor her father would explain to her The first had grinned stupidly the second had drawn her shawl across her face the third asked for tea She handed her father the cup hesitated then ventured to inquire whether she was forbidden to greet the stranger should the occasion arise He is a gentleman replied her father She sipped her tea thoughtfully her imagination stirring Again her recollection lingered over the clear bronze lines of the stranger s face Something vaguely familiar seemed to touch her consciousness with ghostly fingers She closed her eyes and tried to clutch them At once they were withdrawn And then again when her attention wandered they stole back plucking appealingly at the hem of her recollections The room was heavy curtained deep embrasured for the house beneath its clap boards was of logs Although out of doors the clear spring sunshine still flooded the valley of the Moose within the shadows had begun with velvet fingers to extinguish the brighter lights Virginia threw herself back on a chair in the corner Virginia said Galen Albret suddenly Yes father You are no longer a child but a woman Would you like to go to Quebec She did not answer him at once but pondered beneath close knit brows Do you wish me to go father she asked at length You are eighteen It is time you saw the world time you learned the ways of other people But the journey is hard I may not see you again for some years You go among strangers He fell silent again Motionless he had been except for the mumbling of his lips beneath his beard It shall be just as you wish he added a moment later At once a conflict arose in the girl s mind between her restless dreams and her affections But beneath all the glitter of the question there was really nothing to take her out Here was her father here were the things she loved yonder was novelty and loneliness Her existence at Conjuror s House was perhaps a little complex but it was familiar She knew the people and she took a daily and unwearying delight in the kindness and simplicity of their bearing toward herself Each detail of life came to her in the round of habit wearing the garment of accustomed use But of the world she knew nothing except what she had been able to body forth from her reading and that had merely given her imagination something tangible with which to feed her self distrust Must I decide at once she asked If you go this year it must be with the Abitibi brigade You have until then Thank you father said the girl sweetly The shadows stole their surroundings one by one until only the bright silver of the tea service and the glitter of polished wood and the square of the open door remained Galen Albret became an inert dark mass Virginia s gray was lost in that of the twilight Time passed The clock ticked on Faintly sounds penetrated from the kitchen and still more faintly from out of doors Then the rectangle of the doorway was darkened by a man peering uncertainly The man wore his hat from which slanted a slender heron s plume his shoulders were square his thighs slim and graceful Against the light one caught the outline of the sash s tassel and the fringe of his leggings

none	none	there Galen Albret he challenged The spell of twilight mystery broke It seemed as if suddenly the air had become surcharged with the vitality of opposition What then countered the Factor s heavy deliberate tones True I see you now rejoined the visitor carelessly as he flung himself across the arm of a chair and swung one foot I do not doubt you are convinced by this time of my intention My recollection does not tell me what messenger I sent to ask this interview Illustration WHAT YOU WANT DOESN T CONCERN ME IN THE LEAST Scene from the play Correct laughed the young man a little hardly You didn t ask it I attended to that myself What you want doesn t concern me in the least What do you suppose I care what or what not any of this crew wants I m master of my own ideas anyway thank God If you don t like what I do you can always stop me In the tone of his voice was a distinct challenge Galen Albret it seemed chose to pass it by True he replied sombrely after a barely perceptible pause to mark his tacit displeasure It is your hour Say on I should like to know the date at which I take la Longue Traverse You persist in that nonsense Call my departure whatever you want to I have the name for it When do I leave I have not decided And in the meantime Do as you please Ah thanks for this generosity cried the young man in a tone of declamatory sarcasm so artificial as fairly to scent the elocutionary To do as I please here now there s a blessed privilege I may walk around where I want to talk to such as have a good word for me punish those who have not But do I err in concluding that the state of your game law is such that it would be useless to reclaim my rifle from the engaging Placide You have a fine instinct approved the Factor It is one of my valued possessions rejoined the young man insolently He struck a match and by its light selected a cigarette I do not myself use tobacco in this room suggested the older speaker I am curious to learn the limits of your forbearance replied the younger proceeding to smoke He threw back his head and regarded his opponent with an open challenge daring him to become angry The match went out Virginia who had listened in growing anger and astonishment unable longer to refrain from defending the dignity of her usually autocratic father although he seemed little disposed to defend himself now intervened from her dark corner on the divan Is the journey then so long sir she asked composedly that it at once inspires such anticipations and such bitterness In an instant the man was on his feet hat in hand and the cigarette had described a fiery curve into the empty hearth I beg your pardon sincerely he cried I did not know you were here You might better apologize to my father replied Virginia The young man stepped forward and without asking permission lighted one of the tall lamps The lady of the guns he marvelled softly to himself He moved across the room looking down on her inscrutably while she looked up at him in composed expectation of an apology and Galen Albret sat motionless in the shadow of his great arm chair But after a moment her calm attention broke down Something there was about this man that stirred her emotions whether of curiosity pity indignation or a slight defensive fear she was not introspective enough to care to inquire And yet the sensation was not altogether unpleasant and as at the guns that afternoon a certain portion of her consciousness remained in sympathy with whatever it was of mysterious attraction he represented to her In him she felt the dominant as a wild creature of the woods instinctively senses the master and drops its eyes Resentment did not leave her but over it spread a film of confusion that robbed it of its potency In him in his mood in his words in his manner was something that called out in direct appeal the more primitive instincts hitherto dormant beneath her sense of maidenhood so that even at this vexed moment of conscious opposition her heart was ranging itself on his side Overpoweringly the feeling swept her that she was not acting in accordance with her sense of fitness She knew she should strike but was unable to give due force to the blow In the confusion of such a discovery her eyelids fluttered and fell And he saw and understanding his power dropped swiftly beside her on the broad divan You must pardon me mademoiselle he begun his voice sinking to a depth of rich music singularly caressing To you I may seem to have small excuses but when a man is vouchsafed a glimpse of heaven only to be cast out the next instant into hell he is not always particular in the choice of words All the time his eyes sought hers which avoided the challenge and the strong masculine charm of magnetism which he possessed in such vital abundance overwhelmed her unaccustomed consciousness Galen Albret shifted uneasily and shot a glance in their direction The stranger perceiving this lowered his voice in register and tone and went on with almost exaggerated earnestness Surely you can forgive me a desperate man almost anything I do not understand said Virginia with a palpable effort Ned Trent leaned forward until his eager face was almost at her shoulder Perhaps not he urged I cannot ask you to try But suppose mademoiselle you were in my case Suppose your eyes like mine have rested on nothing but a howling wilderness for dear heaven knows how long you come at last in sight of real houses real grass real dooryard gardens just ready to blossom in the spring real food real beds real books real men with whom to exchange the sensible word and something more mademoiselle a woman such as one dreams of in the long forest nights under the stars And you know that while others the lucky ones may stay to enjoy it all you the unfortunate are condemned to leave it at any moment for la Longue Traverse Would not you too be bitter mademoiselle Would not you too mock and sneer Think mademoiselle I have not even the little satisfaction of rousing men s anger I can insult them as I will but they turn aside in pity saying one to another Let us pleasure him in this poor fellow for he is about to take la Longue Traverse That is why your father accepts calmly from me what he would not from another Virginia sat bolt upright on the divan her hands clasped in her lap her wonderful black eyes looking straight out before her trying to avoid her companion s insistent gaze His attention was fixed on her mobile and changing countenance but he marked with evident satisfaction Galen Albret s growing uneasiness This was evidenced only by a shifting of the feet a tapping of the fingers a turning of the shaggy head in such a man slight tokens are significant The silence deepened with the shadows drawing about the single lamp while Virginia attempted to maintain a breathing advantage above the flood of strange emotions which the personality of this man had swept down upon her It does not seem objected the girl in bewilderment I do not know men are often out in this country for years at a time Long journeys are not unknown among us We are used to undertaking them But not la Longue Traverse insisted the young man sombrely La Longue Traverse she repeated in sweet perplexity Sometimes called the Journey of Death he explained She turned to look him in the eyes a vague expression of puzzled fear on her face She has never heard of it said Ned Trent to himself and aloud Men who undertake it leave comfort behind They embrace hunger and weariness cold and disease At the last they embrace death and are glad of his coming Something in his tone compelled belief something in his face told her that he was a man by whom the inevitable hardships of winter and summer travel fearful as they are would be lightly endured She shuddered This dreadful thing is necessary she asked Alas yes I do not understand In the North few of us understand agreed the young man with a hint of bitterness seeping through his voice The mighty order and so we obey But that is beside the point I have not told you these things to harrow you I have tried to excuse myself for my actions Does it touch you a little Am I forgiven I do not understand how such things can be she objected in some confusion why such journeys must exist My mind cannot comprehend your explanations The stranger leaned forward abruptly his eyes blazing with the magnetic personality of the man But your heart he breathed It was the moment My heart she repeated as though bewildered by the intensity of his eyes my heart ah yes Immediately the blood rushed over her face and throat in a torrent She snatched her eyes away and cowered back in the corner going red and white by turns now angry now frightened now bewildered until his gaze half masterful half pleading again conquered hers Galen Albret had ceased tapping his chair In the dim light he sat staring straight before him massive inert grim I believe you she murmured hurriedly at last I pity you She rose Quick as light he barred her passage Don t don t she pleaded I must go you have shaken me I I do not understand myself I must see you again he whispered eagerly To night by the guns No no To night he insisted She raised her eyes to his this time naked of defence so that the man saw down through their depths into her very soul Oh she begged quivering let me pass Don t you see I m going to cry Chapter Six For a moment Ned Trent stared through the darkness into which Virginia had disappeared Then he turned a troubled face to the task he had set himself for the unexpectedly pathetic results of his fantastic attempt had shaken him Twice he half turned as though to follow her Then shaking his shoulders he bent his attention to the old man in the shadow of the chair He was given no opportunity for further speech however for at the sound of the closing door Galen Albret s impassivity had fallen from him He sprang to his feet The whole aspect of the man suddenly became electric terrible His eyes blazed his heavy brows drew spasmodically toward each other his jaws worked twisting his beard into strange contortions his massive frame straightened formidably and his voice rumbled from the arch of his deep chest in a torrent of passionate sound By God young man he thundered you go too far Take heed I will not stand this Do not you presume to make love to my daughter before my eyes And Ned Trent just within the dusky circle of lamplight where the bold sneering lines of his face stood out in relief against the twilight of the room threw back his head and laughed It was a clear laugh but low and in it were all the devils of triumph and of insolence Where the studied insult of words had failed this single cachinnation succeeded The Trader saw his opponent s eyes narrow For a moment he thought the Factor was about to spring on him Then with an effort that blackened his face with blood Galen Albret controlled himself and fell to striking the call bell violently and repeatedly with the palm of his hand After a moment Matthews the English servant came running in To him the Factor was at first physically unable to utter a syllable Then finally he managed to ejaculate the name of his bowsman with such violence of gesture that the frightened servant comprehended by sheer force of terror and ran out again in search of Me en gan This supreme effort seemed to clear the way for speech Galen Albret began to address his opponent hoarsely in quick disjointed sentences a gasp for breath between each You revived an old legend la Longue Traverse the myth It shall be real to you I will make it so By God you shall not defy me Ned Trent smiled You do not deceive me he rejoined coolly Silence cried the Factor Silence You shall speak no more You have said enough Me en gan glided into the room Galen Albret at once addressed him in the Ojibway language gaining control of himself as he went on Listen to me well he commanded You shall make a count of all rifles in this place at once Let no one furnish this man with food or arms You know the story of la Longue Traverse This man shall take it So inform my people I the Factor decree it so Prepare all things at once understand at once Ned Trent waited to hear no more but sauntered from the room whistling gayly a boatman s song His point was gained Outside the long Northern twilight with its beautiful shadows of crimson was descending from the upper regions of the east A light wind breathed up river from the bay The Free Trader drew his lungs full of the evening air Just the same I think she will come said he to himself La Longue Traverse even at once is a pretty slim chance But this second string to my bow is better I believe I ll get the rifle if she comes Chapter Seven Virginia ran quickly up the narrow stairs to her own room where she threw herself on the bed and buried her face in the pillows As she had said she was very much shaken And too she was afraid She could not understand Heretofore she had moved among the men around her pure lofty serene Now at one blow all this crumbled The stranger had outraged her finer feelings He had insulted her father in her very presence for this she was angry He had insulted herself for this she was afraid He had demanded that she meet him again but this at least in the manner he had suggested should not happen And yet she confessed to herself a delicious wonder as to what he would do next and a vague desire to see him again in order to find out That she could not successfully combat this feeling made her angry at herself And so in mingled fear pride anger and longing she remained until Wishkobun the Indian woman glided in to dress her for the dinner whose formality she and her father consistently maintained She fell to talking the soft Ojibway dialect and in the conversation forgot some of her emotion and regained some of her calm Her surface thoughts at least were compelled for the moment to occupy themselves with other things The Indian woman had to tell her of the silver fox brought in by Mu hi ken an Indian of her own tribe of the retort Achille Picard had made when MacLane had taunted him of the forest fire that had declared itself far to the east and of the theories to account for it where no campers had been Yet underneath the rambling chatter Virginia was aware of something new in her consciousness something delicious but as yet vague In the gayest moment of her half jesting half affectionate gossip with the Indian woman she felt its uplift catching her breath from beneath so that for the tiniest instant she would pause as though in readiness for some message which nevertheless delayed A fresh delight in the present moment held her a fresh anticipation of the immediate future though both delight and anticipation were based on something without her knowledge That would come later The sound of rapid footsteps echoed across the lower hall a whistle ran into an air sung gayly with spirit J ai perdu ma maitresse Sans l avoir merite Pour un bouquet de roses Que je lui refusai Li ya longtemps que je t aime Jamais je ne t oublierai She fell abruptly silent and spoke no more until she descended to the council room where the table was now spread for dinner Two silver candlesticks lit the place The men were waiting for her when she entered and at once took their seats in the worn rude chairs White linen and glittering silver adorned the service Galen Albret occupied one end of the table Virginia the other On either side were Doctor and missus Cockburn mc donald the Chief Trader Richardson the clerk and Crane the missionary of the Church of England Matthews served with rigid precision in the order of importance first the Factor then Virginia then the doctor his wife mc donald the clerk and Crane in due order On entering a room the same precedence would have held good Thus these people six hundred miles as the crow flies from the nearest settlement maintained their shadowy hold on civilization The glass was fine the silver massive the linen dainty Matthews waited faultlessly but overhead hung the rough timbers of the wilderness post across the river faintly could be heard the howling of wolves The fare was rice curry salt pork potatoes and beans for at this season the game was poor and the fish hardly yet running with regularity Throughout the meal Virginia sat in a singular abstraction No conscious thoughts took shape in her mind but nevertheless she seemed to herself to be occupied in considering weighty matters When directly addressed she answered sweetly Much of the time she studied her father s face She found it old Those lines were already evident which when first noted bring a stab of surprised pain to the breast of a child the droop of the mouth the wrinkling of the temples the patient weariness of the eyes Virginia s own eyes filled with tears The subjective passive state into which a newly born but not yet recognized love had cast her inclined her to gentleness She accepted facts as they came to her For the moment she forgot the mere happenings of the day and lived only in the resulting mood of them all The new comer inspired her no longer with anger nor sorrow attraction nor fear Her active emotions in abeyance she floated dreamily on the clouds of a new estate This very aloofness of spirit disinclined her for the company of the others after the meal was finished The Factor closeted himself with Richardson The doctor lighting a cheroot took his way across to his infirmary mc donald Crane and missus Cockburn entered the drawing room and seated themselves near the piano Virginia hesitated then threw a shawl over her head and stepped out on the broad veranda At once the vast splendid beauty of the Northern night broke over her soul Straight before her gleamed and flashed and ebbed and palpitated the aurora One moment its long arms shot beyond the zenith the next it had broken and rippled back like a brook of light to its arch over the Great Bear Never for an instant was it still Its restlessness stole away the quiet of the evening but left it magnificent In comparison with this coruscating dome of the infinite the earth had shrunken to a narrow black band of velvet in which was nothing distinguishable until suddenly the sky line broke in calm silhouettes of spruce and firs And always the mighty River of the Moose gleaming jewelled barbaric in its reflections slipped by to the sea So rapid and bewildering was the motion of these two great powers the river and the sky that the imagination could not believe in silence It was as though the earth were full of shoutings and of tumults And yet in reality the night was as still as a tropical evening The wolves and the sledge dogs answered each other undisturbed the beautiful songs of the white throats stole from the forest as divinely instinct as ever with the spirit of peace Virginia leaned against the railing and looked upon it all Her heart was big with emotions many of which she could not name her eyes were full of tears Something had changed in her since yesterday but she did not know what it was The faint wise stars the pale moon just sinking the gentle south breeze could have told her for they are old old in the world s affairs Occasionally a flash more than ordinarily brilliant would glint one of the bronze guns beneath the flag staff Then Virginia s heart would glint too She imagined the reflection startled her She stretched her arms out to the night embracing its glories sighing in sympathy with its meaning which she did not know She felt the desire of restlessness yet she could not bear to go But no thought of the stranger touched her for you see as yet she did not understand Then quite naturally she heard his voice in the darkness close to her knee It seemed inevitable that he should be there part of the restless glorious night part of her mood She gave no start of surprise but half closed her eyes and leaned her fair head against a pillar of the veranda He sang in a sweet undertone an old chanson of voyage Par derrier chez mon pere Vole mon coeur vole Par derrier chez mon pere Li ya t un pommier doux Ah lady lady mine broke in the voice softly the night too is sweet soft as thine eyes Will you not greet me The girl made no sign After a moment the song went on Trois filles d un prince Vole mon coeur vole Trois filles d un prince Sont endormies dessous Will not the princess leave her sisters of dreams whispered the voice fantastically Will she not come Virginia shivered and half opened her eyes but did not stir It seemed that the darkness sighed then became musical again La plus jeun se reveille Vole mon coeur vole La plus jeun se reveille Ma Soeur voila le jour The song broke this time without a word of pleading The girl opened her eyes wide and stared breathlessly straight before her at the singer Non ce n est qu une etoile Vole mon coeur vole Non ce n est qu une etoile Qu eclaire nos amours The last word rolled out through its passionate throat tones and died into silence Come repeated the man again this time almost in the accents of command She turned slowly and went to him her eyes childlike and frightened her lips wide her face pale When she stood face to face with him she swayed and almost fell What do you want with me she faltered with a little sob The man looked at her keenly laughed and exclaimed in an every day matter of fact voice Why I really believe my song frightened you It is only a boating song Come let us go and sit on the gun carriages and talk Oh she gasped a trifle hysterically Don t do that again Please don t I do not understand it You must not He laughed again but with a note of tenderness in his voice and took her hand to lead her away humming in an undertone the last couplet of his song Non ce n est qu une etoile Qu eclaire nos amours Chapter Eight

2156_17942_000015_000003	train-clean-360	But the strange power of the man held her close so she realized that for the moment at least she would do as he desired

2156_17942_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He pulled her shawl about her masterfully yet with gentleness and then as though it was the most natural thing in the world he drew her to him until she rested against his shoulder 
2156_17942_000017_000002	train-clean-360	And she remained there trembling in suspense glancing at him quickly in birdlike pleading glances as though praying him to be kind 
2156_17942_000017_000003	train-clean-360	He took no notice after that so the act seemed less like a caress than a matter of course 
2156_17942_000017_000004	train-clean-360	He began to talk half humorously and little by little as he went on she forgot her fears even her feeling of strangeness and fell completely under the spell of his power

2156_17942_000019_000000	train-clean-360	And then in his gay half mocking yet musical voice he touched lightly on vast and distant things 
2156_17942_000019_000001	train-clean-360	He talked of the great Saskatchewan of Peace River and the delta of the Mackenzie of the winter journeys beyond Great Bear Lake into the Land of the Little Sticks and the half mythical lake of Yamba Tooh

2156_17942_000034_000007	train-clean-360	 Sorry for a weakness you do not understand You must think me a fool 
2156_17942_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I know you are unhappy replied Virginia gently 
2156_17942_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 I am truly sorry for that 
none	none	Are you Are you indeed he cried Unhappiness is worth such pity as yours He brooded for a moment then threw his hands out with what might have been a gesture of desperate indifference Suddenly his mood changed in the whimsical bewildering fashion of the man
2156_17942_000036_000004	train-clean-360	 Ah a star shoots he exclaimed gayly 
2156_17942_000036_000005	train-clean-360	 That means a kiss 
2156_17942_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Still laughing he attempted to draw her to him 
2156_17942_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Angry mortified outraged she fought herself free and leaped to her feet 
2156_17942_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh she cried in insulted anger 
none	none	Oh she cried in a red shame Oh she cried in sorrow 
2156_17942_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Her calm broke 
2156_17942_000041_000001	train-clean-360	She burst into the violent sobbing of a child and turned and ran hurriedly to the factory 
2156_17942_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Ned Trent stared after her a minute from beneath scowling brows 
2156_17942_000042_000001	train-clean-360	He stamped his moccasined foot impatiently 
2156_17942_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Like a rat in a trap he jeered at himself 
2156_17942_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 Like a rat in a trap Ned Trent 
2156_17942_000043_000002	train-clean-360	The fates are drawing around you close 
2156_17942_000043_000003	train-clean-360	You need just one little thing and you cannot get it 
2156_17942_000043_000004	train-clean-360	Bribery is useless 
2156_17942_000043_000005	train-clean-360	Force is useless 
2156_17942_000043_000006	train-clean-360	Craft is useless 
2156_17942_000043_000007	train-clean-360	This afternoon I thought I saw another way 
2156_17942_000043_000008	train-clean-360	What I could get no other way I might get from this little girl She is only a child 
2156_17942_000043_000009	train-clean-360	I believe I could touch her pity ah Ned Trent Ned Trent can you ever forget her frightened white face begging you to be kind He paced back and forth between the two bronze guns with long straight strides like a panther in a cage 
2156_17942_000043_000010	train-clean-360	 Her aid is mine for the asking but she makes it impossible to ask 
none	none	I could not do it Better try la Longue Traverse than take advantage of her pity she d surely get into trouble 
2156_17942_000043_000012	train-clean-360	What wonderful eyes she has 
2156_17942_000043_000013	train-clean-360	She thinks I am a brute how she sobbed as though her little heart had broken 
2156_17942_000043_000014	train-clean-360	Well it was the only way to destroy her interest in me 
2156_17942_000043_000015	train-clean-360	I had to do it 
2156_17942_000043_000016	train-clean-360	Now she will despise me and forget me 
2156_17942_000043_000017	train-clean-360	It is better that she should think me a brute than that I should be always haunted by those pleading eyes The door of the distant church house opened and closed 
2156_17942_000043_000018	train-clean-360	He smiled bitterly 
none	none	To be sure I haven t tried that he acknowledged Their teachings are singularly apropos to my case mercy justice humanity yes and love of man 
2156_17942_000043_000020	train-clean-360	I ll try it 
2156_17942_000043_000021	train-clean-360	I ll call for help on the love of man since I cannot on the love of woman 
none	none	The love of woman ah yes He set his feet reflectively toward the chapel Chapter Nine After a moment he pushed open the door without ceremony and entered He bent his brows studying the Reverend Archibald Crane while the latter looking up startled turned pink He was a pink little man anyway the Reverend Archibald Crane and why in the inscrutability of its wisdom the Church had sent him out to influence strong grim men the Church in its inscrutable wisdom only knows He wore at the moment a cambric English boating hat to protect his bald head from the draught a full clerical costume as far as the trousers which were of lavender and a pair of beaded moccasins faced with red His weak little face was pink and two tufts of side whiskers were nearly so A heavy gold headed cane stood at his hand When he heard the door open he exclaimed before raising his head My these first flies of the season do bother me so and then looked startled Good evening greeted Ned Trent stopping squarely in the centre of the room The clergyman spread his arms along the desk s edge in embarrassment Good evening he returned reluctantly Is there anything I can do for you The visitor puzzled him but was dressed as a voyageur The Reverend Archibald immediately resolved to treat him as such I wish to introduce myself as Ned Trent went on the Free Trader with composure and I have broken in on your privacy this evening only because I need your ministrations cruelly I am rejoiced that in your difficulties you turn to the consolations of the Church replied the other in the cordial tones of the man who is always ready Pray be seated He whose soul thirsteth need offer no apology to the keeper of the spiritual fountains Quite so replied the stranger dryly seating himself as suggested only in this case my wants are temporal rather than spiritual They however seem to me fully within the province of the Church The Church attempts within limits to aid those who are materially in want assured Crane with official dignity Our resources are small but to the truly deserving we are always ready to give in the spirit of true giving I am rejoiced to hear it returned the young man grimly you will then have no difficulty in getting me so small a matter as a rifle and about forty or fifty rounds of ammunition A pause of astonishment ensued Why really ejaculated Crane I fail to see how that falls within my jurisdiction in the slightest You should see our Trader mister mc donald in regard to all such things Your request addressed to me becomes extraordinary Not so much so when you know who I am I told you my name is Ned Trent but I neglected to inform you further that I am a captured Free Trader condemned to la Longue Traverse and that I have in vain tried to procure elsewhere the means of escape Then the clergyman understood The full significance of the intruder s presence flashed over his little pink face in a trouble of uneasiness The probable consequences of such a bit of charity as his visitor proposed almost turned him sick with excitement You expect to have them of me he cried getting his voice at last Certainly assured his interlocutor crossing his legs comfortably Don t you see the logic of events forces me to think so What other course is open to you I am in this country entirely within my legal rights as a citizen of the Canadian Commonwealth Unjustly I am seized by a stronger power and condemned unjustly to death Surely you admit the injustice Well of course you know the customs of the country it is hardly an abstract question stammered Crane still without grasp on the logic of his argument But as an abstract question the injustice is plain resumed the Free Trader imperturbably And against plain injustice it strikes me there is but one course open to an acknowledged institution of abstract and concrete morality The Church must set itself against immorality and you as the Church s representative must get me a rifle You forget one thing rejoined Crane What is that Such an aid would be a direct act of rebellion against authority on my part which would be severely punished Of course he asserted with conscious righteousness I should not consider that for a moment as far as my own personal safety is concerned But my cause would suffer You forget sir that we are doing here a great and good work We have in our weekly congregational singing over forty regular attendants from the aborigines next year I hope to build a church at Whale River thus reaching the benighted inhabitants of that distant region All of this is a vital matter in the service of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ You suggest that I endanger all this in order to right a single instance of injustice Of course we are told to love one another but he paused You have to compromise finished the stranger for him Exactly said the Reverend Crane Thank you it is exactly that In order to accomplish what little good the Lord vouchsafes to our poor efforts we are obliged to overlook many things Otherwise we should not be allowed to stay here at all That is most interesting agreed Ned Trent with a rather biting calm But is it not a little calculating My slight familiarity with religious history and literature has always led me to believe that you are taught to embrace the right at any cost whatsoever that if you give yourself unreservedly to justice the Lord will sustain you through all trials I think at a pinch I could even quote a text to that effect My dear fellow objected the Reverend Archibald in gentle protest you evidently do not understand the situation at all I feel I should be most untrue to my trust if I were to endanger in any way the life long labor of my predecessor You must be able to see that for yourself It would destroy utterly my usefulness here They d send me away I couldn t go on with the work I have to think what is for the best There is some justice in what you say admitted the stranger if you persist in looking on this thing as a business proposition But it seems to my confessedly untrained mind that you missed the point Trust in the Lord saith the prophet In fact certain rivals in your own field hold the doctrine you expound and you consider them wrong To do evil that good may come I seem to recognize as a tenet of the Church of the Jesuits I protest I really do protest objected the clergyman scandalized All right agreed Ned Trent with good natured contempt That is not the point Do you refuse Can t you see begged the other I m sure you are reasonable enough to take the case on its broader side You refuse insisted Ned Trent It is not always easy to walk straightly before the Lord and my way is not always clear before me but You refuse cried Ned Trent rising impatiently The Reverend Archibald Crane looked at his catechiser with a trace of alarm I m sorry I m afraid I must he apologized The stranger advanced until he touched the desk on the other side of which the Reverend Archibald was sitting where he stood for some moments looking down on his opponent with an almost amused expression of contempt You are an interesting little beast he drawled and I ve seen a lot of your kind in my time Here you preach every Sunday to whomever will listen to you certain cut and dried doctrines you don t believe practically in the least Here for the first time you have had a chance to apply them literally and you hide behind a lot of words And while you re about it you may as well hear what I have to say about your kind I ve had a pretty wide experience in the North and I know what I m talking about Your work here among the Indians is rot and every sensible man knows it You coop them up in your log built houses you force on them clothes to which they are unaccustomed until they die of consumption Under your little tin steepled imitation of civilization for which they are not fitted they learn to beg to steal to lie I have travelled far but I have yet to discover what your kind are allowed on earth for You are narrow minded bigoted intolerant and without a scrap of real humanity to ornament your mock religion When you find you can t meddle with other people s affairs enough at home you get sent where you can get right in the business and earn salvation for doing it I don t know just why I should say this to you but it sort of does me good to tell it Once I heard one of your kind tell a sorrowing mother that her little child had gone to hell because it had died before he the smug hypocrite had sprinkled its little body with a handful of water There s humanity for you It may interest you to know that I thrashed that man then and there You are all alike I know the breed When there is found a real man among you and there are such he is so different in everything including his religion as to be really of another race I came here without the slightest expectation of getting what I asked for As I said before I know your breed and I know just how well your two thousand year old doctrines apply to practical cases There is another way but I hated to use it You d take it quick enough I dare say Here is where I should receive aid I may have to get it where I should not You a man of God Why you poor little insect I can t even get angry at you He stood for a moment looking at the confused and troubled clergyman Then he went out Chapter Ten Almost immediately the door opened again You Miss Albret cried Crane What does this mean demanded Virginia imperiously Who is that man In what danger does he stand What does he want a rifle for I insist on knowing She stood straight and tall in the low room her eyes flashing her head thrown back in the assured power of command The Reverend Crane tried to temporize hesitating over his words She cut him short That is nonsense Everybody seems to know but myself I am no child I came to consult you my spiritual adviser in regard to this very case Accidentally I overheard enough to justify me in knowing more The clergyman murmured something about the Company s secrets Again she cut him short Company s secrets Since when has the Company confided in Andrew Laviolette in Wishkobun in you Possibly you would better ask your father said Crane with some return of dignity It does not suit me to do so replied she I insist that you answer my questions Who is this man Ned Trent he says I will not be put off in this way Who is he What is he He is a Free Trader replied the Reverend Crane with the air of a man who throws down a bomb and is afraid of the consequences To his astonishment the bomb did not explode What is that she asked simply The man s jaw dropped and his eyes opened in astonishment Here was a density of ignorance in regard to the ordinary affairs of the Post which could by no stretch of the imagination be ascribed to chance If Virginia Albret did not know the meaning of the term and all the tragic consequences it entailed there could be but one conclusion Galen Albret had not intended that she should know She had purposely been left in ignorance and a politic man would hesitate long before daring to enlighten her The Reverend Crane in sheer terror became sullen A Free Trader is a man who trades in opposition to the Company said he cautiously What great danger is he in the girl persisted with her catechism None that I am aware of replied Crane suavely He is a very ill balanced and excitable young man Virginia s quick instincts recognized again the same barrier which with the people with Wishkobun with her father had shut her so effectively from the truth Her power of femininity and position had to give way before the man s fear for himself and of Galen Albret s unexpressed wish She asked a few more questions received a few more evasive replies and left the little clergyman to recover as best he might from a very trying evening Out in the night the girl hesitated in two minds as to what to do next She was excited and resolved to finish the affair but she could not bring her courage to the point of questioning her father That the stranger was in antagonism to the Company that he believed himself to be in danger on that account that he wanted succor she saw clearly enough But the whole affair was vague disquieting She wanted to see it plainly know its reasons And beneath her excitement she recognized with a catch of the breath that she was afraid for him She had not time now to ask herself what it might mean she only realized the presence of the fact She turned instinctively in the direction of Doctor Cockburn s house missus Cockburn was a plain little middle aged woman with parted gray hair and sweet faded eyes In the life of the place she was a nonentity and her tastes were homely and commonplace but Virginia liked her She proved to be at home the Doctor still at his dispensary which was well Virginia entered a small log room passed through it immediately to a larger papered room and sat down in a musty red arm chair The building was one of the old regime which meant that its floor was of wide and rather uneven painted boards its ceiling low its windows small and its general lines of an irregular and sagging rule of thumb tendency The white wall paper evidently concealed squared logs The present inhabitants being possessed at once of rather homely tastes and limited facilities had over furnished the place with an infinitude of little things little rugs little tables little knit doilies little racks of photographs little china ornaments little spidery what nots and shelves for books Virginia seated herself and went directly to the topic missus Cockburn she said you have always been very good to me always ever since I came here as a little girl I have not always appreciated it I am afraid but I am in great trouble and I want your help What is it dearie asked the older woman softly Of course I will do anything I can I want you to tell me what all this mystery is about the man who to day arrived from Kettle Portage I mean I have asked everybody I have tried by all means in my power to get somebody somewhere to tell me It is maddening and I have a special reason for wanting to know The older woman was already gazing at her through troubled eyes It is a shame and a mistake to keep you so in ignorance she broke out and I have said so always There are many things you have the right to know although some of them would make you very unhappy as they do all of us poor women who have to live in this land of dread But in this I cannot dearie Virginia felt again the impalpable shadow of truth escaping her Baffled confused she began to lose her self control A dozen times to day she had reached after this thing and always her fingers had closed on empty air She felt that she could not stand the suspense of bewilderment a single instant longer The tears overflowed and rolled down her cheeks unheeded Oh missus Cockburn she cried Please You do not know how dreadful this thing has come to be to me just because it is made so mysterious Why has it been kept from me alone It must have something to do with me and I can t stand this mystery this double dealing another minute If you won t tell me nobody will and I shall go on imagining Oh please have pity on me I feel the shadow of a tragedy It comes out in everything in everybody to whom I turn I see it in Wishkobun s avoidance of me in my father s silence in mister Crane s confusion in your reluctance yes in the very reckless insolence of mister Trent himself her voice broke slightly If you will not tell me I shall go direct to my father she ended with more firmness missus Cockburn examined the girl s flushed face through kindly but shrewd and experienced eyes Then with a caressing little murmur of pity she arose and seated herself on the arm of the red chair taking the girl s hand in hers I believe you mean it she said and I am going to tell you myself There is much sorrow in it for you but if you go to your father it will only make it worse I am doing what I should not It is shameful that such things happen in this nineteenth century but happen they do The long and short of it is that the Factors of this Post tolerate no competition in the country and when a man enters it for the purpose of trading with the Indians he is stopped and sent out There is nothing very bad about that said Virginia relieved No my dear not in that But they say his arms and supplies are taken from him and he is given a bare handful of provisions He has to make a quick journey and to starve at that Once when I was visiting out at the front not many years ago I saw one of those men they called him Jo Bagneau and his condition was pitiable pitiable But hardships can be endured A man can escape Yes almost whispered missus Cockburn looking about her apprehensively but the story goes that there are some cases when the man is an old offender or especially determined or so prominent as to be able to interest the law no one breathes of these cases here but he never gets out What do you mean cried Virginia harshly One dares not mean such things but they are so The hardships of the wilderness are many the dangers terrible what more natural than that a man should die of them in the forest It is no one s fault What do you mean repeated Virginia for God s sake speak plainly I dare not speak plainer than I know and no one ever really knows anything about it excepting the Indian who fires the shot or who watches the man until he dies of starvation whispered missus Cockburn But but cried the girl grasping her companion s arm My father Does he give such orders He No orders are given The thing is understood Certain runners whose turn it is shadow the Free Trader Your father is not responsible no one is responsible It is the policy And this man It has gone about that he is to take la Longue Traverse He knows it himself It is barbaric horrible it is murder My dear it is all that but this is the country of dread You have known the soft bright side always the picturesque men the laugh the song If you had seen as much of the harshness of wilderness life as a doctor s wife must you would know that when the storms of their great passions rage it is well to sit quiet at your prayers The girl s eyes were wide fixed staring at this first reality of life A thousand new thoughts jostled for recognition Suddenly her world had been swept from beneath her The ancient patriarchal kindly rule had passed away and in its place she was forced to see a grim iron bond of death laid over her domain And her father no longer the grave kindly old man had become the ruthless tyrant All these bright laughing voyageurs playmates of her childhood were in reality executioners of a savage blood law She could not adjust herself to it She got to her feet with an effort Thank you missus Cockburn she said in a low voice I I do not quite understand But I must go now I must I must see that my father s room is ready for him she finished with the proud defensive instinct of the woman who has been deeply touched You know I always do that myself Good night dearie replied the older woman understanding well the girl s desire to shelter behind the commonplace She leaned forward and kissed her God keep and guide you I hope I have done right Yes cried Virginia with unexpected fire Yes you did just right I ought to have been told long ago They ve kept me a perfect child to whom everything has been bright and care free and simple I I feel that until this moment I have lacked my real womanhood She bowed her head and passed through the log room into the outer air Her father her father had willed this man s death and so he was to die That explained many things the young fellow s insolence his care free recklessness his passionate denunciation of the Reverend Crane and the Reverend Crane s religion He wanted one little thing the gift of a rifle wherewith to assure his subsistence should he escape into the forest and of all those at Conjuror s House to whom he might turn for help some were too hard to give it to him and some too afraid He should have it She the daughter of her father would see to it that in this one instance her father s sin should fail Suddenly in the white heat of her emotion she realized why these matters stirred her so profoundly and she stopped short and gasped with the shock of it It did not matter that she thwarted her father s will it would not matter if she should be discovered and punished as only these harsh characters could punish For the brave bearing the brave jest the jaunty facing of death the tender low voice the gay song the aurora lit moment of his summons all these had at last their triumph She knew that she loved him and that if he were to die she would surely die too And oh it must be that he loved her Had she not heard it in the music of his voice from the first the passion of his tones the dreamy lyrical swing of his talk by the old bronze guns Then she staggered sharply and choked back a cry For out of her recollections leaped two sentences of his the first careless imprudent unforgivable the second pregnant with meaning Ah a star shoots he had said That means a kiss and again to the clergyman I came here without the slightest expectation of getting what I asked for There is another way but I hate to use it She was the other way She saw it plainly He did not love her but he saw that he could fascinate her and he hoped to use her as an aid to his escape She threw her head up proudly Then a man swung into view across the Northern Lights Virginia pressed back against the palings among the bushes until he should have passed It was Ned Trent returning from a walk to the end of the island He was alone and unfollowed and the girl realized with a sudden grip at the heart that the wilderness itself was sufficient safe guard against a man unarmed and unequipped It was not considered worth while even to watch him Should he escape unarmed as he was sure death by starvation awaited him in the land of dread As he entered the settlement he struck up an air Le fils du roi s en va chassant En roulant ma boule Avec son grand fusil d argent Rouli roulant ma boule roulant Almost immediately a window slid back and an exasperated voice cried out Hola dere w at one time dam fool you for mak de sing so late The voice went on imperturbably Avec son grand fusil d argent En roulant ma boule Visa le noir tua le blanc Rouli roulant ma boule roulant Sacre shrieked the habitant Hello Johnny Frenchman called Ned Trent in his acid tones That you Be more polite or I ll stand here and sing you the whole of it The window slammed shut Ned Trent took up his walk again toward some designated sleeping place of his own his song dying into the distance Visa le noir tua le blanc En roulant ma boule O fils du roi tu es mechant Rouli roulant ma boule roulant And he can sing cried the girl bitterly to herself At such a time Oh my dear God help me help me I am the unhappiest girl alive Chapter Eleven Virginia did not sleep at all that night She was reaching toward her new self Heretofore she had ruled those about her proudly secure in her power and influence Now she saw that all along her influence had in not one jot exceeded that of the winsome girl She had no real power at all They went mercilessly on in the grim way of their fathers dealing justice even handed according to their own crude conceptions of it without thought of God or man She turned hot all over as she saw herself in this new light as she saw those about her indulgently smiling at her airs of the mistress of it It angered her though the smile might be good humored even affectionate And she shrank into herself with utter loathing when she remembered Ned Trent There indeed her woman s pride was hard stricken She recalled with burning cheeks how his intense voice had stirred her how his wishes had compelled her she shivered pitifully as she remembered the warmth of his shoulder touching carelessly her own If he had come to her honestly and asked her aid she would have given it but this underhand pretence at love It was unworthy of him and it was certainly most unworthy of her What must he think of her How he must be laughing at her and hoping that his spell was working so that he could get the coveted rifle and the forty cartridges I hate him she cried to herself the backs of her long slender hands pressed against her eyes She meant that she loved him but for the purposes in hand one would do as well as the other At earliest daylight she was up Bathing her face and throat in cold water and hastily catching her beautiful light hair under a cap she slipped down stairs and out past the stockade to the point There she seated herself a heavy shawl about her and gave herself up to reflection She had approached silently her moccasins giving no sound Presently she became aware that someone was there before her Looking toward the river she saw on the next level below her a man seated on a bowlder and gazing to the south His very soul was in his eyes Virginia gasped at the change in him since last she had seen him The gay mocking demeanor which had seemed an essential part of his very flesh and blood had fallen away from him leaving a sad and lofty dignity that ennobled his countenance The lines of his face were stern of his mouth pathetic his eyes yearned He stared toward the south with an almost mesmeric intensity as though he hoped by sheer longing to materialize a vision Tears sprang to the girl s eyes at the subtle pathos of his attitude He stretched his arms wearily over his head and sighed deeply and looked up His eyes rested on the girl without surprise the expression of his features did not change Pardon me he said simply To day is my last of plenty I am up enjoying it Virginia had anticipated the usual instantaneous transformation of his manner when he should catch sight of her Her resentment was dispelled In face of the vaster tragedies little considerations gave way Do you leave to day she asked in a low voice To morrow morning early he corrected To day I found my provisions packed and laid at my door It is a hint I know how to take You have everything you need asked the girl with an assumption of indifference He looked her in the eyes for a moment Everything he lied calmly Virginia perceived that he lied and her heart stood still with a sudden hope that perhaps at this eleventh hour he might have repented of his unworthy intentions toward herself She leaned to him over the edge of the little rise Have you a rifle for la Longue Traverse she inquired with meaning He stared at her a little the harder Why why surely he replied in a tone less confident Nobody travels without a rifle in the North She dropped swiftly down the slope and stood face to face with him Listen she began in her superb manner I know all there is to know You are a Free Trader and you are to be sent to your death It is murder and it is done by my father She held her head proudly but the notes of her voice were straining I knew nothing of this yesterday I was a foolish girl who thought all men were good and just and that all those whom I knew were noble My eyes are open now I see injustice being done by my own household and tears were trembling near her lashes but she blinked them back and I am no longer a foolish girl You need not try to deceive me You must tell me what I can do for I cannot permit so great a wrong to be done by my father without attempting to set it right This was not what she had intended to say but suddenly the course was clear to her The influence of the man had again swept over her drowning her will filling her with the old fear which was now for the moment turned to pride by the character of the situation But to her surprise the man was thinking of something else Who told you he demanded harshly Then without waiting for a reply It was that little preacher I ll have an interview with him No no protested the girl It was not he It was a friend I had the right to know You had no right he cried vehemently You and life should have nothing to do with each other There is a look in your eyes that was not in them yesterday and the one who put it there is not your friend He stood staring at her intently as one who ponders what is best to do Then very quietly he took her hands and drew her to a place beside him on the bowlder I am going to tell you something little girl said he and you must listen quietly to the end Perhaps at the last you may see more clearly than you do now This old Company of yours has been established for a great many years Back in old days over two centuries ago it pushed up into this wilderness to trade for its furs That you know And then it explored ever farther to the west and the north until its servants stood on the shores of the Pacific and the stretches of the Arctic Ocean And its servants loved it Enduring immense hardships cut off from their kind outlining dimly with the eye of faith the structure of a mighty power they loved it always Thousands of men were in its employ and so loyal were they that its secrets were safe and its prestige was defended often to a lonely death I have known the Company and its servants for a long time and if I had leisure I could instance a hundred examples of devotion and sacrifice beside which mere patriotism would seem a little thing Men who had no country cleaved to her desolate posts her lakes and rivers and forests men who had no home ties felt the tug of her wild life at their hearts men who had no God bowed in awe before her power and grandeur The Company was a living thing Rivals attempted her supremacy and were defeated by the steadfastness of the men who received her meagre wages and looked to her as their one ideal Her explorers were the bravest her traders the most enterprising and single minded her factors and partners the most capable and potent in all the world No country no leader no State ever received half the worship her sons gave her The fierce Nor westers the traders of Montreal the Company of the X Y Astor himself had to give way For although they were bold or reckless or crafty or able they had not the ideal which raises such qualities to invincibility And little girl nothing is wrong to men who have such an ideal before them They see but one thing and all means are good that help them to assure that one thing They front the dangers they overcome the hardships they crush the rivals Bloody wars have taken place in these forests ruthless deeds have been done but the men who accomplished them held the deeds good So for two hundred years aided by the charter from the king they have made good their undisputed right Then the railroad entered the west The charter of monopoly ran out Through the Nipissing the Athabasca the Edmonton came the Free Traders men who traded independently These the Company could not control so it competed and to its credit its competition has held its own Even far into the Northwest where the trails are long the Free Traders have established their chains of supplies entering into rivalry with the Company for a barter it has always considered its right The medicine has been bitter but the servants of the Company have adjusted themselves to the new conditions and are holding their own But one region still remains cut off from the outside world by a broad band of unexplored waste The life here at Hudson s Bay although you may not know it is exactly the same to day that it was two hundred years ago And here the Company makes its stand for a monopoly At first it worked openly But in the case of Guillaume Sayer a daring and pugnacious metis it got into trouble with the law Since that time it has wrapped itself in secrecy and mystery carrying on its affairs behind the screen of five hundred miles of forest Here it has still the power no man can establish himself here can even travel here without its consent for it controls the food and the Indians The Free Trader enters but he does not stay for long The Company s servants are mindful of their old fanatical ideal Nothing is ever known no orders are ever given but something happens and the man never ventures again If he is an ordinary metis or Canadian he emerges from the forest starved frightened thankful If his story is likely to be believed in high places he never emerges at all The dangers of wilderness travel are many he succumbs to them That is the whole story Nothing definite is known no instances can be proved your father denies the legend and calls it a myth The Company claims to be ignorant of it perhaps its greater officers really are but the legend holds so good that the journey has its name la Longue Traverse But remember this no man is to blame unless it is he who of knowledge takes the chances It is a policy a growth of centuries an idea unchangeable to which the long services of many fierce and loyal men have given substance A Factor cannot change it If he did the thing would be outside of nature something not to be understood I am here I am to take la Longue Traverse But no man is to blame If the scheme of the thing is wrong it has been so from the very beginning from the time when King Charles set his signature to the charter of unlimited authority The history of a thousand men gives the tradition power gives it insistence It is bigger than any one individual It is as inevitable as that water should flow down hill He had spoken quietly but very earnestly still holding her two hands and she had sat looking at him unblinking from eyes behind which passed many thoughts When he had finished a short pause followed at the end of which she asked unexpectedly Last evening you told me that you might come to me and ask me to choose between my pity and what I might think to be my duty What are you going to ask of me Nothing I spoke idle words Last evening I overheard you demand something of mister Crane she pursued without commenting on his answer When he refused you I heard you say these words Here is where I should have received aid I may have to get it where I should not What was the aid you asked of him and where else did you expect to get it The aid was something impossible to accord and I did not expect to get it elsewhere I said that in order to induce him to help me A wonderful light sprang to the girl s eyes but still she maintained her level voice You asked him for a rifle with which to escape You expected to get it of me Deny it if you can Ned Trent looked at her keenly a moment then dropped his eyes It is true said he And the pity was to give you this weapon and the duty was my duty to my father s house It is true he repeated dejectedly And you lied to me when you said you had a rifle with which to journey la Longue Traverse That too is true he acknowledged When next she spoke her voice was not quite so well controlled Why did you not ask me as you intended Why did you tell me these lies The young man hesitated looked her in the face turned away and murmured I could not Why persisted the girl Why You must tell me Because said Ned Trent because it could not be done Every rifle in the place is known Because you would be found out in this and I do not know what your punishment might not be You knew this before insisted Virginia stonily Yes Then why did you change your mind When first I saw you by the gun began Ned Trent in a low voice I was a desperate man clutching at the slightest chance The thought crossed my mind then that I might use you Then later I saw that I had some influence over you and I made my plan But last night Yes last night urged Virginia softly Last night I paced the island and I found out many things One of them was that I could not Even though this dreadful journey I would rather take my chances Again there was silence between them It was a good lie then said Virginia gently a noble lie And what you have told me to comfort me about my father has been nobly said And I believe you for I have known the truth about your fate He shut his lips grimly Why why did you come she cried passionately Is the trade so good are your needs then so great that you must run these perils My needs he replied No I have enough Then why she insisted Because that old charter has long since expired and now this country is as free for me as for the Company he explained We are in a civilized century and no man has a right to tell me where I shall or shall not go Does the Company own the Indians and the creatures of the woods Something in the tone of his voice brought her eyes steadily to his for a moment Is that all she asked at length He hesitated looked away looked back again No it is not he confessed in a low voice It is a thing I do not speak of My father was a servant of this Company a good true servant No man was more honest more zealous more loyal I am sure of it said Virginia softly But in some way that he never knew himself he made enemies in high places The cowards did not meet him man to man and so he never knew who they were If he had he would have killed them But they worked against him always He was given hard posts inadequate supplies scant help and then he was held to account for what he could not do Finally he left the company in disgrace undeserved disgrace He became a Free Trader in the days when to become a Free Trader was worse than attacking a grizzly with cubs In three years he was killed But when I grew to be a man he clenched his teeth by God how I have prayed to know who did it He brooded for a moment then went on Still I have accomplished something I have traded in spite of your factors in many districts One summer I pushed to the Coppermine in the teeth of them and traded with the Yellow Knives for the robes of the musk ox And they knew me and feared my rivalry these traders of the Company No district of the far North but has felt the influence of my bartering The traders of all districts Fort au Liard Lapierre s House Fort Rae Ile a la Crosse Portage la Loche Lac la Biche Jasper s House the House of the Touchwood Hills all these and many more have heard of Ned Trent Your father you knew him well No but I remember him a tall dark man with a smile always in his eyes and a laugh on his lips I was brought up at a school in Winnipeg under a priest Two or three times in the year my father used to appear for a few days I remember well the last time I saw him I was about thirteen years old You are growing to be a man said he next year we will go out on the trail I never saw him again What happened Oh he was just killed replied Ned Trent bitterly The girl laid her hand on his arm with an appealing little gesture I am so sorry said she I have no portrait of him continued the Free Trader after an instant No gift from his hands nothing at all of his but this He showed her an ordinary little silver match safe such as men use in the North country They brought that to me at the last the Indians who came to tell my priest the news and the priest who was a good man gave it to me I have carried it ever since Virginia took it reverently To her it had all the largeness that envelops the symbol of a great passion After a moment she looked up in surprise Why she exclaimed this has a name carved on it Yes he replied But the name is Graehme Stewart Of course I could not bear my father s name in a country where it was well known he explained Of course she agreed Impulsively she raised her face to his her eyes shining To me all this is very fine said she He smiled a little sadly At least you know why I came Yes she repeated I know why you came But you are in trouble The chances of war And they have defeated you after all I shall start on la Longue Traverse singing Rouli roulant It s a small defeat that Listen said she rapidly When I was quite a small girl mister McTavish of Rupert s House gave me a little rifle I have never used it because I do not care to shoot That rifle has never been counted and my father has long since forgotten all about it You must take that and escape to night I will let you have it on one condition that you give me your solemn promise never to venture into this country again Yes he agreed without enthusiasm nor surprise She smiled happily at his gloomy face and listless attitude But I do not want to give up the little rifle entirely she went on with dainty preciosity watching him closely As I said it was a present given to me when I was quite a small girl You must return it to me at Quebec in August Will you promise to do that He wheeled on her swift as light the eagerness flashing back into his face You are going to Quebec he cried My father wishes me to I have decided to do so I shall start with the Abitibi brigade in July He leaped to his feet I promise he exulted I promise To night then Bring the rifle and the cartridges and some matches and a little salt You must take me across the river in a canoe for I want them to guess at where I strike the woods I shall cover my trail And with ten hours start let them catch Ned Trent who can She laughed happily To night then At the south of the island there is a trail and at the end of the trail a beach I know he cried Meet me there as soon after dark as you can do so without danger He threw his hat into the air and caught it his face boyishly upturned Again that something so vaguely familiar plucked at her with its ghostly appealing fingers She turned swiftly and seized them and so found herself in possession of a memory out of her far off childhood I know you she cried I have seen you before this He bent his puzzled gaze upon her I was a very little girl she explained and you but a lad It was at a party I think a great and brilliant party for I remember many beautiful women and fine men You held me up in your arms for people to see because I was going on a long journey I remember of course I do he exclaimed A bell clanged turning over and over calling the Company s men to their day Farewell she said hurriedly To night To night he repeated She glided rapidly through the grass noiseless in her moccasined feet And as she went she heard his voice humming soft and low Isabeau s y promene Le long de son jardin Le long de son jardin Sur le bord de l ile Le long de son jardin How could he help singing murmured Virginia fondly Ah dear Heaven but I am the happiest girl alive Such a difference can one night bring about Chapter Twelve The day rose and flooded the land with its fuller life All through the settlement the Post Indians and half breeds set about their tasks Some aided Sarnier with his calking of the bateaux some worked in the fields some mended or constructed in the different shops At eight o clock the bell rang again and they ate breakfast Then a group of seven armed with muzzle loading trade guns bound in brass set out for the marshes in hopes of geese For the flight was arriving and the Hudson Bay man knows very well the flavor of goose flesh smoked salted and barrelled Now the voyageurs began to stroll into the sun They were men of leisure Picturesque handsome careless debonair they wandered back and forth smoking their cigarettes exhibiting their finery Indian women wrinkled and careworn plodded patiently about on various businesses Indian girls full of fun and mischief drifted here and there in arm locked groups of a dozen smiling whispering among themselves ready to collapse toward a common centre of giggles if addressed by one of the numerous woods dandies Indian men stalked singly indifferent stolid Indian children of all sizes and degrees of nakedness darted back and forth playing strange games The sound of many voices rose across the air Once the voices moderated when mc donald the Chief Trader walked rapidly from the barracks building to the trading store once they died entirely into a hush of respect when Galen Albret himself appeared on the broad veranda of the factory He stood for a moment hulked broad and black against the whitewash his hands clasped behind him gazing abstractedly toward the distant bay Then he turned into the house to some mysterious and weighty business of his own The hubbub at once broke out again Now about the mouth of the long picketed lane leading to the massive trading store gathered a silent group bearing packs These were Indians from the more immediate vicinity desirous of trading their skins After a moment mc donald appeared in the doorway a hundred feet away and raised his hand Two of the savages and two only trotted down the narrow picket lane their packs on their shoulders mc donald ushered them into a big square room where the bales were undone and spread abroad Deftly silently the Trader sorted the furs placing to one side or the other the primes seconds and thirds of each species For a moment he calculated Then he stepped to a post whereon hung long strings of pierced wooden counters worn smooth by use Swiftly he told the strings over To one of the Indians he gave one with these words Mu hi kun my brother here be pelts to the value of two hundred beaver Behold a string then of two hundred castors and in addition I give my brother one fathom of tobacco The Indian calculated rapidly his eye abstracted He had known exactly the value of his catch and what he would receive for it in castors but had hoped for a larger present by which the premium on the standard price is measured Ah hah he exclaimed finally and stepped to one side Sak we su my brother went on mc donald here be pelts to the value of three hundred beaver Behold a string then of three hundred castors and because you have brought so fine a skin of the otter behold also a fathom of tobacco and a half sack of flour Good ejaculated the Indian The Trader then led them to stairs up which they clambered to where Davis the Assistant Trader kept store There barred by a heavy wooden grill from the airy loft filled with bright calicoes sashes pails guns blankets clothes and other ornamental and useful things Sak we su and Mu hi kun made their choice trading in the worn wooden castors on the string So much flour so much tea so much sugar and powder and lead so much in clothing Thus were their simple needs supplied for the year to come Then the remainder they squandered on all sorts of useless things beads silks sashes bright handkerchiefs mirrors And when the last wooden castor was in they went down stairs and out the picket lane carrying their lighter purchases but leaving the larger as debt to be called for when needed Two of their companions mounted the stairs as they descended and two more passed them in the narrow picket lane So the trade went on At once Sak we su and Mu hi kun were surrounded In detail they told what they had done Then in greater detail their friends told what they would have done until after five minutes of bewildering advice the disconsolate pair would have been only too glad to have exchanged everything if that had been allowed Now the bell rang again It was smoke time Everyone quit work for a half hour The sun climbed higher in the heavens The laughing crews of idlers sprawled in the warmth gambling telling stories singing Then one might have heard all the picturesque songs of the Far North A la claire Fontaine Ma Boule Roulant Par derrier chez mon Pere Isabeau s y promene P tite Jeanneton Luron Lurette Chante Rossignol chante the ever popular Malbrouck C est la belle Francoise Alouette or the beautiful and tender La Violette Dandine They had good voices these voyageurs with the French artistic instinct and it was fine to hear them At noon the squaws set out to gather canoe gum on the mainland They sat huddled in the bottom of their old and leaky canoe reaching far over the sides to dip their paddles irregularly placed silent mysterious They did not paddle with the unison of the men but each jabbed a little short stroke as the time suited her so that always some paddles were rising and some falling Into the distance thus they flapped like wounded birds then rounded a bend and were gone The sun swung over and down the slope Dinner time had passed smoke time had come again Squaws brought the first white fish of the season to the kitchen door of the factory and Matthews raised the hand of horror at the price they asked Finally he bought six of about three pounds each giving in exchange tea to the approximate value of twelve cents The Indian women went away secretly pleased over their bargain Down by the Indian camp suddenly broke the roar of a dog fight Two of the sledge giddes had come to teeth and the friends of both were assisting the cause The idlers went to see laughing shouting running impromptu races They sat on their haunches and cheered ironically and made small bets and encouraged the frantic old squaw hags who at imminent risk were trying to disintegrate the snarling rolling mass Over in the high log stockade wherein the Company s sledge animals were confined other wolf dogs howled mournfully desolated at missing the fun And always the sun swung lower and lower toward the west until finally the long northern twilight fell and the girl in the little white bedroom at the factory bathed her face and whispered for the hundredth time to her beating heart Night has come Chapter Thirteen That evening at dinner Virginia studied her father s face again She saw the square settled line of the jaw under the beard the unwavering frown of the heavy eyebrows the unblinking purpose of the cavernous mysterious eyes Never had she felt herself very close to this silent inscrutable man even in his moments of more affectionate expansion Now a gulf divided them And yet strangely enough she experienced no revulsion no horror no recoil even He had merely become more aloof more incomprehensible his purposes vaster less susceptible to the grasp of such as she There may have been some basis for this feeling or it may have been merely the reflex glow of a joy that made all other things seem insignificant As soon as might be after the meal Virginia slipped away carrying the rifle the cartridges the matches and the salt She was cruelly frightened The night was providentially dark No aurora threw its splendor across the dome and only a few rare stars peeped between the light cirrus clouds Virginia left behind her the buildings of the Post she passed in safety the tin steepled chapel and the church house there remained only the Indian camp between her and the woods trail At once the dogs began to bark and howl the fierce giddes lifting their pointed noses to the sky The girl hurried on swinging far to the right through the grass To her relief the camp did not respond to the summons An old crone or so appeared in the flap of a teepee eyes dazzled to throw uselessly a billet of wood or a volley of Cree abuse at the animals nearest In a moment Virginia entered the trail Here was no light at all She had to proceed warily feeling with her moccasins for the beaten pathway to which she returned with infinite caution whenever she trod on grass or leaves Though her sight was dulled her hearing was not A thousand scurrying noises swirled about her a multitude of squeaks whistles snorts and whines attested that she disturbed the forest creatures at their varied businesses and underneath spoke an apparent dozen of terrifying voices which were in reality only the winds and the trees Virginia knew that these things were not dangerous that daylight would show them to be only deer mice hares weasels bats and owls nevertheless they had their effect For about her was cloying velvet blackness not the closed in blackness of a room where one feels the embrace of the four walls but the blackness of infinite space through which sweep mysterious currents of air After a long time she turned sharp to the left After a long time more she perceived a faint opalescent glimmer in the distance ahead This she knew to be the river She felt her way onward still cautiously then she choked back a scream and dropped her burden with a clatter to the ground A dark figure seemed to have risen mysteriously at her side I didn t mean to frighten you said Ned Trent in guarded tones I heard you coming I thought you could hear me He picked up the fallen articles running his hands over them rapidly Good he whispered I got some moccasins to day traded a few things I had in my pockets for them I m fixed Have you a canoe she asked Yes here on the beach He preceded her down the few remaining yards of the trail She followed already desolated at the thought of parting for the wilderness was very big The bulk of the man partly blotted out the lucent spot where the river was now his arm now his head now the breadth of his shoulders This silhouette of him was dear to her the sound of his movements the faint stir of his breathing borne to her on the light breeze Virginia s tender heart almost overflowed with longing and fear for him They emerged on a little slope and at once pushed the canoe into the current She accepted the aid of his hand for a moment and sank to her place facing him He spurned lightly the shore and so they were adrift In a moment they seemed to be floating on a vast vapor of night infinitely remote from anywhere surrounded by the silence that might have been before the world s beginning A faint splash could have been a muskrat near at hand or a caribou far away The paddle rose and dipped with a faint swish swish and the steersman s twist of it was taken up by the man s strong wrist so it did not click against the gunwale the bow of the craft divided the waters with a murmuring so faint as to seem but the echo of a silence Neither spoke Virginia watched him her heart too full for words watched the full swing of his strong shoulders the balance of his body at the hips the poise of his head against the dull sky In a moment more the parting would have to come She dreaded it and yet she looked forward to it with a hungry joy Then he would say what she had seen in his eyes then he would speak then she would hear the words that should comfort her in the days of waiting For a woman lives much for the present and the moment s word is an important thing The man swung his paddle steadily throwing into the strokes a wanton exuberance that showed how high his spirits ran After a time when they were well out from the shore he took a deep breath of delight Ah you don t know how happy I am he exulted you don t know To be free to play the game to match my wits against theirs ah that is life I am sorry to see you go she murmured very sorry The days will be full of terror until I know you are safe Oh yes he answered but I ll get there and I shall tell it all to you at Quebec at Quebec in August It will be a brave tale You will be there surely Yes said the girl softly I will be there surely Good Feel the wind on your cheek It is from the Southland where I am going I have ventured and I have not lost It is something not to lose when one has ventured against many They have my goods but I You repeated Virginia as he hesitated Ah I don t go back empty handed he cried Her heart stood still then leaped in anticipation of what he would say Her soul hungered for the words the words that should not only comfort her but should be to her the excuse for many things She saw him shadowy graceful against the dim gray of the river and sky lean ever so slightly toward her But then he straightened again to his paddle and contented himself with repeating merely Quebec in August then The canoe grated Ned Trent with an exclamation drove his paddle into the clay Lucky the bottom is soft here said he I did not realize we were so close ashore He drew the canoe up on the shelving beach helped Virginia out took his rifle and so stood ready to depart Leave the canoe just where we got in he advised it is around the point you see and that may fool them a little You are going she said dully Then she came close to him and looked up at him with her wonderful eyes Good by Good by said he Was this to be all Had he nothing more to tell her Was the word to lack the word she needed so much She had given herself unreservedly into this man s hands and at parting he had no more to say to her than Good by Virginia s eyes were tearful but she would not let him know that She felt that her heart would break Well good by he said again after a moment which he had spent inspecting the heavens Ah you don t know what it is to be free By to morrow morning I shall be half way to the Mattagami I can hardly wait to see it for then I am safe And then next day why next day they won t know which of a dozen ways I ve gone He was full of the future man fashion He took her hands leaned over and lightly kissed her on the mouth Instantly Virginia became wildly and unreasonably angry She could not have told herself why but it was the lack of the word she had wanted so much the pain of feeling that he could go like that the thwarted bitterness of a longing that had grown stronger than she had even yet realized Instinctively she leaped into the canoe sending it spinning from the bank Ah you had no right to do that she cried I gave you no right Then heedless of what he was saying she began to paddle straight from the shore weeping bitterly her face upraised her hair in her eyes and the tears coursing unheeded down her cheeks Chapter Fourteen Slower and slower her paddle dipped lower and lower hung her head faster and faster flowed her tears The instinctive recoil the passionate resentment had gone In the bitterness of her spirit she knew not what she thought except that she would give her soul to see him again to feel the touch of his lips once more For she could not make herself believe that this would ever come to pass He had gone like a phantom like a dream and the mists of life had closed about him showing no sign He had vanished and at once she seemed to know that the episode was finished The canoe whispered against the soft clay bottom She had arrived though how the crossing had been made she could not have told Slowly and sorrowfully she disembarked Languidly she drew the light craft beyond the stream s eager fingers Then her forces at an end she huddled down on the ground and gave herself up to sorrow The life of the forest went on as though she were not there A big owl far off said hurriedly his whoo whoo whoo as though he had the message to deliver and wanted to finish the task A smaller owl near at hand cried ko ko ko oh with the intonation of a tin horn Across the river a lynx screamed and was answered at once by the ululations of wolves On the island the giddes howled defiance Then from above clear spiritual floated the whistle of shore birds arriving from the south Close by sounded a rustle of leaves a sharp squeak a tragedy had been consummated and the fierce little mink stared malevolently across the body of his victim at the motionless figure on the beach Virginia drowned in grief knew of none of these things She was seeing again the clear brown face of the stranger his curly brown hair his steel eyes and the swing of his graceful figure Now he fronted the wondering voyageurs one foot raised against the bow of the brigade canoe now he stood straight and tall against the light of the sitting room door now he emptied the vials of his wrath and contempt on Archibald Crane s reverend head now he passed in the darkness singing gayly the chanson de canot But more fondly she saw him as he swept his hat to the ground on discovering her by the guns as he bent his impassioned eyes on her in the dim lamplight of their first interview as he tossed his hat aloft in the air when he had understood that she would be in Quebec She hugged the visions to her and wept over them softly for she was now sure she would never see him again And she heard his voice now laughing now scornful now mocking now indignant now rich and solemn with feeling He flouted the people he turned the shafts of his irony on her father he scathed the minister he laughed at Louis Placide awakened from his sleep he sang he told her of the land of desolation he pleaded She could hear him calling her name although he had never spoken it in low tender tones Virginia Virginia over and over again softly as though his soul were crying through his lips Then somehow in a manner not to be comprehended it was borne in on her consciousness that he was indeed near her and that he was indeed calling her name And at once she made him out standing dripping on the beach A moment later she was in his arms Ah he cried in gladness you are here He crushed her hungrily to him unmindful of his wet clothes kissing her eyes her cheeks her lips her chin even the fragrant corner of her throat exposed by the collar of her gown She did not struggle Oh she murmured my dear my dear Why did you come back Why did you come Why did I come he repeated passionately Why did I come Can you ask that How could I help but come You must have known I would come Surely you must have known Didn t you hear me calling you when you paddled away I came to get the right I came to get your promise your kisses to hear you say the word to get you I thought you understood It was all so clear to me I thought you knew That was why I was so glad to go so eager to get away that I could not even realize I was parting from you so I could the sooner reach Quebec reach you Don t you see how I felt All this present was merely something to get over to pass by to put behind us until I got to Quebec in August and you I looked forward so eagerly to that I was so anxious to get away I was desirous of hastening on to the time when things could be sure Don t you understand Yes I think I do replied the girl softly And I thought of course you knew I should not have kissed you otherwise How could I know she sighed You said nothing and oh I wanted so to hear And singularly enough he said nothing now but they stood facing each other hand in hand while the great vibrant life they were now touching so closely filled their hearts and eyes and left them faint So they stood for hours or for seconds they could not tell spirit hushed ecstatic The girl realized that they must part You must go she whispered brokenly at last I do not want you to but you must She smiled up at him with trembling lips that whispered to her soul that she must be brave Now go she nerved herself to say releasing her hands Tell me he commanded What she asked What I most want to hear I can tell you many things said she soberly but I do not know which of them you want to hear Ah Ned I can tell you that you have come into a girl s life to make her very happy and very much afraid And that is a solemn thing is it not Yes said he And I can tell you that this can never be undone That is a solemn thing too is it not Yes said he And that according as you treat her this girl will believe or not believe in the goodness of all men or the badness of all men Ah Ned a woman s heart is fragile and mine is in your keeping Her face was raised bravely and steadily to his In the starlight it shone white and pathetic And her eyes were two liquid wells of darkness in the shadow and her half parted lips were wistful and childlike The man caught both her hands again looking down on her Then he answered her solemnly and humbly Virginia said he I am setting out on a perilous journey As I deal with you may God deal with me Ah that is as I like you she breathed Good by said he She raised her lips of her own accord and he kissed them reverently Good by she murmured He turned away with an effort and ran down the beach to the canoe Good by good by she murmured under her breath Ah good by I love you Oh I do love you Illustration GO HOME BEFORE THEY SEARCH THE WOODS Scene from the play Then suddenly from the bushes leaped dark figures The still night was broken by the sound of a violent scuffle blows a fall She heard Ned Trent s voice calling to her from the melee Go back at once he commanded clearly and steadily You can do no good I order you to go home before they search the woods But she crouched in dazed terror her pupils wide to the dim light She saw them bind him and stand waiting she saw a canoe glide out of the darkness she saw the occupants of the canoe disembark she saw them exhibit her little rifle and heard them explain in Cree that they had followed the man swimming Then she knew that the cause was lost and fled as swiftly as she could through the forest Chapter Fifteen Galen Albret had chosen to interrogate his recaptured prisoner alone He sat again in the arm chair of the Council Room The place was flooded with sun It touched the high lights of the time darkened rough furniture it picked out the brasses it glorified the whitewashed walls In its uncompromising illumination Me en gan the bowsman standing straight and tall and silent by the door studied his master s face and knew him to be deeply angered For Galen Albret was at this moment called upon to deal with a problem more subtle than any with which his policy had been puzzled in thirty years It was bad enough that in repeated defiance of his authority this stranger should persist in his attempt to break the Company s monopoly it was bad enough that he had when captured borne himself with so impudent an air of assurance it was bad enough that he should have made open love to the Factor s daughter should have laughed scornfully in the Factor s very face But now the case had become grave In some mysterious manner he had succeeded in corrupting one of the Company s servants Treachery was therefore to be dealt with Some facts Galen Albret had well in hand Others eluded him persistently He had of course known promptly enough of the disappearance of a canoe and had thereupon dispatched his Indians to the recapture The Reverend Archibald Crane had reported that two figures had been seen in the act of leaving camp one by the river the other by the Woods Trail But here the Factor s investigations encountered a check The rifle brought in by his Indians to his bewilderment he recognized not at all His repeated cross questionings when they touched on the question of Ned Trent s companion got no farther than the Cree wooden stolidity No they had seen no one neither presence sign nor trail But Galen Albret versed in the psychology of his savage allies knew they lied He suspected them of clan loyalty to one of their own number and yet they had never failed him before Now his heavy revolver at his right hand he interviewed Ned Trent alone except for the Indian by the portal As with the Indians his cross examination had borne scant results The best of his questions but involved him in a maze of baffling surmises Gradually his anger had mounted until now the Indian at the door knew by the wax like appearance of the more prominent places on his deeply carved countenance that he had nearly reached the point of outbreak Swiftly like the play of rapiers the questions and answers broke across the still room You had aid the Factor asserted positively You think so My Indians say you were alone But where did you get this rifle I stole it You were alone Ned Trent paused for a barely appreciable instant It was not possible that the Indians had failed to establish the girl s presence and he feared a trap Then he caught the expressive eye of Me en gan at the door Evidently Virginia had friends I was alone he repeated confidently That is a lie For though my Indians were deceived two people were observed by my clergyman to leave the Post immediately before I sent out to your capture One rounded the island in a canoe the other took the Woods Trail Bully for the Church replied Trent imperturbably Better promote him to your scouts Who was that second person Do you think I will tell you I think I ll find means to make you tell me burst out the Factor Ned Trent was silent If you ll tell me the name of that man I ll let you go free I ll give you a permit to trade in the country It touches my authority my discipline The affair becomes a precedent It is vital Ned Trent fixed his eyes on the bay and hummed a little air half turning his shoulder to the older man The latter s face blazed with suppressed fury Twice his hand rested almost convulsively on the butt of his heavy revolver Ned Trent he cried harshly at last pay attention to me I ve had enough of this I swear if you do not tell me what I want to know within five minutes I ll hang you to day The young man spun on his heel Hanging he cried You cannot mean that The Free Trader measured him up and down saw that his purpose was sincere and turned slowly pale under the bronze of his out of door tan Hanging is always a dreadful death but in the Far North it carries an extra stigma of ignominy with it inasmuch as it is resorted to only with the basest malefactors Shooting is the usual form of execution for all but the most despicable crimes He turned away with a little gesture Well cried Albret Ned Trent locked his lips in a purposeful straight line of silence To such an outrage there could be nothing to say The Factor jerked his watch to the table I said five minutes he repeated I mean it Illustration GO TO THE DEVIL Scene from the play The young man leaned against the side of the window his arms folded his back to the room Outside the varied life of the Post went forward under his eyes He even noted with a surface interest the fact that out across the river a loon was floating and remarked that never before had he seen one of those birds so far north Galen Albret struck the table with the flat of his hand Done he cried This is the last chance I shall give you Speak at this instant or accept the consequences Ned Trent turned sharply as though breaking a thread that bound him to the distant prospect beyond the window For an instant he stared enigmatically at his opponent Then in the sweetest tones Oh go to the devil said he and began to walk deliberately toward the older man There lay between the window and the head of the table perhaps a dozen ordinary steps for the room was large The young man took them slowly his eyes fixed with burning intensity on the seated figure the muscles of his locomotion contracting and relaxing with the smooth stealthy continuity of a cat Galen Albret again laid hand on his revolver Come no nearer he commanded Me en gan left the door and glided along the wall But the table intervened between him and the Free Trader The latter paid no attention to the Factor s command Galen Albret suddenly raised his weapon from the table Stop or I ll fire he cried sharply I mean just that said Ned Trent between his clenched teeth But ten feet separated the two men Galen Albret levelled the revolver Ned Trent watchful prepared to spring Me en gan near the foot of the table gathered himself for attack Then suddenly the Free Trader relaxed his muscles straightened his back and returned deliberately to the window Facing about in astonishment to discover the reason for this sudden change of decision the other two men looked into the face of Virginia Albret standing in the doorway of the other room Father she cried You must go back said Ned Trent speaking clearly and collectedly in the hope of imposing his will on her obvious excitement This is not an affair in which you should interfere Galen Albret send her away The Factor had turned squarely in his heavy arm chair to regard the girl a frown on his brows Virginia he commanded in deliberate stern tones of authority leave the room You have nothing to do with this case and I do not desire your interference Virginia stepped bravely beyond the portals and stopped Her fingers were nervously interlocked her lip trembled in her cheeks the color came and went but her eyes met her father s unfaltering I have more to do with it than you think she replied Instantly Ned Trent was at the table I really think this has gone far enough he interposed We have had our interview and come to a decision Miss Albret must not be permitted to exaggerate a slight sentiment of pity into an interest in my affairs If she knew that such a demonstration only made it worse for me I am sure she would say no more He looked at her appealingly across the Factor s shoulder Me en gan was already holding open the door You come he smiled beseechingly But the Factor s suspicions were aroused Illustration I HAVE MORE TO DO WITH IT THAN YOU THINK Scene from the play There is something in this he decided I think you may stay Virginia You are right broke in the young man desperately There is something in it Miss Albret knows who gave me the rifle and she was about to inform you of his identity There is no need in subjecting her to that distasteful ordeal I am now ready to confess to you I beg you will ask her to leave the room Galen Albret in the midst of these warring intentions had sunk into his customary impassive calm The light had died from his eyes the expression from his face the energy from his body He sat an inert mass void of initiative his intelligence open to what might be brought to his notice Virginia this is true his heavy dead voice rumbled through his beard You know who aided this man Ned Trent mutely appealed to her her glance answered his Yes father she replied Who I did A dead silence fell on the room Galen Albret s expression and attitude did not change Through dull lifeless eyes from behind the heavy mask of his waxen face and white beard he looked steadily out upon nothing Along either arm of the chair stretched his own arms limp and heavy with inertia In suspense the other three inmates of the place watched him waiting for some change It did not come Finally his lips moved You he muttered questioningly I she repeated Another silence fell Why he asked at last Because it was an unjust thing Because we could not think of taking a life in that way without some reason for it Why he persisted taking no account of her reply Virginia let her gaze slowly rest on the Free Trader and her eyes filled with a world of tenderness and trust Because I love him said she softly Chapter Sixteen After an instant Galen Albret turned slowly his massive head and looked at her He made no other movement yet she staggered back as though she had received a violent blow on the chest Father she gasped Still slowly gropingly he arose to his feet holding tight to the edge of the table Behind him unheeded the rough built arm chair crashed to the floor He stood there upright and motionless looking straight before him his face formidable At first his speech was disjointed The words came in widely punctuated gasps Then as the wave of his emotion rolled back from the poise into which the first shock of anger had thrown it it escaped through his lips in a constantly increasing stream of bitter words You you love him he cried You my daughter You have been a traitor to me You have dared dared deny that which my whole life has affirmed My own flesh and blood when I thought the nearest metis of them all more loyal You love this man this man who has insulted me mocked me You have taken his part against me You have deliberately placed yourself in the class of those I would hang for such an offence If you were not my daughter I would hang you Hang my own child Suddenly his rage flared You little fool Do you dare set your judgment against mine Do you dare interfere where I think well Do you dare deny my will By the eternal I ll show you old as you are that you have still a father Get to your room Out of my sight He took two steps forward and so his eye fell on Ned Trent He uttered a scream of rage and reached for the pistol Fortunately the abruptness of his movement when he arose had knocked it to the floor so now in the blindness of a red anger he could not see it He shrieked out an epithet and jumped forward his arm drawn to strike Ned Trent leaped back into an attitude of defence All three of those present had many times seen Galen Albret possessed by his noted fits of anger so striking in contrast to his ordinary contained passivity But always though evidently in a white heat of rage and given to violent action and decision he had retained the clearest command of his faculties issuing coherent and dreaded orders to those about him Now he had become a raging wild beast And for the spectators the sight had all the horror of the unprecedented But the younger man too had gradually heated to the point where his ordinary careless indifference could give off sparks The interview had been baffling the threats real and unjust the turn of affairs when Virginia Albret entered the room most exasperating on the side of the undesirable and unforeseen In foiled escape in thwarted expedient his emotions had been many times excited and then eddied back on themselves The potentialities of as blind an anger as that of Galen Albret were in him It only needed a touch to loose the flood The physical threat of a blow supplied that touch As the two men faced each other both were ripe for the extreme of recklessness But while Galen Albret looked to nothing less than murder the Free Trader s individual genius turned to dead defiance and resistance of will While Galen Albret s countenance reflected the height of passion Trent was as smiling and cool and debonair as though he had at that moment received from the older man an extraordinary and particular favor Only his eyes shot a baleful blue flame and his words calmly enough delivered showed the extent to which his passion had cast policy to the winds Don t go too far I warn you said he As though the words had projected him bodily forward Galen Albret sprang to deliver his blow The Free Trader ducked rapidly threw his shoulder across the middle of the older man s body and by the very superiority of his position forced his antagonist to give ground That the struggle would have then continued body to body there can be no doubt had it not been for the fact that the Factor s retrogressive movement brought his knees sharply against the edge of a chair standing near the side of the table Albret lost his balance wavered and finally sat down violently Ned Trent promptly pinned him by the shoulder into powerless immobility Me en gan had possessed himself of the fallen pistol but beyond keeping a generally wary eye out for dangerous developments did not offer to interfere Your Indian is in such a crisis a disciplinarian and he had received no orders Now said Ned Trent acidly I think this will stop right here You do not cut a very good figure my dear sir he laughed a little You haven t cut a very good figure from the beginning you know You forbade me to do various things and I have done them all I traded with your Indians I came and went in your country Do you think I have not been here often before I was caught And you forbade me to see your daughter again I saw her that very evening and the next morning and the next evening He stood still holding Galen Albret immovably in the chair looking steadily and angrily into the Factor s eyes driving each word home with the weight of his contained passion The girl touched his arm Hush oh hush she cried in a panic Do not anger him further When you forbade me to make love to her he continued unheeding I laughed at you With a sudden swift motion of his left arm he drew her to him and touched her forehead with his lips Look Your commands have been rather ridiculous sir I seem to have had the upper hand of you from first to last Incidentally you have my life Oh welcome That is small pay and little satisfaction He threw himself from the Factor and stepped back Galen Albret sat still without attempting to renew the struggle The enforced few moments of inaction had restored to him his self control He was still deeply angered but the insanity of rage had left him Outwardly he was himself again Only a rapid heaving of his chest answered Ned Trent s quick breathing as the two men glared defiantly at each other in the pause that followed Very well sir said the Factor curtly at last Your time is over I find it unnecessary to hang you You will start on your Longue Traverse to day Oh cried Virginia in a low voice of agony and fluttered to her lover s side Hush hush he soothed her There is a chance You think so broke in Galen Albret harshly And looking at his set face and blazing eyes they saw that there was no chance The Free Trader shrugged his shoulders You are going to do this thing father appealed Virginia after what I have told you My mind is made up I shall not survive him father she threatened in a low voice Then as the Factor did not respond Do not misunderstand me I do not intend to survive him Silence silence silence cried Galen Albret in a crescendo outburst Silence I will not be gainsaid You have made your choice You are no longer a daughter of mine Father cried Virginia faintly her lips going pale Don t speak to me Don t look at me Get out of here Get out of the place I won t have you here another day another hour By The girl hesitated for a moment then ran to him sinking on her knees and clasping his hand Father she pleaded you are not yourself This has been very trying to you To morrow you will be sorry But then it will be too late Think while there is yet time He has not committed a crime You yourself told me he was a man of intelligence and daring a gentleman and surely though he has been hasty he has acted with a brave spirit through it all See he will promise you to go away quietly to say nothing of all this never to come into this country again without your permission He will do this if I ask him for he loves me Look at me father Are you going to treat your little girl so your Virginia You have never refused me anything before And this is the greatest thing in all my life She held his hand to her cheek and stroked it murmuring little feminine caressing phrases secure in her power of witchery which had never failed her before The sound of her own voice reassured her the quietude of the man she pleaded with A lifetime of petting of indulgence threw its soothing influence over her perturbation convincing her that somehow all this storm and stress must be phantasmagoric a dream from which she was even now awakening into a clearer day of happiness For you love me father she concluded and looked up daintily with a pathetic coquettish tilt of her fair head to peer into his face Galen Albret snarled like a wild beast throwing aside the girl as he did the chair in which he had been sitting Ned Trent caught her reeling in his arms For as is often the case with passionate but strong temperaments though the Factor had attained a certain calm of control the turmoil of his deeper anger had not been in the least stilled Over it a crust of determination had formed the determination to make an end by the directest means in his autocratic power of this galling opposition The girl s pleading instead of appealing to him had in reality but stirred his fury the more profoundly It had added a new fuel element to the fire Heretofore his consciousness had felt merely the thwarting of his pride his authority his right to loyalty Now his daughter s entreaty brought home to him the bitter realization that he had been attained on another side that of his family affection This man had also killed for him his only child For the child had renounced him had thrust him outside herself into the lonely and ruined temple of his pride At the first thought his face twisted with emotion then hardened to cold malice Love you he cried Love you An unnatural child An ingrate One who turns from me so lightly He laughed bitterly eyeing her with chilling scrutiny You dare recall my love for you Suddenly he stood upright levelling a heavy trembling arm at her You think an appeal to my love will save him Fool Virginia s breath caught in her throat She straightened clutched the neckband of her gown Then her head fell slowly forward She had fainted in her lover s arms They stood exactly so for an appreciable interval bewildered by the suddenness of this outcome Galen Albret s hand out stretched in denunciation the girl like a broken lily supported in the young man s arms he searching her face passionately for a sign of life Me en gan straight and sorrowful again at the door Then the old man s arm dropped slowly His gaze wavered The lines of his face relaxed Twice he made an effort to turn away All at once his stubborn spirit broke he uttered a cry and sprang forward to snatch the unconscious form hungrily into his bear clasp searching the girl s face muttering incoherent things Quick he cried aloud the guttural sounds jostling one another in his throat Get Wishkobun quick Ned Trent looked at him with steady scorn his arms folded Ah he dropped distinctly in deliberate monosyllables across the surcharged atmosphere of the scene So it seems you have found your heart my friend Galen Albret glared wildly at him over the girl s fair head She is my daughter he mumbled Chapter Seventeen They carried the unconscious girl into the dim lighted apartment of the curtained windows and laid her on the divan Wishkobun hastily summoned unfastened the girl s dress at the throat It is a faint she announced in her own tongue She will recover in a few minutes I will get some water Ned Trent wiped the moisture from his forehead with his handkerchief The danger he had undergone coolly but this overcame his iron self control Galen Albret like an anxious bear weaved back and forth the length of the couch In him the rumble of the storm was but just echoing into distance Go into the next room he growled at the Free Trader when finally he noticed the latter s presence Ned Trent hesitated Go I say snarled the Factor You can do nothing here He followed the young man to the door which he closed with his own hand and then turned back to the couch on which his daughter lay In the middle of the floor his foot clicked on some small object Mechanically he picked it up It proved to be a little silver match safe of the sort universally used in the Far North Evidently the Free Trader had flipped it from his pocket with his handkerchief The Factor was about to thrust it into his own pocket when his eye caught lettering roughly carved across one side Still mechanically he examined it more closely The lettering was that of a man s name The man s name was Graehme Stewart Without thinking of what he did he dropped the object on the small table and returned anxiously to the girl s side cursing the tardiness of the Indian woman But in a moment Wishkobun returned Will she recover asked the Factor distracted at the woman s deliberate examination The latter smiled her indulgent slow smile But surely she assured him in her own tongue it is no more than if she cut her finger In a few breaths she will recover Now I will go to the house of the Cockburn for a morsel of the sweet wood A which she must smell She looked her inquiry for permission Footnote A Camphor Sagaamig go assented Albret Relieved in mind he dropped into a chair His eye caught the little silver match safe He picked it up and fell to staring at the rudely carved letters He found that he was alone with his daughter and the thoughts aroused by the dozen letters of a man s name All his life long he had been a hard man His commands had been autocratic his anger formidable his punishments severe and sometimes cruel The quality of mercy was with him tenuous and weak He knew this and if he did not exactly glory in it he was at least indifferent to its effect on his reputation with others But always he had been just The victims of his displeasure might complain that his retributive measures were harsh that his forgiveness could not be evoked by even the most extenuating of circumstances but not that his anger had ever been baseless or the punishment undeserved Thus he had held always his own self respect and from his self respect had proceeded his iron and effective rule So in the case of the young man with whom now his thoughts were occupied Twice he had warned him from the country without the punishment which the third attempt rendered imperative The events succeeding his arrival at Conjuror s House warmed the Factor s anger to the heat of almost preposterous retribution perhaps for after all a man s life is worth something even in the wilds but it was actually retribution and not merely a ruthless proof of power It might be justice as only the Factor saw it but it was still essentially justice in the broader sense that to each act had followed a definite consequence Although another might have condemned his conduct as unnecessarily harsh Galen Albret s conscience was satisfied and at rest Nor had his resolution been permanently affected by either the girl s threat to make away with herself or by his momentary softening when she had fainted The affair was thereby complicated but that was all In the sincerity of the threat he recognized his own iron nature and was perhaps a little pleased at its manifestation He knew she intended to fulfil her promise not to survive her lover but at the moment this did not reach his fears it only aroused further his dogged opposition The Free Trader s speech as he left the room however had touched the one flaw in Galen Albret s confidence of righteousness Wearied with the struggles and the passions he had undergone his brain numbed his will for the moment in abeyance he seated himself and contemplated the images those two words had called up Graehme Stewart That man he had first met at Fort Rae over twenty years ago It was but just after he had married Virginia s mother At once his imagination with the keen pictorial power of those who have dwelt long in the Silent Places brought forward the other scene that of his wooing He had driven his dogs into Fort la Cloche after a hard day s run in seventy five degrees of frost Weary hungry half frozen he had staggered into the fire lit room Against the blaze he had caught for a moment a young girl s profile lost as she turned her face toward him in startled question of his entrance Men had cared for his dogs The girl had brought him hot tea In the corner of the fire they two had whispered one to the other the already grizzled traveller of the silent land the fresh brave north maiden At midnight their parkas drawn close about their faces in the fearful cold they had met outside the inclosure of the Post An hour later they were away under the aurora for Qu Apelle Galen Albret s nostrils expanded as he heard the crack crack crack of the remorseless dog whip whose sting drew him away from the vain pursuit After the marriage at Qu Apelle they had gone a weary journey to Rae and there he had first seen Graehme Stewart Fort Rae is on the northwestward arm of the Great Slave Lake in the country of the Dog Ribs only four degrees under the Arctic Circle It is a dreary spot for the Barren Grounds are near Men see only the great lake the great sky the great gray country They become moody fanciful In the face of the silence they have little to say At Fort Rae were old Jock Wilson the Chief Trader Father Bonat the priest Andrew Levoy the metis clerk four Dog Rib teepees Galen Albret and his bride and Graehme Stewart Jock Wilson was sixty five Father Bonat had no age Andrew Levoy possessed the years of dour silence Only Graehme Stewart and Elodie bride of Albret were young In the great gray country their lives were like spots of color on a mist Galen Albret finally became jealous At first there was nothing to be done but finally Levoy brought to the older man proof of the younger s guilt The harsh traveller bowed his head and wept But since he loved Elodie more than himself which was perhaps the only redeeming feature of this sorry business he said nothing nor did more than to journey south to Edmonton leaving the younger man alone in Fort Rae to the White Silence But his soul was stirred In the course of nature and of time Galen Albret had a daughter but lost a wife It was no longer necessary for him to leave his wrong unavenged Then began a series of baffling hindrances which resulted finally in his stooping to means repugnant to his open sense of what was due himself At the first he could not travel to his enemy because of the child in his care when finally he had succeeded in placing the little girl where he would be satisfied to leave her he himself was suddenly and peremptorily called east to take a post in Rupert s Land He could not disobey and remain in the Company and the Company was more to him than life or revenge The little girl he left in Sacre Coeur of Quebec he himself took up his residence in the Hudson Bay country After a few years becoming lonely for his own flesh and blood he sent for his daughter There as Factor he gained a vast power and this power he turned into the channels of his hatred Graehme Stewart felt always against him the hand of influence His posts in the Company s service became intolerable At length in indignation against continued injustice oppression and insult he resigned broken in fortune and in prospects He became one of the earliest Free Traders on the Saskatchewan devoting his energies to enraged opposition of the Company which had wronged him In the space of three short years he had met a violent and striking death for the early days of the Free Trader were adventurous Galen Albret s revenge had struck home Then in after years the Factor had again met with Andrew Levoy The man staggered into Conjuror s House late at night He had started from Winnipeg to descend the Albany River but had met with mishap and starvation One by one his dogs had died In some blind fashion he pushed on for days after his strength and sanity had left him Mu hi kun had brought him in His toes and fingers had frozen and dropped off his face was a mask of black frost bitten flesh in which deep fissures opened to the raw He had gone snow blind Scarcely was he recognizable as a human being From such a man in extremity could come nothing but the truth so Galen Albret believed him Before Andrew Levoy died that night he told of his deceit The Factor left the room with the weight of a crime on his conscience For Graehme Stewart had been innocent of any wrong toward him or his bride Such was the story Galen Albret saw in the little silver match box That was the one flaw in his consciousness of righteousness the one instance in a long career when his ruthless acts of punishment or reprisal had not rested on rigid justice and by the irony of fate the one instance had touched him very near Now here before him was his enemy s son he wondered that he had not discovered the resemblance before and he was about to visit on him the severest punishment in his power Was not this an opportunity vouchsafed him to repair his ancient fault to cleanse his conscience of the one sin of the kind it would acknowledge But then over him swept the same blur of jealousy that had resulted in Graehme Stewart s undoing This youth wooed his daughter he had won her affections away Strangely enough Galen Albret confused the new and the old again youth cleaved to youth leaving age apart Age felt fiercely the desire to maintain its own The Factor crushed the silver match box between his great palms and looked up His daughter lay before him still lifeless Deliberately he rested his chin on his hands and contemplated her The room as always was full of contrast shafts of light dust moted bewildering crossed from the embrasured windows throwing high lights into prominence and shadows into impenetrable darkness They rendered the gray clad figure of the girl vague and ethereal like a mist above a stream they darkened the dull hued couch on which she rested into a liquid impalpable black they hazed the draped background of the corner into a far reaching distance so that finally to Galen Albret staring with hypnotic intensity it came to seem that he looked upon a pure and disembodied spirit sleeping sweetly cradled on illimitable space The ordinary and familiar surroundings all disappeared His consciousness accepted nothing but the cameo profile of marble white the nimbus of golden haze about the head the mist like suggestion of a body and again the clear marble spot of the hands All else was a background of modulated depths So gradually the old man s spirit wearied by the stress of the last hour turned in on itself and began to create The cameo profile the mist like body the marble hands remained but now Galen Albret saw other things as well A dim rare perfume was wafted from some unseen space indistinct flashes of light spotted the darknesses faint swells of music lifted the silence intermittently These things were small and still and under the external consciousness like the voices one may hear beneath the roar of a tumbling rapid but gradually they defined themselves The perfume came to Galen Albret s nostrils on the wings of incensed smoke the flashes of light steadied to the ovals of candle flames the faint swells of music blended into grand breathed organ chords He felt about him the dim awe of the church he saw the tapers burning at head and foot the clear calm face of the dead smiling faintly that at last it should be no more disturbed So had he looked all one night and all one day in the long time ago The Factor stretched his arms out to the figure on the couch but he called upon his wife gone these twenty years Elodie Elodie he murmured softly She had never known it thank God but he had wronged her too In all sorrow and sweet heavenly pity he had believed that her youth had turned to the youth of the other man It had not been so Did he not owe her too some reparation As though in answer to his appeal or perhaps that merely the sound of a human voice had broken the last shreds of her swoon the girl moved slightly Galen Albret did not stir Slowly Virginia turned her head until finally her wandering eyes met his fixed on her with passionate intensity For a moment she stared at him then comprehension came to her along with memory She cried out and sat upright in one violent motion He He she cried Is he gone Instantly Galen Albret had her in his arms It is all right he soothed drawing her close to his great breast All right You are my own little girl Chapter Eighteen For perhaps ten minutes Ned Trent lingered near the door of the Council Room until he had assured himself that Virginia was in no serious danger Then he began to pace the room examining minutely the various objects that ornamented it He paused longest at the full length portrait of Sir George Simpson the Company s great traveller with his mild blue eyes his kindly face denying the potency of his official frown his snowy hair and whiskers The painted man and the real man looked at each other inquiringly The latter shook his head You travelled the wild country far said he thoughtfully You knew many men of many lands And wherever you went they tell me you made friends And yet as you embodied this Company to all these people and so made for the fanatical loyalty that is destroying me I suppose you and I are enemies He shrugged his shoulders whimsically and turned away Thence he cast a fleeting glance out the window at the long reach of the Moose and the blue bay gleaming in the distance He tried the outside door It was locked Taken with a new idea he proceeded at once to the third door of the apartment It opened He found himself in a small and much littered room containing a desk two chairs a vast quantity of papers a stuffed bird or so and a row of account books Evidently the Factor s private office Ned Trent returned to the main room and listened intently for several minutes After that he ran back to the office and began hastily to open and rummage one after another the drawers of the desk He discovered and concealed several bits of string a desk knife and a box of matches Then he uttered a guarded exclamation of delight He had found a small revolver and with it part of a box of cartridges A chance he exulted a chance The game would be desperate He would be forced first of all to seek out and kill the men detailed to shadow him a toy revolver against rifles white man against trained savages And after that he would have with the cartridges remaining to assure his subsistence Still it was a chance He closed the drawers and the door and resumed his seat in the arm chair by the council table For over an hour thereafter he awaited the next move in the game He was already swinging up the pendulum arc The case did not appear utterly hopeless He resolved through Me en gan whom he divined as a friend of the girl s to smuggle a message to Virginia bidding her hope Already his imagination had conducted him to Quebec when in August he would search her out and make her his own Soon one of the Indian servants entered the room for the purpose of conducting him to a smaller apartment where he was left alone for some time longer Food was brought him He ate heartily for he considered that wise Then at last the summons for which he had been so long in readiness Me en gan himself entered the room and motioned him to follow Illustration DO SO NOW Scene from the play Ned Trent had already prepared his message on the back of an envelope writing it with the lead of a cartridge He now pressed the bit of paper into the Indian s palm For O mi mi he explained Me en gan bored him through with his bead like eyes of the surface lights Nin nissitotam he agreed after a moment He led the way Ned Trent followed through the narrow uncarpeted hall with the faded photograph of Westminster down the crooked steep stairs with the creaking degrees and finally into the Council Room once more with its heavy rafters its two fireplaces its long table and its narrow windows Beka wait commanded Me en gan and left him Ned Trent had supposed he was being conducted to the canoe which should bear him on the first stage of his long journey but now he seemed condemned again to take up the wearing uncertainty of inaction The interval was not long however Almost immediately the other door opened and the Factor entered His movements were abrupt and impatient for with whatever grace such a man yields to his better instincts the actual carrying out of their conditions is a severe trial For one thing it is a species of emotional nakedness invariably repugnant to the self contained Ned Trent observing this and misinterpreting its cause hugged the little revolver to his side with grim satisfaction The interview was likely to be stormy If worst came to worst he was at least assured of reprisal before his own end The Factor walked directly to the head of the table and his customary arm chair in which he disposed himself Sit down he commanded the younger man indicating a chair at his elbow The latter warily obeyed Galen Albret hesitated appreciably Then as one would make a plunge into cold water quickly in one motion he laid on the table something over which he held his hand You are wondering why I am interviewing you again said he It is because I have become aware of certain things When you left me a few hours ago you dropped this He moved his hand to one side The silver match safe lay on the table Yes it is mine agreed Ned Trent On one side is carved a name Yes Whose The Free Trader hesitated My father s he said at last I thought that must be so You will understand when I tell you that at one time I knew him very well You knew my father cried Ned Trent excitedly Yes At Fort Rae and elsewhere But I do not remember you I was brought up at Winnipeg the other explained Once pursued Galen Albret I did your father a wrong unintentionally but nevertheless a great wrong For that reason and others I am going to give you your life What wrong demanded Ned Trent with dawning excitement I forced him from the Company You Yes I Proof was brought me that he had won from me my young wife It could not be doubted I could not kill him Afterward the man who deceived me confessed He is now dead Ned Trent gasping rose slowly to his feet One hand stole inside his jacket and clutched the butt of the little pistol You did that he cried hoarsely You tell me of it yourself Do you wish to know the real reason for my coming into this country why I have traded in defiance of the Company throughout the whole Far North I have thought my father was persecuted by a body of men and though I could not do much still I have accomplished what I could to avenge him Had I known that a single man had done this and you are that man He came a step nearer Galen Albret regarded him steadily If I had known this before I should never have rested until I had hunted you down until I had killed you even in the midst of your own people cried the Free Trader at last Galen Albret drew his heavy revolver and laid it on the table Do so now he said quietly A pause fell on them pregnant with possibility The Free Trader dropped his head No he groaned No I cannot She stands in the way So that after all concluded the Factor in a gentler tone than he had yet employed we two shall part peaceably I have wronged you greatly though without intention Perhaps one balances the other We will let it pass Yes agreed Ned Trent with an effort we will let it pass They mused in silence while the Factor drummed on the table with the stubby fingers of his right hand I am dispatching to day he announced curtly at length the Abitibi brigade Matters of importance brought by runner from Rupert s House force me to do so a month earlier than I had expected I shall send you out with that brigade Very well You will find your packs and arms in the canoe quite intact Thank you The Factor examined the young man s face with some deliberation You love my daughter truly he asked quietly Yes replied Ned Trent also quietly That is well for she loves you And went on the old man throwing his massive head back proudly my people love well I won her mother in a day and nothing could stay us God be thanked you are a man and brave and clean Enough of that I place the brigade under your command You must be responsible for it for I am sending no other white the crew are Indians and metis All right agreed Ned Trent indifferently My daughter you will take to Sacre Coeur at Quebec Virginia cried the young man I am sending her to Quebec I had not intended doing so until July but the matters from Rupert s House make it imperative now Virginia goes with me Yes You consent You Young man said Galen Albret not unkindly I give my daughter in your charge that is all You must take her to Sacre Coeur And you must be patient Next year I shall resign for I am getting old and then we shall see That is all I can tell you now He arose abruptly Come said he they are waiting They threw wide the door and stepped out into the open A breeze from the north brought a draught of air like cold water in its refreshment The waters of the North sparkled and tossed in the silvery sun Ned Trent threw his arms wide in the physical delight of a new freedom But his companion was already descending the steps He followed across the square grass plot to the two bronze guns A noise of peoples came down the breeze In a moment he saw them the varied multitude of the Post gathered to speed the brigade on its distant journey The little beach was crowded with the Company s people and with Indians talking eagerly moving hither and yon in a shifting kaleidoscope of brilliant color Beyond the shore floated the long canoe with its curving ends and its emblazonment of the five pointed stars Already its baggage was aboard its crew in place ten men in whose caps slanted long graceful feathers which proved them boatmen of a factor The women sat amidships When Galen Albret reached the edge of the plateau he stopped and laid his hand on the young man s arm As yet they were unperceived Then a single man caught sight of them He spoke to another the two informed still others In an instant the bright colors were dotted with upturned faces Listen said Galen Albret in his resonant chest tones of authority This is my son and he must be obeyed I give to him the command of this brigade See to it Without troubling himself further as to the crowd below Galen Albret turned to his companion I will say good by said he formally Good by replied Ned Trent All is at peace between us The Free Trader looked long into the man s sad eyes The hard proud spirit bowed in knightly expiation of its one fault for the first time in a long life of command looked out in petition All is at peace repeated Ned Trent They clasped hands And Virginia perceiving them so threw them a wonderful smile Chapter Nineteen Instantly the spell of inaction broke The crowd recommenced its babel of jests advices and farewells Ned Trent swung down the bank to the shore The boatmen fixed the canoe on the very edge of floating free Two of them lifted the young man aboard to a place on the furs by Virginia Albret s side At once the crowd pressed forward filling up the empty spaces Now Achille Picard bent his shoulders to lift into free water the stem of the canoe from its touch on the bank It floated caught gently by the back wash of the
