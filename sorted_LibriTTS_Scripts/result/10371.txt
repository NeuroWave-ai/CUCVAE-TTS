the other side of the slope were dripping also with raindrops The road flinty and light grey in colour was greasy with repellent looking mud there were puddles even in the asphalt covered pathway which he trod On either side of him stretched the shrunken unpastoral looking fields of an industrial neighbourhood The town village which stretched up the hillside before him presented scarcely a single redeeming feature The small grey stone houses hard and unadorned were interrupted at intervals by rows of brand new red brick cottages In the background were the tall chimneys of several factories on the left a colliery shaft raised its smoke blackened finger to the lowering clouds After his first glance around at these familiar and unlovely objects Philip Romilly walked with his head a little thrown back his eyes lifted as though with intent to the melancholy and watery skies He was a young man well above medium height slim almost inclined to be angular yet with a good carriage notwithstanding a stoop which seemed more the result of an habitual depression than occasioned by any physical weakness His features were large his mouth querulous a little discontented his eyes filled with the light of a silent and rebellious bitterness which seemed somehow to have found a more or less permanent abode in his face His clothes although they were neat had seen better days He was ungloved and he carried under his arm a small parcel which appeared to contain a book carefully done up in brown paper As he reached the outskirts of the village he slackened his pace Standing a little way back from the road from which they were separated by an ugly gravelled playground were the familiar school buildings with the usual inscription carved in stone above the door He laid his hand upon the wooden gate and paused From inside he could catch the drone of children s voices He glanced at his watch It was barely twenty minutes past four For a moment he hesitated Then he strolled on and turning at the gate of an adjoining cottage the nearest to the schools of a little unlovely row he tried the latch found it yield to his touch and stepped inside He closed the door behind him and turned with a little weary sigh of content towards a large easy chair drawn up in front of the fire For a single moment he seemed about to throw himself into its depths his long fingers indeed a little blue with the cold seemed already on their way towards the genial warmth of the flames Then he stopped short He stood perfectly still in an attitude of arrested motion his eyes wonderingly at first and then with a strange unanalysable expression seeming to embark upon a lengthened a scrupulous an almost horrified estimate of his surroundings To the ordinary observer there would have been nothing remarkable in the appearance of the little room save its entirely unexpected air of luxury and refinement There was a small Chippendale sideboard against the wall a round gate legged table on which stood a blue china bowl filled with pink roses a couple of luxurious easy chairs some old prints upon the wall On the sideboard was a basket as yet unpacked filled with hothouse fruit and on a low settee by the side of one of the easy chairs were a little pile of reviews several volumes of poetry and a couple of library books In the centre of the mantelpiece was a photograph the photograph of a man a little older perhaps than this newly arrived visitor with rounder face dressed in country tweeds a flower in his buttonhole the picture of a prosperous man yet with a curious almost disturbing likeness to the pale over nervous loose framed youth whose eye had been attracted by its presence and who was gazing at it spellbound Douglas he muttered Douglas He flung his hat upon the table and for a moment his hand rested upon his forehead He was confronted with a mystery which baffled him a mystery whose sinister possibilities were slowly framing themselves in his mind While he stood there he was suddenly conscious of the sound of the opening gate brisk footsteps up the tiled way the soft swirl of a woman s skirt The latch was raised the door opened and closed The newcomer stood upon the threshold gazing at him Philip she exclaimed Why Philip There was a curious change in the girl s tone from almost glad welcome to a note of abrupt fear in that last pronouncement of his name She stood looking at him the victim apparently of so many emotions that there was nothing definite to be drawn either from her tone or expression She was a young woman of medium height and slim delicate figure attractive with large discontented mouth full clear eyes and a wealth of dark brown hair She was very simply dressed and yet in a manner which scarcely suggested the school teacher To the man who confronted her his left hand gripping the mantelpiece his eyes filled with a flaming jealousy there was something entirely new in the hang of her well cut skirt the soft colouring of her low necked blouse the greater animation of her piquant face with its somewhat dazzling complexion His hand flashed out towards her as he asked his question What does it mean

none	none	She showed signs of recovering herself With a little shrug of the shoulders she turned towards the door which led into an inner room Let me get you some tea Philip she begged You look so cold and wet Stay here please he insisted She paused reluctantly There was a curious lack of anything peremptory in his manner yet somehow although she would have given the world to have passed for a few moments into the shelter of the little kitchen beyond she was impelled to do as he bade her Don t be silly Philip she said petulantly You know you want some tea and so do I Sit down please and make yourself comfortable Why didn t you let me know you were coming Perhaps it would have been better he agreed quietly However since I am here answer my question She drew a little breath After all although she was lacking in any real strength of character she was filled with a certain compensatory doggedness His challenge was there to be faced There was no way out of it She would have lied willingly enough but for the sheer futility of falsehood She commenced the task of bracing herself for the struggle You had better she said frame your question a little more exactly I will then try to answer it He was stung by her altered demeanour embarrassed by an avalanche of words A hundred questions were burning upon his lips It was by a great effort of self control that he remained coherent The last time I visited you he began was three months ago Your cottage then was furnished as one would expect it to be furnished You had a deal dresser a deal table one rather hard easy chair and a very old wicker one You had if I remember rightly a strip of linoleum upon the floor and a single rug Your flowers were from the hedges and your fruit from the one apple tree in the garden behind Your clothes am I mistaken about your clothes or are you dressed more expensively I am dressed more expensively she admitted You and I both know the value of these things he went on with a little sweep of the hand We know the value of them because we were once accustomed to them because we have both since experienced the passionate craving for them or the things they represent Chippendale furniture a Turkey carpet roses in January hothouse fruit Bartolozzi prints do not march with an income of fifty pounds a year They do not she assented equably All the things which you see here and which you have mentioned are presents His forefinger shot out with a sudden vigour towards the photograph From him From Douglas she admitted from your cousin He took the photograph into his hand looked at it for a moment and dashed it into the grate The glass of the frame was shivered into a hundred pieces The girl only shrugged her shoulders She was holding herself in reserve As for him his eyes were hot there was a dry choking in his throat He had passed through many weary and depressed days struggling always against the grinding monotony of life and his surroundings Now for the first time he felt that there was something worse What does it mean he asked once more She seemed almost to dilate as she answered him Her feet were firmly planted upon the ground There was a new look in her face a look of decision She was more or less a coward but she felt no fear She even leaned a little towards him and looked him in the face It means she pronounced slowly exactly what it seems to mean The words conveyed horrible things to him but he was speechless He could only wait You and I Philip she continued have been well I suppose we should call it engaged for three years During those three years I have earned by disgusting and wearisome labour just enough to keep me alive in a world which has had nothing to offer me but ugliness and discomfort and misery You as you admitted last time we met have done no better You have lived in a garret and gone often hungry to bed For three years this has been going on All that time I have waited for you to bring something human something reasonable something warm into my life and you have failed I have passed in those three years from twenty three to twenty six In three more I shall be in my thirtieth year that is to say the best time of my life will have passed You see I have been thinking and I have had enough He stood quite dumb The girl s newly revealed personality seemed to fill the room He felt crowded out She was at that stage absolutely mistress of the situation She passed him carelessly by flung herself into the easy chair and crossed her legs As though he were looking at some person in another world he realized that she was wearing shoes of shapely cut and silk stockings Our engagement she went on was at first the dearest thing in life to me It could have been the most wonderful thing in life I am only an ordinary person with an ordinary character but I have the capacity to love unselfishly and I am at heart as faithful and as good as any other woman But there is my birthright I have had three years of sordid and utterly miserable life teaching squalid dirty unlovable children things they had much better not know I have lived here here in Detton Magna among the smuts and the mists where the flowers seem withered and even the meadows are stony where the people are hard and coarse as their ugly houses where virtue is ugly and vice is ugly and living is ugly and death is fearsome And now you see what I have chosen not in a moment s folly mind because I am not foolish not in a moment s passion either because until now the only real feeling I have had in life was for you But I have chosen and I hold to my choice They won t let you stay here he muttered They needn t she answered calmly There are other ways in which I can at least earn as much as the miserable pittance doled out to me here I have avoided even considering them before Shall I tell you why Because I didn t want to face the temptation they might bring with them I always knew what would happen if escape became hopeless It s the ugliness I can t stand the ugliness of cheap food cheap clothes uncomfortable furniture coarse voices coarse friends if I would have them How do you suppose I have lived here these last three years a teacher in the national schools Look up and down this long dreary street at the names above the shops at the villas in which the tradespeople live and ask yourself where my friends were to come from The clergyman perhaps He is over seventy a widower and he never comes near the place Why I d have been content to have been patronized if there had been anyone here to do it who wore the right sort of clothes and said the right sort of thing in the right tone But the others well that s done with He remained curiously dumb His eyes were fixed upon the fragments of the photograph in the grate In a corner of the room an old fashioned clock ticked wheezily A lump of coal fell out on the hearth which she replaced mechanically with her foot His silence seemed to irritate and perplex her She looked away from him drew her chair a little closer to the fire and sat with her head resting upon her hands Her tone had become almost meditative I knew that this would come one day she went on Why don t you speak and get it over Are you waiting to clothe your phrases Are you afraid of the naked words I m not Let me hear them Don t be more melodramatic than you can help because as you know I am cursed with a sense of humour but don t stand there saying nothing He raised his eyes and looked at her in silence an alternative which she found it hard to endure Then after a moment s shivering recoil into her chair she sprang to her feet 
2473_157859_000042_000005	train-clean-360	Listen 
none	none	she cried passionately I don t care what you think I tell you that if you were really a man if you had a man s heart in your body you d have sinned yourself before now robbed some one murdered them torn the things that make life from the fate that refuses to give them What is it they pay you she went on contemptuously at that miserable art school of yours Sixty pounds a year How much do you get to eat and drink out of that What sort of clothes have you to wear Are you content Yet even you have been better off than I You have always your chance Your play may be accepted or your stories published I haven t even had that forlorn hope But even you Philip may wait too long There are too many laws nowadays for life to be lived naturally If I were a man a man like you I d break them Her taunts apparently moved him no more than the inner tragedy which her words had revealed He did not for one moment give any sign of abandoning the unnatural calm which seemed to have descended upon him He took up his hat from the table and thrust the little brown paper parcel which he had been carrying into his pocket His eyes for a single moment met the challenge of hers and again she was conscious of some nameless inexplicable fear Perhaps he said as he turned away I may do that His hand was upon the latch before she realized that he was actually going She sprang to her feet Abuse scorn upbraidings even violence she had been prepared for all of these There was something about this self restraint however this strange brooding silence which terrified her more than anything she could have imagined Philip she shrieked You re not going You re not going like this You haven t said anything He closed the door with firm fingers Her knees trembled she was conscious of an unexpected weakness She abandoned her first intention of following him and stood before the window holding tightly to the sash He had reached the gate now and paused for a moment looking up the long windy street Then he crossed to the other side of the road stepped over a stile and disappeared walking without haste with firm footsteps along a cindered path which bordered the sluggish looking canal He had come and gone and she knew what fear was CHAPTER II The railway station at Detton Magna presented if possible an even more dreary appearance than earlier in the day as the time drew near that night for the departure of the last train northwards Its long strip of flinty platform was utterly deserted Around the three flickering gas lamps the drizzling rain fell continuously The weary porter came yawning out of his lamp room into the booking office where the station master sat alone his chair turned away from the open wicket window to the smouldering embers of the smoky fire No passengers to night seemingly the latter remarked to his subordinate Not a sign of one was the reply That young chap who came down from London on a one day return excursion hasn t gone back either That ll do his ticket in The outside door was suddenly opened and closed The sound of footsteps approaching the ticket window was heard A long white hand was thrust through the aperture a voice was heard from the invisible outside Third to Detton Junction please The station master took the ticket from a little rack received the exact sum he demanded swept it into the till and resumed his place before the fire The porter with the lamp in his hand lounged out into the booking hall The prospective passenger however was nowhere in sight He looked back into the office Was that Jim Spender going up to see his barmaid again he asked his superior The station master yawned drowsily Didn t notice he answered What an old woman you re getting George Want to know everybody s business don t you The porter withdrew a little huffed When a few minutes later the train drew in he even avoided ostentatiously a journey to the far end of the platform to open the door for the solitary passenger who was standing there He passed up the train and slammed the door without even glancing in at the window Then he stood and watched the red lights disappear Was it Jim the station master asked him on their way out Didn t notice his subordinate replied a little curtly Maybe it was and maybe it wasn t

none	none	Philip Romilly sat back in the corner of his empty third class carriage peering out of the window in which he could see only the reflection of the feeble gas lamp There was no doubt about it however they were moving The first stage of his journey had commenced The blessed sense of motion after so long waiting at first soothed and then exhilarated him In a few moments he became restless He let down the rain blurred window and leaned out The cool dampness of the night was immensely refreshing the rain softened his hot cheeks He sat there peering away into the shadows struggling for the sight of definite objects a tree a house the outline of a field anything to keep the other thoughts away the thoughts that came sometimes like the aftermath of a grisly unrealisable nightmare Then he felt chilly drew up the window thrust his hands into his pockets from which he drew out a handsome cigarette case struck a match and smoked with vivid appreciation of the quality of the tobacco examined the crest on the case as he put it away and finally patted with surreptitious eagerness the flat morocco letter case in his inside pocket At the Junction he made his way into the refreshment room and ordered a long whisky and soda which he drank in a couple of gulps Then he hastened to the booking office and took a first class ticket to Liverpool and a few minutes later secured a seat in the long north bound express which came gliding up to the side of the platform He spent some time in the lavatory washing arranging his hair straightening his tie after which he made his way into the elaborate dining car and found a comfortable corner seat The luxury of his surroundings soothed his jagged nerves The car was comfortably warmed the electric light upon his table was softly shaded The steward who waited upon him was swift footed and obsequious and seemed entirely oblivious of Philip s shabby half soaked clothes He ordered champagne a little vaguely and the wine ran through his veins with a curious potency He ate and drank now and then mechanically now and then with the keenest appetite Afterwards he smoked a cigar drank coffee and sipped a liqueur with the appreciation of a connoisseur A fellow passenger passed him an evening paper which he glanced through with apparent interest Before he reached his journey s end he had ordered and drunk another liqueur He tipped the steward handsomely It was the first well cooked meal which he had eaten for many months Arrived at Liverpool he entered a cab and drove to the Adelphi Hotel He made his way at once to the office His clothes were dry now and the rest and warmth had given him more confidence You have a room engaged for me I think he said mister Douglas Romilly I sent some luggage on The man merely glanced at him and handed him a ticket Number sixty seven sir on the second floor he announced A porter conducted him up stairs into a large well furnished bedroom A fire was blazing in the grate a dressing case a steamer trunk and a hatbox were set out at the foot of the bedstead The heavier luggage labelled for the hold sir the man told him is down stairs and will go direct to the steamer to morrow morning That was according to your instructions I believe Quite right Philip assented What time does the boat sail Three o clock sir Philip frowned This was his first disappointment He had fancied himself on board early in the day The prospect of a long morning s inaction seemed already to terrify him Not till the afternoon he muttered Matter of tide sir the man explained You can go on board any time after eleven o clock in the morning though Very much obliged to you sir The porter withdrew entirely satisfied with his tip Philip Romilly locked the door after him carefully Then he drew a bunch of keys from his pocket and after several attempts opened both the steamer trunk and the dressing case He surveyed their carefully packed contents with a certain grim and fantastic amusement handled the silver brushes shook out a purple brocaded dressing gown laid out a suit of clothes for the morrow even selected a shirt and put the links in it Finally he wandered into the adjoining bathroom took a hot bath packed away at the bottom of the steamer trunk the clothes which he had been wearing went to bed and slept CHAPTER III The sun was shining into his bedroom when Philip Romilly was awakened the next morning by a discreet tapping at the door He sat up in bed and shouted Come in He had no occasion to hesitate for a moment He knew perfectly well where he was he remembered exactly everything that had happened The knocking at the door was disquieting but he faced it without a tremor The floor waiter appeared and bowed deferentially There is a gentleman on the telephone wishes to speak to you sir he announced I have connected him with the instrument by your side To speak with me Philip repeated Are you quite sure Yes sir mister Douglas Romilly he asked for He said that his name was mister Gayes I believe The man left the room and Philip took up the receiver For a moment he sat and thought The situation was perplexing in a sense ominous yet it had to be faced He held the instrument to his ear Hullo Who s that he enquired That mister Romilly was the reply in a man s pleasant voice mister Douglas Romilly Yes Good I m Gayes mister Gayes of Gayes Brothers My people wrote me last night from Leicester that you would be here this morning You are crossing aren t you on the Elletania Philip remained monosyllabic Yes he admitted cautiously Can t you come round and see us this morning mister Gayes invited And look here mister Romilly in any case I want you to lunch with me at the club My car shall come round and fetch you at any time you say Sorry Philip replied I am very busy this morning and I am engaged for lunch 
2473_157859_000047_000004	train-clean-360	Oh 
none	none	come that s too bad the other protested I really want to have a chat with you on business matters mister Romilly Will you spare me half an hour if I come round Tell me exactly what it is you want Philip insisted Oh just the usual thing was the cheerful answer We hear you are off to America on a buying tour Our last advices don t indicate a very easy market over there I am not at all sure that we couldn t do better for you here and give you better terms Philip began to feel more sure of himself The situation after all he realized was not exactly alarming Very kind of you he said My arrangements are all made now though and I can t interfere with them Well I m going to bother you with a few quotations anyway See here I ll just run round to see you My car is waiting at the door now I won t keep you more than a few minutes Don t come before twelve Philip begged I shall be busy until then At twelve o clock precisely then was the reply I shall hope to induce you to change your mind about luncheon It s quite a long time since we had you at the club Good by Philip set down the telephone He was still in his pajamas and the morning was cold but he suddenly felt a great drop of perspiration on his forehead It was the sort of thing this which he had expected had been prepared for in fact but it was none the less in its way gruesome There was a further knock at the door and the waiter reappeared Can I bring you any breakfast sir he enquired What time is it Half past nine sir Bring me some coffee and rolls and butter Philip ordered He sprang out of bed bathed dressed and ate his breakfast Then he lit a cigarette repacked his dressing case and descended into the hall He made his way to the hall porter s enquiry office I am going to pay some calls in the city he announced mister Romilly is my name and I may not be able to get back here before my boat sails I am going on the Elletania Can I have my luggage sent there direct By all means sir Every article is properly labelled Philip continued Those in my bedroom number sixty seven are for the cabin and those you have in your charge are for the hold That will be quite all right sir the man assured him pocketing his liberal tip I will see to the matter myself Philip paid his bill at the office and breathed a little more freely as he left the hotel Passing a large plate glass window he stopped suddenly and stared at his own reflection There was something unfamiliar in the hang of his well cut clothes and fashionable Homburg hat It was like the shadow of some one else passing some one to whom those clothes belonged Then he remembered remembered with a cold shiver which blanched his cheeks and brought a little agonised murmur to his lips The moment passed however crushed down stifled as he had sworn that he would stifle all such memories He turned in at a barber s shop had his hair cut and yielded to the solicitations of a fluffy haired young lady who was dying to go to America if only somebody would take her and who was sure that he ought to have a manicure before his voyage Afterwards he entered a call office and rang up the hotel on the telephone mister Romilly speaking he announced Will you kindly tell mister Gayes if he calls to see me that I have been detained in the city and shall not be back The man took down the message Philip strolled out once more into the streets wandering aimlessly about for an hour or more By this time it was nearly one o clock and selecting a restaurant he entered and ordered luncheon Once more it came over him as he looked around the place that he had after all only a very imperfect hold upon his own identity It seemed impossible that he Philip Romilly should be there ordering precisely what appealed to him most without thought or care of the cost He ate and drank slowly and with discrimination and when he left the place he felt stronger He sought out a first class tobacconist s bought some cigarettes and enquired his way to the dock At a few minutes after two he passed up the gangway and boarded the great steamer One of the little army of linen coated stewards enquired the number of his room and conducted him below Anything I can do for you sir before your luggage comes on the man asked civilly Philip shook his head and wandered up on deck again where there were already a fair number of passengers in evidence He leaned over the side watching the constant stream of porters bearing supplies and the steerage passengers passing into the forepart of the ship With every moment his impatience grew He looked at his watch sometimes half a dozen times in ten minutes changed his position continually started violently whenever he heard an unexpected footstep behind him Finally he broke a promise he had made to himself He bought newspapers took them into a sheltered corner and tore them open Column by column he searched them through feverishly running his finger down one side and up the next It seemed impossible to find nowhere the heading he dreaded to see to realize that they were entirely empty of any exciting incident He satisfied himself at last however The disappearance of a half starved art teacher had not yet blazoned out to a sympathetic world It was so much to the good There was a touch upon his shoulder and he felt a chill of horror When he turned around it was the steward who had conducted him below holding out a telegram I beg your pardon sir he said Telegram just arrived for you He passed on almost at once in search of some one else Philip stood for several moments perfectly still He looked at the inscription Douglas Romilly set his teeth and tore open the envelope Understood you were returning to factory before leaving Am posting a few final particulars to Waldorf Hotel New York Staff joins me in wishing you bon voyage Philip felt his heart cease its pounding felt an immense sense of relief It was a wonderful thing this message It cleared up one point on which he had been anxious and unsettled It was taken for granted at the Works then that he had come straight to Liverpool He walked up and down the deck on the side remote from the dock driving this into his mind Everything was wonderfully simplified If only he could get across once reach New York Meanwhile he looked at his watch again and discovered that it wanted but ten minutes to three He made his way back down to his stateroom which was already filled with his luggage He shook out an ulster from a bundle of wraps and selected a tweed cap Already there was a faint touch of the sea in the river breeze and he was impatient for the immeasurable open spaces the salt wind the rise and fall of the great ship Then as he stood on the threshold of his cabin he heard voices Down in number one hundred ten eh Yes sir he heard his steward s voice reply mister Romilly has just gone down You ve only a minute sir before the last call for passengers That s all right the voice which had spoken to him over the telephone that morning replied I d just like to shake hands with him and wish him bon voyage Philip s teeth came together in a little fury of anger It was maddening this to be trapped when only a few minutes remained between him and safety His brain worked swiftly He took his chance of finding the next stateroom empty as it happened to be and stepped quickly inside He kept his back to the door until the footsteps had passed He heard the knock at his stateroom stepped back into the corridor and passed along a little gangway to the other side of the ship He hurried up the stairs and into the smoking room The bugle was sounding now and hoarse voices were shouting Every one for the shore Last call for the shore Give me a brandy and soda he begged the steward who was just opening the bar The man glanced at the clock and obeyed Philip swallowed half of it at a gulp then sat down with the tumbler in his hand All of a sudden something disappeared from in front of one of the portholes His heart gave a little jump They were moving He sprang up and hurried to the doorway Slowly but unmistakably they were gliding away from the dock Already a lengthening line of people were waving their handkerchiefs and shouting farewells Around them in the river little tugs were screaming and the ropes from the dock had been thrown loose Philip stepped to the rail his heart growing lighter at every moment His ubiquitous steward laden with hand luggage paused for a moment I sent a gentleman down to your stateroom just before the steamer started sir he announced gentleman of the name of Gayes who wanted to say good by to you Bad luck Philip answered I must have just missed him The steward turned around and pointed to the quay There he is sir elderly gentleman in a grey suit and a bunch of violets in his buttonhole He s looking straight at you Philip raised his cap and waved it with enthusiasm After a moment s hesitation the other man did the same The steward collected his belongings and shuffled off He picked you out sir all right he remarked as he disappeared in the companionway Philip turned away with a little final wave of the hand Glad I didn t miss him altogether he observed cheerfully Good afternoon mister Gayes Good by England CHAPTER IV mister Raymond Greene very soon after the bugle had sounded for dinner that evening took his place at the head of one of the small tables in the saloon and wished every one good evening It was perfectly apparent that he meant to enjoy the trip that he was prepared to like his fellow passengers and that he wished them to know it Even the somewhat melancholy looking steward who had been waiting for his arrival cheered up at the sight of his beaming face and the other four occupants of the table returned his salutation according to their lights Two vacant places I am sorry to see mister Greene observed One of them I can answer for though The young lady who is to sit on my right will be down directly Miss Elizabeth Dalstan the great actress you know She is by way of being under my charge Very charming and talented young lady she is Let us see who our other absentee is He stretched across and glanced at the name upon the card mister Douglas Romilly he read out Quite a good name English without a doubt I have crossed with you before haven t I sir he went on affably turning to his nearest neighbour on the left A burly many chinned American signified his assent Why I should say so he admitted and I d like a five dollar bill mister Greene for every film I ve seen of yours in the United States mister Greene beamed with satisfaction Well I am glad to hear you ve come across my stuff he declared I ve made some name for myself on the films and I am proud of it Raymond Greene it is at your service Joseph P Hyam s mine the large American announced watching the disappearance of his soup plate with an air of regret I m in the clothing business If my wife were here she d say you wouldn t think it to look at me Never was faddy about myself though he added with a glance at mister Greene s very correct dinner attire You ought to remember me mister Greene one of the two men remarked from the right hand side of the table I ve played golf with you at Baltusrol more than once mister Greene glanced surreptitiously at the card and smiled Why it s James P Busby
2473_157859_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 of course 
none	none	he exclaimed Your father s the Busby Iron Works isn t he The young man nodded And this is mister Caroll one of our engineers he said indicating a rather rough looking personage by his side Delighted to meet you both mister Greene assured them Say I remember your golf mister Busby You re some driver eh And those long putts of yours you never took three on any green that I can remember Been playing in England the young man asked mister Raymond Greene shook his head When I am on business he explained I don t carry my sticks about with me and I tell you this last fortnight has been a giddy whirl for me I was in Berlin Wednesday night and I did business in Vienna last Monday Ah here comes Miss Dalstan He rose ceremoniously to his feet A young lady who was still wearing her travelling clothes smiled at him delightfully and sank into the chair by his side During the little stir caused by her arrival no one paid any attention to the man who had slipped into the other vacant place opposite mister Greene however when he had finished making known his companion s wants to the steward welcomed Philip Romilly genially Now we re a full table he declared That s what I like I only hope we ll keep it up all the voyage Mind there ll be a forfeit for the first one that misses a meal mister Romilly isn t it he went on glancing at his left hand neighbour s card once more My name s Raymond Greene I am an old traveller and there s nothing I enjoy more outside my business than these little ocean trips especially when they come after a pretty strenuous time on shore Crossed many times sir Never before Philip answered First trip eh mister Greene remarked mildly interested Well well you ve some surprises in store for you then Let me make you acquainted with your opposite neighbour Miss Elizabeth Dalstan I dare say even if you haven t been in the States you know some of our principal actresses by name Philip raised his head and caught a glimpse of a rather pale face a mass of deep brown hair a pleasant smile from a very shapely mouth and the rather intense regard of a pair of wonderfully soft eyes whose colour at that moment he was not able to determine I have had the pleasure of seeing Miss Dalstan on the stage he observed Capital mister Raymond Greene exclaimed We haven t met before have we mister Romilly Something kind of familiar in your face You are not by way of being in the Profession are you Romilly shook his head I am a manufacturer he acknowledged That so his neighbour remarked a trifle surprised Queer I had a fancy that we d met and quite lately too I am in the cinema business You may have heard of me Raymond Greene I have seen some of your films Philip told him Very excellent productions if you will allow me to say so That s pleasant hearing at any time mister Greene admitted with a gratified smile Well I can see that we are going to be quite a friendly party That s mister Busby on your right mister Romilly some golfer I can tell you and his friend mister Caroll alongside The lady next you My name is Miss Pinsent the elderly lady indicated declared pleasantly replying to mister Greene s interrogative glance It is my first trip to America too I am going out to see a nephew who has settled in Chicago Capital mister Raymond Greene repeated Now we are all more or less a family party What did you say your line of business was mister Romilly I don t remember mentioning it Philip observed but I am a manufacturer of boots and shoes Elizabeth Dalstan looked across at him a little curiously One might have surmised that she was in some way disappointed Coming over to learn a thing or two from us eh mister Greene went on You use all our machinery don t you Well there s Paul Lawton on board from Brockton I should think he has one of the biggest plants in Massachusetts I must make you acquainted with him Philip frowned slightly That is very kind of you mister Greene he acknowledged but do you know I would very much rather not talk business with any one while I am on the steamer I am a little overworked and I need the rest Elizabeth Dalstan looked at her vis a vis with some renewal of her former interest She saw a young man who was without doubt good looking although he certainly had an over tired and somewhat depressed appearance His cheeks were colourless and there were little dark lines under his eyes as though he suffered from sleeplessness He was clean shaven and he had the sensitive mouth of an artist His forehead was high and exceptionally good His air of breeding was unmistakable You do look a little fagged mister Raymond Greene observed sympathetically Well these are strenuous days in business We all have to stretch out as far as we can go and keep stretched out or else some one else will get ahead of us Business been good with you this fall mister Romilly Very fair thank you Philip answered a little vaguely Tell me Miss Dalstan he went on leaning slightly towards her and with a note of curiosity in his tone I want to know your candid opinion of the last act of the play I saw you in Henderson s Second Wife I made up my mind that if ever I had the privilege of meeting you I would ask you that question I know exactly why she declared with a quick little nod of appreciation Listen They talked together for some time earnestly mister Greene addressed his conversation to his neighbours lower down the table It was not until the arrival of dessert that Philip and his vis a vis abandoned their discussion Tell me have you written yourself mister Romilly Elizabeth Dalstan asked him with interest I have made an attempt at it he confessed Most difficult thing in the whole world to write a play mister Raymond Greene intervened seeing an opportunity to join once more in the conversation Most difficult thing in the world I should say Now with pictures it s entirely different The slightest little happening in everyday life may give you the start and then there you are the whole thing unravels itself Now let me give you an example he went on helping himself to a little more whisky and soda Only yesterday afternoon on our way up to Liverpool the train got pulled up somewhere in Derbyshire and I sat looking out of the window It was a dreary neighbourhood a miserable afternoon and we happened to be crossing a rather high viaduct Down below were some meadows and a canal and by the side of the canal a path At a certain point I should think about half a mile from where the train was standing this path went underneath a rude bridge built of bricks and covered over with turf Well as I sat there I could see two men both approaching the bridge along the path from opposite directions One was tall dressed in light tweeds a good looking fellow looked like one of your country squires except that he was a little on the thin side The other was a sombre looking person dressed in dark clothes about your height and build I should say mister Romilly Well they both disappeared under that bridge at the same moment and I don t know why but I leaned forward to see them come out The train was there for quite another two minutes perhaps more There wasn t another soul anywhere in sight and it was raining as it only can rain in England mister Raymond Greene paused Every one at the table had been listening intently He glanced around at their rapt faces with satisfaction He was conscious of the artist s dramatic touch Once more it had not failed him He had excited interest In Philip Romilly s eyes there was something even more than interest It seemed almost as though he were trying to project his thoughts back and conjure up for himself the very scene which was being described to him The young man was certainly in a very delicate state of health mister Greene decided You are keeping us in suspense sir the elderly lady complained leaning forward in her place Please go on What happened when they came out That mister Raymond Greene said impressively is the point of the story The train remained standing there as I have said for several minutes as many minutes in fact as it would have taken them seconds to have traversed that tunnel Notwithstanding that they neither of them appeared again I sat there believe me with my eyes fastened upon that path and when the train started I leaned out of the window until we had rounded the curve and we were out of sight but I never saw either of those two men again Now there s the beginning of a film story for you What do you want more than that There s dramatic interest surprise an original situation After all I suppose the explanation was quite a simple one mister Busby remarked They were probably acquaintances and they stayed to have a chat mister Raymond Greene shook his head doubtfully All I can say to that is that it was a queer place to choose for a little friendly conversation he pronounced They were both tall men about the same height I should say and it would have been impossible for them to have even stood upright You mentioned the fact did you not the lady who called herself Miss Pinsent observed that it was raining heavily at the time Perhaps they stayed under the bridge to shelter That s something I never thought of mister Greene admitted perhaps for the reason that they both of them seemed quite indifferent to the rain The young man in the dark clothes hadn t even an umbrella I must admit that I allowed my thoughts to travel in another direction Professional instinct you see It was a fairly broad canal and the water was nearly up to the towing path I d lay a wager it was twelve or fifteen feet deep Supposing those two men had met on that narrow path and quarrelled Supposing Don t mister Raymond Greene stopped short He gazed in amazement at Elizabeth Dalstan who had suddenly clutched his hand There was something in her face which puzzled as well as startled him She had been looking at her opposite neighbour but she turned back towards the narrator of this thrilling story as the monosyllable broke from her lips Please stop she begged You are too dramatic mister Greene You really frighten me Frighten you he repeated My dear Miss Dalstan I suppose it is very absurd of me she went on smiling appealingly at him but your words were altogether too graphic I can t bear to think of what might have taken place underneath that tunnel You must remember that I saw it too Don t go on Don t talk about it any more I am going upstairs for my cigarette Are you coming to get my chair for me mister Greene or must I rely upon the deck steward mister Raymond Greene was a very gallant man and he did not hesitate for a moment He sprang to his feet and escorted the young lady from the saloon He glanced back as he left the table to nod his adieux to the little company whom he had taken under his charge Philip Romilly was gazing steadfastly out of the porthole Kind of delicate young fellow that he remarked Nice face too Can t help thinking that I ve met or seen some one like him lately

none	none	 Philip Romilly found himself alone at last with the things which he had craved darkness solitude the rushing of the salt wind the sense of open spaces On the other the sheltered side of the steamer long lines of passengers were stretched in wicker chairs smoking and drinking their coffee but where he was no one came save an occasional promenader Yet even here was a disappointment He had come for peace for a brief escape from the thrall of memories which during the last few hours had become charged with undreamed of horrors and there was to be no peace In the shadowy darkness which rested upon the white churned sea flying past him he saw again with horrible distinctness the face the figure of the man who for those few brief minutes he had hated with a desperate and passionate hatred He saw the broken photograph the glass splintered into a thousand pieces He saw the man himself choking sinking down beneath the black waters heard the stifled cry from his palsied lips saw the slow dawning agony of death in his distorted features Some one was playing a mandolin down in the second class He heard the feet of a dancer upon the deck the little murmur of applause Well after all this was life It was a rebuke of fate to his own illogical and useless vapourings Men died every second whilst women danced and no one who knew life had any care save for the measure of their own days Some freakish thought pleaded stridently his own justification His mind travelled back down the gloomy avenues of his past along those last aching years of grinding and undeserved poverty He remembered his upbringing his widowed mother a woman used to every luxury struggling to make both ends meet in a suburban street in a hired cottage filled with hired furniture He remembered his schooldays devoid of pocket money unable to join in the sports of others slaving with melancholy perseverance for a scholarship to lighten his mother s burden Always there was the same ghastly crushing penuriousness the struggle to make a living before his schooldays were well over the unbought books he had fingered at the bookstalls and let drop again the coarse clothes he had been compelled to wear the scanty food he had eaten the narrow driving ways of poverty culminating in his mother s death and his own fear he at the age of nineteen years lest the money for her funeral should not be forthcoming If there were any hell surely he had lived in it This other whose flames mocked him now could be no worse Sin Crime He remembered the words of the girl who during these latter years had represented to him what there might have been of light in life He remembered and it seemed to him that he could meet that ghostly image which had risen from the black waters without shrinking almost contemptuously Fate had mocked him long enough 
2581_157857_000003_000023	train-clean-360	It was time indeed that he helped himself 
none	none	He swung away from the solitude to the other side of the steamer paused in a sheltered spot while he lit a cigarette and paced up and down the more frequented ways A soft voice from an invisible mass of furs and rugs called to him mister Romilly please come and talk to me My rug has slipped thank you so much Take this chair next mine for a few minutes won t you mister Greene has rushed off to the smoking room I think he has just been told that there is a rival cinema producer on board and he is trying to run him to ground Philip settled himself without hesitation in the vacant place One is forced to envy mister Raymond Greene he sighed To have work in life which one loves as he does his is the rarest form of happiness What about your own she asked him But you are a manufacturer are you not Somehow or other that surprises me And me he acknowledged frankly I mean that I wonder I have persevered at it so long But you are a very young man Young or old he answered I am one of those who have made a false start in life I am on my way to new things Do you think Miss Dalstan that your country is a good place for one to visit who seeks new things She turned in her chair a little more towards him Against the background of empty spaces the pale softness of her face seemed to gain a new attractiveness Well that depends she said reflectively upon what these new things might be which you desire For an ambitious business man America is a great country But supposing one had finished with business he persisted Supposing one wanted to develop tastes and a gift for another method of life Then I should say that New York is the one place in the world she told him You are speaking of yourself Yes You have ambitions I am sure she continued Tell me are they literary I would like to call them so he admitted I have written a play and three stories so bad that no one would produce the play or publish the stories You have brought them with you 
2473_157859_000038_000000	train-clean-360	He shook his head 
none	none	No They are where I shall never see them again
2581_157857_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Never see them again she repeated puzzled 
none	none	I mean that I have left them at home I have left them there perhaps to a certain extent deliberately he went on You see the idea is still with me I think that I shall rewrite them when I have settled down in America I fancy that I shall find myself in an atmosphere more conducive to the sort of work I want to do I would rather not be handicapped by the ghosts of my old failures One s ghosts are hard sometimes to escape from she whispered He clutched nervously at the end of his rug She looked up and down along the row of chairs There were one or two slumbering forms but most were empty There were no promenaders in sight You know she asked her voice still very low why I left the saloon a little abruptly this evening Why he demanded Because she went on I could see the effect which mister Raymond Greene s story had upon you because I also was in that train and I have better eyesight than mister Greene You were one of the two men who were walking along the towpath Well he muttered You have nothing to tell me Nothing She waited for a moment At least you have not attempted to persuade me that you lingered underneath that bridge to escape from the rain she remarked If I cannot tell you the truth he promised I am not going to tell you a lie but apart from that I admit nothing I do not even admit that it was I whom you saw She laid her hand upon his The touch of her fingers was wonderful cool and soft and somehow reassuring He felt a sense of relaxation felt the strain of living suddenly grow less You know she said all my friends tell me that I am a restful person You are living at high pressure are you not Try and forget it Fate makes queer uses of all of us sometimes She sends her noblest sons down into the shadows and pitchforks her outcasts into the high places of life Those do best who learn to control themselves to live and think for the best Go on talking to me he begged Is it your voice I wonder that is so soothing or just what you say She smiled reassuringly You are glad because you have found a friend she told him and a friend who even if she does not understand does not wish to understand Do you see I wish I felt that I deserved it he groaned S
2581_157858_000051_000000	train-clean-360	he laughed 
none	none	almost gaily What a sorting up there would be of our places in life she declared if we all had just what we deserved Now give me your arm I want to walk a little While we walk if you like I will try to tell you what I can about New York It may interest you They walked up and down the deck and by degrees their conversation drifted into a discussion of such recent plays as were familiar to both of them At the far end of the ship she clung to him once or twice as the wind came booming over the freshening waves She weighed and measured his criticisms of the plays they spoke of and in the main approved of them When at last she stopped outside the companionway and bade him good night the deck was almost deserted They were near one of the electric lights and he saw her face more distinctly than he had seen it at all realised more adequately its wonderful charm The large firm mouth womanly and tender though it was was almost the mouth of a protector She smiled at him as one might smile at a boy You are to sleep well she said firmly Those are my orders Good night She gave him her hand a woman s soft and delicate fingers yet clasping his with an almost virile strength and friendliness She left him with just that feeling about her that she was expansive in her heart her sympathies even her brain and peculiar gifts of apprehension She left him too with a curious sense of restfulness as though suddenly he had become metamorphosed into the woman and had found a sorely needed guardian He abandoned without a second thought his intention of going to the smoking room and sitting up late The thought of his empty stateroom a horror to him a few hours ago seemed suddenly almost alluring and he made his way there cheerfully He felt the sleep already upon his eyes CHAPTER VI All the physical exhilaration of his unlived youth seemed to be dancing in Philip Romilly s veins when he awoke the next morning to find an open porthole the blue sea tossing away to infinity and his steward s cheerful face at his bedside Bathroom steward says if you are ready sir he can arrange for your bath now the man announced Philip sprang out of bed and reached for his Bond Street dressing gown I ll bring you a cup of tea when you get back sir the steward continued
2581_157858_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 The bathrooms are exactly opposite 
none	none	The sting of the salt water seemed to complete his new found light heartedness Philip dressed and shaved whistling softly all the time to himself He even found a queer sort of interest in examining his stock of ties and other garments The memory of Elizabeth Dalstan s words was still in his brain They had become the text of his life This he told himself was his birthday He even accepted without a tremor a letter and telegram which the steward brought him These were in the rack for you sir he said I meant to bring them down last night but we had a busy start off Philip took them up on deck to read He tore open the telegram first and permitted himself a little start when he saw the signature It was sent off from Detton Magna Why did you not come as promised 
2581_157858_000008_000001	train-clean-360	What am I to do 
none	none	BEATRICE The envelope of the letter he opened with a little more compunction It was written on the printed notepaper of the Douglas Romilly Shoe Company and was of no great length
2581_157858_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear mister Romilly 
none	none	I understood that you would return to the factory this evening for a few minutes before taking the train to Liverpool There were one or two matters upon which I should like some further information but as time is short I am writing to you at the Waldorf Hotel at New York I see that the acceptances due next fourth are unusually heavy but I think I understood you to say that you had spoken to mister Henshaw at the bank concerning these and in any case I presume there would be no difficulty Wishing you every success on the other side and a safe return I am Your obedient servant

none	none	There is not the slightest doubt Philip said to himself as he tore both communications into pieces and watched them flutter away downwards that I am on my way to New York If only one knew what had become of that poor half starved art master He went down to breakfast and afterwards strolled aimlessly about the deck His sense of enjoyment was so extraordinarily keen that he found it hard to settle down to any of the usual light occupations of idle travellers He was content to stand by the rail and gaze across the sea a new wonder to him or to lie about in his steamer chair and listen with half closed eyes to the hissing of the spray and the faint music of the wind His mind turned by chance to one of those stories of which he had spoken A sudden new vigour of thought seemed to rend it inside out almost in those first few seconds He thought of the garret in which it had been written the wretched surroundings the odoriferous food the thick crockery the smoke palled vista of roofs and chimneys The genius of a Stevenson would have become dwarfed in such surroundings A phrase a happy idea suddenly caught his fancy He itched for a pencil and paper Then he looked up to find the one thing wanting Elizabeth Dalstan followed by a maid carrying rugs and cushions had paused smiling by his side You have slept and you are better she said pleasantly Now for the next few minutes you must please devote yourself to making me comfortable Put everything down Phoebe mister Romilly will look after me For a moment he paused before proceeding to his task
2581_157858_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I want to look at you he confessed 
none	none	Remember I have only seen you under the electric lights of the saloon or in that queer violet gloom of last night 
2581_157858_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Why you have quite light hair and I thought it was dark 
none	none	She laughed good humouredly and turned slowly around Here I am she announced a much bephotographed person Almost plain some journalists have dared to call me but for my expression On flowing lines as you see because I always wear such loose clothes and yet believe me slim As a matter of fact she went on pensively I am rather proud of my figure A little journalist who had annoyed me and to whom I was rude once called it ample No one has ever ventured to say more The critics who love me and they most of them love me because I am so exceptionally polite to them and tell them exactly what to say about every new play allude to my physique as Grecian But your eyes he exclaimed Last night I thought they were grey 
2581_157858_000024_000002	train-clean-360	This morning why surely they are brown 
none	none	You see that is all according to the light she confided If any one does try to write a description of me they generally evade the point by calling them browny grey A young man who was in love with me she sighed but that was long ago used to say that they reminded him of fallen leaves in a place where the sunlight sometimes is and sometimes isn t And now if you please I want to be made exceedingly comfortable I want you to find the deck steward and see that I have some beef tea as quickly as possible I want my box of cigarettes on one side and my vanity case on the other and I should like to listen to the plot of your play He obeyed her behests with scrupulous care leaned back in his chair and brought into the foreground of his mind the figures of those men and women who had told his story finding them to his dismay unexpectedly crude and unlifelike 
2581_157858_000026_000001	train-clean-360	And the story itself 
none	none	Was unhappiness so necessary after all They suddenly seemed to crumble away into insignificance these men and women of his creation In their place he could almost fancy a race of larger beings a more extensive canvas a more splendid a riper and richer vocabulary Nothing that I have ever done he sighed is worth talking to you about But if you are going to be my friend Well If you are going to be my friend he went on with almost inspired conviction I shall write something different One can rebuild she murmured One can sometimes use the old pieces Life and chess are both like that Would you help me I wonder he asked impulsively She looked away from him out across the steamer rail She seemed to be measuring with her eyes the roll of the ship as it rose and fell in the trough of the sea You are a strange person she said Tell me are you in the habit of becoming suddenly dependent upon people Not I he assured her If I were to tell you how my last ten years have been spent you would not believe me

none	none	If I were to speak of a tearing unutterable loneliness if I were to speak of poverty not the poverty you know anything about but the poverty of bare walls of coarse food and little enough of it of everything cheap and miserable and soiled and second hand nothing fresh nothing real He stopped abruptly But I forgot he muttered I can t explain Is one to understand she asked a little puzzled that you have had difficulties in your business I have never been in business he answered quickly My name is Romilly but I am not Romilly the manufacturer For the last eight years I have lived in a garret in London teaching false art in a third rate school some of the time doing penny a line journalistic work when I got the chance clerk for a month or two in a brewer s office and sacked for incapacity those are a few of the real threads in my life At the present moment then she observed you are an impostor Exactly he admitted and I should probably have been repenting it by now but for your words last night She smiled at him and the sun shone once more It wasn t an ordinary smile at all It was just as though she were letting him into the light of her understanding as though some one from the world entrance into which he had craved had stooped down to understand and was telling him that all was well He drew his chair a little closer to hers We are all more or less impostors she said Does any one I wonder go about the world telling everybody what they really are how they really live Dear me how unpleasant and uncomfortable it would be You are so wise my new friend You know the value of impulses You tell me the truth and I am your friend I do not need facts because facts count for little I judge by what lies behind and I understand Do not weary me with explanations I like what you have told me Only of course your work must have suffered from surroundings like that Will it be better for you now I shall land in New York he told her with at least a thousand pounds That is about as much as I have spent in ten years There is the possibility of other money Concerning that well I can t make up my mind The thousand pounds of course is stolen So I gathered she remarked Do you continue may I ask to be Douglas Romilly the manufacturer He shook his head a little vaguely I haven t thought he confessed But of course I don t I have risked everything for the chance of a new life I shall start it in a new way and under a new name He was suddenly conscious of her pity of a moistness in her eyes as she looked at him I think she said that you must have been very miserable Above all things now whatever you may have done for your liberty don t be fainthearted If you are in trouble or danger you must come to me You promise If I may he assented fervently Now I must hear the play as it stood in your thoughts when you wrote it she insisted I have a fancy that it will sound a little gloomy

none	none	 Philip Romilly was accosted late that afternoon by two young women whose presence on board he had noticed with a certain amount of disapproval 
2473_157859_000006_000001	train-clean-360	They were obviously of the chorus girl type a fact which they seemed to lack the ambition to conceal 
none	none	After several would be ingratiating giggles they finally pulled up in front of him whilst he was promenading the deck You are mister Romilly aren t you one of them asked Bob Millet told us you were going to be on this steamer

2473_157859_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Good old Bob 
none	none	I don t mind confessing the young woman went on that though we were all out one night together Trocadero Empire and Murray s afterwards I should never have recognised you Seems to me you ve got thinner and more serious looking I am afraid my own memory is also at fault Philip remarked a little stiffly I am Violet Fox the young woman who had accosted him continued This my friend Hilda Mason She s a dear girl but a little shy aren t you Hilda That s just because I told her that we ought to wait until you remembered us the slighter young woman with the very obvious peroxidised hair protested Didn t seem to be any use waiting for that her friend retorted briskly
2473_157859_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Hilda and I are dying for a cocktail mister Romilly 
none	none	He led them with an unwillingness of which they seemed frankly unaware towards the lounge 
2473_157859_000015_000001	train-clean-360	They drank two cocktails and found themselves unfortunately devoid of cigarettes a misfortune which it became his privilege to remedy 
none	none	They were very friendly young ladies if a little slangy invited him around to their staterooms and offered to show him the runs around New York 
2473_157859_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Philip escaped after about an hour and made his way to where Elizabeth was reclining in her deck chair 
none	none	That fellow Romilly he declared irritably the other one I mean seems to have had the vilest tastes If I am to be landed with any more of his ridiculous indiscretions I think I shall have to go overboard There was an enterprising gentleman named Gayes in Liverpool who nearly drove me crazy then there s this mister Lawton who wants to talk about lasts and finally it seems that I dined at the Trocadero and spent the evening at the Empire and Murray s with the two very obvious looking young ladies who accosted me just now I am beginning to believe that Douglas life was not above suspicion 
2473_157859_000017_000000	train-clean-360	She smiled at him tolerantly 
2473_157859_000017_000001	train-clean-360	An unopened book lay by her side 
2473_157859_000017_000002	train-clean-360	She seemed to have been spending the last quarter of an hour in thought 
none	none	I am rather relieved to hear she confessed that those two young people are a heritage from the other mister Romilly 
2473_157859_000018_000001	train-clean-360	No don t sit down she went on 
none	none	I want you to do something for me Go into the library and on the left hand side as you enter you will see all the wireless news Read the bottom item and then come back to me 
2473_157859_000019_000000	train-clean-360	He turned slowly away 
2473_157859_000019_000001	train-clean-360	All his new found buoyancy of spirits had suddenly left him 
none	none	He cursed the imagination which lifted his feet from the white decks and dragged his eyes from the sparkling blue sea to the rain soaked smut blackened fields riven by that long thread of bleak turgid water The horrors of a murderous passion beat upon his brain He saw himself hastening grim and blind on his devil sped mission Then the haze faded from before his eyes Somehow or other he accomplished his errand 
2473_157859_000019_000006	train-clean-360	He was in the library standing in front of those many sheets of typewritten messages passing them all over heedless of what their message might be until he came to the last and most insignificant Four lines almost overlapped by another sheet 
2473_157859_000020_000000	train-clean-360	STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE OF A LONDON ART TEACHER
2473_157859_000021_000000	train-clean-360	SUICIDE FEARED
none	none	 Acting upon instructions received the police are investigating a somewhat curious case of disappearance 
2473_157859_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Philip Romilly a teacher of art in a London school visited Detton Magna on Friday afternoon and apparently started for a walk along the canal bank towards dusk 
2473_157859_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Nothing has since been heard of him or his movements and arrangements have been made to drag the canal at a certain point 
none	none	The letters seemed to grow larger to him as he stood and read He remained in front of the message for an inordinately long time Again his imagination was at work 
2473_157859_000023_000003	train-clean-360	He saw the whole ghastly business the police on the canal banks watching the slow progress of the men with their drags bringing to the surface all the miserable refuse of the turgid waters the dripping black mud perhaps at last 
2473_157859_000024_000000	train-clean-360	He was back again on the deck walking quite steadily yet seeing little He made his way to the smoking room asked almost indifferently for a brandy and soda and drained it to the last drop 
none	none	Then he walked up the deck to where Elizabeth was seated and dropped into a chair by her side
2473_157859_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 So I am missing he remarked almost in his ordinary tone 
none	none	I really had no idea that I was a person of such importance 
2473_157859_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Fancy reading of my own disappearance within a few days of its taking place in the middle of the Atlantic 
none	none	There was probably some one there who gave information she suggested There was the young lady whom I went to visit he assented She probably watched me cross the road and turn in at that gate and take the path by the canal side Yes she may even have gone to the station to see whether I took the only other train back to London and found that I did not She knew too that I could only have had a few shillings in my pocket and that my living depended upon being in London for my school the next morning 
2473_157859_000027_000004	train-clean-360	Yes the whole thing was reasonable 
2473_157859_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 And they are going to drag the canal Elizabeth said thoughtfully 
2473_157859_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 A difficult business he assured her 
none	none	It is one of the most ghastly ill constructed filthiest strips of water you ever looked upon It has been the garbage depository of the villages through which it makes its beastly way for generations 
2473_157859_000029_000003	train-clean-360	I don t envy the men who have to handle the drags 
2473_157859_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 You do not believe then that they will find anything interesting 
none	none	He shrugged his shoulders That type of man he continued must have a morbid mind There will be dead animals without a doubt worn out boots filthy and decomposed articles of clothing
2473_157859_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t she interrupted 
2473_157859_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 You know what I mean 
none	none	Do leave off painting your ghastly pictures You know quite well what I mean Philip Romilly is here by my side 
2473_157859_000033_000005	train-clean-360	What can they hope to find there in his place 
2473_157859_000034_000000	train-clean-360	His evil moments for that afternoon were over 
none	none	He answered her almost carelessly
2473_157859_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Not what they are looking for 
2473_157859_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Have you brought the paper and pencil you spoke of 
none	none	I have an idea I am getting fresh ideas every moment now that I picture you as my heroine It is queer isn t it how naturally you fall into the role 
2473_157859_000036_000000	train-clean-360	She drew a little nearer to him 
none	none	He was conscious of a mysterious and unfamiliar perfume perhaps from the violets half hidden in her furs or was it something in her hair It reminded him a little of the world the keys into which he had gripped the world of joyousness of light hearted pleasures the sunlit world into which he had only looked through other men s eyes Perhaps you knew that I was somewhere across the threshold she suggested Did you drag your Mona wholly from your brain or has she her prototype somewhere in your world He shook his head Therein lies the weakness of all that I have ever written he declared There have been so few in my world from whom I could garner even the gleanings of a personality They are all my men and women artificially made not born Twenty three shillings a week has kept me well outside the locked doors Yet you know in many ways she reflected Mona is like me Like you because she was a helper of men he assented swiftly a woman of large sympathies appealing to me I suppose because in my solitude thoughts of my own weakness taunted me weakness because I couldn t break out I mean Perhaps for that reason the thought of a strong woman fascinated me a woman large in thoughts and ways a woman to whom purposes and tendencies counted most I dreamed of a woman sweetly omnipotent strong without a shadow of masculinity That is where my Mona was to be different from all other created figures
2473_157859_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Chance she declared is a wonderful thing 
2473_157859_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Chance has pitchforked you here absolutely to my side I the one woman who could understand what you mean who could give your Mona life 
2473_157859_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Don t think I am vain she went on 
none	none	I can assure you that my head isn t the least turned because I have been successful 
2473_157859_000042_000004	train-clean-360	I simply know 
none	none	Listen I have few engagements in New York I should not be going back at all but to see my mother who is too delicate to travel and who is miserable when I am away for long 
2473_157859_000042_000008	train-clean-360	Take this pencil and paper 
2473_157859_000042_000009	train-clean-360	Let us leave off dreaming for a little time and give ourselves up to technicalities 
none	none	I want to draft a new first act and a new last one not so very different from your version and yet with changes which I want to explain as we go on 
2473_157859_000042_000011	train-clean-360	Bring your chair a little nearer so 
2473_157859_000042_000012	train-clean-360	Now take down these notes 
2473_157859_000043_000000	train-clean-360	They worked until the first gong for dinner rang 
2473_157859_000043_000001	train-clean-360	She sat up in her chair with a happy little laugh 
2473_157859_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Isn t it wonderful she exclaimed 
2473_157859_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 I never knew time to pass so quickly 
2473_157859_000044_000002	train-clean-360	There isn t any pleasure in the world like this she added a little impulsively the pleasure of letting your thoughts run out to meet some one else s some one who understands 
none	none	Take care of every line we have written my friend We might go on after dinner he suggested eagerly 
2473_157859_000046_000000	train-clean-360	She shook her head 
2473_157859_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I d rather not she admitted 
2473_157859_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 My brain is too full 
none	none	I have a hundred fancies dancing about I even find myself as we sit here rehearsing my gestures tuning myself to a new outlook Oh You most disturbing person intellectually of course I mean she added laughing into his face
2473_157859_000047_000006	train-clean-360	 Take off my rugs and help me up 
2473_157859_000047_000007	train-clean-360	No we ll leave them there Perhaps after dinner we might walk for a little time 
2473_157859_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 But the whole thing is tingling in my brain he protested 
2473_157859_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 Couldn t we go into the library 
2473_157859_000048_000002	train-clean-360	We could find a corner by ourselves 
2473_157859_000049_000000	train-clean-360	She turned and looked at him standing up now the wind blowing her skirts her eyes glowing her lips a little parted 
none	none	Then for the first time he understood her beauty understood the peculiar qualities of it the dissensions of the Press as to her appearance the supreme charm of a woman possessed of a sweet and passionate temperament turning her face towards the long wished for sun Even the greater things caught hold of him in that moment and he felt dimly what was coming Do you really wish to work she asked 
2473_157859_000051_000000	train-clean-360	He looked away from her 
none	none	No he answered a little thickly
2473_157859_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 We will talk if you will 
2473_157859_000053_000000	train-clean-360	They neither of them moved 
none	none	The atmosphere had suddenly become charged with a force indescribable almost numbing In the far distance they saw the level line of lights from a passing steamer mister Raymond Greene with his hands in his ulster pockets suddenly spotted them and did for them what they seemed to have lost the power to do Hullo he exclaimed I ve been looking for you two everywhere I don t want to hurt that smoking room steward s feelings He s not bad at his job 
2473_157859_000054_000004	train-clean-360	But he added confidentially dropping his voice and taking them both by the arm I have made a cocktail down in my stateroom it s there in the shaker waiting for us something I can t talk about 
2473_157859_000054_000005	train-clean-360	I ve given Lawton one and he s following me about like a dog 
2473_157859_000054_000006	train-clean-360	Come right this way both of you 
none	none	Steady across the gangway she s pitching a little Why you look kind of scared mister Romilly 
2473_157859_000054_000008	train-clean-360	Been to sleep either of you 
none	none	Philip s laugh was almost too long to be natural 
2473_157859_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Elizabeth as though by accident had dropped her veil 
none	none	mister Raymond Greene bubbling over with good nature and anticipation led them towards the stairs CHAPTER VIII mister Raymond Greene could scarcely wait until Philip had taken his place at the dinner table that evening to make known his latest discovery Say mister Romilly he exclaimed leaning a little forward do you happen to have seen the wireless messages to day those tissue sheets that are stuck up in the library Philip set down the menu in which he had been taking an unusual interest Yes I looked through them this afternoon he acknowledged There s a little one at the bottom looks as though it had been shoved in at the last moment I don t know whether you noticed it It announced the mysterious disappearance of a young man of the same name as your own an art teacher from London I think he was I wondered whether it might have been any relation I read the message Philip admitted It certainly looks as though it might have referred to my cousin mister Raymond Greene became almost impressive in his interested earnestness Talk about coincidences he continued Do you remember last night talking about subjects for cinema plays I told you of a little incident I happened to have noticed on the way from London to Liverpool about the two men somewhere in Derbyshire whom I had seen approaching a tunnel over a canal they neither of them came out you know all the time that the train was standing there Philip helped himself a little absently to whisky and soda from the bottle in front of him I remember your professional interest in the situation he confessed I felt at the time mister Raymond Greene went on eagerly that there was something queer about the affair Listen I have been putting two and two together and it seems to me that one of those men might very well have been this missing mister Romilly Philip shook his head pensively I don t think so he ventured What s that You don t think so the cinema magnate exclaimed Why not mister Romilly It s exactly the district at Detton Magna the message said in Derbyshire and it was a canal too one of the filthiest I ever saw Can t you realise the dramatic interest of the situation now that you are confronted with this case of disappearance I have been asking myself ever since I strolled up into the library before dinner and read this notice What about the other man Philip had commenced a leisurely consumption of his first course and answered without undue haste Well he said if this young man Romilly is my cousin it would be the second or third time already that he has disappeared He is an ill balanced neurotic sort of creature At times he accepts help even solicits it from his more prosperous relations and at times he won t speak to us But of one thing I am perfectly convinced and that is that there is no man in the world who would be less likely to make away with himself He has a nervous horror of death or pain of any sort and in his peculiar way he is much too fond of life ever to dream of voluntarily shortening it On the other hand he is always doing eccentric things He probably set out to walk to London I have known him do it before and will turn up there in a fortnight s time mister Raymond Greene seemed rather to resent having cold water poured upon his melodramatic imaginings He turned to Elizabeth who had remained silent during the brief colloquy What do you think Miss Dalstan he asked Don t you think that under the circumstances I ought to give information to the British police She laughed at him quite good naturedly and yet in such a way that a less sensitive man than mister Raymond Greene might well have been conscious of the note of ridicule No wonder you are such a great success in your profession she observed You carry the melodramatic instinct with you day by day You see everything through the dramatist s spectacles That s all very well mister Greene protested but you saw the two men yourself and you ve probably read about the case of mysterious disappearance Surely you must admit that the coincidence is interesting Alas she went on shaking her head I am afraid I must throw cold water upon your vivid imaginings You see my eyesight is better than yours and I could see the two men distinctly whilst you could only see their figures One of them the better dressed was fair and obviously affluent and the other was a labourer Neither of them could in any way have answered the description of the missing man mister Raymond Greene was a little dashed You didn t say so at the time he complained I really wasn t sufficiently interested she told him Besides without knowing anything of mister Romilly s cousin I don t think any person in the world could have had the courage to seek an exit from his troubles by means of that canal But my point mister Raymond Greene persisted is that it wasn t suicide at all I maintain that the situation as I saw it presented all the possibilities of a different sort of crime My cousin hadn t an enemy in the world except himself Philip intervened And I would give you the filming of my next play for nothing Elizabeth ventured if either of those two men could possibly have been an art teacher Can I have a little more oil with my salad please steward and I should like some French white wine mister Raymond Greene took what appeared to be a positive disappointment very good naturedly Well he said I dare say you are both right and in any case I shouldn t like to persist in a point of view which might naturally enough become distressing to our young friend here Tell you what I ll do to show my penitence I shall order a bottle of wine and we ll drink to the welfare of the missing mister Philip Romilly wherever he may be Pommery steward and bring some ice along Philip pushed away his whisky and soda Just in time he remarked I ll drink to poor Philip s welfare with pleasure although he hasn t been an unmixed blessing to his family The subject passed away with the drinking of the toast and with the necessity for a guard upon himself gone Philip found himself eating and drinking mechanically watching all the time the woman who sat opposite to him who had now engaged mister Raymond Greene in an animated conversation on the subject of the suitability for filming of certain recent plays He was trying with a curious intentness to study her dispassionately to understand the nature of the charm on which dramatic critics had wasted a wealth of adjectives and of which he himself was humanly and personally conscious She wore a high necked gown of some soft black material with a little lace at her throat fastened by her only article of jewellery a pearl pin Her hair was arranged in coils with a simplicity and a precision which to a more experienced observer would have indicated the possession of a maid of no ordinary qualities Her mouth became more and more delightful every time he studied it her voice even her method of speech were entirely natural and with a peculiarly fascinating inflexion At times she looked and spoke with the light hearted gaiety of a child then again there was the grave and cultured woman apparent in her well balanced and thoughtful criticisms When at the end of the meal she rose to leave the table he found himself surprised at her height and the slim perfection of her figure His first remark when he joined her upon the stairs was an almost abrupt expression of his thoughts Tell me he exclaimed why were all my first impressions of you wrong To night you are a revelation to me You are amazingly different She laughed at him I really can t do more than show you myself as I am she expostulated Ah but you are so many women he murmured Of course if you are going to flatter me Give me a cigarette from my case please and strike a match and if you don t mind struggling with this wind and the darkness we will have our walk There she added as they stood in the companionway Now don t you feel as though we were facing an adventure We shan t be able to see a yard ahead of us and the wind is singing They passed through up the companionway She took his arm and he suddenly felt the touch of her warm fingers feeling for his other hand He gripped them tightly and his last impression of her face before they plunged into the darkness was of a queer softness as though she were giving herself up to some unexpected but welcome emotion Her eyes were half closed She had the air of one wrapped in silence So they walked almost the whole length of the deck Philip indeed had no impulse or desire for speech All his aching nerves were soothed into repose The last remnants of his ghostly fears had been swept away They were on the windward side of the ship untenanted save now and then by the shadowy forms of other promenaders The whole experience even the regular throbbing of the engines the swish of the sea the rising and falling of a lantern bound to the top of a fishing smack by which they were passing the distant chant of the changing watch all the night sights and sounds of the seaborne hostel were unfamiliar and exhilarating And inside his hand even though given him of her great pity a woman s fingers lay in his She spoke at last a little abruptly There is something I must know about she said You have only to ask he assured her Don t be afraid she continued I wish to ask you nothing which might give you pain but I must know you see I am really such a ordinary woman I must know about some one whom you went to visit that day didn t you at Detton Magna He answered her almost eagerly I want to talk about Beatrice he declared I want to tell you everything about her I know that you will understand We were brought up together in the same country place We were both thrown upon the world about the same time That was one thing I suppose which made us kindly disposed towards one another We corresponded always I commenced my unsuccessful fight in London I lived I can t tell you how week by week month by month I ate coarse food I was a hanger on to the fringe of everything in life which appealed to me fed intellectually on the crumbs of free libraries and picture galleries I met no one of my own station I was at a public school and my people were gentlefolk or tastes I had no friends in London before whom I dared present myself no money to join a club where I might have mixed with my fellows no one to talk to or exchange a single idea with and I wasn t always the gloomy sort of person I have become in my younger days I loved companionship And the women my landlady s daughter with dyed hair a loud voice slatternly in the morning a flagrant imitation of her less honest sisters at night Who else Where was I to meet women when I didn t even know men I spent my poor holidays at Detton Magna Our very loneliness brought Beatrice and me closer together We used to walk in those ugly fields around Detton Magna and exchanged the story of our woes She was a teacher at the national school The children weren t pleasant their parents were worse The drudgery was horrible and there wasn t any escape for her Sometimes she would sob as we sat side by side She too wanted something out of life as I did and there seemed nothing but that black wall always before us I think that we clung together because we shared a common misery We talked endlessly of a way out For me what was there There was no one to rob I wasn t clever enough There was no way I could earn money honestly or dishonestly And for her buried in that Derbyshire village amongst the collieries where there was scarcely a person who hadn t the taint of the place upon them what chance was there for her There was nothing she could do either I knew in my heart that we were both ready for evil things if by evil things we could make our escape And we couldn t So we tried to lose ourselves in the only fields left for such as we We read poetry We tried to live in that unnatural world where the brains only are nourished and the body languishes It was a morbid unhealthy existence but I plodded along and so did she Then her weekly letters became different For the first time she wrote me with reserves I took a day s vacation and I went down to Detton Magna to see what had happened That was the day she interrupted softly when That was the day he assented I remember so well getting out of the train and walking up that long miserable street School wasn t over and I went straight to her cottage as I have often done before There was a change Her cheap furniture had gone It was like one of those little rooms we had dreamed of There was a soft carpet upon the floor Chippendale furniture flowers hothouse fruit and on the mantelpiece the photograph of a man He paused and they took the whole one long turn along the wind swept shadowy deck in silence Presently she came he continued The change was there too She was dressed simply enough but even I in my inexperience knew the difference She came in she who had spoken of suicide a short time ago singing softly to herself She saw me our eyes met and the story was told I knew and she knew that I knew It seemed as though something in his tone might have grated upon her Gently but with a certain firmness she drew her hand away from his You were very angry I suppose she murmured Some instinct told him exactly what was passing in her thoughts In a moment he was on the defensive I think he said that if it had been any other man but listen The photograph which I took from the mantelpiece and threw into the fire was the photograph of my own cousin His father and my father were brought up together My father chose the Church his founded the factory in which most of the people in Detton Magna were employed When my grandfather died it was found that he was penniless The whole of his money had gone towards founding the Douglas Romilly Shoe Company I won t weary with the details The business prospered but we remained in poverty When my mother died I was left with nothing My uncle made promises and never kept them He too died My cousin and I quarrelled He and his father both held that the money advanced by my grandfather had been a gift and not a loan They offered me a pittance Well I refused anything I spoke plain words and that was an end of it And then I came back and I saw his picture my cousin s picture upon the mantelpiece I can see it now and it looks hateful to me All the old fires burned up in me I remembered my father s death a pauper he was I remembered how near I had been to starvation I remembered the years I had spent in a garret whilst Douglas had idled time away at Oxford had left there to trifle with the business his father had founded had his West End club hunters and shooting It was a vicious mad jealous hatred perhaps but I claim that it was human I went out of that little house and it seemed to me that there was a new lust in my heart a new craving desire If I had thrown myself into that canal they might well have called it temporary insanity I didn t but I was mad all the same Anything else I did was temporary insanity Her hand suddenly came back again and she leaned towards him through the darkness You poor child she whispered Stop there please Don t be afraid to think you ve told me this You see I am of the world and I know that we are all only human Now twice up and down the deck and not a word Then I shall ask you something So they passed on side by side the touch of her fingers keeping this new courage alive in his heart his head uplifted even to the stars towards which their rolling mast pointed It was wonderful this to tell the truth to open the door of his heart Now I am going to ask you something she said when they turned for the third time You may think it a strange question but you must please answer it To me it is rather important Just what were your feelings for Beatrice I think I was fond of her he answered thoughtfully I know that I hated her when she came in from the schoolhouse when I understood Both of us in the days of our joint poverty had scoffed at principles had spoken boldly enough of sin but I can only say that when she came when I looked into her eyes I seemed to have discovered a new horror in life I can t analyse it I am not sure even now that I was not more of a beast that I had thought myself I am not sure that part of my rage was not because she had escaped and I couldn t But your personal feelings that is what I want to know about she persisted He dug down into his consciousness to satisfy her Think of what my life in London had been he reminded her There wasn t a single woman I knew with whom I could exchange a word All the time I loved beautiful things and beautiful women and the thought of them I have gone out into the streets at nights sometimes and hung around the entrances to theatres and restaurants just for the pleasure of looking at them with other men It didn t do me any good you know but the desire was there I wanted a companion like those other men had Beatrice was the only woman I knew I didn t choose her It wasn t the selective instinct that made her attractive to me It was because she was the only one I never felt anything great when I was with her he went on hoarsely I knew very well that ours were ordinary feelings She was in the same position that I was There was no one else for her either Do you want me to go on She hesitated Don t be afraid I am not quite mad he continued only I ll answer for you the part of your question you don t put into words Beatrice was nothing to me but an interpretress of her sex I never loved her If I had we might in our misery have done the wildest the most foolish things I will tell you why I know so clearly that I never loved her I have known it since you have been kind to me since I have realised what a wonderful thing a woman can be what a world she can make for the man who cares whom she cares for Her fingers gripped his tightly And now she said I know all that I want to know and all that it is well for us to speak of just now Dear friend will you remember that you are sharing your burden with me and that I who am accounted something in the world and who know life pretty thoroughly believe in you and hope for you They paused for a moment by the side of the steamer rail She understood so well his speechlessness She drew her hand away from his and held it to his lips Please kiss my fingers she begged That is just the seal of our friendship in these days See how quickly we seem to plough our way through the water Listen to the throbbing of that engine always towards a new world for you my friend It is to be an undiscovered country Be brave keep on being brave and remember The words seemed to die away upon her lips A shower of spray came glittering into the dim light like flakes of snow falling with unexpected violence close to them He drew her cloak around her and moved back Now she said I think we will smoke and perhaps if you made yourself very agreeable to the steward in the smoking room you could get some coffee One moment he pleaded Remember what Don t you realise that there is just one word I still need one little word to crown all that you have said She turned her head towards him The trouble and brooding melancholy seemed to have fallen from his face She realised more fully its sensitive lines its poetic almost passionate charm She was carried suddenly away upon a wave of the emotion which she herself had created Oh but you know she faltered You see I trust you even to know when Now your arm please until we reach the smoking room and mind I must have coffee

none	none	 Philip Romilly on the last day of the voyage experienced to the full that peculiar sensation of unrest which seems inevitably to prevail when an oceangoing steamer is being slowly towed into port The winds of the ocean had been left behind There was a new but pleasant chill in the frosty sunlit air

none	none	The ferry boats with their amazing human cargo seemed to be screeching a welcome as they churned their way across the busy river Wherever he looked there was something novel and interesting yet nothing sufficiently arresting to enable him to forget that he was face to face now with the first crisis of his new life Since that brief wireless message on the first day out there had been nothing disquieting in the daily bulletins of news and he had been able to appreciate to the full the soothing sense of detachment the friendliness of his fellow voyagers immeasurably above all the daily association with Elizabeth He felt like one awaking from a dream as he realised that these things were over At the first sight of land it was as though a magician s wand had been waved a charm broken 
2473_157861_000005_000009	train-clean-360	His fellow passengers in unfamiliar costumes were standing about with their eyes glued upon the distant docks 
none	none	A queer sense of ostracism possessed him Perhaps after all it had been a dream from which he was now slowly awaking He wandered into the lounge to find Elizabeth surrounded by a little group of journalists She nodded to him pleasantly and waved a great bunch of long stemmed pink roses which one of them had brought to her Her greeting saved him from despair She at least was unchanged See how my friends are beginning to spoil me she cried out
2473_157861_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Really I can t tell any of you a thing more she went on turning back to them only this and I am sure it ought to be interesting

none	none	A dark young man wearing eyeglasses with a notebook and pencil in his hand swung around Is this mister Douglas Romilly he enquired of the Romilly Shoe Company I am from the New York Star Pleased to meet you mister Romilly You are over here on business we understand 
2473_157861_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Philip was taken aback and for the moment remained speechless 
2473_157861_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 We d like to know your reason mister Romilly for paying us a visit the young man continued in your own words

none	none	Women s shoes and misses isn t it Elizabeth intervened swiftly shaking her finger at the journalist mister Harris she said mister Romilly is my friend and I am not going to have him spend these few impressive moments when he ought to be looking about him at the harbour telling you silly details about his business You can call upon him at his hotel if you like the Waldorf he is going to I believe and I am sure he will tell you anything you want to know That s all right Miss Dalstan the young man declared soothingly See you later mister Romilly he added Maybe you ll let us have a few of your impressions to work in with the other stuff Romilly made light of the matter but there was a slight frown upon his forehead as they passed along the curiously stationary deck I am afraid he observed that this is going to be a terribly hard country to disappear in Don t you believe it she replied cheerfully You arrive here to day and you are in request everywhere To morrow you are forgotten some one else arrives That newspaper man scarcely remembers your existence at the present moment He has discovered mister Raymond Greene Tell me why do you look so white and unhappy I am sorry the voyage is over he confessed So am I for that matter she assented I have loved every minute of the last few days but then we knew all the time didn t we that it was just an interlude The things which lie before us are so full of interest It is the next few hours which I fear he muttered gloomily She laughed at him Foolish If there had been any one on this side who wanted to ask you disagreeable questions they wouldn t have waited to meet you on the quay 
2473_157861_000022_000002	train-clean-360	They d have come down the harbour and held us up

2473_157861_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I will not he promised 
none	none	It was only for just a moment that I felt an idiot It s exciting you know this new atmosphere and the voyage was so wonderful such a perfect rest It s like waking up and the daylight seems a little crude She held out her hand You see the gangways are going down she pointed out I can see many of my friends waiting Remember with your new life begins our new alliance Good luck to you dear friend Their fingers were locked for a moment together He looked earnestly into her eyes Whatever the new life may mean for me he said fervently I shall owe to you A little rush of people came up the gangway and Elizabeth was speedily surrounded and carried off They came across one another several times in the Custom House and she waved her hand to him gaily Philip went through the usual formalities superintended the hoisting of his trunks upon a clumsy motor truck and was himself driven without question from the covered shed adjoining the quay He looked back at the huge side of the steamer the floor of the Custom House about which were still dotted little crowds of his fellow passengers It was the disintegration of a wonderful memory his farewell At the Waldorf he found himself greeted with unexpected cordiality The young gentleman to whom he applied after some hesitation for a room stretched out his hand and welcomed him to America So you are mister Romilly he exclaimed Well that s good We ve got your room Number six hundred two on the ninth floor
2473_157861_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Ninth floor Philip gasped 
none	none	If you d like to be higher up we can change you the young man continued amiably

2473_157861_000033_000000	train-clean-360	He handed the key to a small boy and waved Philip away 
none	none	The small boy proved fully equal to his mission
2473_157861_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 You just step this way sir he invited encouragingly 
2473_157861_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 Those packages of yours will be all right 
2473_157861_000034_000002	train-clean-360	You don t need to worry about them 
none	none	He led the way down a corridor streaming with human beings into a lift from which it appeared to Philip that he was shot on to the ninth floor along a thickly carpeted way into a good sized and comfortable bedroom with bathroom attached Your things will be up directly sir the small boy promised holding out his hand
2473_157861_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll see after them myself 
none	none	Philip expressed his gratitude in a satisfactory manner and stood for a few moments at the window Although it was practically his first glimpse of New York the wonders of the panorama over which he looked failed even to excite his curiosity The clanging of the surface cars the roar and clatter of the overhead railway the hooting of streams of automobiles all apparently being driven at breakneck speed alien sounds though they were fell upon deaf ears He could neither listen nor observe Every second s delay fretted him His plans were all made Everything depended upon their being carried out now without the slightest hitch He walked a dozen times to the door waiting for his luggage and when at last it arrived he was on the point of using the telephone 
2473_157861_000037_000008	train-clean-360	He feed the linen coated porters and dismissed them as rapidly as possible 
none	none	Then he ransacked the trunks until he found amidst a pile of fashionable clothing a quiet and inconspicuous suit of dark grey In the bathroom he hastily changed his clothes selected an ordinary Homburg hat and filled a small leather case with various papers He was on the point of leaving the room when his eyes fell upon the cable He hesitated for a moment gazed at the superscription shrugged his shoulders and tore it open He moved to the window and read it slowly word for word
2473_157861_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Just seen Henshaw 
none	none	Most disturbing interview Tells me you have had notice to reduce overdraft by February first Absolutely declines any further advances Payments coming in insufficient meet wages and current liabilities No provision for fourth bills amounting sixteen thousand pounds Have wired London for accountant Await your instructions urgently

2473_157861_000038_000009	train-clean-360	Please reply 
none	none	Very worried Potts Word by word Philip read the cable twice over Then it fluttered from his fingers on to the table It told its own story beyond any shadow of a mistake 
2473_157861_000039_000003	train-clean-360	His cousin s great wealth was a fiction 
none	none	The business to which his own fortune and the whole of his grandfather s money had been devoted was even now tottering He remembered the rumours he had heard of Douglas extravagance his establishment in London the burden of his college debts And then a further light flashed in upon him Twenty thousand pounds in America lying there too for Douglas under a false name He drew out one of the documents which he had packed and glanced at it more carefully 
2473_157861_000039_000009	train-clean-360	Then he replaced it a little dazed 
none	none	Douglas had planned to leave England then with this crisis looming over him Why Philip for a moment sat down on the arm of an easy chair A grim sense of humour suddenly parted his lips He threw back his head and laughed Douglas Romilly had actually been coming to America to disappear It was incredible but it was true 
2473_157861_000040_000000	train-clean-360	He left the cable carefully open upon the dressing table and picking up the small leather case left the room 
none	none	He reached the lift happily escaping the observation of the young lady seated at her desk and descended into the hall Once amongst the crowd of people who thronged the corridors he found it perfectly simple to leave the hotel by one of the side entrances He walked to the corner of the street and drew a little breath Then he lit a cigarette and strolled along Broadway curiously light hearted his spirits rising at every step He was free for ever from that other hateful personality mister Douglas Romilly of the Douglas Romilly Shoe Company had paid his brief visit to America and passed on BOOK II CHAPTER I After a fortnight of his new life Philip took stock of himself and his belongings In the first place then he owned a new name taken bodily from certain documents which he had brought with him from England Further as mister Merton Ware he was the monthly tenant of a small but not uncomfortable suite of rooms on the top story of a residential hotel in the purlieus of Broadway He had also apparently been a collector of newspapers of certain dates all of which contained some such paragraph as this DOUGLAS ROMILLY WEALTHY ENGLISH BOOT MANUFACTURER DISAPPEARS FROM THE WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL WALKS OUT OF HIS ROOM WITHIN AN HOUR OF LANDING AND HAS NOT BEEN HEARD OF SINCE DOWN TOWN HAUNTS SEARCHED FOUL PLAY FEARED SUPERINTENDENT SHIPMAN DECLARES HIMSELF BAFFLED Early on Monday morning the police of the city were invited to investigate a case of curious disappearance mister Douglas Romilly an English shoe manufacturer who travelled out from England on board the Elletania arrived at the Waldorf Hotel at four o clock on Saturday afternoon and was shown to the reservation made for him Within an hour he was enquired for by several callers who were shown to his room without result The apartment was found to be empty and nothing has since been seen or heard of mister Romilly The room assigned to him which could only have been occupied for a few minutes has been locked up and the keys handed to the police A considerable amount of luggage is in their possession and certain documents of a somewhat curious character From cables received early this afternoon it would appear that the Douglas Romilly Shoe Company one of the oldest established firms in England is in financial difficulties Then there was a paragraph in a paper of later date NO NEWS OF DOUGLAS ROMILLY The police have been unable to discover any trace of the missing Englishman From further cables to hand it appears that he was in possession of a considerable sum of money which must have been on his person at the time of disappearance and it is alleged that there was also a large amount with which he had intended to make purchases for his business standing to his credit at a New York bank Nothing has since been discovered however amongst his belongings of the slightest financial value nor does any bank in New York admit holding a credit on behalf of the missing man Perhaps it is time Philip murmured that these were destroyed He tore the newspapers into pieces and threw them into his waste basket On his writing table were forty or fifty closely written pages of manuscript In his pocketbook were sixteen hundred dollars and a document indicating a credit for a very much larger amount at the United Bank of New York in favor of Merton Ware and another The remainder of his belongings were negligible He stood at the window and looked out across the city the city into whose labyrinths he was so eager to penetrate the undiscovered country By day and night its voices were in his ears the rattle and roar of the overhead railway the clanging of the street cars the heavy traffic the fainter but never ceasing foot fall of the multitudes He had sat there before dawn and watched the queer pinky white light steal with ever widening fingers through the darkness heard the yawn of the city as it seemed to shiver and tremble before the battle of the day At twilight he had watched the lights spring up one by one at first like pin pricks in the distance growing and widening until the grotesque shapes of the buildings from which they sprung had faded into nothingness and there was left only a velvet curtain of strangely lit stars At a giddy distance below he could trace the blaze of Broadway the blue lights flashing from the electric wires as the cable cars rushed back and forth the red and violet glimmer of the sky signs He knew it all so well by morning by noon and night in rainstorm storms which he had watched come up from oceanwards in drifting clouds of vapour and in sunshine clear brilliant sunshine a little hard and austere to his way of thinking and unseasonable A week he muttered She said a week Tonight I will go out He looked at himself in the glass He wore no longer the well cut clothes of mister Douglas Romilly s Saville Row tailor but a ready made suit of Schmitt Mayer s business reach me downs an American felt hat and square toed shoes She said a week he repeated It s a fortnight to day I ll go to the restaurant at the corner I must find out for myself what all this noise means what the city has to say He turned towards the door and then stopped short For almost the first time since he had taken up his quarters here the lift had stopped outside There was a brief pause then his bell rang For a moment Philip hesitated Then he stepped forward and opened the door looking out enquiringly at his caller You mister Merton Ware He admitted the fact briefly His visitor was a young woman dressed in a rather shabby black indoor dress over which she wore an apron She was without either hat or gloves Her fingers were stained with purple copying ink and her dark hair was untidily arranged I live two stories down below she announced handing him a little card Miss Martha Grimes that s my name typewriter and stenographer you see The waiter who brings our meals told me he thought you were some way literary so I just stepped up to show you my prospectus If you ve any typewriting you want doing I m on the spot and I don t know as you d get it done much cheaper anywhere else or better There was nothing particularly ingratiating about Miss Martha Grimes but with the exception of a coloured waiter she happened to be the first human being with whom Philip had exchanged a word for several days He felt disinclined to hurry her away Come in he invited holding the door open So you do typing eh What sort of a machine do you use Remington she answered It s a bit knocked about a few of the letters I mean but I ve got some violet ink and I can make a manuscript look all right Half a dollar a thousand words and a quarter for carbon copies Of course if you d got a lot of stuff she went on her eyes lighting hopefully upon the little collection of manuscript upon his table I might quote you a trifle less He picked up some of his sheets and glanced at them Sooner or later he admitted I shall have to have this typed It isn t quite ready yet though He was struck by the curious little light of anticipation which somehow changed her face and which passed away at his last words Under pretence of gathering together some of those loose pages he examined her more closely and realised that he had done her at first scant justice She was very thin and the expression of her face was spoilt by the discontented curve of her lips The shape of her head however was good Her dark hair notwithstanding its temporary disarrangement was of beautiful quality and her eyes though dull and spiritless looking were large and full of subtle promise He replaced the sheets of manuscript Sit down for a moment he begged I d rather stand she replied Just as you please he assented smiling I was just wondering what to do about this stuff She hesitated for a moment then a little sulkily she seated herself I suppose you think I m a pretty forward young person to come up here and beg for work I don t care if you do she went on swinging her foot back and forth One has to live I am very pleased that you came he assured her It will be a great convenience to me to have my typing done on the premises and although I am afraid there won t be much of it you shall certainly do what there is Story writer she enquired I am only a beginner he told her This work I am going to give you is a play She looked at him with a shade of commiseration in her face Sickening job ain t it writing for the stage unless you ve got some sort of pull This is my first effort he explained Well it s none of my business she said gloomily All I want is the typing of it only you should see some of the truck I ve had I ve hated to send in the bill Waste of good time and paper I don t suppose yours is like that but there ain t much written that s any good anyway You re a hopeful young person aren t you he remarked taking a cigarette from the mantelpiece and lighting it Have one No thank you she replied rising briskly to her feet I m not that sort that sits about and smokes cigarettes with strange young men If you ll let me know when that work s going to be ready I ll send the janitor up for it He smiled deprecatingly You re not afraid of me by any chance are you he asked Her eyes glowed with contempt as she looked him up and down Afraid of you sir she repeated I should say not I ve met all sorts of men and I know something about them Then sit down again please he begged She hesitated for a moment then subsided once more unwillingly into the chair Don t know as I want to stay up here gossiping she remarked You d much better be getting on with your work Give me one of those cigarettes anyway she added abruptly Do you live in the building he enquired as he obeyed her behest Two flats below with pop she replied He s a bad actor very seldom in work and he drinks There are just the two of us Now you know as much as is good for you You re English ain t you I am Philip admitted Just out too by the way you talk I have been living in Jamaica he told her for many years clerk in an office there Better have stayed where you were I should think if you ve come here hoping to make a living by that sort of stuff Perhaps you re right he agreed but you see I am here been here a week or two in fact Done much visiting around she enquired I ve scarcely been out he confessed You see I don t know the city except from my windows It s wonderful from here after twilight Think so she replied dully It s a hard hammering brazen sort of place when you re living in it from hand to mouth Not but what we don t get along all right she added a little defiantly I m not grumbling I am sure you re not he assented soothingly Tell me to night I am a little tired of work I thought of going out Be a Good Samaritan and tell me where to find a restaurant in Broadway somewhere where crowds of people go but not what they call a fashionable place I want to get some dinner I haven t had anything decent to eat for I don t know how long and I want to breathe the same atmosphere as other people She looked at him a little enviously How much do you want to spend she asked bluntly I don t know that that really matters very much I have some money Things are more expensive over here aren t they I should go to the New Martin House she advised him right at the corner of this block It s real swell and they say the food s wonderful I could go as I am I suppose he asked glancing down at his clothes She stared at him wonderingly Say where did you come from she exclaimed You ain t supposed to dress yourself out in glad clothes for a Broadway restaurant not even the best of them Have you been to this place yourself he enquired Nope Come with me he invited suddenly She arose at once to her feet and threw the remains of her cigarette into the grate Say mister Ware she pronounced I ain t that sort and the sooner you know it the better especially if I m going to do your work I ll be going Look here he remonstrated earnestly you don t seem to understand me altogether What do you mean by saying you re not that sort You know well enough she answered defiantly I guess you re not proposing to give me a supper out of charity are you I am asking you to accompany me he declared because I haven t spoken to a human being for a week because I don t know a soul in New York because I ve got enough money to pay for two dinners and because I am fiendishly lonely She looked at him and it was obvious that she was more than half convinced Her brightening expression transformed her face She was still hesitating but her inclinations were apparent Say you mean that straight she asked You won t turn around afterwards and expect a lot of soft sawder because you ve bought me a meal Don t be a silly little fool he answered good humouredly All I want from you is to sit by my side and talk and tell me what to order Her face suddenly fell No good she sighed Haven t got any clothes If I am going like this he expostulated why can t you go as you are Take your apron off You ll be all right There s my black hat with the ribbon she reminded herself It s no style and Stella said yesterday she wouldn t be seen in a dime show in it Never you mind about Stella he insisted confidently You clap it on your head and come along She swung towards the door Meet you in the hall in ten minutes she promised Can t be any quicker This is your trouble you know I didn t invite myself Philip opened the door a civility which seemed to somewhat embarrass her I shall be waiting for you he declared cheerfully CHAPTER II Philip stepped into his own little bedroom and made scanty preparations for this his first excursion Then he made his way down into the shabby hall and was seated there on the worn settee when his guest descended She was wearing a hat which so far as he could judge was almost becoming Her gloves notwithstanding their many signs of mending were neat her shoes carefully polished and although her dress was undeniably shabby there was something in her carriage which pleased him Her eyes were fixed upon his from the moment she stepped from the lift She was watching for his expression half defiantly half anxiously Well you see what I look like she remarked brusquely You can back out of it if you want to Don t be silly he replied You look quite all right I m not much of a beau myself you know I bought this suit over the counter the other day without being measured for it or anything Guess you ain t used to ready made clothes she observed as they stepped outside You see in England and the Colonies he added hastily things aren t so expensive as here What a wonderful city this is of yours Martha Miss Grimes please she corrected him I beg your pardon he apologised That s just what I was afraid of she went on querulously You re beginning already You think because you re giving me a meal you can take all sorts of liberties Calling me by my Christian name indeed It was entirely a slip he assured her Tell me what theatre that is across the way She answered his question and volunteered other pieces of information Philip gazed about him as they walked along Broadway with the eager curiosity of a provincial sightseer She laughed at him a little scornfully You ll get used to all the life and bustle presently she told him It won t seem so wonderful to you when you walk along here without a dollar to bless yourself with and your silly plays come tumbling back Now this is the Martin House My Looks good inside don t it They crossed the threshold Philip handed his hat to the attendant and they stood a little undecided at the top of the brilliantly lit room A condescending maitre d hotel showed them to a retired table in a distant corner and another waiter handed them a menu You know half of this is unintelligible to me Philip confessed You ll have to do the ordering that was our bargain you know You must tell me how much you want to spend then she insisted I will not he answered firmly What I want is a good dinner and for this once in my life I don t care what it costs I ve a few hundred dollars in my pocket so you needn t be afraid I shan t be able to pay the bill You just order the things you like and a bottle of claret or anything else you prefer She turned to the waiter and carefully studying the prices she gave him an order One portion for two remember of the fish and the salad she enjoined Two portions of the chicken if you think one won t be enough She leaned back in her place It s going to cost you when you ve paid for the claret a matter of four dollars and fifty cents this dinner she said and I guess you ll have to give the waiter a quarter Are you scared He laughed at her once more Not a bit She looked at his long delicate fingers studied him for a moment Notwithstanding his clothes there was an air of breeding about him unconcealable a thing apart even from his good looks Clerk were you she remarked Seems to me you re used to spending two dollars on a meal all right I m not Neither am I he assured her One doesn t have much opportunity of spending money in Jamaica You seem kind of used to it somehow she persisted Have you come into money then I ve saved a little he explained with a rather grim smile and I ve well shall we say come into some Stolen it maybe she observed indifferently Should you be horrified if I told that I had I don t know she answered I m one of those who s lived honest and I sometimes wonder whether it pays It s a great problem he sighed It is that she admitted gloomily I ve got a friend she used to live in our place just below me Stella Kimbell her name is She and I learnt our typewriting together and started in the same office We stood it somehow for three years sometimes office work sometimes at home We didn t have much luck It was always better for me than for Stella because she was good looking and I m not I shouldn t say that he remonstrated You ve got beautiful eyes you know You stop it she warned him firmly My eyes are my own and I ll trouble you not to make remarks about them Sorry Philip murmured duly crushed The men were after her all the time the girl continued reminiscently Last place we were at a dry goods store not far from here the heads of the departments used to make her life fairly miserable She held out though but what with fines and one thing or another they forced her to leave So I did the same We drifted apart then for a while She got a job at an automobile place and I was working at home I remember the night she came to me I was all alone Pop had got a three line part somewhere and was bragging about it at all the bars in Broadway Stella came in quite suddenly and almost out of breath Kid she said I m through with it What do you mean I asked her Then she threw herself down on the sofa and she sobbed I never heard a girl cry like that in all my life She shrieked she was pretty nearly in hysterics and I couldn t get a word out of her When she was through at last she was all limp and white She wouldn t tell me anything She simply sat and looked at the stove Presently she got up to go I put my hands on her shoulders and I forced her back in the chair You ve got to tell me all about it Stella I insisted And then of course I heard the whole story She d got fired again These men are devils Don t tell me more about it unless you like he begged sympathetically Where is she now In the chorus of Three Frivolous Maids She comes in here regularly Sorry for herself Not she Last time I saw her she told me she wouldn t go back into an office or take on typewriting again for anything in the world She was looking prettier than ever too There s a swell chap almost crazy about her Shouldn t wonder if she hasn t got an automobile Well she answers our question one way then he remarked thoughtfully Tell me Miss Grimes is everything to eat in America as good as this fish Some cooking here she observed looking rather regretfully at her empty plate I told you things were all right There s grilled chicken Maryland chicken coming and green corn Have I got to eat the corn like that man opposite he asked anxiously You can eat it how you like she answered Watch me if you want to I don t care I ain t tasted green corn since I can remember and I m going to enjoy it You don t like your claret I m afraid he remarked She sipped it and set down the glass a little disparagingly If you want to know what I would like she said it s just a Martini cocktail We don t drink wines over here as much as you folk I guess He ordered the cocktails at once Every now and then he watched her She ate delicately but with a healthy and unashamed appetite A little colour came into her cheeks as the room grew warmer her lower lip became less uncompromising Suddenly she laid down her knife and fork Her eyes were agleam with interest She pulled at his sleeve Say that s Stella she exclaimed excitedly Look she s coming this way Don t she look stunning A girl undeniably pretty with dark red gold hair wearing a long ermine coat and followed by a fashionably dressed young man was making her way up the room She suddenly recognised Philip s companion and came towards her with outstretched hand If it isn t Martha she cried Isn t this great Felix this is Miss Grimes Martha Grimes you know she added calling to the young man who was accompanying her You must remember why what s the matter with you Felix She broke off in her speech Her companion was staring at Philip who was returning his scrutiny with an air of mild interrogation Say the young man enquired didn t I meet you on the Elletania Aren t you mister Douglas Romilly Philip shook his head My name is Ware he pronounced Merton Ware I have certainly never been on the Elletania and I don t remember having met you before The young man whose name was Felix appeared almost stupefied Gee whiz he muttered Excuse me sir but I never saw such a likeness before never Well shake hands with Miss Grimes quickly and come along Stella enjoined Remember I only have half an hour for dinner now You coming to see the show Martha Not to night that young woman declared firmly The two passed on after a few more moments of amiable but on the part of the young man somewhat dazed conversation Philip had resumed the consumption of his chicken He raised an over filled glass to his lips steadily and drank it without spilling a drop Mistook me for some one he remarked coolly She nodded Man who disappeared from the Waldorf Astoria They made quite a fuss about him in the newspapers I shouldn t have said you were the least like him to judge by his pictures anyway Philip shrugged his shoulders He seemed very little interested I don t often read the newspapers So that is Stella That is Stella she assented a little defiantly And if I were she I mean if I were as good looking as she is I d be in her place I wonder whether you would he observed thoughtfully Oh don t bother me with your problems she replied Does it run to coffee Of course it does he agreed and a liqueur if you like If you mean a cordial I ll have some of that green stuff she decided Don t know when I shall get another dinner like this again Well that rests with you he assured her I am very lonely just now Later on it will be different We ll come again next week if you like Better see how you feel about it when the time comes she answered practically Besides I m not sure they d let me in here again Did you see Stella s coat Fancy feeling fur like that up against your chin Fancy She broke off and sipped her coffee broodingly Those things are immaterial in themselves he reminded her It s just a question how much happiness they have brought her whether the thing pays or not Of course it pays she declared almost passionately You ve never seen my rooms or my drunken father I can tell you what they re like though They re ugly they re tawdry they re untidy when I ve any work to do they re scarcely clean Our meals are thrown at us we re always behind with the rent There isn t anything to look at or listen to that isn t ugly You haven t known what it is to feel the grim pang of a constant hideousness crawling into your senses stupefying you almost with a sort of misery oh I can t describe it I have felt all those things he said quietly What did you do she demanded No perhaps you had luck Perhaps it s not fair to ask you that It wouldn t apply What should you do if you were me if you had the chance to get out of it all the way that she has I am not a woman he reminded her simply If I answer you as an outsider a passer by mind though one who thinks about men and women I should say try one of her lesser sins one of the sins that leaves you clean Steal for instance And go to prison she protested angrily How much better off would you be there I wonder and what about when you came out Pooh Pay your bill and let s get out of this He obeyed and they made their way into the crowded street He paused for a moment on the pavement The pleasure swirl was creeping a little into his veins Would you like to go to a theatre he asked She shook her head You do as you like I m going home You needn t bother about coming with me either Don t be foolish he protested I only mentioned a theatre for your sake Come along They walked down Broadway and turned into their own street They entered the tenement building together and stepped into the lift She held out her hand a little abruptly Good night Good night he answered You get out first don t you I ll polish that stuff up to night the first part of it so that you can get on with the typing Some half developed fear which had been troubling her during the walk home seemed to have passed Her face cleared Don t think I am ungrateful she begged as the lift stopped I haven t had a good time like this for many months Thank you mister Ware and good night She stepped through the iron gates on to her own floor and Philip swung up to his rooms Somehow he entered almost light heartedly The roar of the city below was no longer provocative He felt as though he had stretched out a hand towards it as though he were in the way of becoming one of its children CHAPTER III A few nights later Philip awoke suddenly to find himself in a cold sweat face to face with all the horrors of an excited imagination Once more he felt his hand greedy for the soft flesh of the man he hated tearing its way through the stiff collar felt the demoniacal strength shooting down his arm the fever at his finger tips He saw the terrified face of his victim a strong man but impotent in his grasp heard the splash of the turgid waters saw himself his lust for vengeance unsatisfied peering downwards through the dim and murky gloom It was not only a physical nightmare which seized him His brain too was his accuser He saw with a hideous clarity that even the excuse of motive was denied him It was a sense of personal loss which had driven him out on to that canal path a murderer at heart It was something of which he had been robbed an acute and burning desire for vengeance personal entirely egotistical It was not the wrong to the woman which he resented had there been any wrong It was the agony of his own personal misery He rose from his bed and stamped up and down his little chamber in a fear which was almost hysterical He threw wide open the windows heedless of a driving snowstorm The subdued murmur of the city with its paling lights brought him no relief He longed frantically for some one who knew the truth for Elizabeth before any one with her soft cool touch her gentle protective sympathy He was a fool to think he could live alone like this with such a burden to bear Perhaps it would not be for long The risks were many At any moment he might hear the lift stop steps across the corridor the ring at his bell the plainly clad businesslike man outside with his formal questions his grim civility He fumbled about in his little dressing case until he came to a small box containing several white pills He gripped them in his hand and looked around listening No it was fancy There was still no sound in the building When at last he went back to bed however the little box was tightly clenched in his hands In the morning he went through his usual programme He arose soon after eight lighted his little spirit lamp made his coffee cut some bread and butter and breakfasted Then he lit a cigarette and sat down at his desk His imagination however seemed to have burnt itself out in the night Ideas and phrases were denied to him He was thankful about eleven o clock to hear a ring at the bell and find Martha Grimes outside with a little parcel under her arm She was wearing the same shabby black dress and her fingers were stained with copying ink Her almost too luxuriant hair was ill arranged and untidy Even her eyes seemed to have lost their lustre I ve finished she announced handing him the parcel Better look and see whether it s all right I can t do it up properly till I ve had the whole He cut the string and looked at a few of the sheets The typing was perfect He began to express his approval but she interrupted him It s better stuff than I expected she declared grudgingly I thought you were only one of these miserable amateurs Where did you learn to write like that Somehow her praise was like a tonic Do you like it he asked eagerly Oh my likes or dislikes don t matter she replied It s good stuff You ll find the account in there If you d like to pay me I d like to have the money He glanced at the neat little bill and took out his pocketbook Sit down for a minute he begged I m stuck this morning can t write a line Take my easy chair and smoke a cigarette I have nothing else to offer you For a moment she seemed about to refuse Then she flung herself into his easy chair took a cigarette and holding it between her lips almost scarlet against the pallor of her cheeks stretched upwards towards the match which he was holding Stella and her boy were over to see me last night she announced a little abruptly The young lady with the ermines he murmured And her boy Felix Martin It was through him they came I could see that all right He was trying all the time to pump me about you About me Oh you needn t trouble to look surprised she remarked I guess you remember the bee he had in his bonnet that night Mistook me for some one didn t he Philip murmured She nodded Kind of queer you don t read our newspapers It was a guy named Romilly Douglas Romilly who disappeared from the Waldorf Hotel Strange thing about it she went on is that I saw photographs of him in the newspapers and I can t recognise even a likeness This mister Felix Martin doesn t agree with you apparently Philip observed He don t go by the photographs Martha Grimes explained He believes that he crossed from Liverpool with this mister Douglas Romilly and that you she continued crossing her legs and smoothing down her skirt to hide her shabby shoes are so much like him that he came down last night to see if there was anything else he could find out from me before he paid a visit to police headquarters There was a moment s silence Philip was apparently groping for a match and the girl was keeping her head studiously turned away from him What business is it of his There was a reward offered Don t know as that would make much difference to Felix Martin though According to Stella s account he is pretty well a millionaire already It would be more useful to you wouldn t it Philip remarked Five hundred dollars Martha sighed Don t seem to me just now that there s much in the world you couldn t buy with five hundred dollars Well what did you tell mister Felix Martin Oh I lied sure He d found out the date you came into your rooms here the day this man Romilly disappeared but I told him that I d known you and done work for you before then long enough before the Elletania ever reached New York That kind of stumped him Why did you do that Philip demanded Dunno the girl replied with a shrug of the shoulders Just a fancy I guessed you wouldn t want him poking around But supposing I had been Douglas Romilly you might at least have divided the reward he reminded her There s money and money Martha declared We spoke of that the other day Stella s got money now Well she s welcome My time will come I suppose but if I can t have clean money I haven t made up my mind yet whether I wouldn t rather try the Hudson on a foggy morning Well I am not Douglas Romilly anyway Philip announced She looked up at him almost for the first time since her entrance I kind of thought you were she admitted I might have saved my lies then He shook his head You have probably saved me from more than you know of he replied I am not Douglas Romilly but You re not Merton Ware either she interrupted Quite right he agreed I started life as Philip Merton Ware the day I took these rooms and if the time should come he went on that any one seriously set about the task of finding out exactly who I was before I was Merton Ware you and I might as well take that little journey was it to the Hudson you said on a foggy morning together They sat in complete silence for several moments Then she threw the end of her cigarette into the fire Well I m glad I didn t lie for nothing she declared I didn t quite tumble to the Douglas Romilly stunt though They say he has left his business bankrupt in England and brought a fortune out here You don t look as though you were overdone with it I certainly haven t the fortune that Douglas Romilly is supposed to have got away with he said quietly I have enough money for my present needs though enough by the by to pay you for this typing he added counting out the money upon the table Any more stuff ready With luck there ll be some this afternoon he promised her I had a bad night last night but I think I ll be able to work later in the day She looked at him curiously at his face absolutely devoid of colour his eyes restless and overbright his long twitching fingers Bad conscience or drugs she asked Bad conscience he acknowledged I ve been where you have been Miss Grimes I looked over the edge and I jumped I d stay where you are if I were you Maybe I shall maybe I shan t she replied doggedly Stella wants to bring a boy around to see me You bring him I said I ll talk to him Then she got a little confused Stella s kind in her way She came back after mister Martin had gone down the passage See here kid she said you know as well as I do I can t bring any one round to see you while you are sitting around in those rags Let me lend you Well I stopped her short at that My own plumes or none at all I told her and I d just as soon he didn t come anyway You re a queer girl Philip exclaimed Where s your father to day Usual place she answered in bed He never gets up till five Let me order lunch up here for both of us from the restaurant he suggested She shook her head No thanks Why not he persisted I m going round to the office to see if I can get any extra work But you ve got to lunch some time he persisted She laughed a little hardly Have I We girls haven t got to eat like you men I ll call up towards the evening and see if you ve anything ready for me She was gone before he could stop her He turned back to his desk and seated himself The sight of his last finished sentence presented itself suddenly in a new light There was a suggestiveness about it which was almost poignant He took up his pen and began to write rapidly CHAPTER IV It was a few minutes after six that evening when Philip was conscious of a knock at his door He swung around in his chair blinking a little Come in Martha Grimes entered She was in outdoor apparel that is to say she wore her hat and a long mackintosh She remained standing upon the threshold Just looked up to see if you ve got any more work ready she explained He sprang to his feet and stood there for a moment unsteadily Come in and shut the door he ordered Look Look he added pointing to his table Thirty three sheets I ve been working all the time I ve been living I tell you living God knows where not in this accursed little world Here let s pick up the sheets There s enough work for you She looked at him curiously Have you been in that chair ever since she asked Ever since he assented enthusiastically Any lunch Not a scrap Never thought about it You ll make yourself sick that s what you ll do she declared Go out and get something at once Never even thought about lunch he repeated half to himself Where have you been Some luck she replied First place I dropped in at Found there was a girl gone home for the day fainted Lots of work to do so they just stuck me down in her chair Three dollars they gave me The girl s coming back to morrow though worse luck When did you have your lunch Haven t had any I m going to make myself a cup of tea now He reached for his hat Not on your life he exclaimed Come along Miss Martha Grimes I have written lines you just wait till you type them I tell you it s what I have had at the back of my head for months It s there now on paper living flaring words Come along Where to We are going to eat he insisted I am faint and so are you We are going to that same place and we ll have lunch and dinner in one Nothing doing she snapped You ll see some more people who recognise you He waved his hand contemptuously Who cares If you don t come along with me I ll go up town to the Waldorf or the Ritz Carlton I ll waste my money and advertise myself Come along that same little quiet corner I don t suppose your friends will be there again Stella won t she admitted doubtfully She s going to Sherry s I d just as soon be out she went on ruminatingly Shouldn t be surprised if she didn t bring that guy in after all He had already rung the bell of the lift Look at me she exclaimed ironically Nice sort of an object I am to take out Got a raincoat on though it s dry enough because my coat s gone at the seams If you don t stop talking like that he declared I ll march into one of those great stores and order everything a woman wants to wear Look at me Did you ever see such clothes A man s different she protested Besides you ve got a way with you of looking as though you could wear better clothes if you wanted to something superior I don t like it I should like you better if you were common You re going to like me better he assured her because we are going to have a cocktail together within the next three minutes Look at you pale as you can stick I bet you haven t had a mouthful of food all day Neither have I except a slice of bread and butter with my tea this morning We re a nice sort of couple to talk about clothes What we want is food She swayed for a moment and pretended that she tripped He caught her arm and steadied her She jerked it from him Have your own way she yielded They reached the corner of the street plunged into the surging crowds of Broadway passed into the huge restaurant were once more pounced upon by a businesslike but slightly patronizing maitre d hotel and escorted to a remote table in a sort of annex of the room Philip pushed the menu away Two cocktails the quickest you ever mixed in your life he ordered Quicker than that mind The man was back again almost at once with two frosted glasses upon a tray They laughed together almost like children as they set them down empty I know what I want and you too by the look of you he continued a beefsteak with some more of that green corn you gave me the other day and fried potatoes and Burgundy We ll have some oysters first while we wait She sighed I don t mean to come here with you again she said a little impatiently I don t know why I give in to you You re not strong you know You are a weak man Women will always look after you they ll always help you in trouble I suppose they ll always care for you Can t think why I do what you want me to Guess I was near starving He laughed You don t know much about me yet he reminded her You don t know much about yourself she retorted glibly Why according to your own confession you only started life a few weeks ago I fancy what went before didn t count for much You ve been fretted and tied up somewhere You haven t had the chance of getting big like so many of our American men What are you going to do with this play of yours Miss Elizabeth Dalstan has promised to produce it he told her She looked at him in some surprise Elizabeth Dalstan she repeated Why she s one of our best actresses I understood so he replied She has heard the story in fact I wrote out one of the scenes with her She is going to produce it as soon as it s finished Well all you poor idiots who write things have some fine tale to tell their typewriter she remarked You seem as though you mean it though Where did you meet Elizabeth Dalstan I came over with her on the Elletania he answered thoughtlessly She gave a little start Then she turned upon him almost in anger Well of all the simpletons she exclaimed So that s the way you give yourself away is it Just here from Jamaica eh Nothing to do with Douglas Romilly Never heard of the Elletania did you I d like to see you on the grid at police headquarters for five minutes with one of our men asking you a few friendly questions You d look well you would You ought to go about with a nurse Philip had all the appearance of a guilty child You see he explained penitently I am new to this sort of thing However you know now Still ready to swear that you re not Douglas Romilly I suppose On my honour I am not he replied Kind of funny that you should have been on the steamer after all she jeered Perhaps so but I am not Douglas Romilly he persisted She was silent for a moment then she shrugged her shoulders What do I care who your are she said Here help me off with this raincoat please It s warm in here thank goodness He looked at her as she sat by his side in her plain black dress and was impressed for the first time with a certain unsuspected grace of outline which made him for the moment oblivious of the shabbiness of her gown You have rather a nice figure he told her with a sudden impulse of ingenuousness She turned upon him almost furiously Something in his expression however seemed to disarm her She closed her lips again You are nothing but a child she declared You don t mean anything I d be a fool to be angry with you The waiter brought their steak Philip was conscious of something in his companion s eyes which almost horrified him It was just that gleam of hungry desire which has starvation for its background Don t let s talk he pleaded There isn t any conversation in the world as good as this The waiter served them and withdrew casting a curious glance behind They were from his point of view a strange couple for cosmopolitan though the restaurant was money was plentiful in the neighbourhood and clients as shabby as these two seldom presented themselves He pointed them out to a maitre d hotel who in his turn whispered a few words concerning them to a dark lantern jawed man with keen eyes and a hard mouth who was dining by himself The latter glanced at them and nodded Thank you Charles he said I ve had my eye on them The girl s a pauper daughter of that old fool Grimes the actor Does a little typewriting precious little I should think from the look of her The man s interesting Don t talk about them Understand The maitre d hotel bowed I understand Inspector Not much any one can tell you sir Pays his bill in American money I suppose the diner asked I ll ascertain for you mister Dane Charles replied I believe he is an Englishman Name of Merton Ware the inspector agreed nodding just arrived from Jamaica Writes some sort of stuff which the girl with him typewrites That s his story He s probably as harmless as a baby Charles bowed and moved away His smile was inscrutable CHAPTER V New York became a changed city to Philip Its roar and its turmoil its babel of tongues speaking to him always in some alien language were suddenly hushed He was no longer conscious of the hard unconcern of a million faces of the crude buildings in the streets the cutting winds the curious depressing sense of being on a desert island the hermit clutching at the sleeves of imaginary multitudes A few minutes journey in a cable car which seemed to crawl a few minutes swift walking along the broad thoroughfare of Fifth Avenue where his feet seemed to fall upon the air and the passersby seemed to smile upon him like real human beings and he was in her room It was only an hotel sitting room after all but eloquent of her a sitting room filled with great bowls of roses with comfortable easy chairs furniture of rose coloured satin white walls and an English fire upon the grate Elizabeth was in New York and the world moved differently She came out to him from an inner room almost at once His eyes swept over her feverishly He almost held his breath Then he gave a great sigh of satisfaction She came with her hands outstretched a welcoming smile upon her lips She was just as he had expected to find her There was nothing in her manner to indicate that they had not parted yesterday Welcome to New York my dramatist she exclaimed I am here you see to the day almost to the hour He stood there holding her hands His eyes seemed to be devouring her Go on talking to me he begged Let me hear you speak You can t think you can t imagine how often in the middle of the night I have waked up and thought of you and the cold shivers have come because after all I fancied that you must be a dream that you didn t really exist that that voyage had never existed Go on talking You foolish person she laughed patting his hands affectionately But then of course you are a little overwrought I am very real I can assure you I have been in Chicago playing but there hasn t been a night when I haven t thought of the times when we used to talk together in the darkness when you let me into your life and I made up my mind to try and help you Foolish person Sit down in that great easy chair and draw it up to the fire He sank into it with a little sigh of content She threw herself on to the couch opposite to him Her hands drooped down a little wearily on either side her head was thrown back Against the background of rose silk cushions her cheeks seemed unexpectedly pale I am tired with travelling she murmured and I hate Chicago and I have worried about you Day by day I have read the papers Everything has gone well So far as I know he answered I did exactly as we planned or rather as you planned The papers have been full of the disappearance of Douglas Romilly You read how wonderfully it has all turned out Fate has provided him with a real reason for disappearing It seems that the business was bankrupt You mustn t forget though she reminded him that that also supplies a considerable motive for tracking him down He is supposed to have at least twenty thousand pounds with him I have all the papers he went on They prove that he knew the state the business was in They prove that he really intended to disappear in New York The money stands to the credit of Merton Ware and another at a bank with which his firm apparently had had no connections a small bank in Wall Street So that she remarked is where you get your pseudonym from It makes the identification so easy he pointed out and no one knew of it except he I could easily get a witness presently to prove that I am Merton Ware You haven t drawn the money yet then I haven t been near the bank he replied I still have over a thousand dollars money he had with him Sometimes I think that if I could I d like to leave that twenty thousand pounds where it is I should like some day if I could do so without suspicion to let the creditors of the firm have it back again What do you think She nodded I would rather you didn t touch it yourself she agreed I think you ll find too that you ll be able to earn quite enough without wanting it Nothing disturbing has happened to you at all then Once I had a fright he told her I was in a restaurant close to my hotel I was there with a young woman who is typing the play for me She looked towards him incredulously You were there with a typewriter she exclaimed I suppose it seems queer he admitted It didn t to me She is a plain shabby half starved little thing fighting her own battle bravely She came to me for work she lives in the flat below and it seemed to me that she was just as hungry for a kind word as I was lonely and I took her out with me Twice I have taken her Her name is Miss Grimes I am not in the least sure that I approve she said but go on A friend of hers came into the restaurant a girl in the chorus of a musical comedy here and she had with her a young man I recognised him at once We didn t come across one another much but he was on the steamer Elizabeth s face was full of concern Go on He asked me twice if I wasn t mister Romilly I assured him that he was mistaken I don t think I gave myself away The next day he went to see the girl I was with Martha Grimes Well what did she tell him She told him that she had been typing my work for over a month that I had come from Jamaica and that my name was Merton Ware Elizabeth gazed into the fire for several moments and Philip watched her It was a woman s face grave and thoughtful a little perturbed just then as though by some unwelcome thought Presently she looked back at him looked into his eyes long and earnestly My friend she said you are like no one else on earth Perhaps you are one of those horrible people who have what they call an unholy influence over my sex You have known this girl for a matter of a few days and she lies for you And there s five hundred dollars reward I suppose she knew about that Yes she knew he admitted She simply isn t that sort I suppose I realised that or I shouldn t have been kind to her It s a puzzle she went on I think there must be something in you of the weakling you know something that appeals to the mothering instinct in women I know that my first feeling for you was that I wanted to help you Tell me what you think of yourself mister Philip Merton Ware Are you a faithful person Are you conscientious Have you a heart I wonder How much of the man is there underneath that strong frame of yours Are you going to take just the things that are given you in life and make no return For the moment you see I am forgetting that you are my friend and that I like you I am thinking of you from the point of view of an actress as a psychical problem Philip you idiot she broke off suddenly stamping her foot don t sit there looking at me with your great eyes Tell me you are glad I ve come back Tell me you feel something for goodness sake He was on his knees before she could check him his arms his lips praying for her She thrust him back It was my fault she declared but don t please Yes of course you have feelings I don t know why you tempted me to that little outburst You ll tempt me to more than that he cried passionately Do you think it s for your help that I ve thought of you Do you think it s because you re an angel to me because you ve comforted me in my darkest most miserable hours that I ve dreamed of you and craved for you There s more than that in my thoughts dear It s because you are you yourself that I ve longed for you through the aching hours of the night that I ve sat and written like a man beside himself just for the joy of thinking that the words I wrote would be spoken by you Oh if you want me to tell you what I feel She suddenly leaned forward took his head between her hands and kissed his forehead Now get back please to your chair she begged You ve stilled the horrible miserable little doubt that was tearing at my heartstrings I just had it before once or twice and then isn t it foolish your telling me about this little typewriter girl I must go and see her We must be kind to her He resumed his seat with a little sigh She thought a great deal more of me and my work when I told her that you were probably going to act in my play Her expression changed She was more serious at the same time more eager Ah The play she exclaimed I can see that you have brought some of it He drew the roll of manuscript from his pocket Shall I read it he suggested She almost snatched it away No I can t wait for that Give it to me quickly She leaned forward so that the firelight fell upon the pages Little strands of soft brown hair drooped over her face In studying her Philip almost forgot his own anxiety He had known so few women yet he had watched so many from afar off endowed them with their natural qualities built up their lives and tastes for them and found them all so sadly wanting To him Elizabeth represented everything that was desirable in her sex from the flowing lines of her beautiful body to the sympathy which seemed to be always shining out of her eyes Notwithstanding her strength she was so exquisitely and entirely feminine a creature of silk and laces free from any effort of provocativeness yet subtly almost clamorously human He forgot in those few moments that she had become the arbitress of his material fate that he was a humble author watching the effect of his first attempts upon a mistress in her profession He remembered only that she was the woman who was filling his life stealing into every corner of it permeating him with love pointing him onwards towards a life indescribable unrealisable She swung suddenly towards him There was a certain amount of enthusiasm in her face but even more marked was her relief Oh I am so glad she cried You know I have had qualms When you told me the story in your own words picking your language so carefully and building it all up before me well you know what I said I gave you more than hope I promised you success And then when I got away into the hard stagey world of Chicago and my manager talked business to me and my last playwright preached of technique I began to wonder whether after all you could bring your ideas together like this whether you would have a sense of perspective you know what I mean don t you And you have it and the play is going to be wonderful and I shall produce it Why don t you look pleased mister Author You are going to be famous He smiled I don t care about fame he said And for the rest I think I knew Conceited she exclaimed It wasn t that he protested It was simply when I sat down in that little room high up over the roofs and buildings of a strange city shut myself in and told myself that it was for you well the thoughts came too easily They tumbled over one another And when I looked away from my work I saw the people moving around me and I knew that I had made my dreams real and that s the great thing isn t it Elizabeth Well I am lonely in that little room You lonely taking out typewriters to dine she mocked tenderly It is lonely he repeated and I am afraid of you here in all this luxury I am so far away I come from my attic to this and I am afraid Do you know why She sat quite still for a moment Dimly she felt the presage of a coming change in their relations Up to now she had been the mistress she had held him so easily in check with her practised skill with an unfinished sentence a look a touch And now the man was rising up in him and she felt her powers weaken Shall I change my abode she murmured Ah but you would be just as wonderful and as far away even if we changed places if you sat in my attic and I took your place here That isn t why I torture myself why I am always asking myself if you are real if the things we talk about are real if the things we feel belong to ourselves well up from our own hearts for one another or are just the secondary emotions of other people we catch up without knowing why This is foolish but you understand you do understand It is because you keep me so far away from yourself when my fingers are burning for yours when even to touch your face to feel your cheek against mine would banish every fear I have ever had Elizabeth you do understand I have never kissed you I have never held you for one moment in my arms and I love you He was leaning over her chair and she held him tightly by the shoulders There was nothing left of that hidden fear in his dark eyes They shone now with another light and she began to tremble I wanted to wait a little Philip but if you feel like that well I can t He took her silently into his arms With the half closing of her eyes the first touch of her responsive lips himself dimly conscious of the change he passed into the world where stronger men live BOOK III CHAPTER I Three months later a very different Philip stood in the smaller of a handsome suite of reception rooms in a fashionable Fifth Avenue hotel He was wearing evening clothes of the most approved cut and carried himself with a dignity and assurance entirely transforming The distinction of birth and breeding little apparent in those half starved passionate days of his misery had come easily to the surface His shoulders too seemed to have broadened and his face had lost its cadaverous pallor The apartment in which he stood was plainly but handsomely furnished as a small withdrawing room On the oak chiffonier stood a silver tray on which were half a dozen frosted cocktails Through the curtains was apparent a room beyond in which a round table smothered with flowers was arranged for supper in the distance from the public restaurant came the sound of softly played music Philip glanced at the clock The whole of the anxieties of this momentous evening had passed Telephone messages had reached him every quarter of an hour The play was a great success Elizabeth was coming to him with her producer and a few theatrical friends flushed with triumph They were all to meet for the first time that night the man who for the last three months had lived as a hermit Merton Ware the author of The House of Shams the new found dramatist A maitre d hotel appeared in the space between the two rooms and bowed Everything is quite ready mister Ware he said in the friendly yet deferential manner of an American head waiter Won t you take a cocktail sir while you are waiting Very thoughtful of you Louis I think I will Philip assented taking a little case from his pocket and lighting a cigarette The man passed him a glass upon a small salver You ll pardon the liberty I am sure sir he continued dropping his voice a little I ve just heard that The House of Shams seems to be a huge success sir If I might take the liberty of offering my congratulations Philip smiled genially You are the first Louis he said Thank you very much indeed I think you will find the supper everything that could be desired mister Ware the man went on Our head chef Monsieur Raconnot has given it his personal attention The wine will be slightly iced as you desired I shall be outside in the corridor to announce the guests Capital Louis Ware replied sipping his cocktail It will be another quarter of an hour yet before we see anything of them I am afraid The man disappeared and left Philip once more alone He looked through the walls of the room as though indeed he could see into the packed theatre and could hear the cries for Author which even then were echoing through the house From the moment when Elizabeth abandoning her reserve had given him the love he craved a new strength seemed to have shone out of the man Step by step he had thought out subtly and with infinite care every small detail of his life It was he who had elected to live those three months in absolute seclusion It was he indirectly who had arranged that many more photographs of Douglas Romilly the English shoe manufacturer should appear in the newspapers One moment s horror he had certainly had He could see the little paragraph now almost lost in the shoals of more important news GHASTLY DISCOVERY IN A DERBYSHIRE CANAL Yesterday the police recovered the body of a man who had apparently been dead for some weeks from a canal close to Detton Magna The body was unrecognisable but it is believed that the remains are those of mister Philip Romilly the missing art teacher from London who is alleged to have committed suicide in January last The thought of that gruesome find scarcely blanched his cheeks His nerves now were stronger and tenser things He crushed back those memories with all the strength of his will Whatever might lie behind he had struck for the future which he meant to live and enjoy They were only weaklings who brooded over an unalterable past It was for the present and the near future that he lived and both in that moment were more alluring than ever before Even his intellectual powers seemed to have developed in his new found happiness The play which he had written every line of which appeared to gain in vital and literary force towards its conclusion was only the first of his children Already other images and ideas were flowing into his brain The power of creation was triumphantly throwing out its tendrils He was filled with an amazing and almost inspired confidence He was ready to start upon fresh work that hour to morrow or when he chose And before him now was the prospect of stimulating companionship Elizabeth and he had decided that the time had come for him to take his fate into his hands He was to be introduced to the magnates of the dramatic profession to become a clubman in the world s most hospitable city to mix freely in the circles where he would find himself in constant association with the keenest brains and most brilliant men of letters in the world He was safe They had both decided it He walked to the mirror and looked at himself The nervous highly strung half starved neurotic stripling had become the perfectly assured well mannered and well dressed man of the world He had studied various details with a peculiar care suffered a barber to take summary measures with his overlong black hair had accustomed himself to the use of an eyeglass which hung around his neck by a thin black ribbon Men might talk of likenesses men who were close students of their fellows yet there was no living person who could point to him and say You are beyond a shadow of doubt a man with whom I travelled on the Elletania The thing was impossible Louis once more made a noiseless appearance There was the slightest of frowns upon his face A gentleman wishes a word with you before the arrival of your guests mister Ware he announced A journalist Philip enquired carelessly I do not think so sir Even as he spoke the door was opened and closed again The man who had entered bowed slightly to Philip He was tall and clean shaven self assured and with manner almost significantly reserved He held a bowler hat in his hand and glanced towards Louis He had the air of being somewhat out of place in so fashionable a rendezvous Good evening mister Ware he began Could I have just a word with you Philip nodded to Louis who at once left the room The newcomer drew a little nearer My name sir he said is Dane Edward Dane Philip bowed politely He was just a little annoyed at the intrusion an annoyance which he failed altogether to conceal What do you want with me he asked I am expecting some friends to supper in about ten minutes Ten minutes will perhaps be sufficient for what I have to say the other promised You don t know me then mister Ware Never saw you before to the best of my knowledge Philip replied nonchalantly Are you a journalist The man laid his hat upon a corner of the table I am a detective he said attached to the Cherry Street headquarters Your last rooms mister Ware were in my beat Philip nodded with some slight indication of interest He faced his ordeal with the courage of a man of steel That so he remarked indifferently Well mister Dane I have heard a good deal about you American detectives Pleased to meet you What can I do for you The detective eyed Philip steadfastly There was just the shadow of something that looked like admiration in his hard grey eyes Well mister Ware he said nothing that need disturb your supper party I am sure Over in this country we sometimes do things in an unusual way That s why I am paying you this visit I have been watching you for exactly three months and fourteen days Watching me Philip repeated Precisely No idea why I suppose Not the slightest The detective glanced towards the clock Barely two minutes had passed Well he explained I got on your tracks quick enough when you skipped from the Waldorf and blossomed out in a second rate tenement house as Merton Ware So I was at the Waldorf was I Philip murmured You crossed from Liverpool on the Elletania the man continued registered at the Waldorf as mister Douglas Romilly of the Douglas Romilly Shoe Company went to your room changed your clothes and disappeared Of course a disappearance of that sort he went on tolerantly might be possible in London In New York to even attempt it is farcical Dear me remarked Philip this is very interesting Let me ask you this question though If you were so sure of your facts why didn t you arrest me at once instead of just watching me The man s eyes were like gimlets He seemed as though he were trying with curious and professional intensity to read the thoughts in Philip s brain There is no criminal charge against Douglas Romilly that I know of he said There s a considerable reward offered for his discovery Philip reminded him I can claim that at any moment the man replied I have had my reasons for waiting It s partly those reasons that have brought me here For one thing mister Douglas Romilly was supposed to be able to put his hand on a matter of a hundred thousand dollars somewhere in New York You haven t shown many signs up till now mister Ware of having any such sum in your possession I see Philip assented You wanted the money as well The creditors of the Douglas Romilly Shoe Company are wanting it pretty badly the man proceeded but that wasn t all I wanted to find out what your game was That I don t know even now That is why I have come to you Have I the pleasure of speaking to mister Douglas Romilly I really don t see Philip protested thoughtfully why I should go into partnership with you in this affair You see in the long run our interests might not be altogether identical mister Dane smiled grimly That s a fairly shrewd calculation mister Ware he admitted You ain t bound to answer any question you don t want to This is just a friendly chat and no more Besides Philip continued lighting another cigarette I think I understood you to say that you had already arrived at the conclusion that I was Douglas Romilly Not precisely that the detective replied All that I discovered was that you were the man who registered at the Waldorf Hotel as mister Douglas Romilly Well the only name I choose to acknowledge at present is the name of Merton Ware Philip declared If you think there is any mystery about me any connection with the gentleman whom I believe you call mister Douglas Romilly well the matter is one for your investigation You will forgive me if I remind you that my guests will be here in a matter of a few minutes and permit me to ask you one more question Why do you come here to me in this very unofficial manner If I am really an impostor you are giving me every opportunity of clearing out mister Edward Dane shook his head He was fingering the brim of his hat Oh no mister Ware he declared smoothly Our detective system may have some faults but when a man s name is put on the list where yours figures he has not one chance in a million of leaving the country or of gaining any place of hiding I shall know where you lunch to morrow and with whom you dine and with whom you spend your time The law sir will keep its eye upon you Really that seems very friendly Philip said coolly Shall I have the privilege of your personal surveillance I think not mister Ware To tell you the truth this is rather a p p c visit I ve booked my passage on the Elletania sailing to morrow from New York I am taking a trip over to England to make a few enquiries round about the spot where this mister Douglas Romilly hails from Detton Magna isn t it Philip made no reply yet even his silence might well have been the silence of indifference At the last moment the detective concluded it flashed in upon me that there might be some ridiculous explanation of the few little points about your case which I must confess have puzzled me For that reason I decided to seek an interview with you before I left You have however I gather nothing to say to me Nothing at all mister Dane except to wish you a pleasant voyage Philip declared I won t detain you a moment longer I hear my guests in the corridor Good night sir he added opening the door I appreciate your call very much Come and see me again when you return from England mister Dane lingered for a moment upon the threshold hat in hand a somewhat ominous figure There was no attempt at a handshake between the two men The detective was imperturbable Philip listening to Elizabeth s voice had shown his first sign of impatience I shall surely do that mister Ware the other promised as he passed out The door closed Philip stood for a moment in the empty room listening to the man s retreating footsteps Then he turned slowly around His cheeks were blanched his eyes were glazed with reminiscent horror He looked through the wall of the room a long way back We shall find mister Ware in here I expect He could hear the voices of his approaching guests He ground his heel into the carpet and swung around He anticipated Louis threw open the curtain and stood there waiting to welcome his guests a smile upon his lips his hands outstretched towards Elizabeth CHAPTER II Elizabeth s face was glowing with joy For the first time Philip realised that she too had had her anxieties 
2312-157868-0000	train-other-500	You dear dear man she exclaimed To think what you have missed It would have been the evening of your life It s a success do you hear a great success It was wonderful
2312-157868-0001	train-other-500	He seemed almost to himself to be playing a part he was so calm yet so gracefully happy I am glad for both our sakes he said She indicated the others with a little wave of the hand
2312-157868-0002	train-other-500	I don t think you know a soul do you she asked They none of them quite believe in your existence down at the theatre This is my leading man Noel Bridges You should have seen how splendid he was as Carriston
2312-157868-0003	train-other-500	mister Noel Bridges with a deprecating smile towards Elizabeth held out his hand He was tall and of rather a rugged type for the New York stage Like the rest of the little party his eyes were full of curiosity
2312-157868-0004	train-other-500	as he shook hands with Philip So you are something human after all he remarked We began to think you lived underground and only put your head up every now and then for a little air I am glad to meet you mister Ware
none	none	 I enjoy acting in your play very much indeed 
2312-157868-0005	train-other-500	and I hope it s only the first of many You are very kind Philip murmured cordially Elizabeth glanced around the little group Dear me I am forgetting my manners she declared
2312-157868-0006	train-other-500	I ought to have presented you to Sara Denison first Sara is really the star of your play mister Ware although I have the most work to do She loves her part and has asked about you nearly every day
2312-157868-0007	train-other-500	Miss Denison a young lady of the smaller Gibson type with large eyes and a very constant smile greeted Philip warmly Do you know she told him that this is the first time I have ever been in a play
2312-157868-0008	train-other-500	in which the author hasn t been round setting us to rights most of the time I can t imagine how you kept away mister Ware Perhaps observed Philip my absence has contributed to your success I am sure I shouldn t have known what to tell you
2312-157868-0009	train-other-500	You see I am so absolutely ignorant of the technique I ve got to shake hands with you mister Ware a stout middle aged clean shaven man with narrow black eyes and pale cheeks declared stepping forward
none	none	 These other folk don t count for much by the side of me 
2312-157868-0010	train-other-500	I am the manager of the theatre and I m thundering glad that your first play has been produced at the New York sir There s good stuff in it and if I am any judge and I m supposed to be
2312-157868-0011	train-other-500	there s plenty of better stuff behind Shake hands if you please sir You know me by name Paul Fink I hope you ll see my signature at the bottom of a good many fat cheques before you ve finished writing plays
2312-157868-0012	train-other-500	That s very nice of you mister Fink Philip declared Now I am sure you all want your supper
none	none	 At a sign from Philip the maitre d hotel handed round the tray of cocktails 
2312-157868-0013	train-other-500	mister Fink raised his glass Here s success to the play he exclaimed and good luck to all of us He tossed off the contents of the glass and they all followed his example Then they took their places at the little round table
none	none	 and the service of supper began The conversation somewhat naturally centered around Philip The three strangers were all interested in his personality and the fact that he had no previous work to his credit 
2312-157868-0014	train-other-500	It was unusual almost dramatic and for a time both Elizabeth and he himself found themselves hard put to it to escape the constant wave of good natured but very pertinent questions
none	none	 You ll have a dose of our newspapermen to morrow sir 
2312-157868-0015	train-other-500	mister Fink promised him They ll be buzzing around you all day long They ll want to know everything from where you get your clothes and what cigarettes you smoke to how you like best to do your work and what complexioned typist you prefer
2312-157868-0016	train-other-500	They re some boys I can tell you Philip s eyes met Elizabeth s across the table The same instinct of disquietude kept them both for a moment silent I am afraid Elizabeth sighed
2312-157868-0017	train-other-500	that mister Ware will find it rather hard to appreciate some of our journalistic friends They re good fellows mister Fink declared heartily white men all of them So long as you don t try to put em off on a false stunt or anything of that sort
2312-157868-0018	train-other-500	they ll sling the ink about some Ed Harris was in my room just after the second act and he showed me some of his stuff I tell you he means to boost us Elizabeth laid her hand upon her manager s arm
2312-157868-0019	train-other-500	They re delightful every one of them she agreed but mister Fink you have such influence with them I wonder if I dare give you just a hint mister Ware has passed through some very painful times lately
2312-157868-0020	train-other-500	He is so anxious to forget and I really don t wonder at it myself I am sure he will be delighted to talk with all of them as to the future and his future plans but do you think you could just drop them a hint to go quietly
2312-157868-0021	train-other-500	as regards the past mister Fink was a little perplexed but inclined to be sympathetic He glanced towards Philip who was deep in conversation with Sara Denison Why I ll do my best Miss Dalstan he promised
none	none	 You know what the boys are though 
2312-157868-0022	train-other-500	They do love a story I am not going to have mister Ware s story published in every newspaper in New York Elizabeth said firmly and the newspaper man who worms the history of mister Ware s misfortunes out of him
2312-157868-0023	train-other-500	and then makes use of it will be no friend of mine Ask them to be sports mister Fink there s a dear I ll do what I can he promised mister Ware isn t the first man in the world who has funked the limelight
2312-157868-0024	train-other-500	and from what I can see of him it probably wasn t his fault if things did go a little crooked in the past I ll do my best Miss Dalstan I promise you that I ll look in at the club to night and drop a few hints around
2312-157868-0025	train-other-500	Elizabeth patted his hand and smiled at him very sweetly The conversation flowed back once more into its former channels became a medley of confused chaff disjointed streams of congratulation
2312-157868-0026	train-other-500	of toast drinking and pleasant speeches Then mister Fink suddenly rose to his feet Say he exclaimed we ve all drunk one another s healths There s just one other friend I think we ought to take a glass of wine with
2312-157868-0027	train-other-500	Gee he d give something to be with us to night You ll agree with me Miss Dalstan I know Let s empty a full glass to Sylvanus Power There was a curious silence for a second or two
none	none	 then a clamour of assenting voices 
2312-157868-0028	train-other-500	For a single moment Philip felt a sharp pang at his heart Elizabeth was gazing steadily out of the room a queer tremble at her lips a look in her eyes which puzzled him a look almost of fear
2312-157868-0029	train-other-500	of some sort of apprehension The moment passed but her enthusiasm as she raised her glass was a little overdone her gaiety too easily assumed Why of course she declared
2312-157868-0030	train-other-500	Fancy not thinking of Sylvanus They drank his health noisily Philip set down his glass empty A curious instinct kept his lips sealed He crushed down and stifled the memory of that sudden stab
2312-157868-0031	train-other-500	He did not even ask the one natural question
none	none	 Say where is Sylvanus Power these days mister Fink enquired In Honolulu when last I heard Elizabeth replied lightly 
2312-157868-0032	train-other-500	but then one never knows really where he is Philip became naturally the central figure of the little gathering mister Fink was anxious to arrange a little dinner to introduce him to some fellow workers
2312-157868-0033	train-other-500	Noel Bridges insisted upon a card for the Lambs Club and a luncheon there Philip accepted gratefully everything that was offered to him It was no good doing things by halves he told himself
2312-157868-0034	train-other-500	The days of his solitude were over Even when after the departure of his guests he glanced for a moment into the anteroom beyond and remembered those few throbbing moments of suspense
2312-157868-0035	train-other-500	they came back to him with a curious sense of unreality they belonged surety to some other man living in some other world You are happy Elizabeth murmured
2312-157868-0036	train-other-500	as she took his arm and they waited in the portico below for her automobile He had no longer any idea of telling her of that disquieting visit The touch of her hair blown against his cheek
2312-157868-0037	train-other-500	as he had helped her on with her cloak something in her voice some slight diffidence a queer half expostulating look in the eyes
none	none	 that fell with a curious uneasiness before his 
2312-157868-0038	train-other-500	drove every thought of future danger out of his mind He had at least the present He answered without a moment s hesitation For the first time in my life
2312-157868-0039	train-other-500	She gave the chauffeur a whispered order as she stepped into the car I have told him to go home by Riverside Drive she said as they glided off It is a little farther
2312-157868-0040	train-other-500	and I love the air at this time of night He clasped her fingers suddenly felt with the leaning of her body
none	none	 her heart beating against his 
2312-157868-0041	train-other-500	With that wave of passion there was an instant and portentous change in their attitudes The soft protectiveness which had sometimes seemed to shine out of her face to envelop him in its warmth had disappeared
2312-157868-0042	train-other-500	She was no longer the stronger She looked at him almost with fear and he was electrically conscious of all the vigour and strength of his stunted manhood was master at last of his fate
2312-157868-0043	train-other-500	accepting battle willing to fight whatever might come for the sake of the joy of these moments
none	none	 She crept into his arms almost humbly CHAPTER III The success of The House of Shams was as immediate and complete as was the social success of its author After a few faint hearted attempts Philip and Elizabeth both agreed that the wisest course was to play the bold game to submit himself to the photographer the interviewer and to some judicious extent to the wave of hospitality which flowed in upon him from all sides He threw aside completely and utterly every idea of leading a more or less sheltered life His photograph was in the Sunday newspapers and the magazines It was quite easy in satisfying the appetite of journalists for copious personal details especially after the hints dropped by mister Fink to keep them carefully off the subject of his immediate past There had been many others in the world who on attaining fame had preferred to gloss over their earlier history It seemed to be tacitly understood amongst this wonderful freemasonry of newspaper men that mister Merton Ware was to be humoured in this way He was a man of the present Character sketches of him were to be all foreground But nevertheless Philip had his trials Want to introduce you to one of our chief movie men Noel Bridges said to him one day in the smoking room of The Lambs He is much interested in the play too mister Raymond Greene shake hands with mister Merton Ware mister Raymond Greene smiling and urbane turned around with outstretched hand which Philip courteous and with all that charm of manner which was making him speedily one of the most popular young men in New York grasped cordially I am very happy to meet you mister Greene he said You represent an amazing development I am told that we shall all have to work for you presently or find our occupation gone With a cool calculation which had come to Philip in these days of his greater strength he had purposely extended his sentence conscious although apparently he ignored the fact that all the time mister Raymond Greene was staring in his face with a bewilderment which was not without its humorous side He was too much a man of the world this great picture producer to be at a loss for words to receive an introduction with any degree of clumsiness But surely he almost stammered we have met before Philip shook his head doubtfully I don t think so he said As a matter of fact I am sure we haven t because you are one of the men whom I hoped some day to come across over here I couldn t possibly have forgotten a meeting with you mister Raymond Greene s blue eyes looked as though they saw visions But surely he expostulated the Elletania my table on the Elletania when Miss Dalstan crossed Philip laughed easily Why he exclaimed are you going to be like the others and take me for wasn t it mister Romilly the man who disappeared from the Waldorf Why I ve been tracked all round New York because of my likeness to that man Likeness mister Raymond Greene muttered Likeness There was a moment s silence Then mister Greene knew that the time had arrived for him to pull himself together He had carried his bewilderment to the very limits of good breeding Well well he continued Fortunately it s six o clock and I can offer you gentlemen a cocktail for upon my word I need it Come to look at you mister Ware there s a trifle more what I might term savoir faire about you That chap on the boat was a little crude in places but believe me sir he went on thrusting his arm through Ware s and leading him towards the bar you don t want to be annoyed at those people who have mistaken you for Romilly for in the whole course of my life and I ve travelled round the world a pretty good deal I never came across a likeness so entirely extraordinary I have heard other people mention it Noel Bridges intervened although not quite with the same conviction as you mister Greene Curiously enough however the photograph of Romilly which they sent out from England and which was in all the Sunday papers didn t strike me as being particularly like mister Ware It was a damned bad photograph that mister Raymond Greene pronounced I saw it couldn t make head nor tail of it myself Well the world is full of queer surprises but this is the queerest I ever ran up against Believe me mister Ware if this man Romilly who disappeared had been a millionaire you could have walked into his family circle and been made welcome at the present moment Why I don t believe his own wife or sister if he had such appendages would have been able to tell that you weren t the man Unfortunately Bridges remarked as he sipped the cocktail which the cinema man had ordered this chap Romilly was broke wasn t he did a scoot to avoid the smash up They say that he had a few hundred thousand dollars over here ostensibly for buying material and that he has taken the lot out West Well I must say he didn t seem that sort on the steamer mister Raymond Greene declared but you never can tell Looked to me more like a schoolteacher Some day mister Ware I want you to come along to my office it s just round the corner in Broadway there and have a chat about the play You don t want to film us before we ve finished its first run surely Philip protested laughing Give us a chance Well we ll talk about that the cinema magnate promised They were joined by other acquaintances and Philip presently made his escape One of the moments which he had dreaded more than any other had come and passed Even if mister Raymond Greene had still some slight misgivings he was to all effects and purposes convinced Philip walked down the street feeling that one more obstacle in the path of his absolute freedom had been torn away He glanced at his watch and boarded a down town car descended in the heart of the city region of Broadway and threaded his way through several streets until he came to the back entrance of a dry goods store Here he glanced once more at his watch and commenced slowly to walk up and down The timekeeper who was standing in the doorway with his hands in his pockets watched him with interest When Philip approached for the third time he addressed him in friendly fashion Waiting for one of our gals eh Philip stifled his quick annoyance and answered in as matter of fact a tone as possible Yes How long will it be before they are out from the typewriting department Typewriting department the man repeated Well that depends some upon the work They ll be out most likely in ten minutes or so I guessed you were after one of our showroom young ladies We get some real swells down here sometimes motor cars of their own The typists ain t much as a rule It s a skinny job theirs The young ladies from here appear to be prosperous Ware remarked I watched them last night coming out My friend happened to be late and I had to leave without seeing her That s nothing to go by their clothes ain t the man replied They spend all their money on their backs instead of putting it inside If it s Miss Grimes you re waiting for you re in luck for here she is first out Philip drew a little into the background The girl came down the stone passage passed the timekeeper without appearing to notice his familiar Good evening and stepped out into the murky street Philip who saw her face as she emerged from the gloom gave a little start She seemed paler than ever and she walked with her eyes fixed upon vacancy as though almost unconscious of her whereabouts She crossed the sidewalk without noticing the curbstone and stumbled at the unexpected depth of it Philip stepped hastily forward Miss Grimes he exclaimed Martha Why do you look at me as though I were a ghost She started violently It was certain that she saw him then for the first time You mister Ware Sorry I didn t see you He insisted upon shaking hands There was a little streak of colour in her cheeks now I came to meet you he explained I came yesterday and missed you I have been to your rooms four times and only found out with difficulty where you were working The last time I called I rang the bell six times but the door was locked I was in bed she said shortly I can t have gentlemen callers there at all now Father s gone off on tour Thank you for coming to meet me but I don t think you d better stop Why not he asked gently Because I don t want to be seen about with you she declared because I don t want you to look at me because I want you to leave me alone she added with a little passionate choke in her voice He turned and walked by her side Martha he said you were very kind to me when I needed it you were a companion to me when I was more miserable than I ever thought any human being could be I was in a quandary then in a very difficult position I took a plunge In a way I have been successful Oh we all know that she replied bitterly Pictures everywhere notices in the paper all the time you and your fine play I ve seen it Didn t think much of it myself but I suppose I m not a judge Tell me why you came out there looking as though you d seen a ghost he asked Discharged she answered promptly Why Fainted yesterday she went on and was a bit wobbly to day The head clerk said he wanted some one stronger Brute Philip muttered Well that s all right Martha I have some work for you Don t want to do your work Little fool he exclaimed Martha do you know you re the most obstinate pig headed prejudiced ill tempered little beast I ever knew Then go along and leave me she insisted stopping short if I m all that You re also a dear She drew a little breath and looked at him fiercely Now don t be silly he begged I m starving I had no lunch so that I could dine early Here we are at Durrad s I m not going inside there with you she declared Look here he expostulated are we going to do a wrestling act on the sidewalk It will be in all the papers you know Spoil your clothes some wouldn t it she remarked looking at them disparagingly It would indeed also my temper he assured her We are going to have a cocktail you and I within two minutes young lady and a steak afterwards If you want to go in there with my hand on your neck you can but I think it would look better She set her feet squarely upon the ground and faced him mister Ware she said I am in rags any one can see that Listen I will not go into a restaurant and sit by your side to have people wonder what woman from the streets you have brought in to give a meal to out of charity Do you hear that I can live or I can die just by myself If I can t keep myself I ll die but I won t Nothing doing You hear She had been so strong and then something in his eyes that pitying half anxious expression with which he listened suddenly seemed to sap her determination She swayed a little upon her feet she was indeed very tired and very weak Philip took instant advantage of her condition Without a moment s hesitation he passed his arm firmly through hers and before she could protest she was inside the place being led to a table seated there with her back to the wall with a confused tangle of words still in her throat unuttered Then two great tears found their way into her eyes She said nothing because she could not Philip was busy talking to the waiter Soon there was a cocktail by her side and he was drinking smiling at her perfectly good natured obviously accepting her momentary weakness and his triumph as a joke Got you in didn t I he observed pleasantly Now remember you told me the way to drink American cocktails one look one swallow and down they go She obeyed him instinctively Then she took out a miserable little piece of a handkerchief and wiped her eyes What s gone wrong he asked briskly Tell me all about it Father went off on tour she explained He left the rent owing for a month and he s been writing for money all the time The agent who comes round doesn t listen to excuses You pay or out you go into the street I ve paid somehow and nearly starved over it Then I got this job after worrying about it Lord knows how long and this evening I m discharged How much a week was it he enquired with sympathy Ten dollars she replied Little enough but I can t live without it He changed his attitude suddenly realising the volcanic sensitiveness of her attitude towards him and life in general Instinctively he felt that at a single ill considered word she would even then in her moment of weakness have left him have pushed him on one side and walked out to whatever she might have to face What a fool you are he exclaimed a little brusquely Am I she replied belligerently Of course you are You call yourself a daughter of New York a city whose motto seems to be pretty well every one for himself You know you did my typing all right you know my play was a success you know that I shall have to write another What made you take it for granted that I shouldn t want to employ you and go and hide yourself Lock the door when I came to see you because it was past eight o clock and not answer my letters Can t have men callers now dad s away she told him a little brusquely It s not allowed Oh rubbish he answered irritably That isn t the point You ve kept away from me You ve deliberately avoided me You knew that I was just as lonely as you were Then she blazed out The sallowness of her cheeks the little dip under her cheekbones she had grown thinner during the last week or so made her eyes seem larger and more brilliant than ever You lonely Rubbish Why they re all running after you everywhere Quite a social success according to the papers I say ain t you afraid Horribly he admitted and about the one person I could have talked to about it chucks me I don t know anything about you or what you ve done she said I only know that the tecs He laid his hand upon her fingers She snatched them away but accepted his warning They were served then with their meal and their conversation drifted into other channels Well he continued presently in a perfectly matter of fact tone I ve found you now and you ve got to be sensible It s true I ve had a stroke of luck but that might fall away at any moment I ve typing waiting for you or I can get you a post at the New York Theatre You d better first do my typing I ll have it in your rooms to morrow morning by nine o clock And would you like something in advance No she replied grudgingly I ll have what I ve earned when I ve earned it He sipped his claret and studied her meditatively You re not much of a pal are you She scoffed at him looked him up and down at his well fitting clothes his general air of prosperity Pal she jeered Look at you Merton Ware the great dramatist and me a shabby ugly bad tempered indifferent typewriter Bad tempered she repeated Yes I am that I didn t start out to be I just haven t had any luck It will all come some day he assured her cheerfully I think if you d stayed different she went on thoughtfully if you hadn t slipped away into the clouds shows what a selfish little beast I am Can t imagine why you bother about me Shall I tell you why really he asked Because you saved me I don t know what from The night we went out I was suffering from a loneliness which was the worst torture I have ever felt It was there in my throat and dragging down my heart and I just felt as though any way of ending it all would be a joy All these millions of hard faced people intent on their own prosperity or their own petty troubles goaded me I think into a sort of silent fury Just that one night I craved like a madman for a single human being to talk to well I shall never forget it Martha Miss Grimes she interrupted under her breath He laughed That doesn t really matter does it he asked You ve never been afraid that I should want to make love to you have you She glanced round into the mirror by their side looked at her wan face the shabby little hat the none too tidily arranged hair which drooped over her ears down at her shapeless jacket her patched skirt the shoes which were in open rebellion Then she laughed curiously enough without any note of bitterness Seems queer doesn t it even to think of such a thing I ve been up against it pretty hard though A man who gives a meal to a girl even if she is as plain as I am generally seems to think he s bought her in this city Even the men who are earning money don t give much for nothing But you are different she admitted I ll be fair about it you re different You ll be waiting for the work at nine o clock to morrow morning he asked as indifferently as possible I will she promised He leaned back and told her little anecdotes about the play things that had happened to him during the last few weeks speaking often of Elizabeth Dalstan By degrees the nervous unrest seemed to pass away from her When they had finished their meal and drunk their coffee she was almost normal She smoked a cigarette and even accepted the box which he thrust into her hand When he had paid the bill she rose a little abruptly Well she said you ve had your way and a kind nice way it was Now I ll have mine I don t want any politeness When we leave this place I am going to walk home and I am going to walk home alone That s lucky he replied because I have to be at the theatre in ten minutes to meet a cinema man Button up your coat and have a good night s sleep They left the place together She turned away with a farewell nod and walked rapidly eastwards He watched her cross the road A poor little waif she seemed except that something had gone from her face which had almost terrified him She carried herself he fancied with more buoyancy with infinitely more confidence and he drew a sigh of relief as he called for a taxi CHAPTER IV Elizabeth paused for breath at the top of the third flight of stairs She leaned against the iron balustrade You poor dear she exclaimed How many times a day did you have to do this I didn t go out very often he reminded her and it wasn t every day that the lift was out of order It s only one more flight She looked up the stairs sighed and raised her smart grey tailor made skirt a little higher over her shoes Well she announced heroically lead on If they would sometimes dust these steps but after all it doesn t matter to you now does it Fancy that poor girl though He smiled a little grimly A few flights of stairs aren t the worst things she has had to face I m afraid he said I am rather terrified of her Elizabeth confided supporting herself by her companion s shoulder I think I know that ultra independent type Kick me if I put my foot in it Is this the door Philip nodded and knocked softly There was a sharp Come in Put the key down please the figure at the typewriter said as they entered The words had scarcely left Martha s lips before she turned around conscious of some other influence in the room Philip stepped forward Miss Grimes he said I have brought Miss Dalstan in to see you She wants He paused Something in the stony expression of the girl who had risen to her feet and stood now facing them her ashen paleness unrelieved by any note of colour her hands hanging in front of her patched and shabby frock seemed to check the words upon his lips Her voice was low but not soft It seemed to create at once an atmosphere of anger and resentment What do you want she demanded I hope you don t mind I am so anxious that you should do some work for me Elizabeth explained When mister Ware first brought me in his play I noticed how nicely it was typewritten You must have been glad to find it turn out such a success I take no interest in my work when once it is typed Martha Grimes declared and I am very sorry but I do not like to receive visitors I am very busy mister Ware knows quite well that I like to be left alone Elizabeth smiled at her delightfully But it isn t always good for us is it she reminded her to live exactly as we would like or to have our own way in all things There was a moment s rather queer silence Martha Grimes seemed to be intent upon studying the appearance of her visitor the very beautiful woman familiar to nearly every one in New York perhaps at that moment America s most popular actress Her eyes seemed to dwell upon the little strands of fair hair that escaped from beneath her smart but simple hat to take in the slightly deprecating lift of the eyebrows the very attractive half appealing smile the smart grey tailor made gown with the bunch of violets in her waistband Elizabeth was as quietly dressed as it was possible for her to be but her appearance nevertheless brought a note of some other world into the shabby little apartment It s the only thing I ask of life Martha said the only thing I get I want to be left alone and I will be left alone If there is any more work I will do it If there isn t I can find some somewhere else But visitors I don t want and won t have Elizabeth was adorably patient She surreptitiously drew towards her a cane chair a doubtful looking article of furniture upon which she seated herself slowly and with great care Well she continued with unabated pleasantness that is reasonable as far as it goes only we didn t quite understand and it is such a climb up here isn t it I came to talk about some work but I must get my breath first Miss Dalstan thought perhaps Philip intervened diffidently that you might consider accepting a post at the theatre They always keep two stenographers there and one of them fills up her time by private work generally work for some one connected with the theatre In your case you could of course go on with mine only when I hadn t enough for you and of course I can t compose as fast as you can type there would be something else and the salary would be regular I should like a regular post the girl admitted sullenly So would any one who s out of work of course The salary Elizabeth explained is twenty five dollars a week The hours are nine to six You have quite a comfortable room there but when you have private work connected with the theatre you can bring it home if you wish mister Ware tells me that you work very quickly You will finish all that you have for him to day won t you I shall have it finished in half an hour Then will you be at the New York Theatre to morrow morning at nine o clock Elizabeth suggested There are some parts to be copied It will be very nice indeed if you like the work and I think you will The girl stood there irresolute It was obvious that she was trying to bring herself to utter some form of thanks Then there was a loud knock at the door which was opened without waiting for any reply The janitor stood there with a small key in his hand which he threw down upon a table Key of number two hundred miss he said Let me have it back again to night He closed the door and departed Two hundred Philip exclaimed Why that s my old room the one up above I must see it Elizabeth insisted Do please let us go up there I meant to ask you to show it me You are not thinking of moving are you Miss Grimes Philip enquired She snatched at the key but he had just possessed himself of it and was swinging it from his forefinger I don t know she snapped I was going up there anyway You can t have the key to day Why not Philip asked in surprise Never mind There are some things of mine up there I She broke off They both looked at her perplexed Philip shook his head good naturedly Miss Grimes he said you forget that the rooms are mine till next quarter day I promise you we will respect any of your belongings we may find there Come along Elizabeth We ll see you as we come down the latter promised nodding pleasantly I don t know as you will the girl retorted fiercely I may not be here They climbed the last two flights of stairs together What an extraordinary young woman Elizabeth exclaimed Is there any reason for her being quite so rude to me None that I can conceive he answered She is always like that And yet you took an interest in her Why not She is human soured by misfortune if you like with an immense stock of bravery and honesty underneath it all She has had a drunken father practically upon her hands and life s been pretty sordid for her Here we are He fitted the key into the lock and swung the door open The clear afternoon light shone in upon the little shabby room and its worn furniture There were one or two insignificant belongings of Philip s still lying about the place and on the writing table exactly opposite the spot where he used to sit a little blue vase in which was a bunch of violets Somehow or other it was the one arresting object in the room They both of them looked at it in equal amazement Is any one living here Elizabeth enquired Not to my knowledge he replied No one could take it on without my signing a release They moved over to the desk Elizabeth stooped down and smelt the violets lifted them up and looked at the cut stalks Is this where you used to sit and write she asked He nodded But I never had any flowers here he observed gazing at them in a puzzled manner Elizabeth looked at the vase and set it down Then she turned towards her companion and shook her head Oh my dear Philip she sighed you really don t know what makes that girl so uncouth You mean Martha Of course I don t You think that she Rubbish He stopped short in sudden confusion Elizabeth passed her arm through his She replaced the vase very carefully looked once more around the room and led him to the door Never mind she said It isn t anything serious of course but it s wonderful Philip what memories a really lonely woman will live on what she will do to keep that little natural vein of sentiment alive in her and how fiercely she will fight to conceal it You can go on down and wait for me in the hall I am going in to say good by to Miss Martha Grimes I think that this time I shall get on better with her CHAPTER V Philip waited nearly a quarter of an hour for Elizabeth When at last she returned she was unusually silent They drove off together in her automobile She held his fingers under the rug Philip dear she said I think it is time that you and I were married He turned and looked at her in amazement There was a smile upon her lips but rather a plaintive one He had a fancy somehow that there had been tears in her eyes lately Elizabeth If we are ever going to be she went on softly why shouldn t we be married quietly as people are sometimes and then tell every one afterwards He held the joy away from him struggling hard for composure But a little time ago he reminded her you wanted to wait Yes she confessed I too had my my what shall I call it fear my ghost in the background Ah but not like mine he faltered his voice unsteady with a surging flood of passion Elizabeth if you really mean it if you are going to take the risk of finding yourself the wife of the villain in a cause celebre why why you know very well that even the thought of it can draw me up into heaven But dear my sweetheart remember We ve played a bold game or rather I have with your encouragement but we re not safe yet Do you know anything that I don t she asked feverishly Well I suppose I do he admitted It isn t necessarily serious he went on quickly as he saw the colour fade from her cheeks but on the very night that our play was produced whilst I was waiting about for you all at the restaurant a man came to see me He is one of the keenest detectives in New York Edward Dane his name is He knew perfectly well that I was the man who had disappeared from the Waldorf He told me so to my face Then why didn t he why didn t he do something Because he was clever enough to suspect that there was something else behind it all Philip said grimly You see he d discovered that I hadn t used any of the money He couldn t fit in any of my doings with the reports they d had about Douglas Somehow or other I can t tell how another suspicion seems to have crept into the man s brain All the time he talked to me I could see him trying to read in my face whether there wasn t something else He d stumbled across a puzzle of which the pieces didn t fit He has gone to England gone to Detton Magna gone to see whether there are any missing pieces to be found He may be back any day now But what could he discover she faltered God knows Philip groaned There s the whole ghastly truth there if fortune helped him and he were clever enough if by any devilish chance the threads came into his hand I don t think I don t think there was ever any fear from the other side I had all the luck But Elizabeth sometimes I am terrified of this man Dane I didn t mean to tell you this but it s too late now Do you know that I am watched day by day I pretend not to notice it I am even able now and then to shut it out from my own thoughts but wherever I go there s some one shadowing me some one walking in my footsteps I m perfectly certain that if you were to go to police headquarters here you could find out where I have spent almost every hour since I took that room in Monmouth House She gripped his fingers fiercely Philip Philip He leaned forward gazing with peculiar almost passionate intentness into the faces of the people as they swept along Broadway Look at them Elizabeth he muttered Look at that mob of men and women sweeping along the pavements there every kind and shape of man every nationality every age They are like the little flecks on the top of a wave I watched them when I first came and I felt almost reckless You d think a man could plunge in there and be lost wouldn t you He can t I tried it Is there anywhere else in the world I wonder Is there anywhere in the living world where one can throw off everything of the past where one can take up a new life and memory doesn t come She shook her head She was more composed now The moment of feverish excitement had passed Her shrewd and level common sense had begun to reassert itself There isn t any such place Philip she told him and if there were it wouldn t be worth while your trying to find it We are both a little hysterical this evening We ve lost our sense of proportion You ve played for your stake You mustn t quail if the worst should come you must brave it out I believe even then you would be safe But it won t come it shan t He gripped her hands They were slowing up now caught in a maze of heavy traffic a few blocks from the theatre His voice was firm He had regained his self control What an idiot I have been he exclaimed scornfully Never mind that s past There is just one more serious word though dear She responded immediately to the change in his manner and smiled into his face Well My only real problem he went on earnestly is this Dare I hold you to your word Elizabeth Dare I for instance say yes to the wonderful suggestion of yours make you my wife and risk having people look at you in years to come point at you with pity and say that you married a murderer who died a shameful death Fancy how the tragedy of that would lie across your life you who are so wonderful and so courted and so clever Isn t that my affair Philip she asked calmly No he answered it s mine She turned and laughed at him For a moment she was her old self again You refuse me His eyes glowed We ll wait he said hoarsely till Dane comes back from England The car had stopped outside the theatre Hat in hand and with his face wreathed in smiles the commissionaire had thrown open the door The people on the pavement were nudging one another a famous woman was about to descend She turned back to Philip Come in with me she begged Somehow I feel cold and lonely to night It hasn t anything to do with what we were talking about but I feel as though something were going to happen that something were coming out of the shadows something that threatens either you or me I m silly but come She clung to him as they crossed the pavement For once she forgot to smile at the little curious crowd She was absorbed in herself and her feelings Life is so hard sometimes she exclaimed as they lingered for a moment near the box office There s that poor girl Philip friendless and lonely What she must suffer God help her God help us all I am sick with loneliness myself Philip Don t leave me alone Come with me to my room I only want to see if there are any letters We ll go somewhere near and dine first before I change Philip what is the matter with me I don t want to go a step alone I don t want to be alone for a moment He laughed reassuringly and drew her closer to him She led the way down the passage towards her own suite of apartments They passed one or two of the officials of the theatre whom she greeted with something less than her usual charm of manner As they reached the manager s office there was the sound of loud voices and the door was thrown open mister Fink appeared and with him a somewhat remarkable figure a tall immensely broad ill dressed man with a strong rugged face and a mass of grey hair a huge man who seemed somehow or other to proclaim himself of a bigger and stronger type than those others amongst whom he moved He had black eyes and the heavy jaw of an Irishman His face was curiously unwrinkled He stood there blocking the way his great hands suddenly thrust forward Betty by the Lord that loves us he exclaimed Here s luck I was on my way out to search for you Got here on the Chicago Limited at four o clock Give me your hands and say that you are glad to see me If Elizabeth were glad she showed no sign of it She seemed to have become rooted to the spot suddenly dumb Philip by her side heard the quick indrawing of her breath Sylvanus she murmured You Why I thought you were in China There s no place on God s earth can hold me for long was the boisterous reply I did my business there in three days and caught a Japanese boat back Such a voyage and such food But New York will make up for that You ve got a great play they tell me I must hear all about it Shake my hands first though girl as though you were glad to see me You seem to have shrunken since I saw you last to have grown smaller Didn t London agree with you The moment of shock had passed Elizabeth had recovered herself She gave the newcomer her hands quite frankly She even seemed in a measure glad to see him These unannounced comings and goings of yours from the ends of the earth are so upsetting to your friends she declared And this gentleman Who is he Elizabeth laughed softly I needn t tell you mister Ware she said turning to Philip that this dear man here is an eccentric I dare say you ve heard of him It is mister Sylvanus Power and Sylvanus this is mister Merton Ware the author of our play The House of Shams Philip felt his hand held in a grasp which firm though it was seemed to owe its vigour rather to the long powerful fingers than to any real cordiality mister Sylvanus Power was studying him from behind his bushy eyebrows So you re Merton Ware he observed I haven t seen your play yet hope to to night An Englishman eh Yes I am English Philip assented coolly You come from the West don t you There was a moment s silence Elizabeth laughed softly Oh there s no mistake about mister Power she declared He brings the breezy West with him to Wall Street or Broadway Paris or London You can t shake it off or blow it away And I don t know as I am particularly anxious to either mister Power pronounced Are you going to your rooms here Betty If so I ll come along I guess mister Ware will excuse you Philip was instantly conscious of the antagonism in the other s manner As yet however he felt little more than amusement He glanced towards Elizabeth and the look in her face startled him The colour had once more left her cheeks and her eyes were full of appeal If you wouldn t mind she begged mister Power is a very old friend and we haven t met for so long You needn t expect to see anything more of Miss Dalstan to night either of you the newcomer declared drawing her hand through his arm except on the stage that is I am going to take her out and give her a little dinner directly Au revoir Fink I ll see you to night here Good day to you mister Ware Philip stood for a moment motionless The voice of mister Sylvanus Power was no small thing and he was conscious that several of the officials of the place and the man in the box office had heard every word that had passed He felt somehow curiously ignored He watched the huge figure of the Westerner with Elizabeth by his side disappear down the corridor mister Fink who had also been looking after them turned towards him Say that s some man Sylvanus Power he exclaimed admiringly He is one of our multimillionaires mister Ware What do you think of him So far as one can judge from a few seconds conversation Philip remarked he seems to possess all the qualities essential to the production of a multimillionaire in this country mister Fink grinned Sounds a trifle sarcastic but I guess he s a new type to you he observed tolerantly Absolutely Philip acknowledged as he turned and made his way slowly out of the theatre CHAPTER VI Philip s disposition had been so curiously affected by the emotions of the last few months that he was not in the least surprised to find himself that evening torn by a very curious and unfamiliar spasm of jealousy After an hour or so of indecision he made his way as usual to the theatre but instead of going at once to Elizabeth s room he slipped in at the back of the stalls The house was crowded and seated in the stage box alone and gloomy his somewhat austere demeanour intensified by the severity of his evening clothes sat Sylvanus Power with the air of a conqueror Philip unaccountably restless left his seat in a very few minutes and making his way to the box office scribbled a line to Elizabeth The official to whom he handed it looked at him in surprise Won t you go round yourself mister Ware he suggested Miss Dalstan has another ten minutes before she is on Philip shook his head I m looking for a man I know he replied evasively I ll be somewhere about here in five minutes The answer came in less than that time It was just a scrawled line in pencil Forgive me dear I will explain everything in the morning if you will come to my rooms at eleven o clock This evening I have a hateful duty to perform and I cannot see you Philip impatient of the atmosphere of the theatre wandered out into the streets with the note in his pocket Broadway was thronged with people a heterogeneous slowly moving throng the hardest crowd to apprehend to understand of any in the world He looked absently into the varying stream of faces stared at the whirling sky signs the lights flashing from the tall buildings heard snatches of the music from the open doors of the cafes and restaurants Men and even women elbowed him unresenting out of the way without the semblance of an apology It seemed to him that his presence there part of the drifting pandemonium of the pavement was in a sense typical of his own existence in New York He had given so much of his life into another s hands and now the anchor was dragging He was suddenly confronted with the possibility of a rift in his relations with Elizabeth with a sudden surging doubt not of Elizabeth herself but simply a feeling of insecurity with regard to their future He only realised in those moments how much he had leaned upon her how completely she seemed to have extended over him and his troubled life some sort of sheltering influence to which he had succumbed with an effortless an almost fatalistic impulse finding there at any rate a refuge from the horrors of his empty days It was all abstract and impersonal at first this jealousy which had come so suddenly to disturb the serenity of an almost too perfect day but as the hours passed it seemed to him that his thoughts dwelt more often upon the direct cause of his brief separation from Elizabeth He turned in at one of the clubs of which he had been made a member and threw himself gloomily into an easy chair His thoughts had turned towards the grim masterful personality of the man who seemed to have obtruded himself upon their lives What did it mean when Elizabeth told him she was engaged for to night She was supping with him somewhere probably at that moment seated opposite to him at a small rose shaded table in one of the many restaurants of the city which they had visited together He Sylvanus Power his supplanter was occupying the place that belonged to him ordering her supper humouring her little preferences perhaps sharing with her that little glow of relief which comes with the hour of rest after the strain of the day s work The suggestion was intolerable To morrow he would have an explanation Elizabeth belonged to him The sooner the world knew it the better and this man first of all He read her few lines again hastily pencilled and evidently written standing up There was a certain ignominy in being sent about his business just because this colossus from the West had appeared and claimed what Not his right he could have no right What then Philip ordered a drink tore open an evening paper and tried to read The letters danced before his eyes the whisky and soda stood neglected at his elbow Afterwards he found himself looking into space There was something cynical challenging almost in the manner in which that man had taken Elizabeth away from him had acknowledged his introduction even had treated the author of a play a writer as some sort of a mountebank making his living by catering for the amusements of the world How did that man regard such gifts as his he wondered Sylvanus Power of whom he had seen it written that he was one of the conquerors of nature a hard but splendid utilitarian the builder of railways in China and bridges for the transit of his metals amid the clouds of the mountain tops In the man s absence his harshness almost uncouthness seemed modified He was a rival without a doubt and to night a favoured one How well had he known Elizabeth For how long Was it true that rumour he had once heard that the first step in her fortunes had been due to the caprice of a millionaire He found the room stifling but the thought of the streets outside unnerved him He looked about for some distraction The room was beginning to fill actors musicians a few journalists a great many men of note in the world of Bohemia kept streaming in One or two of them nodded to him several paused to speak Hullo Ware Noel Bridges exclaimed Not often you give us a look in What are you doing with yourself here all alone Philip turned to answer him and suddenly felt the fire blaze up again He saw his questioner s frown saw him even bite his lip as though conscious of having said a tactless thing The actor probably understood the whole situation well enough I generally go into the Lotus Philip lied To night I had a fancy to come here The Lotus is too far up town for us fellows Bridges remarked We need a drink a little supper and to see our pals quickly when the night s work is over I hear great things of the new play mister Ware but I don t know when you ll get a chance to produce it Were you in the house tonight Only for a moment Going stronger than ever Bridges continued impressively Yes thanks I ll take a Scotch highball he added in response to Philip s mute invitation plenty of ice Mick There wasn t a seat to be had in the house and I wouldn t like to say what old Fink had to go through before he could get his box for the great Sylvanus His box Philip queried The theatre belongs to Sylvanus Power you know Bridges explained He built it five years ago For a speculation The actor fidgeted for a moment with his tumbler No for Miss Dalstan he replied Philip set his teeth hard The temptation to pursue the conversation was almost overpowering The young man himself though a trifle embarrassed seemed perfectly willing to talk At least it was better to know the truth Then another impulse suddenly asserted itself Whatever he was to know he must learn from her lips and from hers only Well I should think it s turned out all right he remarked Noel Bridges shrugged his shoulders The rent if it were figured out at a fair interest on the capital would be something fabulous he declared You see the place was extravagantly built without any regard to cost The dressing rooms as you may have noticed are wonderful and all the appointments are unique I don t fancy the old man s ever had a quarter s rent yet that s paid him one per cent on the money See you later perhaps mister Ware the young man concluded setting down his tumbler I m going in to have a grill Why don t you come along Philip hesitated for a second and then somewhat to the other s surprise assented He was conscious that he had been perhaps just a little unresponsive to the many courtesies which had been offered him here and at the other kindred clubs They had been ready to receive him with open arms this little fraternity of brain workers and his response had been perhaps a little doubtful not from any lack of appreciation but partly from that curious diffidence so hard to understand but so fundamentally English and partly because of that queer sense of being an impostor which sometimes swept over him a sense that he was after all only the ghost of another man living a subjective life that reason it out however he might there was something of the fraud in any personality he might adopt And yet deep down in his heart he was conscious of so earnest a desire to be really one of them this good natured good hearted gay spirited little throng with their delightful intimacies their keen interest in each other s welfare their potent almost mysterious geniality which seemed to draw the stranger of kindred tastes so closely under its influence Philip as he sat at the long table with a dozen or so other men did his best that night to break through the fetters tried hard to remember that his place amongst them after all was honest enough They were writers and actors and journalists Well he too was a writer He had written a play which they had welcomed with open arms as they had done him In this world of Bohemia if anywhere he surely had a right to lift up his head and breathe and he would do it He sat with them smoking and talking until the little company began to thin out establishing all the time a new reputation doing a great deal to dissipate that little sense of disappointment which his former non responsiveness had created He s a damned good fellow after all one of them declared as at last he left the room He is losing his Britishness every day he stays here Been through rough times they say another remarked He is one of those an elder member pronounced taking his pipe for a moment from his mouth who was never made for happiness You can always read those men You can see it behind their eyes Nevertheless Philip walked home a saner and a better man He felt somehow warmed by those few hours of companionship The senseless part of his jealousy was gone his trust in Elizabeth reestablished He looked at the note once more as he undressed At eleven o clock on the following morning in her rooms CHAPTER VII Something of his overnight s optimism remained with Philip when at eleven o clock on the following morning he was ushered into Elizabeth s rooms It was a frame of mind however which did not long survive his reception From the moment of his arrival he seemed to detect a different atmosphere in his surroundings the demeanour of Phoebe his staunch ally who admitted him without her usual welcoming smile the unanalysable sense of something wanting in the dainty little room overfilled with strong smelling hothouse flowers in the entrance and welcome of Elizabeth herself His eyes had ached for the sight of her He was so sure that he would know everything the moment she spoke Yet her coming brought only confusion to his senses She was different unexpectedly bewilderingly different She had lost that delicate serenity of manner that almost protective affection which he had grown to lean upon and expect She entered dressed for the street smoking a cigarette which was in itself unusual with dark rings under her eyes which seemed to be looking all around the room on some pretext or other but never at him Am I late she asked a little breathlessly I am so sorry Tell me have you anything particular to do Nothing he answered I want to go out of the city into the country at once she told him feverishly The car is waiting I ordered it for a quarter to eleven Let us start Of course if you wish it he assented He opened the door but before she passed through he leaned towards her She shook her head His heart sank What could there be more ominous than this I am not well she muttered Don t take any notice of anything I say or do for a little time I am like this sometimes temperamental I suppose All great actresses are temperamental I suppose I am a great actress Do you think I am Philip He was following her down stairs now He found it hard however to imitate the flippancy of her tone The critics insist upon it he observed drily Evidently your audience last night shared their opinion She nodded I love them to applaud like that and yet audiences don t really know do they Perhaps She relapsed into silence and they took their places in the car She settled herself down with a little sigh of content and drew the rug over her As far as you can go John she told the man but you must get back at six o clock The country mind not the shore They started off So you were there last night she murmured leaning back amongst the cushions with an air of relief I was there for a few moments I wrote my note to you in the box office She shook the memory away And afterwards I went to one of the clubs down town What did you do there she enquired Gossip Some of the men were very kind to me he said I had supper with Noel Bridges amongst others Well she asked almost defiantly I don t understand She looked intently at him for a moment I forgot she went on You are very chivalrous aren t you You wouldn t ask questions See I am going to close my eyes It is too horrible here and all through Brooklyn When we are in the lanes I can talk This is just one of those days I wish that we were in England All our country is either suburban or too wild and restless Can you be content with silence for a little time Of course he assured her Besides you forget that I am in a strange country Everything is worth watching They passed over Brooklyn Bridge and for an hour or more they made slow progress through the wide flung environs of the city At last however the endless succession of factories and small tenement dwellings lay behind them They passed houses with real gardens through stretches of wood whose leaves were opening whose branches were filled with the sweet smelling sap of springtime Elizabeth seemed to wake almost automatically from a kind of stupor She pushed back her veil and Philip stealing eager glances towards her was almost startled by some indefinable change Her face seemed more delicate almost the face of an invalid and she lay back there with half closed eyes The strength of her mouth seemed to have dissolved and its sweetness had become almost pathetic There were signs of a great weariness about her The fingers which reached out for the little speaking tube seemed to have become thinner Take the turn to the left John she instructed the one to Bay Shore Go slowly by the lake and stop where I tell you They left the main road and travelled for some distance along a lane which with its bramble grown fences and meadows beyond was curiously reminiscent of England They passed a country house built of the wood which was still a little unfamiliar to Philip but wonderfully homelike with its cluster of outbuildings its trim lawns and the turret clock over the stable entrance Then through the leaves of an avenue of elms they caught occasional glimpses of the blue waters of the lake which they presently skirted Elizabeth s eyes travelled over its placid surface idly yet with a sense of passive satisfaction In a few minutes they passed into the heart of a little wood and she leaned forward Stop here close to the side of the road John Stop your engine please and go and sit by the lake The man obeyed at once with the unquestioning readiness of one used to his mistress whims For several minutes she remained silent She had the air of one drinking in with almost passionate eagerness the sedative effect of the stillness the soft spring air the musical country sounds the ripple of the breeze in the trees the humming of insects the soft splash of the lake against the stony shore Philip himself was awakened into a peculiar sense of pleasure by this almost his first glimpse of the country since his arrival in New York A host of half forgotten sensations warmed his heart He felt suddenly intensely sympathetic perhaps more genuinely tender than he had ever felt before towards the woman by his side whose hour of suffering it was His hand slipped under the rug and held her fingers which clutched his in instantaneous response Her lips seemed unlocked by his slight action I came here alone two years ago she told him and since then often sometimes to study a difficult part sometimes only to think One moment She released her fingers from his drew out the hatpins from her hat unwound the veil and threw them both on to the opposite seat Then she laid her hands upon her forehead as though to cool it The little breeze from the lake rippled through her hair bringing them every now and then faint whiffs of perfume from the bordering gardens There she exclaimed with a little murmur of content That s a man s action isn t it Now I think I am getting brave I have something to say to you Philip He felt her fingers seeking his again and held them tightly It was curious how in that moment of crisis his thoughts seemed to wander away He was watching the little flecks of gold in her hair wondering if he had ever properly appreciated the beautiful curve of her neck Even her voice seemed somehow attuned to the melody of their surroundings the confused song of the birds the sighing of the lake the passing of the west wind through the trees and shrubs around Philip she began clinging closely to him I have brought you here to tell you a story which perhaps you will think when you have heard it might better have been told in my dressing room Well I couldn t Besides I wanted to get away It is about Sylvanus Power He sat a little more upright His nerves were tingling now with eagerness Yes I met him she continued eight years ago out West when I was in a travelling show I accepted his attentions at first carelessly enough I did not realise the sort of man he was He was a great personage even in those days and I suppose my head was a little turned Then he began to follow us everywhere There was a scandal of course In the end I left the company and came to New York He went to China where he has always had large interests When I heard that he had sailed I remember reading it in the paper I could have sobbed with joy Philip moved a little uneasily in his place Some instinct told him however how greatly she desired his silence that she wanted to tell her story her own way Then followed three miserable years during which I saw little of him I knew that I had talent I was always sure of making a living but I got no further It didn t seem possible to get any further Nothing that I could do or say seemed able to procure for me an engagement in New York Think of me for a moment now Philip as a woman absolutely and entirely devoted to her work I loved it It absorbed all my thoughts It was just the one thing in life I cared anything about I simply ached to get at New York and I couldn t All the time I had to play on tour and you won t quite understand this dear but there is nothing so wearing in life as for any one with my cravings for recognition there to be always playing on the road She paused for a few minutes There was a loud twittering of birds A rabbit who had stolen carefully through the undergrowth scurried away A car had come through the wood and swept past them bringing with it some vague sense of disturbance It was some little time before she settled down again to her story At the end of those three years she went on Sylvanus Power had become richer stronger more masterful than ever I was beginning to lose heart He was clever He studied my every weakness He knew quite well that with me there was only one way and he laid his schemes with regard to me just in the same fashion as he schemed to be a conqueror of men to build up those millions We were playing near New York and one day he asked me to motor in there and lunch with him I accepted It was in the springtime almost on such a day as this We motored up in one of his wonderful cars We lunched I remember how shabby I felt at the best restaurant in New York where I was waited upon like a queen Somehow or other the man had always the knack of making himself felt wherever he went He strode the very streets of New York like one of its masters and the people seemed to recognise it Afterwards he took me into Broadway and he ordered the car to stop outside the theatre where I am now playing I looked at it and I remember I gave a little cry of interest This is the new theatre that every one is talking about isn t it I asked him eagerly It is he answered Would you like to see inside Of course I was half crazy with curiosity The doors flew open before him and he took me everywhere You know yourself what a magnificent place it is that marvellous stage the auditorium all in dark green satin the seats like armchairs the dressing rooms like boudoirs the wonderful spaciousness of it It took my breath away I had never imagined such splendour When we had finished looking over the whole building I clutched his arm I can t believe that it isn t some sort of fairy palace I exclaimed And to think that no one knows who owns the place or when it is going to be opened I ll tell you all about that he answered I built it I own it and it will be opened just when you accept my offer and play in it It all seemed too amazing For a time I couldn t speak coherently Then I remember thinking that whatever happened whatever price I had to pay I must stand upon the stage of that theatre and win My lips were quite dry His great voice seemed to have faded into a whisper Your offer I repeated Yourself he answered gruffly There was a silence which seemed to Philip interminable All the magic of the place had passed away its music seemed no longer to be singing happiness into his heart Then at last he realised that she was waiting for him to speak He wanted to marry you he faltered He had a wife already Splash John was throwing stones into the lake a pastime of which he was getting a little tired A huge thrush was thinking about commencing to build his nest and in the meantime sat upon a fallen log across the way and sang about it A little tree climbing bird ran round and round the trunk of the nearest elm staring at them every time he appeared with his tiny black eyes A squirrel almost overhead who had long since come to the conclusion that they were harmless decided now that they had the queerest manners of any two young people he had ever watched from his leafy throne and finally abandoned his position Elizabeth had been staring down the road ever since the last words had passed her lips She turned at last and looked at her companion He was once more the refugee the half starved man flying from horrors greater even than he had known She began to tremble Philip she cried Say anything but speak to me Like a flash he seemed to pass from his own almost the hermit s way of looking out upon life from the old fashioned standpoint of his inherent puritanism into a closer sympathy with those others the men and women of the world into which he had so lately entered the men and women who had welcomed him so warm heartedly human beings all of them who lived and loved with glad hearts and much kindliness The contrast was absurd the story itself suddenly so reasonable No other woman on tour would have kept Sylvanus Power waiting for three years Only Elizabeth could have done that It was such a human little problem People didn t live in the clouds He wasn t fit for the clouds himself Nevertheless when he tried to speak his throat was hard and dry and at the second attempt he began instead to laugh She gripped his arm Philip she exclaimed Be reasonable Say what you like but look and behave like a human being Don t make that noise she almost shrieked He stopped at once Forgive me he begged humbly I can t help it I seem to be playing hide and seek with myself You haven t finished the story yet if there is anything more to tell me She drew herself up She spoke absolutely without faltering I accepted Sylvanus Power s terms she went on He placed large sums of money in Fink s hands to run the theatre There was a wonderful opening You were not interested then or you might have heard of it I produced a new play of Clyde Fitch s It was a great triumph The house was packed Sylvanus Power sat in his box It was to be his night Through it all I fought like a woman in a nightmare I didn t know what it meant I knew hundreds of women who had done in a small way what I was prepared to do magnificently In all my acquaintance I think that I scarcely knew one who would have refused to do what I was doing And all the time I was in a state of fierce revolt I had moments when my life s ambitions when New York itself the Mecca of my dreams and that marvellous theatre with its marble and silk seemed suddenly to dwindle to a miserable contemptible little doll s house And then again I played and I felt my soul as I played and the old dreams swept over me and I said that it wasn t anything to do with personal vanity that made me crave for the big gifts of success that it was my art and that I must find myself in my art or die The blood was flowing in his veins again She was coming back to him He was ashamed he with his giant load of sin His voice trembled with tenderness Go on he begged I think that the reason I played that night as though I were inspired was because of the great passionate craving at my heart for forgetfulness to shut out the memory of that man who sat almost gloomily alone in his box waiting And then after it was all over the wonder and the glory of it he appeared suddenly in my dressing room elbowing his way through excited journalists kicking bouquets of flowers from his path We stood for a moment face to face He came nearer I shrank away I was terrified He looked at me in cold surprise Three minutes he exclaimed to say good by I m off to China Stick at it You ve done well for a start but remember a New York audience wants holding Choose your plays carefully Trust Fink You re going away I almost shrieked He glanced at his watch leaned over and kissed me on the forehead I ll barely make that boat he muttered and rushed out Philip was breathless The strange untold passion of the whole thing was coming to him in waves of wonderful suggestion Finish he cried impatiently Finish That is the end she said I played for two years and a half with scarcely a pause Then I came to Europe for a rest and travelled back with you on the Elletania Last night I saw Sylvanus Power again for the first time Don t speak My story is in two halves That is the first The second is just one question That will come before we reach home John she called The man approached promptly he was quite weary of throwing stones Take us somewhere to lunch his mistress directed and get back to New York at six o clock CHAPTER VIII It was not until they were crossing Brooklyn Bridge on their way into the city that she asked him that question They crawled along one of an interminable tangled line of vehicles of all sorts and conditions the trains rattling overhead and endless streams of earnest people passing along the footway Below them the evening sunlight flashed upon the murky waters glittered from the windows of the tall buildings and shone a little mercilessly upon the unlovely purlieus of the great human hive The wind had turned cool and Elizabeth with a little shiver had drawn her furs around her neck All through the day during the luncheon in an unpretentious little inn and the leisurely homeward drive she had been once more entirely herself pleasant and sympathetic ignoring absolutely the intangible barrier which had grown up between them soon to be thrown down for ever or to remain for all time We left our heroine she said at an interesting crisis in her career I am waiting to hear from you what would you have done in her place He answered her at once and he spoke from the lesser heights He was fiercely jealous It is not a reasonable question he declared I am not a woman I am just a man who has led an unusually narrow and cramped life until these last few months That is scarcely fair she objected You profess to have loved to love still I hope That in itself makes a man of any one Then you too have sinned You too are one of those who have yielded to passion of a sort Therefore your judgment ought to be the better worth having He winced as though he had been struck and looked at her with eyes momentarily wild He felt that the deliberate cruelty of her words was of intent an instinct of her brain defying for the moment her heart I don t know he faltered I won t answer your question I can t You see the love you speak of is my love for you You ask me to ignore that I who am clinging on to life by one rope You are like all men she sighed We do not blame you for it perhaps we love you the more but when a great crisis comes you think only of yourselves You disappoint me a little Philip I fancied that you might have thought a little of me something of Sylvanus Power I haven t your sympathy for other people he declared hoarsely No she assented sympathy is the one thing a man lacks It isn t your fault Philip You are to be pitied for it And after all it is a woman s gift isn t it There followed then a silence which seemed interminable It was not until they were nearing the theatre that he suddenly spoke with a passion which startled her Tell me he insisted last night I can t help asking I was in hell He told himself afterwards that there couldn t be any possible way of reconciling cruelty so cold blooded with all that he knew of Elizabeth She behaved as though his question had fallen upon deaf ears The car had stopped before the entrance to the theatre She stepped out even before he could assist her hurried across the pavement and looked back at him for one moment only before she plunged into the dark passage She nodded and there was an utterly meaningless smile upon her lips Good by she said Do you mind telling John he needn t wait for me Then she disappeared He stood motionless upon the pavement a little dazed Two or three people jostled against him A policeman glanced at him curiously A lady with very yellow hair winked in his face Philip pulled himself together and simultaneously felt a touch upon his elbow He glanced into the face of the girl who had accosted him and for a moment he scarcely recognised her Wish you d remember you re in New York and not one of your own sleepy old towns Miss Grimes remarked brusquely You ll have a policeman say you re drunk in a minute if you stand there letting people shove you around He fell into step by her side and they walked slowly along Martha was plainly dressed but she was wearing new clothes new shoes and a new hat Don t stare at me as though you never saw me out of a garret before she went on a little sharply Your friend Miss Dalstan is a lady who understands things When I arrived at the theatre this morning I found that it was to be a permanent job all right and there was a little advance for me waiting in an envelope That fat old mister Fink began to cough and look at my clothes so I got one in first This is for me to make myself look smart enough for your theatre I suppose I said Give me an hour off and I ll do it So he grinned and here I am Done a good day s work too copying the parts of your play for a road company and answering letters What s wrong with you The very sound of her voice was a tonic He almost smiled as he answered her Just a sort of hankering for the moon and a sudden fear lest I mightn t get it You re spoilt that s what s the matter with you she declared brusquely It never occurred to me he said gloomily that life had been over kind Oh cut it out she answered Here you are not only set on your feet but absolutely held up there all the papers full of Merton Ware s brilliant play and Merton Ware the new dramatist with his social gifts such an acquisition to New York Society Why it isn t so very long ago after all that you hadn t a soul in New York to speak to I saw something in your face that night I thought you were hungry So you were only it wasn t for food It cheered you up even to talk with me And look at you to day Clubs and parties and fine friends and there you were half dazed in Broadway Be careful man You don t know what it is to be down and out You haven t been as near it as I have anyway or you d lift your head up and be thankful Martha he began earnestly Miss Grimes she interrupted firmly Don t let there be any mistake about that I hate familiarity Miss Grimes then he went on You talk about my friends Quite right I should think I have been introduced to nearly a thousand people since the night my play was produced I have dined at a score of houses and many scores of restaurants The people are pleasant enough too but all the time it s Merton Ware the dramatist they are patting on the back They don t know anything about Merton Ware the man Perhaps there are some of them would be glad to but you see it s too soon and they seem to live too quickly here to make friends I am almost as lonely as I was so far as regards ordinary companionship Last night I felt the first little glow of real friendliness just the men down at the club You ve put all your eggs into one basket that s what you ve done she declared That s true enough he groaned And like all men selfish brutes she proceeded deliberately you expect everything Fancy expecting everything from a woman like Miss Dalstan Why you aren t worthy of it you know Perhaps not he admitted but you see Miss Grimes there is something in life which seems to have passed you by up till now Has it indeed she objected You think I ve never had a young man eh Perhaps you re right Haven t found much time for that sort of rubbish Anyway this is where I hop on a trolley car Wait a moment he begged Don t leave me yet You ve nothing to do have you Nothing particular she confessed except go home and cook my dinner Look here he went on eagerly I feel like work I ve got the second act of my new play in my mind Come round with me and let me try dictating it I ll give you something to eat in my rooms It s for the theatre mind I never tried dictating I believe I could do it to you In your rooms she repeated a little doubtfully They won t talk scandal about us Miss Grimes he assured her To tell you the truth I want to be near the telephone In case she rings you up eh That s so I said something I ought not to have done I ought to have waited for her but it was something that had been tearing at me ever since last night and I couldn t bear it Some blunderers you men Miss Grimes sighed Well I m with you He led her almost apologetically to the lift of the handsome building in which his new rooms were situated They were very pleasant bachelor rooms with black oak walls and green hangings prints upon the wall a serviceable writing table and a deep green carpet She looked around her and at the servant who had come forward at their entrance with a little sniff Shall you be changing to night sir he asked Not to night Philip answered quickly Tell the waiter to send up a simple dinner for two I can t bother to order And two cocktails he added as an afterthought Martha stared after the disappearing manservant disparagingly Some style she muttered A manservant eh Don t know as I ever saw one before off the stage Don t be silly he remonstrated He has four other flats to look after besides mine It s the way one lives nowadays cheaper than ordinary hotels or rooms Take off your coat She obeyed him depositing it carefully in a safe place Then she strolled around the room finding pictures little to her taste and finally threw herself into an easy chair Are we going to work before we eat she asked No afterwards he told her Have a cigarette She held it between her fingers but declined a match I ll wait for the cocktails she decided Now listen here mister Ware there s a word or two I d like to say to you Go ahead he invited listlessly You men she continued looking him squarely in the face think a lot too much of yourselves You think so much of yourselves that as often as not you ve no time to think of other folk A month or so ago who were you You were hiding in a cheap tenement house scared out of your wits dressed pretty near as shabbily as I was with a detective on your track and with no idea of what you were going to do for a living And now look at you Who s done it all Of course my play being successful he began She broke in at once You and your play Who took your play Who produced it at the New York Theatre and acted in it so that people couldn t listen without a sob in their throats and a tingling all over Yours isn t the only play in the world I bet Miss Dalstan has a box full of them She probably chose yours because she knew that you were feeling pretty miserable because she d got sorry for you coming over on the steamer because she has a great big heart and is always trying to do something for others She s made a man of you Oh I know a bit about plays I know that with the royalties you re drawing you can well afford rooms like these and anything else you want But that isn t all she s done She s introduced you to her friends she s taken more notice of you than any man around She takes you out automobile driving she lets you spend all your spare time in her rooms She don t mind what people say You dine with her and take her home after the play You have more of her than any other person alive Say what I want to ask is do you think you re properly grateful I couldn t ever repay Miss Dalstan he acknowledged a little sadly but Look here no buts she interrupted You think I don t know anything Perhaps I don t and perhaps I do I was standing in the door of the office when you two came in from your automobile drive this afternoon I saw her come away without wishing you good by then I saw her turn and nod looking just as usual and I saw her face afterwards If I had had you my man as close to me then as you are now I d have boxed your ears He moved uneasily in his chair There was no doubt about the girl s earnestness She was leaning a little forward and her brown eyes were filled with a hard accusing light There was a little spot of colour even in her sallow cheeks She was unmistakably angry I d like to know who you are and what you think yourself to make a woman look like that she wound up The waiter entered with the cocktails and began to lay the cloth for dinner Philip paced the room uneasily until he had gone Look here my little friend he said when at last the door was closed there s a great deal of sound common sense in what you say I may be an egoist I dare say I am I ve been through the proper training for it and I ve started life again on a pretty one sided basis perhaps But have you ever been jealous Me jealous she repeated scornfully What of I wonder There was a suspicious glitter in her eyes a queer little tremble in her tone His question however was merely perfunctory She represented little more to him at that moment than the incarnation of his own conscience Very likely you haven t he went on You are too independent ever to care much for any one Well I ve been half mad with jealousy since last night That is the truth of it There s another man wants her the man who built the theatre for her She told me about him yesterday while we were out together Don t you want her to be happy the girl asked bluntly Of course I do Then leave her alone to choose Don t go about looking as though you had a knife in your heart if you find her turn for a moment to some one else You don t want her to choose you do you just because you are a weakling because her great kind heart can t bear the thought of making you miserable Stand on your feet like a man and take your luck Can I take off my hat I can t eat in this The waiter had entered with the dinner Merton opened the door of his room and paced up and down for a few moments thoughtfully When she reappeared she took the seat opposite Philip and suddenly smiled at him an exceedingly rare but most becoming performance Her mouth seemed at once to soften and even her eyes laughed at him Here you ask me to dine she said because you are lonely and I do nothing but scold you Never mind I was typewriting something of yours this morning I ve forgotten the words but it was something about the discipline of affection You can take my scolding that way If I didn t adore Miss Dalstan and if you hadn t been kind to me I should never take the trouble to make myself disagreeable He smiled back at her readily falling in with her altered mood She seemed to have talked the ill humour out of her blood and during the service of the meal she told him of the comfort of her work the charm of the other girl in the room with whom she was already discussing a plan to share an apartment When she came to speak however remotely of Miss Dalstan her voice seemed instinctively to soften Philip found himself wondering what had passed between the two women in those few moments when Elizabeth had left him and gone back to Martha s room By some strange miracle the strong sweet understanding woman had simply taken possession of the friendless child The thought of her sat now in Martha s heart an obsession almost a worship Perhaps that was why the sense of companionship between the two notwithstanding certain obvious disparities seemed to grow stronger every moment They drank their coffee and smoked cigarettes afterwards in lazy fashion Suddenly Martha sprang up Say I came here to work she exclaimed And I brought you under false pretences he confessed My brain s not working I can t dictate We ll try another evening You don t mind Of course not she answered glancing at the clock I ll be going Wait a little time longer he begged She resumed her seat There was only one heavily shaded lamp burning on the table and through the little cloud of tobacco smoke she watched him His eyes were sometimes upon the timepiece sometimes on the telephone He seemed always although his attitude was one of repose to be listening waiting It was half past nine the middle of the second act They knew quite well that for a quarter of an hour Elizabeth would be in her dressing room She could ring up if she wished The seconds ticked monotonously away Martha found herself too sharing that curiously intense desire to hear the ring of the telephone Nothing happened A quarter to ten came and passed She rose to her feet I am going home right now she announced He reached for his hat I ll come with you he suggested a little halfheartedly You ll do nothing of the sort she objected or if you do I ll never come inside your rooms again Understand that I don t want any of these Society tricks See me home indeed I d have you know that I m better able to take care of myself in the streets of New York than you are So thank you for your dinner and just you sit down and listen for that telephone It will ring right presently and if it doesn t go to bed and say to yourself that whatever she decides is best She knows which way her happiness lies You don t And it s she who counts much more than you Leave off thinking of yourself quite so much and shake hands with me please mister Ware He gripped her hand opened the door and watched her sail down towards the lift whistling to herself her hands in her coat pockets Then he turned back into the room and locked himself in CHAPTER IX The slow fever of inaction fretting in Philip s veins culminated soon after Martha s departure in a passionate desire for a movement of some sort The very silence of the room maddened him the unresponsive looking telephone the fire which had burned itself out the dropping even of the wind which at intervals during the evening had flung a rainstorm against the windowpane At midnight he could bear it no longer and sallied out into the streets Again that curious desire for companionship was upon him a strange heritage for one who throughout the earlier stages of his life had been content with and had even sought a grim and unending solitude He boarded a surface car for the sake of sitting wedged in amongst a little crowd of people and he entered his club noting the number of hats and coats in the cloakroom with a queer sense of satisfaction He no sooner made his appearance in the main room than he was greeted vociferously from half a dozen quarters He accepted every hospitality that was offered to him drinking cheerfully with new as well as old acquaintances Presently Noel Bridges came up and gripped his shoulder Come and have a grill with us Ware he begged There s Seymour and Richmond here from the Savage Club and a whole crowd of us Hullo Freddy he went on greeting the man with whom Philip had been talking Why don t you come and join us too We ll have a rubber of bridge afterwards That s great the other declared Come on Ware We ll rag old Honeybrook into telling us some of his stories The little party gathered together at the end of the common table Philip had already drunk much more than he was accustomed to but the only result appeared to be some slight slackening of the tension in which he had been living His eyes flashed and his tongue became more nimble He insisted upon ordering wine He had had no opportunity yet of repaying many courtesies They drank his health forced him into the place of honour by the side of Honeybrook veteran of the club and ate their meal to the accompaniment of ceaseless bursts of laughter chaff the popping of corks mock speeches badinage of every sort Philip felt somehow that his brain had never been clearer He not only held his own but he earned a reputation for a sense of humour previously denied to him And in the midst of it all the door opened and closed and a huge man dressed in plain dinner clothes still wearing his theatre hat with a coat upon his arm and a stick in his hand passed through the door and stood for a moment gazing around him Say that s Sylvanus Power one of the young men at the table exclaimed Looks a trifle grim doesn t he It s the old man right enough Noel Bridges murmured Wonder what he wants down here It isn t in his beat Honeybrook the great New York raconteur father of the club touched Philip upon the shoulder Hey presto he whispered We who think so much of ourselves have become pigmies upon the face of the earth There towers the representative of modern omnipotence Those are the hands grim strong looking hands aren t they that grip the levers of modern American life Rodin ought to do a statue of him as he stands there art and letters growing smaller as he grows larger We exist for him He builds theatres for our plays museums for our pictures libraries for our books Seems to me he is looking for one of us Noel Bridges remarked Some pose isn t it a younger member of the party exclaimed reverently as he lifted his tankard All these things were a matter of seconds during which Sylvanus Power did indeed stand without moving looking closely about the room Then his eye at last lit upon the end of the table where Philip and his friends were seated He approached them without a word Noel Bridges ventured upon a greeting Coming to join us mister Power he asked Sylvanus Power if he heard the question ignored it His eyes had rested upon Philip He stood over the table now looming before them massive in his way awe inspiring Ware he said I ve been looking for you Instinctively Philip rose to his feet Tall though he was he had to look up at the other man and his slender body seemed in comparison like a willow wand Nevertheless the light in his eyes was illuminative There was no shrinking away He stood there with the air of one prepared to welcome to incite and provoke storm whatever might be brewing I have been to your rooms Sylvanus Power went on They knew nothing about you there They wouldn t Philip replied I go where I choose and when I choose What do you want with me Conversation in the room was almost suspended Those in the immediate locality well acquainted with the gossip of the city held the key to the situation Every one for a moment however was spellbound They felt the coming storm but they were powerless I sought you out Ware Sylvanus Power continued his harsh voice ringing through the room to tell you what probably every other man here knows except you If you know it you re a fool and I m here to tell you so Have you been drinking Philip asked calmly Maybe I have Sylvanus Power answered but whisky can t cloud my brain or stop my tongue You re looking at my little toy here he went on twirling in his right hand a heavy malacca cane with a leaden top I killed a man with that once The weapon seems sufficient for the purpose Philip answered indifferently Any other man Sylvanus Power went on would have sat in the chair for that Not I You don t know as much of me as you need to Merton Ware I m no whippersnapper of a pen slinger earning a few paltry dollars by writing doggerel for women and mountebanks to act I ve hewn my way with my right arm and my brain from the streets to the palace They say that money talks By God if it does I ought to shout for I ve more million dollars than there are men in this room Nevertheless Philip said growing calmer as he recognised the man s condition you are a very insufferable fellow There had been a little murmur throughout the room at the end of Sylvanus Power s last blatant speech but at Philip s retort there was a hushed almost an awed silence mister Honeybrook rose to his feet Sir he said turning to Power to the best of my belief you are not a member of this club I am a member of any club in America I choose to enter the intruder declared As for you writing and acting popinjays I could break the lot of you if I chose I came to see you Ware Come out from your friends and talk to me Philip pushed back his chair made his way deliberately round the head of the table brushing aside several arms outstretched to prevent his going Sylvanus Power stood in an open space between the tables swinging his cane with its ugly top in the middle of his hand He watched Philip s approach and lowered his head a little like a bull about to charge If you have anything to say to me Philip observed coolly I am here but I warn you that there is one subject which is never discussed within these walls If you transgress our unwritten rule I shall neither listen to what you have to say nor will you be allowed to remain here And what is that subject Sylvanus Power thundered No woman s name is mentioned here Philip told him calmly Several of the men had sprung to their feet It seemed from Power s attitude as though murder might be done Philip however stood his ground almost contemptuously his frame tense and poised his fists clenched Suddenly the strain passed The man whose face for a moment had been almost black with passion lowered his cane swayed a little upon his feet and recovered himself So you know what I ve come here to talk about young man he demanded One can surmise Philip replied If you think it worth while I will accompany you to my rooms or to yours Philip in those few seconds made a reputation for himself which he never lost The little company of men looked at one another in mute acknowledgment of a courage which not one of them failed to appreciate I ll take you at your word Sylvanus Power decided grimly Here boys he went on moving towards the table where Philip had been seated give me a drink some rye whisky I m dry Not a soul stirred Even Noel Bridges remained motionless Heselton the junior manager of the theatre met the millionaire s eye and never flinched mister Honeybrook knocked the ash from his cigar and accepted the role of spokesman mister Power he said we are a hospitable company here and we are at all times glad to entertain our friends At the same time the privileges of the club are retained so far as possible for those who conform to a reasonable standard of good manners There was a sudden thumping of hands upon the table until the glasses rattled Power s face showed not a single sign of anger He was simply puzzled He had come into touch with something which he could not understand There was Bridges earning a salary at his theatre to be thrown out into the streets or made a star of according to his whim Heselton a family man drawing his salary and a good one too also from the theatre men whose faces were familiar to him some of them he knew on newspapers in which he owned a controlling interest The power of which he had bragged was a real enough thing What had come to these men that they failed to recognise it to this slim young boy of an Englishman that he dared to defy him Pretty queer crowd you boys he muttered Philip who had been waiting by the door came a few steps back again mister Power he said I don t know much about you and you don t seem to know anything at all about us I am only at present a member by courtesy of this club but it isn t often that any one has reason to complain of lack of hospitality here If you take my advice you ll apologise to these gentlemen for your shockingly bad behaviour when you came in Tell them that you weren t quite yourself and I ll stand you a drink myself That goes Honeybrook assented gravely It s up to you sir mister Sylvanus Power felt that he had wandered into a cul de sac He had found his way into one of those branch avenues leading from the great road of his imperial success He was man enough to know when to turn back Gentlemen he said I offer you my apologies I came here in a furious temper and a little drunk I retract all that I said I ll drink to your club if you ll allow me the privilege Willing hands filled his tumbler and grateful ones forced a glass between Philip s fingers None of them really wanted Sylvanus Power for an enemy Here s looking at you all the latter said Luck he muttered glancing towards Philip They all drank as though it were a rite Philip and Sylvanus Power set their glasses down almost at the same moment Philip turned towards the door I am at your service now mister Power he announced Good night you fellows There was a new ring of friendliness in the hearty response which came from every corner of the room Goodnight Ware So long old fellow Good night old chap There was a little delay in the cloakroom while the attendant searched for Philip s hat which had been temporarily misplaced Honeybrook who had followed the two men out of the room fumbling for a moment in his locker and coming over to Philip dropped something into the latter s overcoat pocket Rather like a scene in a melodrama isn t it Ware he whispered but I know a little about Sylvanus Power It s only a last resource mind CHAPTER X Philip fetched his hat and the two men stepped out on to the pavement A servant in quiet grey livery held open the door of an enormous motor car Sylvanus Power beckoned his companion to precede him Home he told the man unless he added turning to Philip you d rather go to your rooms I am quite indifferent Philip replied They drove off in absolute silence a silence which remained unbroken until they passed through some elaborate iron gates and drew up before a mansion in Fifth Avenue You ll wait Sylvanus Power ordered and take this gentleman home This way sir The doors rolled open before them Philip caught a vista of a wonderful hall with a domed roof and stained glass windows and a fountain playing from some marble statuary at the further end A personage in black took his coat and hat The door of a dining room stood open A table covered with a profusion of flowers was laid and places set for two mister Sylvanus Power turned abruptly to a footman You can have that cleared away he directed harshly No supper will be required He swung around and led the way into a room at the rear of the hall a room which in comparison with Philip s confused impressions of the rest of the place was almost plainly furnished There was a small oak sideboard upon which was set out whisky and soda and cigars a great desk covered with papers before which a young man was seated two telephone instruments and a phonograph The walls were lined with books The room itself was long and narrow Power turned to the young man You can go to bed George he ordered Disconnect the telephones The young man gathered up some papers locked the desk in silence bowed to his employer and left the room without a word Power waited until the door was closed Then he stood up with his back to the fireplace and pointed to a chair You can sit if you like he invited Drink or smoke if you want to You re welcome Thank you Philip replied I d rather stand You don t want even to take a chair in my house I suppose mister Sylvanus Power went on mockingly or drink my whisky or smoke my cigars eh From the little I have seen of you Philip confessed my inclinations are certainly against accepting any hospitality at your hands That s a play writing trick I suppose Sylvanus Power sneered stringing out your sentences as pat as butter It s not my way There s the truth always at the back of my head and the words ready to fit it but they come as they please I seem to have noticed that Philip observed What sort of a man are you anyway the other demanded his heavy eyebrows suddenly lowering his wonderful keen eyes riveted upon Philip Can I buy you I wonder or threaten you That rather depends upon what it is you want from me I want you to leave this country and never set foot in it again That s what I want of you I want you to get back to your London slums and write your stuff there and have it played in your own poky little theatres I want you out of New York and I want you out quick Then I am afraid Philip regretted that we are wasting time I haven t the least intention of leaving New York Well we ll go through the rigmarole Power continued gruffly We ve got to understand one another There s my cheque book in that safe A million dollars if you leave this country alone within twenty four hours and stay away for the rest of your life Philip raised his eyebrows He was lounging slightly against the desk I should have no use for a million dollars mister Power he said If I had I should not take it from you and further the conditions you suggest are absurd Bribery no good eh mister Power observed What about threats There was a man once who wrote a letter to a certain woman which I found I killed him a few days afterwards There was a sort of a scuffle but it was murder right enough I am nearer the door than you are and I should say about three times as strong How would a fight suit you Ware s hand was in his overcoat pocket Not particularly he answered Besides it wouldn t be fair You see I am armed and you re not As though for curiosity he drew from his pocket the little revolver which Honeybrook had slipped into it Power looked at it and shrugged his shoulders We ll leave that out then for the moment he said Now listen to me I m off on another tack now Eight years ago I met Elizabeth Dalstan I was thirty eight years old then I am forty six now You young men nowadays go through your life they tell me with a woman on your hands most of the time waste yourself out in a score of passions go through the same old rigmarole once a year or something like it I was married when I was twenty four I got married to lay my hands on the first ten thousand dollars I needed My wife left me fifteen years ago You may have read of her She was a storekeeper s daughter then She has a flat in Paris now a country house in England a villa at Monte Carlo and another at Florence She lives her life I live mine She s the only woman I d ever spoken a civil word to until I met Elizabeth Dalstan or since Philip was interested despite his violent antipathy to the man A singular record of fidelity he remarked suavely If you d drop that play acting talk and speak like a man I d like you better Sylvanus Power continued There it is in plain words I lived with my wife until we quarrelled and she left me and while she lived with me I thought no more of women than cats When she went I thought I d done with the sex Elizabeth Dalstan happened along and I found I hadn t even begun Eight years ago we met I offered her at once everything I could offer Nothing doing We don t need to tell one another that she isn t that sort I went off and left her spent a winter in Siberia and came home by China I suppose there were women there and in Paris I was there for a month I didn t see them Then America Elizabeth Dalstan was still touring not doing much good for herself I hung around for a time tried my luck once more no go Then I went back to Europe offered my wife ten million and an income for a divorce It didn t suit her so I came back again The third time I found Elizabeth discouraged If ever a man found a woman at the right time I did She is ambitious Lord knows why I hate acting and the theatres and everything to do with them However I tried a new move I built that theatre in New York there isn t another place like it in the world and offered it to her for a birthday present Then she began to hesitate Look here Philip broke in I know all this I know everything you have told me and everything you can tell me What about it What have you got to say to me This Sylvanus Power declared striking the desk with his clenched fist I have only had one consolation all the time I have been waiting there has been no other man Elizabeth isn t that sort Each time I was separated and came back I just looked at her and I knew That s why I have been patient That is why I haven t insisted upon my debt being paid You understand that I hear what you say Power crossed the room helped himself to whisky and returned to his place with the tumbler in his hand There was a brief silence A little clock upon the mantelpiece struck two The street sounds outside had ceased save for the hoot of an occasional taxicab Philip was conscious of a burning desire to get away This man this great lump of power and success standing like a colossus in his wonderful home infuriated him That a man should live who thought he had a right such as he claimed was maddening Well Power proceeded setting down the tumbler empty you won t be bought How am I going to get you out of the way You can t do it Philip asserted I am going to morrow morning to Elizabeth and I am going to pray her to marry me at once Power swayed for a single moment upon his feet The teeth gleamed between his slightly parted lips His great arm was outstretched its bursting muscles showing against the sleeve of his dinner coat His chest was heaving If you do it he shouted I ll close the theatre to morrow and sack every one in it I ll buy any theatre in New York where you try to present your namby pamby play I ll buy every manager she goes to for an engagement every newspaper that says a word of praise of any work of yours I tell you I ll stand behind the scenes and pull the strings which shall bring you and her to the knowledge of what failure and want mean I ll give up the great things in life I ll devote every dollar I have every thought of my brain every atom of my power to bringing you two face to face with misery That s if I keep my hands off you I mayn t do that Philip shrugged his shoulders If I put you in a play he said which is where you really belong people would find you humorous Your threats don t affect me at all mister Power Elizabeth can choose Power leaned over to the switch and turned on an electric light above Philip s head Blast you let me look at you he thundered You re a white faced sickly creature to call yourself a man Can t you see this thing as I see it You re the sort that s had women and plenty of them Another will do for you and my God she is the only one I ve looked at I Sylvanus Power mind I who have ruled fate and ruled men all my life I want her Don t be a fool Get out of my path I ve crushed a hundred such men as you in my day Philip took up his hat We are wasting time he observed You are a cruder person than I thought you mister Power I am sorry for you if that s anything Sorry for me You Very Philip continued You see you ve imbibed a false view of life You ve placed yourself amongst the gods and your feet really are made of very sticky clay Shall I find my own way out You can find your way to hell Power roared Use your toy pistol if you want to You re going where you ll never need it again He took a giant stride a stride which was more like the spring of a maddened bull towards Philip The veneer of a spurious civilisation seemed to have fallen from him He was the great and splendid animal transformed with an overmastering passion There was murder in his eyes His great right arm with its long hairy fingers and its single massive ring was like the limb of some prehistoric creature Philip s brain and his feet however were alike nimble He sprang a little on one side and though that first blow caught him just on the edge of the shoulder and sent him spinning round and round he saved himself by clutching at the desk Fortunately it was his left arm that hung helpless by his side His fingers groped feverishly in the cavernous folds of his overcoat pocket Power who had dashed against the wall smashing the glass of one of the pictures had already recovered his balance and turned around The little revolver with whose use Philip was barely acquainted flashed suddenly out in the lamplight Even in that lurid moment he kept his nerve He aimed at the right arm outstretched to strike him and pulled the trigger Through the little mist of smoke he saw a spasm of pain in his assailant s face felt the thundering crash of his other arm striking him on the side of the head The room spun round There was a second almost of unconsciousness When he came to he was lying with his finger pressed against the electric bell Power was clutching the desk for support and gasping The sober person in black with a couple of footmen behind were already in the room Their master turned to them There has been an accident here he groaned nothing serious Take that gentleman and put him in the car It s waiting outside for him Telephone round for Doctor Renshaw For a single moment the major domo hesitated The weapon was still smoking in Philip s hand Then Power s voice rang out again in furious command Do as I tell you he ordered If there s one of you here opens his lips about this he leaves my service to morrow Not a dollar of pension mind he added his voice shaking a little The servant bowed sombrely Your orders shall be obeyed sir he promised He took up the telephone and signed to one of the footmen who helped Philip to the door A moment afterwards the latter sank back amongst the cushions a little dizzy and breathless but revived almost instantly by the cool night air He gave the chauffeur his address and the car glided through the iron gates and down Fifth Avenue CHAPTER XI Philip was awakened the next morning by the insistent ringing of the telephone at his elbow He took up the receiver conscious of a sharp pain in his left shoulder as he moved Is this mister Merton Ware a man s smooth voice enquired Yes I am speaking for mister Sylvanus Power mister Sylvanus Power regrets very much that he is unable to lunch with mister Ware as arranged to day but he is compelled to go to Philadelphia on the morning train He will be glad to meet mister Ware anywhere a week to day and know the result of the matter which was discussed last night To whom am I speaking Philip demanded I don t know anything about lunching with mister Power to day I am mister Power s secretary George Lunt was the reply mister Power s message is very clear He wishes you to know that he will not be in New York until a week to day How is mister Power Philip enquired He met with a slight accident last night the voice continued and is obliged to wear his arm in a sling Except for that he is quite well He has already left for Philadelphia by the early train He was anxious that you should know this Thank you very much Philip murmured a little dazed He sprang out of bed dressed quickly hurried over his coffee and rolls boarded a cross town car and arrived at the Monmouth House flats just in time to meet Martha Grimes issuing into the street She was not at all the same Martha She was very neatly dressed her shoes were nicely polished her clothes well brushed her gloves new and she wore a bunch of fresh looking violets in her waistband She started in surprise as Philip accosted her Whatever are you doing back in the slums she demanded Any fresh trouble Nothing particular Philip replied turning round and falling into step with her I can t see my way that s all and I want to talk to you You re the most human person I know and you understand Elizabeth Gee she smiled This is the lion and the mouse with a vengeance You can walk with me if you like as far as the block before the theatre I m not going to arrive there with you and I tell you so straight No followers eh There s no reason to set people talking she declared Their tongues wag fast enough at the theatre as it is I ve only been there for one day s work and it seems to me I ve heard the inside history of every one connected with the place That makes what I have to say easier he remarked Just what do they say about Miss Dalstan and mister Sylvanus Power She looked at him indignantly If you think you re going to worm things out of me Don t be foolish he interrupted a little wearily How could you know anything You are only the echo of a thousand voices I could find out if I went where they gossip I don t In effect I don t care but I am up against a queer situation I want to know just what people think of them Afterwards I ll tell you the truth Well they profess to think she said slowly that the theatre belongs to Miss Dalstan and that she Stop please he interrupted I know you hate saying it and I know quite well what you mean Well what about that It isn t my affair It isn t true he told her Whether it s true or not she is one of the best women in the world Martha declared vigorously There isn t any doubt about that either he assented This is the situation Listen Sylvanus Power has been in love with Elizabeth for the best part of his life He built that theatre for her and offered it at a price She accepted his terms When the time came for payment he saw her flinch He went away again and has just come back She is face to face now with a decision a decision to which she is partly committed In the meantime during these last few months Elizabeth and I have become great friends You know that I care for her I think that she cares for me She has to make up her mind Martha which is she to choose How do you want me to answer that the girl asked slackening her pace a little I m not Miss Dalstan From her point of view he explained eagerly This man Power is madly and I believe truly in love with her In his way he is great in his way too he is a potentate He can give her more than luxury more even than success You know Elizabeth he went on She is one of the finest women who ever breathed an idealist but a seeker after big things She deserves the big things Is she more likely to find them with me or with him Power s wife is still alive she ruminated And won t accept a divorce at present he observed If ever she does of course he will marry her That has to be taken into account not morally but the temporal side of it We know perfectly well that whatever Elizabeth decides she couldn t possibly do wrong Martha smiled a little grimly That s what it is to be born in the clouds she said There is no sin for a good woman He looked at her appreciatively I wonder how I knew that you would understand this he sighed Suddenly he clutched at her arm She glanced up in surprise He was staring at a passer by Her eyes followed his In a neat morning suit with a black bowler hat and well polished shoes a cigar in his mouth and a general air of prosperity mister Edward Dane was strolling along Broadway He passed without a glance at either of them For a moment Philip faltered Then he set his teeth and walked on There was an ashen shade in his face The girl looked at him and shook her head mister Ware she said we haven t talked much about it but there is something there behind isn t there something you are terrified about something that might come even now She knows about it he interposed quickly Would it be very bad if it came Hideous If she were your wife She would be notorious It would ruin her Do you think then she asked quietly that you needed to come and ask my advice He walked on with his head high looking upwards with unseeing eyes A little vista of that undisturbed supper table on the other side of the marble hall a dim perspective of those eight years of waiting flitted through his brain The lord of that Fifth Avenue Mansion was in earnest right enough and he had so much to offer It will break me if I have to give her up he said simply I believe I should have gone overboard crossing the Atlantic but for her There are some women she sighed the best of all women the joy of whose life seems to be sacrifice That sounds queer don t it but it s true They re happy in misfortune so long as they are helping some one else She is wonderful Elizabeth Dalstan She may even be one of those You ll find that out You d better find out for yourself There isn t any one can help you very much I am not sure that you haven t he said Now I ll go Where did you get your violets Martha Had them in water since last night haven t you She made a little grimace at him A very polite young gentleman at the box office sent us each a bunch directly we started work yesterday I ve only had a few words with him yet but Eva that s the other girl she s plagued to death with fellows already so I m going to take him out one evening Philip stopped short They were approaching the theatre Not a step further he declared solemnly I wouldn t spoil your prospects for worlds Run along my little cynic and warm your hands Life s good at your age better than when I found you eh You don t think I am ungrateful she asked a little wistfully He shook his head You couldn t be that Martha Good luck to you She turned away with a little farewell wave of the hand and was lost at once in the surging stream of people Philip summoned a taxicab sat far back in the corner and drove to his rooms He hesitated for a moment before getting out crossed the pavement quickly hurried into the lift and arriving up stairs let down the latch of the outside door Edward Dane was back in New York For a moment the memory of the great human drama in which he found himself a somewhat pathetic figure seemed swallowed up by this sudden resurrection of a grisly tragedy He looked around his room a little helplessly Against his will that hideous vision which had loomed up before him in so many moments of depression was slowly reforming itself this time not in the still watches of the night but in the broad daylight with the spring sunshine to cheer his heart the roar of a friendly city in his ears It was no time for dreams this and yet he felt the misery sweeping in upon him felt all the cold shivers of his ineffective struggles Slowly that fateful panorama unfolded itself before his memory He saw himself step out with glad relief from the uncomfortable nauseous third class carriage and clutching his humble little present in his hand cross the flinty platform climb the long rain swept hill keeping his head upraised though the very sky seemed grimy battling against the miserable depression of that everlasting ugliness Before him at least there was his one companion There would be kind words sympathy a cheerful fireside a little dreaming a little wandering into that world which they had made for themselves with the help of such treasures as that cheap little volume he carried And then the last few steps the open door the room its air at first of wonderful comfort and then the queer note of luxury obtruding itself disquietingly the picture on the mantelpiece her coming He had never been in love with Beatrice He knew that now perfectly well He had simply clung to her because she was the only living being who knew and understood because they had mingled their thoughts and trodden the path of misery together Removed now from that blaze of passion smouldering perhaps in him through previous years of discontent but which leaped into actual and effective life for the first time in those few moments he realised a certain justice in her point of view a certain hard logic in the way she had spoken of life and their relations There had been so little real affection between them So little had passed which might have constituted a greater bond It was his passionate outburst of revolt against life whose drear talons seemed to have fastened themselves into his very soul which had sent him out with murder in his brain to seek the man who had robbed him of the one thing which stood between him and despair the pent up fury of a lifetime which had tingled in his blood and had given him the strength of the navvy in those few minutes by the canal side He covered his face with his hands strode around the room gazing wildly out over the city trying to listen to the clanging of the surface cars the rumble of the overhead railway in the distance the breaking of the long ceaseless waves of human feet upon the pavement It was useless No effort of his will could keep from his brain the haunting memory of those final moments the man s face handsome and well satisfied at first the careless greeting the sudden change the surprise the apprehension the ghastly fear the agony He heard the low gurgling shriek of terror he looked into the eyes with the fear of hell before them Then he heard the splash of the black filthy water There was a cry It was several seconds before he realised that it had broken from his lips He looked around him like a hunted creature There was another terror now the gloomy court with its ugly miserable paraphernalia the death uglier still death in disgrace a sordid ghastly thing And in his brain too there was so much dawning so many wonderful ideas craving for fulfilment These few months had been months of marvellous development The power of the writer had seemed to grow hour by hour His brain was full of fancies exquisite fancies some of them It was a new world growing up around him and within him too beautiful a world to leave Yet in those breathless moments fear was the dominant sensation He felt a coward to his fingertips He walked up and down the room feverishly as a man might pace a prison in the first few moments of captivity There was no escape If he disappeared again it would only rivet suspicion the more closely There was no place to which he could fly no shelter save on the other side of the life which he had just begun to love His physical condition began to alarm him He felt his forehead by accident and found it damp with sweat His heart was beating irregularly with a spasmodic vigour which brought pain He caught sight of his terror stricken face in the looking glass and the craving to escape from his frenzied solitude overcame all his other resolutions He rushed to the telephone spoke with Phoebe waited breathlessly whilst she fetched his mistress to the instrument I want to see you he begged as soon as he was conscious of her presence at the other end I want to see you at once Has anything happened she asked quickly Yes he almost groaned I can t tell you I will be with you in ten minutes she promised He set the receiver down Those ten minutes were surely the longest which had ever ticked their way into Eternity And then she came He heard the lift stop and his door open There was a moment s breathless silence as their eyes met then a little gathering together of the lines of her forehead a half querulous half sympathetic smile She shook her head at him You ve had one of those silly nervous attacks she declared Tell me at once why Dane is back I saw him on the pavement this morning he exclaimed He has been to England to find out She made him sit down and seated herself by his side Listen she said Dane came back on the Orinoco the day before yesterday I saw his name in the paper If his voyage to England had been a success which it could not have been you would have heard from him before now I didn t think of that he muttered I have never asked you she went on to tell me exactly what happened behind there I don t want to know Only I have a consciousness I had from the first when you began to talk to me about it that your fears were exaggerated If you have been allowed to remain safe all this time you will be safe always I feel it and I am always right in these things Now use your own common sense Tell me truthfully don t you think it is very improbable that anything could be discovered That anything could be proved he admitted eagerly yes Then don t be silly No one is likely to make accusations and attempt a case unless they had a definite end in view We are safe even from the Elletania people mister Raymond Greene has ceased to talk of your wonderful resemblance to Douglas Romilly Phoebe the only one who could really know will never open her lips Now take me for a little walk We will look in the shops in Fifth Avenue and lunch at the Ritz Carlton Go and brush yourself and make yourself look respectable I ll have a cigarette and read the paper No I won t I ll look over these loose sheets and see how you are getting on He disappeared into his room for a few minutes When he returned she was entirely engrossed She looked up at him with something almost of reverence in her face When did you write this she asked Yesterday most of it he answered There is more of it I haven t finished yet When you send me away this afternoon I shall go on That is only the beginning I have a great idea dawning What you have written is wonderful she said simply It makes me feel almost humble makes me feel that the very best actress in the world remains only an interpretress Yes I can say those words you have written but they can never be mine I want to be something more than an intelligent parrot Philip Why can t you teach me to feel and think things like that You he murmured as he took her arm and led her to the door You could feel all the sweetest and most wonderful things in heaven The writer s knack is only a slight gift I put on paper what lives in your heart She raised her head and he kissed her lips For a moment he held her quite quietly Her arms encircled him The perfume of her clothes her hair her warm gentle touch seemed like a strong sedative If she said that he was safe he must be It was queer how so often at these times their sexes seemed reversed it was he who felt that womanly desire for shelter and protection which she so amply afforded him She patted his cheek Now for our little walk she said Open the windows and let out all these bad fancies of yours And listen she went on as they stepped out of the lift a moment or two later and passed through the hall towards the pavement not a word about our own problem We are going to talk nonsense We are going to be just two light hearted children in this wonderful city gazing at the sights and taking all she has to offer us I love it you know I love the noise of it It isn t a distant stifled roar like London There s a harsh clarion like note about it like metal striking upon metal And the smell of New York there isn t any other city like it When we get into Fifth Avenue I am going to direct your attention to the subject of hats Have you ever bought a woman s hat Philip Never he answered truthfully enough Then you are going to this morning or rather you are going to help me to choose one she declared and in a very few moments too There is a little place almost underground in Fifth Avenue there and a Frenchwoman oh she is so French and all her assistants have black hair and wear untidy shapeless clothes and velvet slippers It isn t New York at all but I love it and I let them put their name on the programme They really don t charge me more than twice as much as they ought to for my hats We go down here she added descending some steps and if you make eyes at any of the young women I shall bring you straight out again They spent half an hour choosing a hat and nearly two hours over lunch It was late in the afternoon before she dropped him at his rooms Not a word had they spoken of Sylvanus Power or their future but Philip was a different man Only as he turned and said good by his voice trembled I can t say thank you he muttered but you know The lift was too slow for him He opened his door with almost breathless haste He only paused to light a cigarette and change his coat and wheel his table round so as to catch the afternoon light more perfectly Then with his brain teeming with fancies he plunged into his work CHAPTER XII Philip let the pen slip at last from his tired fingers The light had failed He had been writing with straining eyes almost in the darkness But there was something else Had it been fancy or This time there could be no mistake He had not heard the lift stop but some one was knocking softly at the door softly but persistently He turned his head The room seemed filled with shadows He had written for hours and he was conscious that his limbs were stiff The sun had gone down in a cloudy sky and the light had faded He could scarcely distinguish the articles of furniture at the further end of the room For some reason or other he felt tongue tied Then without any answer from him to this mysterious summons the handle of the door slowly turned As he sat there he saw it pushed open A woman wrapped in a long coat stepped inside closing it firmly behind her She stood peering around the room There was something familiar and yet unfamiliar in her height her carriage He waited spellbound for her voice Douglas she exclaimed Ah there you are The words seemed to die away unuttered upon his lips He suddenly thought that he was choking He stared at her blankly It was impossible She came a step further into the room Her hand was stretched out accusingly So I ve found you have I Douglas she cried and there was a note of bitter triumph in her words found you after all these months Aren t you terrified Aren t you afraid No wonder you sit there shrinking away Do you know what I have come for He tried to speak but his lips were as powerless to frame words as his limbs were to respond to his desire for movement This was the one thing which he had not foreseen You broke your promise she went on raising her voice a little in passionate reproach You left me there alone to face dismissal without a penny and slipped off yourself to America You never even came in to wish me good by Why Tell me why you went without coming near me You won t eh You daren t Be a man Out with it I am here and I know the truth For the first time some definite sound came from his lips Beatrice he gasped Ah she mocked You can remember my name then Douglas I knew that you were a bad man I knew that when you told me how you meant to cheat your creditors how you meant to escape over here on the pretext of business and bring all the money you could scrape together I knew that and yet I was willing to come with you and I should have come But there was one thing I didn t reckon upon I didn t know that you had the heart or the courage to be a murderer The little cry that broke from his lips was stifled even before it was uttered I shall never forgive you she sobbed I never want to touch your bloodstained fingers I have forgotten that I ever loved you You re horrible do you hear horrible And yet I don t mean to be left to starve That s why I ve followed you You re afraid I am going to give you up to justice Well I don t know It depends Turn on the lights I want to see you Do you hear I want to see how you can face me I want to see how the memory of that afternoon has dealt with you Do as I tell you Don t stand there glowering at me He crossed the room with stumbling footsteps You ve learnt to stoop anyhow she went on You re thinner too My God The room was suddenly flooded with light Philip rigid and ghastly was looking at her from the other side of the table She held up her hands as though to shut out the sight of him Philip she shrieked Philip Oh my God Her eyes were lit with horror as she swayed upon her feet For a moment she seemed about to collapse Then she groped her way towards the door and stood there clinging to the handle Slowly she looked around over her shoulder her face as white as death She moistened her lips with her tongue her eyes glared at him Behind her brain seemed to be working Her first spasm of inarticulate fear passed Philip alive she muttered Alive Speak Can t you speak to me Are you a ghost Of course not he answered with a calm which surprised him You can t have forgotten in less than six months what I look like A new expression struggled into her face She abandoned her grasp of the handle and came back to her former position Look here she faltered if you are Philip Romilly where s he Douglas Where s Douglas There was no answer Philip simply looked at her She began to shake once more upon her feet Where s Douglas she demanded fiercely Tell me Tell me quickly before I go mad If you are Philip Romilly alive if it wasn t your body they found where s Douglas You can guess what happened to him Philip said slowly I met him on the towing path by the side of the canal I spoke to him about you He answered me with a jest I think that all the passion of those grinding years of misery swept up at that moment from my heart I was strong God how strong I was I took him by the throat Beatrice I watched his face change I watched his damned self satisfied complacency fade away He lost all his smugness and his eyes began to stare at me and his lips grew whiter as they struggled to utter the cries for mercy which choked back Then I flung him in that s all Splash God I can hear it now I saw his face just under the water Then I went on You went on she repeated trembling in every limb I picked up the pocketbook which I had shaken out of his clothes in that first struggle I studied its contents and it gave me an idea I went to Liverpool stayed at the hotel where he had engaged rooms dressed myself in his clothes and went on the steamer in his place I travelled to New York as mister Douglas Romilly of the Douglas Romilly Shoe Company occupied my room at the Waldorf under that name Then I disappeared suddenly there were too many people waiting to see me I took the pseudonym which he had carefully prepared for himself and hid for a time in a small tenement house Then I rewrote the play There you have my story You murdered him Philip You It was no crime he continued calmly filled with a queer sense of relief at the idea of being able to talk about it My whole life up till that day had been one epitome of injustice and evil fortune You were my one solace His life well you know what it had been Everything was made easy for him He had a luxurious boyhood he was sent to college pampered and spoilt and passed on to a dissipated manhood He spent a great fortune ruined a magnificent business He lived month by month hour by hour for just the voluptuous pleasures which his wealth made possible to him That was the man I met on the canal bank that afternoon You know the state I was in You know very well the grievance I had against him You had no right to interfere she said dully If I chose to accept what he had to give it was my business There never had been over much affection between you and me We were just waifs together Life wouldn t give us what we wanted I had made up my mind months before to escape whenever the opportunity came Douglas brought it to me and I snatched at it I am not accepting any blame He leaned towards her Neither am I he declared Do you remember we used to talk about the doctrine of responsibility I am a pervert I did what I had to do and I am content She stood quite still for several moments Then she took out the pins from her hat banged it upon the table opened her tweed coat came round to the fireside and threw herself into an easy chair Her action was portentous and significant Tell me how you found me out he asked after a brief pause I was dismissed from Detton Magna she told him I had to go and be waiting maid to Aunt Esther at Croydon I took the place of her maid of all work I scrubbed for my living There wasn t anything else I hadn t clothes to try for the bolder things not a friend in the world but I was only waiting I meant at the first chance to rob Aunt Esther to come to London dress myself properly and find a post on the stage if possible I wasn t particular Then one day a man came to see me an American He d travelled all the way from New York because he was interested in what he called the mysterious Romilly disappearance He knew that I had been Douglas friend He asked me to come out and identify you He offered me my passage a hundred pounds and to give me a start in life here if I needed it So I came out with him With Dane he muttered She nodded Yes that was his name mister Edward Dane I came out to identify Douglas You weren t going to give him away Philip asked curiously Of course not I should have made my bargain and then after I had scared Douglas for leaving me as he did I should have said that it wasn t the man And instead I found you He tapped the table with his fingers restlessly A new hope was forming in his brain This indeed might be the end of all his troubles Listen he said earnestly Dane has always suspected me Sometimes I have wondered whether he hadn t the truth at the back of his head You can make me safe forever She made no reply Her eyes were watching his face She seemed to be waiting to hear what else he had to say Don t you understand he went on impatiently You have only to tell Dane that I am neither Douglas nor Philip but curiously like both and he will chuck the thing up He must Then I shall be safe You see that don t you Yes I see that she admitted Well Tell me exactly how much of Douglas money you have spent she demanded Only the loose money from the pocketbook Not all of that I am earning money now She leaned across the table What about the twenty thousand pounds I haven t touched it he assured her not a penny On your honour He rose silently and went to his desk unlocked one of the drawers and drew from a hidden place a thin strip of paper He smoothed it out on the table before her There s the deposit note he said Twenty thousand pounds to the joint or separate credit of Beatrice Wenderley and Douglas Romilly on demand The money s there still I haven t touched it She gripped the paper in her fingers The sight of the figures seemed to fascinate her Then she looked around How can you afford to live in a place like this then she demanded suspiciously Where does your money come from The play he told her What all this she exclaimed It is a great success The theatre is packed every night My royalties come every week to far more than I could spend She looked once more around her gripped the deposit note in her fingers and leaned back in her chair She laughed curiously Her eyes had travelled back to Philip s anxious face Wonderful she murmured You paid the price but you ve won You ve had something for it I paid the price and up till now She stared at the paper in her hand Then she looked away into the fire I can t get it all into my head she went on I pictured him here living in luxury spending the money of which he had promised me a share and he s dead That was his body that unrecognisable thing they found in the canal You killed him Douglas He was so fond of life too Fond of the things which meant life to him Philip muttered I should never have believed that you had the courage she observed ruminatingly After all then he wasn t faithless He wasn t the brute I thought him She sat thinking for what seemed to him to be an interminable time He broke in at last upon her meditations Well he asked what are you going to say to Dane I shan t give you away at least I don t think so she promised cautiously I shall see Presently I will make terms only this time I am not going to be left I am going to have what I want But he ll be waiting to hear from you Philip exclaimed He may come here even She shook her head He s gone to Chicago He can t be back for five days I promised to wire but I shan t I ll wait until he s back And in the meantime Her fingers closed upon the deposit note He nodded shortly That s yours he said You can have it all I have helped myself to a fresh start in life at his expense That s all I wanted She folded up the paper and thrust it carefully into the bosom of her gown Then she stood up Well she pronounced I think I am getting used to things It s wonderful how callous one can become The banks are closed now I suppose He nodded They will be open at nine o clock in the morning First of all then she decided I ll make sure of my twenty thousand pounds and then we ll see I don t think you ll find me hard Philip I ought not to be hard on you ought I She looked at him most kindly and he began to shiver Curiously enough her very kindness when he realised the knowledge which lay behind her brain was hateful to him He had pleaded for her forgiveness even her toleration but anything else seemed horrible She strolled across the room and glanced at the clock took one of his cigarettes from a box and lit it Well this is queer she murmured reflectively Now I want some dinner and I ll see your play Philip You shall take me Get ready quickly please He looked at her doubtfully But Beatrice he protested think You know why you came here You know the story you will have to tell We are strangers you and I What if we are seen together She snapped her fingers at him Pooh Who cares I am a stranger in New York and I have taken a fancy to you You are a young man of gallantry and you are going to take me out We often used to talk of a little excursion like this in London We ll have it in New York instead He turned slowly towards the door of his bedroom She was busy looking at her own eyes in the mirror and she missed the little gleam of horror in his face In ten minutes he promised her CHAPTER XIII 
956-157879-0000	train-other-500	Beatrice replaced the programme which she had been studying on the ledge of the box and turned towards Philip who was seated in the background There was something a little new in her manner Her tone was subdued her eyes curious
956-157879-0001	train-other-500	You really are a wonderful person Philip she declared
none	none	 It s the same play just as you used to tell it me word for word 
956-157879-0002	train-other-500	And yet it isn t What is it that you have gained I wonder a sense of atmosphere breadth something strangely vital I am glad you like it he said simply Like it It s amazing And what an audience
956-157879-0003	train-other-500	I never thought that the people were so fashionable here Philip
none	none	 I am sitting right back in the box but ten minutes after I have cashed my draft tomorrow I shall be buying clothes 
956-157879-0004	train-other-500	You won t be ashamed to be seen anywhere with me then He drew his chair up to her side a little haggard and worn with the suspense of the evening She laughed at him mockingly What an idiot you are she exclaimed
956-157879-0005	train-other-500	You ought to be one of the happiest men in the world and you look like a death s head The happiest man in the world he repeated
none	none	 Beatrice sometimes I think that there is only one thing in the world that makes for happiness 
956-157879-0006	train-other-500	And what s that booby she asked with some of her old familiarity A clear conscience She laid her hand upon his arm Look here Philip she said
956-157879-0007	train-other-500	the one thing I determined when I threw up the sponge was that whether the venture was a success or not I d never waste a single moment in regrets Things didn t turn out too brilliantly with me as you know But you
956-157879-0008	train-other-500	see what you ve attained Why it s wonderful Your play the one thing you dreamed about produced in one of the greatest cities in the world and a packed house to listen to it people applauding all the time I didn t realise your success when we talked this evening
none	none	 I am just beginning to understand I ve been reading some of these extracts from the newspapers 
956-157879-0009	train-other-500	You re Merton Ware the great dramatist the coming man of letters You ve won Philip Can t you see that it s puling cowardice to grumble at the price He for his part was wondering at her callousness
956-157879-0010	train-other-500	of which he was constantly discovering fresh evidences
none	none	 The whole shock of her discovery seemed already in these few hours to have passed away 
956-157879-0011	train-other-500	If you can forget so soon he muttered I suppose I ought to be able to She made a little grimace but immediately afterwards he saw the cold tightening of her lips Listen Philip she said
956-157879-0012	train-other-500	I started life with the usual quiverful of good qualities but there s one I ve lost and I don t want it back again
none	none	 I m a selfish woman and I mean to stay a selfish woman I am going to live for myself I ve paid a fair price and I m going to have what I ve paid for See 
956-157879-0013	train-other-500	Do you think he asked that it is possible to make that sort of bargain with one s self and fate She laughed scornfully There s room for a little stiffening in you even now Philip No one but a weakling ever talks about fate
956-157879-0014	train-other-500	You d think better of me I suppose if I stayed in my room and wept Well I could do it if I let myself but I won t I should lose several hours of the life that belongs to me You think I didn t care about Douglas
956-157879-0015	train-other-500	I am not at all sure that I didn t care for him as much as I ever did for you although of course he wasn t worthy of it
956-157879-0016	train-other-500	But he s gone and all the shudders and morbid regrets in the world won t bring him back again And I am here in New York and to morrow I shall have twenty thousand pounds and to night I am with you watching your play That s life enough for me at present no more no less
956-157879-0017	train-other-500	I hate missing the first act and I m coming to see it again to morrow What time is it over
none	none	 Soon after eleven he told her She glanced at her watch 
956-157879-0018	train-other-500	You shall take me out and give me some supper she decided
none	none	 somewhere where there s music 
956-157879-0019	train-other-500	He made no remark but she surprised again something in his face which irritated her Look here Philip she said firmly
none	none	 I won t have you look at me as though I were something inhuman 
956-157879-0020	train-other-500	There are plenty of other women like me in the world even if they are not quite so frank about it I want to live and I will live and I grudge every moment out of which I am not extracting the fullest amount of happiness That s because I ve paid
956-157879-0021	train-other-500	It s the woman s bargaining instinct you know She wants to get value Now I want to hear about Miss Dalstan Where did you meet her and how did you get her to accept your play
956-157879-0022	train-other-500	She was on the Elletania he explained We crossed from Liverpool together She sat at my table How much does she know about you Beatrice asked bluntly Everything he confessed I don t know what I should have done without her
956-157879-0023	train-other-500	She has been the most wonderful friend any one could have Beatrice looked at him a little critically You re a queer person Philip she exclaimed
none	none	 You re not fit to go about alone really 
956-157879-0024	train-other-500	Good thing I came over to take care of you I think You don t understand he replied Miss Dalstan is well unlike anybody else She wants to see you I am to take you round after the next act if you would like to go
956-157879-0025	train-other-500	Beatrice smiled at him in a gratified manner I ve always wanted to go behind the scenes she admitted I ll come with you with pleasure Perhaps if I decide that I d like to go on the stage she may be able to help me How much is twenty thousand pounds in dollars Philip
none	none	 A little over a hundred thousand he told her I don t suppose they think that much out here 
956-157879-0026	train-other-500	she went on ruminatingly The hotel where mister Dane sent me it s nice enough in its way but very stuffy as regards the people is twice as expensive as it would be in London However we shall see
956-157879-0027	train-other-500	The curtain rang up on the third act and Beatrice seated well back in the shadows followed the play attentively appreciated its good points and had every appearance of both understanding and enjoying it Afterwards she rose promptly to her feet still clapping
956-157879-0028	train-other-500	I m longing to meet Miss Dalstan Philip she declared She is wonderful
none	none	 And to think that you wrote it that you created the part for her I am really quite proud of you 
956-157879-0029	train-other-500	She laughed at his embarrassment affecting to ignore the fact that it was less the author s modesty than some queer impulse of horror
none	none	 which seemed to come over him when any action of hers reminded him of their past familiarity 
956-157879-0030	train-other-500	He hurried on piloting her down the corridor to the door of Elizabeth s dressing room In response to his knock they were bidden to enter and Elizabeth who was lying on a couch whilst a maid was busy preparing her costume for the next act
956-157879-0031	train-other-500	held out her hand with a little welcoming smile I am so glad to see you Miss Wenderley she said
none	none	 cordially 
956-157879-0032	train-other-500	Philip bring Miss Wenderley over here You ll forgive my not getting up won t you
none	none	 I have to rest for just these few minutes before the next act Beatrice was for a moment overpowered The luxury of the wonderful dressing room with its perfect French furniture 
956-157879-0033	train-other-500	its white walls hung with a few choice sketches
none	none	 the thick rugs upon the polished wood floor the exquisite toilet table with its wealth of gold and tortoiseshell appurtenances 
956-157879-0034	train-other-500	Elizabeth herself so beautiful and gracious
none	none	 even a hurried contemplation of all these things took her breath away 
956-157879-0035	train-other-500	She felt suddenly acutely conscious of the poverty of her travelling clothes of her own insignificance Won t you sit down for a moment Elizabeth begged pointing to a chair by her side You and I must be friends you know for Philip s sake
none	none	 Beatrice recovered herself a little 
956-157879-0036	train-other-500	She sank into the blue satin chair with its ample cushions and looked down at Elizabeth with something very much like awe I am sure Philip must feel very grateful to you for having taken his play she declared
956-157879-0037	train-other-500	It has given him a fresh chance in life After all he has gone through Elizabeth said gently he certainly deserves it It is a wonderfully clever play you know don t blush mister Author
none	none	 I heard the story long ago Beatrice observed only of course it sounded very differently then and we never dreamed that it would really be produced Philip has told me about those days Elizabeth said I am afraid that you too have had your share of unhappiness Miss Wenderley I only hope that life in the future will make up to you something of what you have lost The girl s face hardened 
956-157879-0038	train-other-500	Her lips came together in familiar fashion I mean it to she declared I am going to make a start to morrow I wish Miss Dalstan you could get Philip to look at things a little more cheerfully He has been like a ghost ever since I arrived
956-157879-0039	train-other-500	Elizabeth turned and smiled at him sympathetically Your coming must have been rather a shock she reminded Beatrice
none	none	 You came with the idea did you not that you would find mister Douglas Romilly 
956-157879-0040	train-other-500	The girl nodded and glanced around for the maid who had disappeared however into an inner apartment They were always alike she confided the same figures
none	none	 same shaped head and that sort of thing Douglas was a little overfond of life though and Philip here hasn t found out yet what it means 
956-157879-0041	train-other-500	It was a shock though Miss Dalstan Philip was sitting in the dark when I arrived at his rooms
none	none	 this evening and I thought it was Douglas 
956-157879-0042	train-other-500	Elizabeth shivered a little Don t let us talk about it she begged You must come and see me won t you Miss Wenderley Philip will tell you where I live
none	none	 Are you going back to England at once I haven t made up my mind yet the girl replied with a slight frown 
956-157879-0043	train-other-500	It just depends Elizabeth glanced at the little clock upon her table and Philip threw away his cigarette and came forward We must go Beatrice he announced Miss Dalstan has to change her dress for this act He held out his hand and Elizabeth
956-157879-0044	train-other-500	rose lightly to her feet So far no word as to their two selves had passed their lips She smiled at him and all this sense of throbbing almost theatrical excitement subsided He was once more conscious of the beautiful things beyond
956-157879-0045	train-other-500	Once more he felt the rest of her presence You must let me see something of you tomorrow Philip she said Telephone will you Good night Miss Wenderley The maid who had just returned held the door open Philip glanced back over his shoulder
none	none	 Elizabeth blew him a kiss a gesture which curiously enough brought a frown to Beatrice s face CHAPTER XIV 
2301-157880-0000	train-other-500	The close of the performance left them both curiously tongue tied They waited until the theatre was half empty before they left their seats Then they joined the little throng of stragglers at the end
none	none	 Your play she murmured as they faced the soft night air I can t believe it even now We ve seen it together your play and this is New York That s a new ending isn t it Absolutely he confessed The ending was always what bothered me you know 
2301-157880-0001	train-other-500	She laughed not quite naturally She was unexpectedly impressed So you re a genius after all she went on Sometimes I wondered but never mind that now
none	none	 Philip do you know I am starving We took exactly ten minutes over dinner He led her to a huge restaurant a few doors away where they found a corner table 
2301-157880-0002	train-other-500	Up in the balcony an orchestra was playing light music and a little crowd of people were all the time streaming through the doors Beatrice settled herself down with an air of content
2301-157880-0003	train-other-500	Few of the people were in evening dress and the tone of the place was essentially democratic Philip who had learnt a little about American dishes gave an order
none	none	 and Beatrice sipped her cocktail with an air of growing appreciation Queer idea this but the stuff tastes all right she acknowledged I suppose if you were taking your dear Miss Dalstan out you d go to a different sort of place eh 
2301-157880-0004	train-other-500	We generally go further up town he admitted unthinkingly She set her glass down quickly So you do take her out do you she asked coldly
2301-157880-0005	train-other-500	You d have been with her to night perhaps if I hadn t been here Very likely She was half inclined to rally him behind it all a little annoyed You re a nice sort of person
none	none	 Why it s only a few months ago since you pretended to be in love with me He looked at her and her eyes fell before his I don t think there was ever much question of our being in love with one another was there We simply seemed to have drifted together because we were both miserable 
2301-157880-0006	train-other-500	and then as the time passed on well you came to be my only solace against the wretchedness of that life She nodded appreciatively
none	none	 For a moment the sights and sounds of the noisy restaurant passed from her consciousness Do you remember how glad I was to see you How we used to spend our holidays out in those dingy fields and hope and pray for better things some day 
2301-157880-0007	train-other-500	But it was all so hopeless wasn t it You could barely keep yourself from starving and I oh the misery of that awful Detton Magna and teaching those wretched children
none	none	 There never were such children in the world I couldn t get their mothers to send them clean They seemed to have inherited all the vice 
2301-157880-0008	train-other-500	the bad language the ugly sordidness with which the place reeked
none	none	 They were old men and women in wickedness before they passed their first standard 
2301-157880-0009	train-other-500	It s a corner of the world I never want to see again I d rather find hell Have you ordered any wine Philip I want to forget
none	none	 He pointed to the bottle which stood in the pail by their side 
2301-157880-0010	train-other-500	and summoned a waiter She watched it being opened and their glasses filled This is like one of our fairy stories of the old days isn t it she said Well I drink to you Philip
2301-157880-0011	train-other-500	Here s success to our new lives She raised her glass and drained it A woman had entered who reminded him of Elizabeth and his eyes had wandered away for a moment as Beatrice pledged him
none	none	 She called him back a little impatiently Don t sit there as though you were looking at ghosts Philip Try and remember who I am 
2301-157880-0012	train-other-500	and what we used to mean to one another Let us try and believe she added a little wistfully that one of those dreams of ours which we used to set floating like bubbles has come true
none	none	 We can wipe out all the memories we don t want That ought to be easy 
2301-157880-0013	train-other-500	Ought it he answered grimly There are times when I ve found it difficult enough She laughed and looked about her
2301-157880-0014	train-other-500	He realised suddenly that she was still very attractive with her rather insolent mouth her clear eyes her silky hair with the little fringe People as they passed paid her some attention
2301-157880-0015	train-other-500	and she was frankly curious about everybody Well she went on presently thank heavens I have plenty of will power I remember nothing
none	none	 absolutely nothing which happened before this evening 
2301-157880-0016	train-other-500	I am going to tell myself that an uncle in Australia has died and left me money and so we are here in New York to spend it To morrow I am going to begin I shall buy clothes
none	none	 all sorts of clothes 
2301-157880-0017	train-other-500	and hats You won t know me to morrow evening Philip His heart sank To morrow evening But Beatrice he expostulated
none	none	 you don t think of staying out here do you You don t know a soul 
2301-157880-0018	train-other-500	You haven t a friend in the city What friends have I in England she retorted Not
none	none	 one 
2301-157880-0019	train-other-500	I may just as well start a new life in a new country It seems bright enough here and
none	none	 gay I like it 
2301-157880-0020	train-other-500	I shall move to a different sort of hotel to morrow You must help me choose one And as to friends she whispered looking up at him with a little provocative gleam in her eyes don t you count
2301-157880-0021	train-other-500	Can t you do what I am going to do Philip Can t you draw down that curtain He shivered I can t he muttered A waiter brought their first course
2301-157880-0022	train-other-500	and she at once evinced interest in her food She returned to the subject however later on after she had drunk another glass of wine You re a silly old thing you know she declared
2301-157880-0023	train-other-500	You found the courage somehow to break away from that loathsome existence You had more courage even than I because you ran a risk I never did But here you are
2301-157880-0024	train-other-500	free with the whole world before you and your last danger disappearing with the knowledge that I am ready to be your friend and am sensible about everything that has happened
2301-157880-0025	train-other-500	This ought to be an immense relief to you Philip You ought to be the happiest man on earth And there you sit looking like a death s head
none	none	 Look at me for a moment like a human being can t you Drink some more wine There must be some strength some manhood about you somewhere or you couldn t have done what you have done He filled his glass mechanically She leaned across the table 
2301-157880-0026	train-other-500	Her eyes were bright her cheeks delicately pink
none	none	 Courage Philip she murmured Remember that what you did well in a way it was for my sake wasn t it for love of me I am here now and we are both free The old days are passed Even their shadow cannot trouble us any longer Don t be a sentimentalist Listen and I ll tell you something 
2301-157880-0027	train-other-500	at the bottom of my heart I rather admire you for what you did Don t you want your reward
none	none	 No he answered firmly I don t She shrugged her shoulders and kept time with her foot to the music Across the table although she kept silence for a while she smiled at him whenever she caught his eye She was not angry not even hurt Philip had always been so difficult but in the end so easily led She had unlimited confidence in herself 
2301-157880-0028	train-other-500	Don t be a goose she exclaimed at last Of course you want your reward and of course you ll have it some day You ve always lived with your head partly in the clouds
2301-157880-0029	train-other-500	and it s always been my task to pull you down to earth I suppose I shall have to do the same again but to night I haven t patience I feel suddenly gay You are so nice looking Philip
2301-157880-0030	train-other-500	but you d look ten times nicer still if you d only smile once or twice and look as though you were glad The whole thing was a nightmare to him The horror of it was in his blood
2301-157880-0031	train-other-500	yet he did his best to obey Plain speaking just then was impossible He drank glass after glass of wine and called for liqueurs She held his fingers for a moment under the table
none	none	 Oh Philip she whispered can t you forget that you have ever been a school teacher dear 
2301-157880-0032	train-other-500	We are only human and did suffer so You know she went on you were made for the things that are coming to us You ve improved already ever so much
none	none	 I like your clothes and the way you carry yourself But you look oh so sad and so far away all the time When I came to your rooms at my first glimpse of you I knew that you were miserable 
2301-157880-0033	train-other-500	We must alter all that dear Tell me how it is that with all your success you haven t been happy
none	none	 Memories 
2301-157880-0034	train-other-500	he answered harshly Only a few hours before you came I was in hell Then you had better make up your mind she told him firmly that you are going to climb up out of there
none	none	 and when you re out you re going to stay out 
2301-157880-0035	train-other-500	You can t alter the past You can t alter even the smallest detail of its setting Just as inevitably as our lives come and go so what has happened is finished with unchangeable
none	none	 It is only a weak person who would spoil the present and the future brooding You used not to be weak Philip I don t think that I am really he said 
2301-157880-0036	train-other-500	I am moody though and that s almost as bad
none	none	 The sight of you brought it all back And that fellow Dane I ve been frightened of him Beatrice Well you needn t be any longer she declared What you want is some one with you all the time who understands you some one to drive back those other thoughts when they come to worry you It is really a very good thing for you dear that I came out to New York 
2301-157880-0037	train-other-500	mister Dane is going to be very disappointed when I tell him that I never saw you before in my life Don t you love the music Listen to that waltz
2301-157880-0038	train-other-500	That was written for happy people Philip
none	none	 I adore this place I suppose we shall find others that we like better as time goes on but I shall always think of this evening It is the beginning of my task too Philip with you for you What has really happened dear 
2301-157880-0039	train-other-500	I can t realise anything I feel as though the gates of some great prison had been thrown wide open
none	none	 and everything there was to long for in life was just there 
2301-157880-0040	train-other-500	within reach waiting I am glad
none	none	 so much gladder than I should have imagined possible It s wonderful to have you again I didn t even feel that I missed you so much 
2301-157880-0041	train-other-500	but I know now what it was that made life so appalling Tell me am I still nice to look at Of course you are he assured her
2301-157880-0042	train-other-500	Can t you understand that by the way people notice you She strummed upon the table with her fingers Her whole body seemed to be moving to the music She nodded several times
2301-157880-0043	train-other-500	I don t want them to notice me Philip she murmured I want you to look just for a moment as though you thought me the only person in the world
2301-157880-0044	train-other-500	as you did once you know He did his best to be responsive
none	none	 but he was not wholly successful 
2301-157880-0045	train-other-500	Nevertheless she was tolerant with his shortcomings They sat there until nearly three o clock It was she at last who rose reluctantly to her feet
2301-157880-0046	train-other-500	I want to go whilst the memory of it all is wonderful she declared Come
none	none	 Here s a card with my address on Drive me home now please He paid his bill and they found a cab She linked her arm through his her head sank a little upon his shoulder He made no movement 
2301-157880-0047	train-other-500	She waited for a moment then she leaned back amongst the cushions Philip she asked quietly has this Elizabeth Dalstan been letting you make love to her
2301-157880-0048	train-other-500	Please don t speak of Miss Dalstan like that he begged Answer my question she insisted Miss Dalstan has been very kind to me he admitted slowly
none	none	 wonderfully kind If you really want to know I do care for her More than you did for me Very much more 
2301-157880-0049	train-other-500	he answered bravely and in a different fashion In the darkness of the cab it seemed to him that her face had grown whiter Her arm remained within his
2301-157880-0050	train-other-500	but it clasped him no longer Her body seemed to have become limp Even her voice firm though it was seemed pitched in a different key
none	none	 Listen she said You will have to forget Miss Dalstan I have made up my mind what I want in life and I am going to have it I shall draw my money to morrow morning and afterwards I shall come straight to your rooms 
2301-157880-0051	train-other-500	Then we will talk I want more than just that money I am lonely And do you know Philip I believe that I must have cared for you all the time
none	none	 and you you must have cared for me a little or you would never have done that for my sake You must and you shall care Philip because our time has come and I want you please 
2301-157880-0052	train-other-500	shall I have to say it dear I want you to marry me
none	none	 He wrenched himself free from her That is quite out of the question Beatrice he declared She laughed at him mockingly Oh don t say that Philip You might tempt me to be brutal You might tempt me to speak horribly plain words to you Speak them and have done with it he told her roughly I might find a few too I am past hurting she replied and I am not in the least afraid of anything you could say 
2301-157880-0053	train-other-500	You robbed me of the man who was bringing me to America who would have married me some day I suppose Well you must pay do you see and in my way
none	none	 I have told you the way I choose

none	none	 quite safe I ve come to take care of you You need it so badly Good night dear CHAPTER XV Late though it was when Philip reached his rooms he found on his writing table a message addressed to him from the telephone call office in the building He tore it open Kindly ring up Number five hundred fifty one Avenue immediately you return whatever the time He glanced at the clock hesitated and finally approaching the instrument called up Elizabeth s number For a few moments he waited The silence in the streets outside seemed somehow to have become communicated to the line the space between them emptied of all the jarring sounds of the day It was across a deep gulf of silence that he heard at last her voice Yes Is that you Philip I am here he answered I am sorry it is so late Have you only just come in This moment Has that girl kept you out till now she asked reprovingly I couldn t help it he replied It was her first night over here I took her to Churchill s for supper Is everything all right with her She doesn t mean to make trouble The unconscious irony of the question almost forced a smile to his lips I don t think so he answered She is thoroughly excited at the idea of possessing the money I believe she thought that Douglas would have drawn it all She is going straight to the bank early in the morning to get hold of it What about the man Dane He has gone to Chicago He won t be back for several days There was a moment s pause Have you anything to ask me she enquired Nothing I have had the most extraordinary letter from Sylvanus You and he have met Yes he admitted Philip we must make up our minds You mean that you must make up your mind he answered gently There was another silence Then she spoke a little abruptly I wonder whether you really love me Philip No don t please don t try to answer such a foolish question Go to bed and sleep well now You ve had a trying day Good night dear He had barely time to say good night before he heard the ring off He set down the receiver Somehow there was a sensation of relief in having been although indirectly in touch with her The idea of the letter from Sylvanus Power affected him only hazily The crowded events of the day had somehow or other dulled his power of concentrated thought He felt a curious sense of passivity He undressed without conscious effort closed his eyes and slept until he was awakened by the movements of the valet about the room Philip was still seated over his breakfast reading the paper and finishing his coffee when the door was thrown suddenly open and Beatrice entered tumultuously She laughed at his air of blank surprise You booby she exclaimed I couldn t help coming in to wish you good morning I have just discovered that my hotel is quite close by here Lucky isn t it except that I am going to move Good morning mister Serious Face she went on leaning towards him her hands behind her her lips held out invitingly He set down his paper kissed her on the cheek and looked inside the coffeepot Have you had your breakfast Hours ago I was too excited to sleep when I got to bed and yet I feel so well Philip where s Wall Street Won t you take me there He shook his head I am expecting a visitor and I have piles of work to do She made a grimace I know I shall be terrified when I march up to the counter of the bank and say I ve come for twenty thousand pounds You must transfer it to a current account he explained in your own name Have you any papers with you for identification I mean She nodded I ve thought of all that I ve a photograph and a passport and some letters It isn t that I m really afraid but I hate being alone and you look so nice Philip dear I always loved you in blue serge and I adore your eyeglass You really have been clever in the small things you have done to change your appearance Perhaps you are right not to come though she went on looking in the mirror These clothes are the best I could get at a minute s notice mister Dane was really quite nice but he hadn t the least idea how long it takes a woman to prepare for a journey Never mind you wait until I get back here this afternoon I am going round to all the shops and I am going to bring the clothes I buy away with me Then I am going to lock myself in my room and change everything I am going to have some of those funny little patent shoes and silk stockings and oh well all sorts of things you wouldn t understand about And do try and cheer up before I get back please Philip Twelve months ago you would have thought all this Paradise Oh I can t stop a moment longer she wound up throwing away the cigarette she had taken from the box and lit I m off now And Philip don t you dare to go out of these rooms until I come back She turned towards the door she was half way there in fact when they were both aware of a ring at the bell She stopped short and looked around enquiringly Who s that she whispered Philip glanced at the clock It was too early for Elizabeth No idea he answered Come in The door opened and closed Philip sat as though turned to stone Beatrice remained in the middle of the room her fingers clasping the back of a chair mister Dane hat in hand had entered Good morning Miss Wenderley he said Good morning mister Ware Philip said nothing He had a horrible feeling that this was some trap Beatrice at first could only stare at the unexpected visitor His sudden appearance had disconcerted her I thought you were in Chicago mister Dane she exclaimed at last My plans were altered at the last moment he told her No I won t sit down thanks he added waving away the chair towards which Philip had pointed As a matter of fact I haven t been out of New York I decided to wait and hear your news Miss Wenderley Well you re going to be disappointed then she said bluntly I haven t any mister Dane was politely incredulous He was also a little stern You mean he protested that you cannot identify this gentleman that you don t recognise him as mister Douglas Romilly I cannot identify him she repeated He is not mister Douglas Romilly I have brought you all this way then to confront you with a stranger Absolutely she insisted It wasn t my fault I didn t want to come mister Dane s expression suddenly changed His hard knuckles were pressed upon the table he leaned forward towards her Even his tone was altered His blandness had all vanished his grey eyes were as hard as steel A stranger he exclaimed derisively Yet you come here to his rooms early in the evening you stay here you go to the theatre with him the same night you go on to supper at Churchill s and stay there till three o clock in the morning you are here with him again at nine o clock at breakfast time A stranger Miss Wenderley Think again A story like this might do for Scotland Yard It won t do for us out here She knew at once that she had fallen into a trap but she was not wholly dismayed The position was one which they had half anticipated She told herself that he was bluffing that it was simply the outburst of a disappointed man On the whole she behaved extraordinarily well You brought me out here she said to confront me with this man to identify him if I could as mister Douglas Romilly Well he isn t mister Douglas Romilly and that s all there is about it As to my going out with him last evening I can t see that that s any concern of any one He was kind to me cheered me up when he saw that I was disappointed I told him my whole story and that I didn t know a soul in New York and we became friends That s all there is about it That so the detective observed with quiet sarcasm You seem to have a knack of making friends pretty easily Miss Wenderley It is not your business if I have she snapped Well we ll pass that then he conceded I haven t quite finished with you yet though There are just one or two more points I am going to put before you and this gentleman who is not mister Douglas Romilly he added with a little bow to Philip The first is this There is one fact which we can all three take for granted because I know it I can prove it a hundred times over and you both know it and that is that the mister Merton Ware of to day travelled from Liverpool on the Elletania as mister Douglas Romilly occupied a room at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel as mister Douglas Romilly and absconded from there leaving his luggage and his identity behind him to blossom out in an attic of the Monmouth tenement house as mister Merton Ware a young writer of plays Now I don t think mister Dane went on leaning a little further over the table that the mister Douglas Romilly who has disappeared was ever capable of writing a play I don t think he was a man of talent at all I don t think he could have written for instance The House of Shams Let us however leave the subject of Douglas Romilly for a moment Let us go a little further back to Detton Magna let us say Curiously enough there was another young man who disappeared from that little Derbyshire village about the same time who has never been heard of since His name too was Romilly I gathered during the course of my recent enquiries that he was a poor relation a cousin of mister Douglas Romilly He was drowned in the canal Beatrice faltered His body has been found A body has been found mister Dane corrected but it was in an unrecognisable state It has been presumed to be the body of Philip Romilly the poor relation a starving young art teacher in London with literary aspirations but I hold that that presumption is a mistake I believe the detective went on his eyes fastened upon Philip his voice a little raised that it was the body of Douglas Romilly the shoe manufacturer which was fished out from the canal and that you sir are mister Philip Romilly late art school teacher of Kensington who murdered Douglas Romilly on the banks of the canal stole his money and pocketbook assumed his identity in Liverpool and on the Elletania and became what you are now mister Merton Ware Philip threw away the cigarette which he had been smoking and leaning over the box carefully selected another He tapped it against the table and lit it mister Dane he said coolly I shall always be grateful to you for your visit this morning for you have given me what is the most difficult thing in the whole world to stumble up against an excellent idea for a new play Apart from that you seem for so intelligent a man to have wasted a good deal of your time and to have come what we should call in English a cropper I will take you into my confidence so far as to admit that I am not particularly anxious to disclose my private history but if ever the necessity should arise I shall do so without hesitation Until that time comes you must forgive me if I choose to preserve a certain reticence as to my antecedents mister Dane in the moment s breathless silence which followed acknowledged to himself the perpetration of a rare mistake He had selected Philip to bear the brunt of his attack believing him to be possessed of the weaker nerve Beatrice who at the end of his last speech had sunk into a chair white and terrified an easy victim had rallied now inspired by Philip s composure You deny then that you are mister Philip Romilly the detective asked I never heard of the fellow in my life Philip replied pleasantly but don t go mister Dane You can t imagine how interesting this is to me You have sent me a most charming acquaintance he added bowing to Beatrice and you have provided me with what I can assure you is almost pathetically scarce in these days a new and very dramatic idea Take a seat won t you and chat with us a little longer Tell us how you came to think of all this I have always held that the workings of a criminologist s brain must be one of the most interesting studies in life mister Dane smiled enigmatically Ah he protested you mustn t ask me to disclose all my secrets You wouldn t care to tell us a little about your future intentions Philip enquired mister Dane shook his head It is very kind of you mister Merton Ware he confessed to let me down so gently We all make mistakes of course As to my future intentions well I am not quite sure about them You see this isn t really my job at all It isn t up to me to hunt out English criminals so long as they behave themselves in this city If an extradition order or anything of that sort came my way it would of course be different Why not lay this interesting theory of yours before the authorities at Scotland Yard Philip suggested I am sure they would listen with immense interest to any report from you That s some idea certainly the detective admitted taking up his hat from the table For the present I ll wish you both good morning or shall I say an revoir We may look for the pleasure of another visit from you then Philip enquired politely The detective faced them from the doorway Sir he said to Philip I admire your nerve and I admire the nerve of your old sweetheart Miss Wenderley I am afraid I cannot promise you however that this will be my last visit The door closed behind him They heard the shrill summons of the bell the arrival of the lift the clanging of the iron gate and its subsequent descent Then Beatrice turned her head Philip was still smoking serenely standing with his back to the mantelpiece his hands in his pockets She rose and threw her arms around him Philip she cried Why you are wonderful You are marvellous You make me ashamed It was only for a moment that I lost my nerve and you saved us Oh what idiots we were Of course he meant to watch that s why he told me he was going to Chicago The beast He seems to have got hold of the idea all right doesn t he Philip muttered Pooh she exclaimed encouragingly I know a little about the law so do you He hasn t any proof he never can have any proof No one will ever be able to swear that the body which they picked out of the canal was the body of Douglas Romilly There wasn t a soul who saw you do it I am the only person in the world who could supply the motive and I I shall never be any use to them Don t you see Philip I shall be your wife A wife can t give evidence against her husband You ll be safe dear quite safe He withdrew a little from her embrace Beatrice he reminded her there is another tragedy beyond the one with which Dane threatens us I do not wish to marry you She suddenly blazed up Because Not because of any reason in the world he interrupted except that I love Elizabeth Dalstan Does she want to marry you He was suddenly an altered person Some of his confidence seemed to desert him He shook his head doubtfully I am not sure Sometimes I think that she would Sometimes I fancy that it is only a great kindness of heart an immense sympathy a kind of protective sympathy which has made her so good to me She looked at herself steadily for a moment in the mirror Then she pulled down her veil Philip she said we find out the truth when we are up against things like this I used to think I could live alone I can t Whatever you may think of me I was fond of Douglas It wasn t only for the sake of the money and the comfort He was kind and in his way he understood And then you know misery didn t agree with you You were often even in those few hours we spent together very hard and cold Anyway she added with a little tightening of the lips I am going to get my money now No one can stop that You stay here and think it over It would be better to marry me Philip and be safe than to have the fear of that man Dane always before you And wait wait till you see me when I come back she went on her spirits rapidly rising as she moved towards the door You ll change your mind then Philip You were always so impressionable weren t you A little touch of colour the perfume of flowers a single soft word spoken at the right moment anything that took your fancy made such a difference Well just wait till I come back She closed the door Philip heard her descend in the lift He moved to the window and watched for her on the pavement She appeared there in a moment or two and waited whilst the boy whistled for a taxicab her face expectantly upraised one hand resting lightly on her bosom just over the spot where her pocketbook lay CHAPTER XVI Philip was still gazing into vacancy and smoking cigarettes when Elizabeth arrived She seemed conscious at once of the disturbed atmosphere His hands which she held firmly in hers were as cold as ice Is that girl going to be troublesome she demanded anxiously Not in the way we feared he replied All the same the plot has thickened so far as I am concerned That fellow Dane has been here Go on she begged He laid a trap for us and we fell into it like the veriest simpletons He let Beatrice think that he had gone to Chicago Of course he did nothing of the sort He turned her loose to come to me and he had us watched He knew that we spent last evening together as old friends She was here in my rooms this morning when he arrived Oh Philip Philip she murmured Well what does he suspect The truth He accused me to my face of being Philip Romilly Beatrice did her best but you see the position was a little absurd She denied strenuously that she had ever seen me before that I was anything but a stranger to her In the face of last evening and his finding her here this morning it didn t sound convincing What is Dane going to do Heaven knows It isn t his affair really If there were any charge against me well you see there d have to be an extradition order I should think he will probably lay the facts before Scotland Yard and let them do what they choose She made him sit down and drew a low chair herself to his side She held his hand in hers Philip she said soothingly they can t possibly prove anything They can prove he pointed out that I was in Detton Magna that afternoon I don t think any one except Beatrice saw me start along the canal path but they can prove that I knew all about Douglas Romilly s disappearance because I travelled to America under his name and with his ticket and deliberately personated him They can prove all that she agreed but they can t prove the crime itself Beatrice is the only person who could do that She proposes to marry me he announced grimly That would prevent her giving evidence at all Elizabeth suddenly threw her arms around his neck and held her cheek to his She shan t marry you she declared I want you myself Elizabeth Yes I have made up my mind Philip It is no use The other things are fascinating and splendid in their way but they don t count they don t last They re tinsel dear and I don t want tinsel I want the gold We ll face this bravely wherever it leads however far however deep down and then we ll start again You know what this means Elizabeth he faltered That man Power She brushed the thought away I know He ll close the theatre He ll do all he can to harm us That doesn t matter The play is ours That s worth a fortune And the new one coming why it s wonderful Philip We don t want wealth Your brain and my art can win us all that we desire in life We shall have something sweeter than anything which Sylvanus Power s millions could buy We shall have our love your love for me dear and mine for you He felt her tears upon his cheek her lips pressed to his He held her there but although his heart was beating with renewed hope he said nothing for a time When she stepped back to look at his face however the change was already there You are glad Philip she cried You are happy I can see it You didn t ever care really for that girl did you He almost laughed Not like this he answered confidently I never even for a single moment pretended to care in a great way We were just companions in misfortune The madness that came over me that day had been growing in my brain for years I hated Douglas Romilly I had every reason to hate him And then after all he had robbed me of my one companion She stopped him I know I know she murmured You need never try to explain anything to me I know everything I understand I sympathise A revulsion of feeling had suddenly chilled him He held her to him none the less tightly but there was a ring of despair in his tone Elizabeth think what it may mean he muttered How can I drag you through it all A trial perhaps the suspense and all the time that guilty knowledge behind yours and mine Pooh she exclaimed lightly I am not a sentimentalist I am a woman in love But Elizabeth I am guilty he groaned That s the horror of it I d take the risk if I were an innocent man I d risk everything But I am afraid to stand there and know that every word they say against me will be true and every word of the men who speak in my defence will be false Can t you realise the black abominable horror of it I couldn t drag you into such a plight Elizabeth I was weak to think of it I couldn t You ll drag me nowhere she answered holding him tightly Where I go my feet will lead me and my love for you You can t help that We ll play the game play it magnificently Philip My faith in you will count for something But dear he protested don t you see If the case ever comes into court even if I get off every one will know that it is through a technicality The evidence is too strong Half the world at least will believe me guilty It shan t come into court she proclaimed confidently I shall talk to Dane I have some influence with the police authorities here I shall point out how ridiculous it all is What s the use of formulating a charge that they can never never prove Unless he reminded her hesitatingly Beatrice Beatrice You re not afraid of her I am afraid of no one or anything he declared when you are here But Beatrice has been behaving strangely ever since she arrived She has a sudden fancy for remembering that in a sense we were once engaged Beatrice Elizabeth announced must be satisfied with her twenty thousand pounds I know what you are trying to say she wants you She shan t have you Philip We ll find her some one else We ll be kind to her I don t mind that Very soon we ll find her plenty of friends But as for you Philip well she just shan t have you and that s all there is about it He took her suddenly into his arms In that moment he was the lover she had craved for strong passionate and reckless All the love that my heart has ever known he cried is yours Elizabeth Every thought and every hope is yours You are my life You saved me you made me what I am The play is yours my brain is yours there isn t a thought or a dream or a wish that isn t for you of you yours He kissed her as he had never dreamed of kissing any woman It was the one supreme moment of their life and their love Time passed uncounted Then interruption came suddenly and tragically Without knock or ring the door was flung open and slammed again Beatrice stood there still in her shabby clothes her veil pushed back gloveless and breathless Her clenched hand flew out towards Philip as though she would have struck him You liar she shrieked You ve had my money You ve spent it You ve stolen it Thief Murderer She paused struggling for breath tore her hat from her head and threw it on the table Her face was like the face of a virago her eyes blazed her cheeks were as pale as death save for one hectic spot of colour You are talking nonsense Beatrice he expostulated Don t lie to me she shouted You can lie in the dock when you stand there and tell them you never murdered Douglas Romilly That makes you cringe doesn t it I don t want to make a scene but the woman you re in love with had better hear what I have to say Are you going to give me back my money Philip As I stand here he declared solemnly I have not touched that money or been near the bank where it was deposited I swear it Every penny I have spent since I moved into this apartment I have spent from my earnings My own royalties come to over a hundred pounds a week more than sufficient to keep me in luxury I never meant to touch that money I have not touched it His words carried conviction with them She stood there for several seconds absolutely rigid her eyes growing larger and rounder her lips a little parted Bewilderment was now struggling with her passion Who in God s name then she asked hoarsely could have known about the money and forged his signature I tell you that I ve seen it with my own eyes a few minutes ago in the bank They showed me into a little cupboard a place without any roof and laid it there before me on the desk his cheque and signature for the whole amount Philip looked at her earnestly oppressed by a sense of coming trouble Beatrice he said I wouldn t deceive you I should be a fool to try shouldn t I I can only repeat what I have said I have never been near the bank I have never touched that money She shivered a little where she stood It was obvious that she was convinced but her sense of personal injustice remained unabated Then there is some one else she declared who knows everything some one else my man she added leaning across the table and shaking her head with a sudden fierceness who can step into the witness box and tell the truth about you You must find out who it is You must find out who has stolen that money and get it back I tell you I won t have everything snatched away from me like this she cried her voice breaking hysterically I won t be robbed of life and happiness and everything that counts I want my money Are you going to get it back for me Beatrice don t be absurd he protested You know very well that I can t do that I am not in a position to go about making enquiries I shall be watched from now day and night if nothing worse happens A single step on my part in that direction would mean disaster Then take me straight to the town hall or the registry office or wherever you go here and marry me she demanded A hundred pounds a week royalty eh Well that s good enough I ll marry you Philip do you hear at once That ll save your skin if it won t get me back my twenty thousand pounds You needn t flatter yourself overmuch either I d rather have had Douglas He s more of a man than you after all You are too self conscious You think about yourself too much You re too intellectual too I don t want those things I want to live Any way you ve got to marry me to day Now give me some money do you hear He took out his pocketbook and threw it towards her She smoothed out the wad of notes which it contained and counted them with glistening eyes Well there s enough here for a start she decided slipping them into her bosom No one shall rob me of these before I get to the shops Better come with me Philip I m not going to leave you alone with her Elizabeth would have intervened but Philip laid his hand upon her arm Beatrice he said sternly you are a little beside yourself Listen I don t understand what has happened I must think about it Apparently that twenty thousand pounds has gone but so far as regards money I recognise your claim You shall have half my earnings I ll write more I ll make it up somehow But for the rest this morning has cleared away many misunderstandings Let this be the last word Miss Dalstan has promised to be my wife She is the only woman I could ever love Then you ll have to marry me without loving me Beatrice declared thickly I won t be left alone in this beastly city I want some one to take care of me I am getting frightened It s uncanny horrible I oh I am so miserable so miserable She sank into a chair and fell forward across the table sobbing hysterically I hate every one she moaned Philip why can t you be kind to me Why doesn t some one care CHAPTER XVII And after all nothing happened Dane s barely veiled threats seemed to vanish like the man himself into thin air Beatrice after the breakdown of her one passionate outburst had become wonderfully meek and tractable Sylvanus Power who had received from Elizabeth the message for which he had waited showed no sign either of disappointment or anger After the storm which had seemed to be breaking in upon him from every quarter the days which followed possessed for Philip almost the calm of an Indian summer He had found something in life at last stronger than his turbulent fears His whole nature was engrossed by one great atmosphere of deep and wonderful affection He spent a part of every day with Elizabeth and the remainder of his time was completely engrossed by the work over which she too the presiding genius pored eagerly Together they humoured many of Beatrice s whims treating her very much as an unexpected protegee a position with which she seemed entirely content She made friends with the utmost facility She wore new clothes with frank and obvious joy She preened herself before the looking glass of life developed a capacity for living and enjoying herself which under the circumstances was nothing less than remarkable And then came the climax of Philip s new found happiness His earnest protests had long since been overruled and certainly no one could have accused him of posing for a single moment as the reluctant bridegroom The happiness which shone from their two faces seemed to brighten the strangely unecclesiastical looking apartment in which a cheerful and exceedingly pleasant looking American divine completed the formalities of their marriage It was a queer little company who hurried back to Elizabeth s room for tea Elizabeth and Philip themselves and Martha Grimes and Beatrice sharing the attentions of Noel Bridges For an event of such stupendous importance it was amazing how perfectly matter of fact the two persons chiefly concerned were There was only one moment just before they started for the theatre when Elizabeth betrayed the slightest signs of uneasiness I sent a telegram Philip she said to Sylvanus Power I thought I had better This is his answer Philip read the few typewritten words on the little slip of paper You will hear from me within twenty four hours Philip frowned a little as he handed it back It was dated from Washington I think Elizabeth faltered he might have sent his good wishes at any rate Philip laughed confidently We have nothing to fear he declared confidently from Sylvanus Power Nor from any one else in the world Elizabeth murmured fervently Then followed the wonderful evening Philip found Beatrice alone in the stage box when he returned from taking Elizabeth to her dressing room Where s Martha he asked Faithless Beatrice replied She is in the stalls down there with a young man from the box office She said you d understand A serious affair Philip ventured Beatrice nodded They are engaged I had tea with them yesterday We shall have to do something for you Beatrice soon he remarked cheerfully A very rare gravity settled for a moment upon her face I wonder Philip she said simply I thought a little time ago it would be easy enough to care for the right sort of person Perhaps I am not really quite so rotten as I thought I was Here comes Elizabeth Let s watch her They both leaned a little forward in the box Philip in a state of beatific wonder which turned soon to amazement when at Elizabeth s first appearance the house suddenly rose and a torrent of applause broke out from the floor to the ceiling Elizabeth for a moment seemed dumbfounded The fact that the news of what had happened that afternoon could so soon have become public property had not occurred to either her or Philip Then a sudden smile of comprehension broke across her face With understanding however came a momentary embarrassment She looked a little pathetically at the great audience then laughed and glanced at Philip seated now well back in the box Many of them followed her gaze and the applause broke out again Then there was silence She paused before she spoke the first words of her part Thank you so much she said quietly It was a queer little episode Beatrice gripped Philip s hand as she drew her chair back to his There were tears in her eyes How they love her these people And fancy their knowing about it Philip already You ought to have shown yourself as the happy bridegroom They were all looking up here I wonder why men are so shy I m glad I have my new frock on Fancy being married only a few hours ago Tell me how you are feeling can t you Philip You sit there looking like a sphinx You are happy aren t you Happier I think than any man has a right to be he answered his eyes watching Elizabeth s every movement As the play proceeded his silence only deepened He went behind at the end of each act and spent a few stolen moments with Elizabeth Life was a marvellous thing indeed Every pulse and nerve in his body was tingling with happiness And yet as he lingered for a moment in the vestibule of the theatre before going back to his box at the commencement of the last act he felt once more that terrible wave of depression the ghostly uprising of his old terrors even in this supreme moment He looked down from the panorama of flaring sky signs into the faces of the passers by along the crowded pavement He had a sudden fancy that Dane was there watching His heart beat fiercely as he stood almost transfixed scanning eagerly every strange face Then the bell rang behind him He set his teeth and turned away In less than half an hour the play would be over They would be on their way home He found the box door open and the box itself to his surprise empty There was no sign anywhere of Beatrice He waited for a little time Then he rang the bell for the attendant but could hear no news of her His uneasiness increased as the curtain at last fell and she had not returned He hurried round to the back but Elizabeth when he told her only smiled Why there s nothing to worry about dear she said Beatrice can take care of herself Perhaps she thought it more tactful to hurry on home tonight She is really just as kind hearted as she can be you know Philip underneath all that pent up passionate desire for just a small share of the good things of life She has wasted so much of herself in longings Poor child I sometimes wonder that she is as level headed as she seems to be Now I am ready They passed down the corridor amidst a little chorus of good nights and stepped into the automobile which was waiting As it glided off she suddenly came closer to him Philip she whispered it s true isn t it Put your arms around me You are driving me home say it s true Elizabeth sat up presently a little dazed Her fingers were still gripping Philip s almost fiercely The automobile had stopped I haven t the least idea where we are she murmured And I forgot to tell you he laughed as he helped her out I took the suite below mine by the week There are two or three rooms and an extra one for Beatrice Of course it s small but then with this London idea before us Such extravagance she interrupted Your own rooms would have done quite nicely only it is a luxury to have a place for Phoebe I hope Beatrice won t have gone to bed I am sure she won t he replied She has done all the arranging for me she and Phoebe together They crossed the pavement and entered the lift The attendant grinned broadly as he stopped at the eighth floor and held out his hand for the tip for which Philip had been fumbling The door of the suite was opened before they could reach the bell Elizabeth s maid Phoebe came forward to take her mistress cloak and the floor valet was there to relieve Philip of his overcoat A waiter was hovering in the background Supper is served in the dining room sir he announced Shall I open the wine Philip nodded and showed Elizabeth over the little flat finally ushering her into the small round dining room It s perfectly delightful she declared but we don t need nearly so much room Philip What a dear little dining table and what a delicious supper Everything I like best in the world from pate de foie gras to cold asparagus You are a dear The waiter disappeared with a little bow They were alone at last She held his hands tightly She was trembling The forced composure of the last few minutes seemed to have left her I am silly she faltered but the servants and everything they won t come back will they He laughed as he patted her hand We shan t see another soul dear he assured her She laid her cheek against his How hot your face feels she exclaimed Throw open the window do I shan t feel it He obeyed her at once The roar of the city all its harshness muffled came to them in a sombre almost melodious undernote She rested her hands upon his shoulder What children we are she murmured Now it s you who are trembling Sit down please You ve been so brave these last few days It was just for a moment he told her It seems too wonderful I had a sudden impulse of terror lest it should all be snatched away She laughed easily I don t think there s any fear of that dear she said Perhaps There was a little knock at the door Philip who had been holding Elizabeth s chair stood as though transfixed Elizabeth gripped at the side of the table It was some few seconds before either of them spoke It s perhaps Beatrice Elizabeth faltered The knock was repeated Philip drew a little breath Come in he invited The door opened slowly towards them and closed again It was mister Dane who had entered From outside they caught a momentary glimpse of another man waiting mister Dane took off his hat For a man with so expressionless a countenance he was looking considerably perturbed Miss Dalstan he said I am very sorry believe me to intrude I only heard of your marriage an hour ago I wish I could have prevented it Prevented it Elizabeth repeated What do you mean I think that mister Philip Romilly could explain Dane continued turning towards Philip I am sorry but I have received an imperative cable from Scotland Yard and it is my duty to arrest you Philip Romilly and to hold you pending the arrival of a special police mission from England I am bound to take note of anything you may say so I beg of you not to ask me any particulars as to the charge The colour slowly faded from Elizabeth s cheeks She had risen to her feet and was gripping the mantelpiece for support Philip however was perfectly calm He poured out a glass of water and held it to her lips Drink this dear he begged and don t be alarmed It sounds very terrible but believe me there is nothing to be feared He swung suddenly round to Dane His voice shook with passion You ve kept me under observation he cried all this time I haven t attempted to escape I haven t moved from New York I haven t the slightest intention of doing so until this thing is cleared up Can t you take my parole Can t you leave me alone until they come from England mister Dane shook his head slowly He was a hard man but there was an unaccustomed look of distress in his face Sorry mister Romilly he said regretfully I did suggest something of the sort but they wouldn t hear of it at headquarters If we let you slip through our fingers we should never hear the last of it from London Then there came another and a still more unexpected interruption From outside they heard Beatrice s voice raised in excitement mister Dane stood on one side as the door was thrown open Beatrice suddenly flung herself into the room dragging after her a man who was almost breathless I say Beatrice steady the latter began good naturedly There followed the most wonderful silence in the world a silence which was filled with throbbing indescribable emotions a silence which meant something different for every one of them Beatrice gripping her captive by the wrist was looking around striving to understand Elizabeth was filled with blank wonder mister Dane was puzzled But Philip who a moment before had seemed perfectly composed was the one who seemed torn by indescribable by horrible emotions He was livid almost to the lips His hands were stretched out as though to keep from him some awful and ghastly vision His eyes filled with the anguished light of supreme terror were fastened upon the newcomer His lips shook as he tried to speak Take him away he shrieked Oh my God Beatrice more coherent than any of them scoffed at him Don t be a fool she cried Take him away indeed He s the most wonderful thing that ever happened He s the one man in life you want to see So you ve come for him eh she went on turning almost like a wild cat on Dane You beast You chose to night did you Now get on with it then and I ll give you the surprise of your life What are you here for I am here to arrest that man Philip Romilly for the murder of his cousin Douglas Romilly Miss Wenderley Dane announced gravely I am sorry Beatrice threw her head back and laughed hysterically You ll never write a play like it Philip she exclaimed There never was anything like it before Now mister Dane what is it you say in America when you want to introduce anybody shake hands with mister Douglas Romilly that s it Shake hands with the dead man here and then get on with your arresting He must be dead if you say so but he doesn t look it does he Philip s face had become a more natural colour His eyes had never left the other man s He swayed a little on his feet and his voice seemed to him to come from a long way off Douglas It isn t you Douglas It isn t you really I wish you d all leave off staring at me as though I were a ghost the other man answered almost pettishly I m Douglas Romilly right enough You needn t look in such a blue funk Philip he went on his fingers mechanically rearranging his collar and tie which Beatrice had disarranged I served you a beastly trick and you went for me I should have done the same if I d been in your place On the other hand I rather turned the tables on you by keeping quiet Perhaps it s up to me to explain Elizabeth feeling her way by the mantelpiece came to Philip s side His arm supported her holding her as though in a vise Is that your cousin she whispered hoarsely Is that Douglas Romilly Is he alive after all Philip had no words but his face spoke for him Then they both turned to listen The newcomer had dragged a chair towards him and was leaning over the back of it He addressed Philip We met as you know on the canal path that beastly afternoon he began I was jolly well ashamed of myself for having made love to Beatrice and all the rest of it and you were mad with rage We had a sort of tussle and you threw me into the canal It was a nasty dark spot just underneath the bridge I expect I was stunned for a moment but it was only for a moment I came to long before I choked and when I remembered your grip upon my throat I decided I was safer where I was I could swim like a duck you know and though it was filthy water I took a long dive When I came up again gad what disgusting water it was you were tearing off like a creature possessed That s the true history of our little fracas But afterwards Philip asked wonderingly What happened afterwards You just tell them all about it Beatrice ordered him sternly Go on Douglas Well you see Douglas Romilly continued I was just going to scramble out on to the bank when my brain began to work and I swam slowly along instead You see just then I was in a devil of a mess I d spent a lot of money and though I d kept the credit of the firm good I knew that the business was bust and the one thing I was anxious about was to get off to America without being stopped I ve explained this all to Beatrice and why I didn t send for her before Anyway I swam along until I met with an old barge I climbed in and got two of the choicest blackguards you ever saw to let me spend an hour or two in their filthy cabin and to keep their mouths closed about it Fortunately I had another pocketbook with sufficient to satisfy them and keep me going Then I borrowed some clothes and came out to America steerage I had no difficulty in getting my money as I had a couple of pals in Lynn whom I had fixed things up with before I started They came and identified me as Merton Ware and we all three started in business together as the Ford Boot and Shoe Manufacturing Company at Lynn in Massachusetts Incidentally we ve done all right Heaps more of course but that s the pith of it As for the body that was fished out of the canal if you make enquiries you ll find there was a tramp missing a month or so before Elizabeth had begun to sob quietly Philip who was holding her tenderly in his arms whispered unheard things into her ears It was Beatrice who remained in charge of the situation So now mister Dane she jeered what about your little errand I hope this will be a lesson to you not to come meddling in other people s affairs Dane turned to the man who had brought this bombshell into their midst Do you swear that you are Douglas Romilly he asked I not only swear it but I can prove it if you ll come along with me to Murray s he answered My partner s there waiting supper and another man who has known me all his life The detective glanced interrogatively towards Philip That is my cousin Douglas Romilly the latter pronounced Dane took up his hat mister Merton Ware he said or mister Philip Romilly whichever you may in future elect to call yourself you may not believe it but the end of this affairs is an immense relief to me I offer you my heartiest congratulations You need fear no more annoyance Good night He passed out They heard the sound of his footsteps and his companion s as they crossed the corridor and rang for the lift Speech was a little difficult It was still Beatrice who imposed conviction upon them I was seated in the box she explained when Philip went round to see you Elizabeth I had looking down into the stalls to find Martha and all of a sudden I saw Douglas there He too was staring at me Of course I thought it was some extraordinary likeness but whilst I was clutching at the curtain he stood up and waved his hand You should have seen me tear from the box You know ever since they showed me that signature at the bank I have had a queer idea at the back of my head Luckily for him she went patting his arm he sent home for me a fortnight ago and sent a draft for my expenses out You won t mind will you if I take him off now she concluded turning to Elizabeth They are waiting supper for us but I wasn t going to let Philip Did you know that Dane was going to be here Elizabeth asked Not an idea Beatrice declared I simply dragged Douglas along here as soon as we d talked things out because I knew that it would be the one thing wanting to complete Philip s happiness We ll leave you now Douglas will bring me back and we are going to be married in a few days Philip held out his hand a little diffidently You wouldn t My dear fellow Douglas interrupted grasping it wouldn t I I m thundering sorry for all you ve been through I suppose I ought to have let you know that I was still in the land of the living but I was waiting until things blew over in England That s all right now though he went on I ve turned over a new leaf and I am making money making it after a style they don t understand in England I am going to pay my creditors twenty shillings in the pound before a couple of years have gone and do pretty well for Beatrice and myself as well You wouldn t care I suppose he added as they stood there with locked hands to offer us just a glass of wine before we start out Beatrice has been riddling me with questions and dragging me through the streets till I scarcely know whether I am on my head or my heels Philip emptied the contents of the champagne bottle into the glasses Never was wine poured out more gladly Douglas he explained this is Miss Elizabeth Dalstan whom you saw act this evening We were married this afternoon You can understand can t you just what your coming has meant for us Douglas shook Elizabeth by the hand Then he held up his glass Here s the best of luck to you both he said heartily Very soon Beatrice and I will ask you to wish us the same Philip old chap he added as he set his glass down and without the slightest protest watched it replenished that s a thundering good play of yours I ve seen this evening but you ll never write one to beat this Soon Beatrice and Douglas also took their departure Elizabeth held out her arms almost as the door closed The tear stains were still on her cheeks Her lips quivered a little but her voice was clear and sweet and passionate Philip she cried it s all over it s all finished with the dread the awful days I am not going to be hysterical any more and you you are just going to remember that we have everything we want in the world Sit down opposite to me if you please and fill my glass I have only one emotion left I am hungry desperately hungry Move your chair nearer so that I can reach your hand There Now you and I will drink our little toast It was an hour before they thought of leaving the table A very perplexed waiter brought them coffee and watched them light cigarettes Then the telephone bell rang They both stared at the instrument Philip would have taken off the receiver but Elizabeth held out her hand I have an idea she said I believe it is from Sylvanus Power Let me answer it She held the receiver to her ear and listened Yes she murmured Yes At what time Her face grew more puzzled She listened for a moment longer But Sylvanus she expostulated what do you mean Sylvanus mister Power The telephone had become a dumb thing She replaced the receiver I don t understand she told Philip All that he said was You will receive my present at five o clock this morning Does he think we are going to sit up for it Philip asked He is the strangest man she sighed After all some queer fancy awoke Philip at a little before five that morning and drew him to the window He sat looking out over the still sleeping city All sound now was hushed It was the brief breathing space before the dawn In the clear morning spring light the buildings of the city seemed to stand out with a new and marvellous distinctness Now and then from the harbour came the shriek of a siren A few pale lights were still burning along the river way From one of the city clocks the hour was slowly tolled Philip counted the strokes one two three four five Then almost as he was preparing to leave his post there came a terrific roar The window against which he leaned shook Some of the buildings in the distance trembled One with its familiar white cupola seemed for a moment to be lifted from the ground and then split through by some unseen hand The roar of the explosion was followed by the crashing of falling masonry Long fingers of fire suddenly leapt up into the quiet cool air Fragments of masonry a portion even of that wonderful cupola came crashing down into the street He heard Elizabeth s voice behind him felt her fingers upon his shoulder What is it Philip what is it He pointed with steady finger The truth seemed to come to him by inspiration It is Sylvanus Power s message to you he replied The theatre There were flames now leaping up to the sky Together they watched them and listened to the shrieking of sirens and whistles as the fire engines galloped by from every section of the city There was a strange look in Elizabeth s face as she watched the curling flames Philip she whispered thank God There it goes all his great offering to me It s like the man and his motto A man may do what he will with his own Only last night I felt as though I would give anything in the world never to stand upon the stage of that theatre again He doesn t know it Philip but his is a precious gift He passed his arm around her and drew her from the window A man may do what he will with his own he repeated Well it isn t such a bad motto Sylvanus Power may destroy a million dollar theatre for a whim but so far as you and I are concerned She sighed with content We do both need a holiday she murmured Somewhere in Europe I think THE END End of Project Gutenberg s The Cinema Murder by E Phillips Oppenheim END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CINEMA MURDER This file should be

confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web
