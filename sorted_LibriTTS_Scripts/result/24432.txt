that Russell did he did his best to hasten And one day he decided that he d like to be a Mason But nothing else would suit him and nothing less would please But he must take and all at once the thirty three degrees So he rode the ah that is he crossed the I can t tell You either must not know at all or else know very well He dived in well well never mind It only need be said That somewhere in the last degree poor Russell dropped down dead They arrested all the Masons and they stayed in durance vile Till the jury found them guilty when the Judge said with a smile I m forced to let the prisoners go for I can find said he No penalty for murder in the thirty third degree FOOTNOTES one Lippincott s Magazine TABLE MANNERS two BY JAMES MONTGOMERY FLAGG When you turn down your glass it s a sign

THE JULEP BY EMERSON HOUGH In the warm sun of the southern morning the great plantation lay as though half asleep dozing and blinking at the advancing day The plantation house known in all the country side as the Big House rested calm and self confident in the middle of a wide sweep of cleared lands surrounded immediately by dark evergreens and the occasional primeval oaks spared in the original felling of the forest Wide and rambling galleries of one height or another crawled partially about the expanses of the building and again paused as though weary of the attempt to circumvent it The strong white pillars rising from the ground floor straight to the third story shone white and stately after the old Southern fashion that Grecian style simplified and made suitable to provincial purses by those Adams brothers of old England who first set the fashion in early American architecture White coated with wide cool green blinds with ample and wide doored halls and deep low windows the Big House here in the heart of the warm southland was above all things suited to its environment It was all so safe and sure that there was no need for anxiety Life here was as it had been for generations even for the generation following the upheaval of the Civil War But if this were a kingdom apart and self sufficient what meant this thing which crossed the head of the plantation this double line tenacious and continuous which shone upon the one hand dark and upon the other where the sun touched it a cold gray in color What meant this squat little building at the side of these rails which reached on out straight as the flight of a bird across the clearing and vanished keenly in the forest wall This was the road of the iron rails It clung close to the ground at times almost sinking into the embankment now grown scarcely discernible among the concealing grass and weeds although the track itself had been built but recently This railroad sought to efface itself even as the land sought to aid in its effacement as though neither believed that this was lawful spot for it One might say it made a blot upon this picture of the morning Perhaps it seemed thus to the tall young girl who now stood upon its long gallery her tangle of high rolled red brown hair held back by the hand which half shaded her eyes as she looked out discontentedly over the familiar scene Miss Lady for thus she was christened by the Big House servants and she bore well the title frowned now as she tapped a little foot upon the gallery floor Perhaps it was not so much what she saw as what she did not see that made Miss Lady discontented for this white rim of the forest bounded the world for her yet after all youth and the morning do not conspire with discontent A moment more light fleet of foot Miss Lady fled down the gallery steps through the gate and out along the garden walk Beyond the yard fence she was greeted riotously by a score of dogs and puppies long since her friends and devoted admirers as indeed were all dwellers dumb or human thereabout Had Miss Lady or any observer looked from the gallery off to the southward and down the railway track there might thus have been discovered two figures just emerging from the rim of the forest something like a mile away and these might have been seen growing slowly more distinct as they plodded up the railway track toward the Big House Presently they might have been discovered to be a man and a woman the former tall thin dark and stooped his companion tall as himself quite as thin and almost as bent The garb of the man was nondescript neutral loose his hat dark and flapping The woman wore a shapeless calico gown and on her head was a long telescopic sunbonnet of faded pink from which she must perforce peer forward looking neither to the right nor to the left The travelers indeed needed not to look to the right or the left for the path of the iron rails led them directly on They did not step to the gallery did not knock at the door or indeed give any evidences of their intentions but seated themselves deliberately upon a pile of boards that lay near in the broad expanse of the front yard Here they remained silent and at rest fitting well enough into the sleepy scene No one in the house noticed them for a time and they tired by the walk seemed willing to rest under the shade of the evergreens before making known their errand They sat speechless and content for several moments until finally a mulatto house servant passing from one building to another cast a look in their direction and paused uncertainly in curiosity The man on the board pile saw her Here Jinny Jinny he called just loud enough to be heard and not turning toward her more than half way Come here Yessah said the girl and slowly approached Get us a little melk Jinny said the speaker We re plumb out o melk down home Yessah said Jinny and disappeared leisurely to be gone perhaps half an hour There remained little sign of life on the board pile the bonnet tube pointing fixedly toward the railway station the man now and then slowly shifting one leg across the other but staring out at nothing his lower lip drooping laxly When the servant finally brought back the milk pail and placed it beside him he gave no word of thanks To all appearances he was willing to wait here indefinitely forgetful of the pail of milk toward which the sun was creeping ominously close The way back home seemed long and weary at that moment His lip drooped still more laxly as he sat looking out vaguely Not so calm seemed his consort she of the sunbonnet Restored to some extent by her tarrying in the shade she began to shift and hitch about uneasily upon the board pile At length she leaned a bit to one side reached into a pocket and taking out a snuff stick and a parcel of its attendant compound began to take a dip of snuff after the habit of certain of the population of that region This done she turned with a swift jerk of the head bringing to bear the tube of her bonnet in full force upon her lord and master Jim Bowles she said this here is a shame Hit s a plumb shame There was no answer save an uneasy hitch on the part of the person so addressed He seemed to feel the focus of the sunbonnet boring into his system The voice in the bonnet went on shot straight toward him so that he might not escape It s a plumb shame said missus Bowles again I know it I know it said her husband at length uneasily But now Sar Ann how kin I help it The cow s daid and I kain t help it and that s all about it My God woman this with sudden energy do you think I kin bring a cow to life that s been killed by the old railroad kyahs I ain t no vangelist It ain t my fault old Muley got killed Ain t yore fault No it ain t my fault Whut am I going to do I kaint get no otheh cow right now and I done tol you so You reckon cows grows on bushes Grows on bushes Yes or that they comes for nuthin Comes for nuthin Yes Sar Ann that s whut I said I tell you it ain t so fur to come ain t so fur up here if you take it easy only three mile And Cunnel Blount ll give us melk as long as we want I reckon he would give us a cow too if I ast him I s pose I could pay him out o the next crop if they wasn t so many things that has to be paid out n the crop It s too blame bad bout Muley He scratched his head thoughtfully Yes responded his spouse Muley was a heap better cow then you ll ever git agin Why she gave two quo ts o melk the very mornin she was done killed two quo ts I reckon we didn t have to walk no three mile that mornin did we And she that kin and gentle like oh we ain t goin to git no new cow like Muley no time right soon I want to tell you that Jim Bowles Well well I know all that said her husband conciliatingly a trifle easier now that the sunbonnet was for the moment turned aside That s all true mighty true But what kin you do Do Why do somethin Somebody sho ought to suffer for this here This new fangled railroad a comin through here a killing things an a killing folks Why Bud Sowers said just the other week he heard of three darkies gittin killed in one bunch down to Allenville They standin on the track jes talkin and visitin like Didn t notice nuthin Didn t notice the train a comin Biff says Bud an thah was them darkies Yes said mister Bowles that s the way it was with Muley She just walk up out n the cane and stan thah in the sun on ther track to sort o look aroun whah she could see free for a little ways Then long comes the railroad train an biff Thah s Muley Plumb daid Plumb daid And she a good cow fer us fer fo teen yeahs It don t look exactly right now does it It sho don t It s a outrage that s whut it is said Sar Ann Bowles Well we got the railroad said her husband tentatively Yes we got the railroad said Sar Ann Bowles savagely and what yearthly good is hit Who wants any railroad Why all the way here this mornin I was skeered every foot of the way afearin that there ingine was goin to come along an kill us both Sho Sar Ann said her husband with superiority It ain t time for the train yit leastwise I don t think it is He looked about uneasily That s all right Jim Bowles One of them ingines might come long most any time It might creep up behine you then biff Thah s Jim Bowles Whut use is the railroad I d like to know I wouldn t be caught a climbin in one o them thar kyars not for big money Supposin it run off the track Oh well now said her husband maybe it don t always But supposin it did The front of the telescope turned toward him suddenly and so burning was the focus this time that mister Bowles shifted his seat and took refuge upon another board at the other end of the board pile out of range Whut made you vote for this yere railroad said Sarah Ann following him mercilessly with the bonnet tube We didn t want no railroad We never did have one and we never ought to a had one You listen to me that railroad is goin to ruin this country Th ain t a woman in these yeah bottoms but would be skeered to have a baby grow up in her house Supposin you got a baby nice little baby never did harm no one You a cookin or somethin out to the smoke house like enough baby alone for about two minutes Baby crawls out on to the railroad track Along comes the ingine an biff Thah s baby missus Bowles shed tears at this picture which she had conjured up and even her less imaginative consort became visibly affected so that for a moment he half straightened up Well I dunno said he vaguely and sighed softly all of which irritated missus Bowles to such an extent that she flounced suddenly around to get a better gaze upon her master In this movement her foot struck the pail of milk which had been sitting near and overturned it Jinny she called out you Jinny Yassam replied Jinny from some place on the gallery Come here said missus Bowles Git me another pail o melk I done spilled this one Yassam replied Jinny and presently returned with the refilled vessel Well anyway said Jim Bowles at length rising and standing with hands in pockets inside the edge of the shade line of the evergreens I heard that there was a man came down through yere a few days ago He was sort of taking count of the critters that done got killed by the railroad kyahs That so said Sarah Ann somewhat mollified I reckon so said Jim Bowles I lowed I d ast Cunnel Blount here at the Big House about that some time O course it don t bring Muley back but then No hit don t said Sarah Ann resuming her original position And our little Sim he just loved that Muley cow little Sim he did Say Jim Bowles do you heah me this with a sudden flirt of the sunbonnet in an agony of actual fear Why Jim Bowles do you know that our little Sim might be a playin out thah in front of ouah house on to that railroad track at this very minute S pose s posen long comes that there railroad train Say man whut you standin there in that there shade fer We got to go We got to git home Come right along this minute er we may be too late And so smitten by this sudden thought they gathered themselves together as best they might and started toward the railroad for their return Even as they did so there appeared upon the northern horizon a wreath of smoke rising above the forest There was the far off sound of a whistle deadened by the heavy intervening vegetation presently there puffed into view one of the railroad trains still new upon this region Iconoclastic modern strenuous it wabbled unevenly over the new laid rails up to the station house where it paused for a few moments ere it resumed its wheezing way to the southward The two visitors at the Big House gazed at it open mouthed for a time until all at once her former thought crossed the woman s mind She turned upon her husband Thar hit goes Thar hit goes she cried Right on straight to our house Hit kaint miss hit And little Sim he s sure to be playin out thah on the track Oh he s daid right this minute he shorely is Her speech exercised a certain force upon Jim Bowles He stepped on the faster tripped upon a clod and stumbled spilling half the milk from the pail Thah now said he Thah hit goes agin Done spilled the melk Well hit s too far back to the house now fer mo But now mabbe Sim wasn t playin on the track Mabbe he wasn t said Sarah Ann scornfully Why o course he was Well if he was said Jim Bowles philosophically why Sar Ann from whut I done notice about this here railroad train why it s too late now He might perhaps have pursued this logical line of thought further had not there occurred an incident which brought the conversation to a close Looking up the two saw approaching them across the lawn evidently coming from the little railway station and doubtless descended from this very train the alert quick stepping figure of a man evidently a stranger to the place Jim and Sarah Ann Bowles stepped to one side as he approached and lifted his hat with a pleasant smile Good morning said the stranger It s a fine day isn t it Can you tell me whether or not Colonel Blount is at home this morning Well suh said Jim Bowles rubbing his chin thoughtfully he is an he ain t He s home o course that is he hain t gone away no whah to company te er nothin But then ag in he s out huntin gone after b ah I reckon he s likely to be in most any day now Most any day Yessah You better go on up to the house Thank you said the stranger I am very much obliged to you indeed I believe I ll wait here for just a little while Good morning sir Good morning madam He turned and walked slowly up the path toward the house as the others pursued their way to the railroad track down which they presently were plodding on their homeward journey There was at least a little milk left in the pail when finally they reached their small log cabin with its yard full of pigs and chickens Eagerly they scanned the sides of the railway embankment as they drew near looking for signs of what they feared to see One need not describe the fierce joy with which Sarah Ann Bowles fell upon little Sim who was presently discovered safe and dirty knocking about on the kitchen floor in abundant company of puppies cats and chickens I knowed he would be killed said Sarah Ann But he hain t said her husband triumphantly And for one time in their married life there seemed to be no possible way in which she might contradict him which fact for her constituted a situation somewhat difficult Well it hain t yore fault ef he hain t said she at length The new comer at the Big House was a well looking figure enough as he advanced up the path toward the white pillared galleries In height just above middle stature and of rather spare habit of body alert compact and vigorous he carried himself with a self respect redeemed from aggressiveness by an open candor of face and the pleasant forthright gaze of a kindly blue gray eye In spite of a certain gravity of mien his eyes seemed wont to smile upon occasions as witnessed divers little wrinkles at the corners A hurried observer might have guessed his age within ten years but might have been wrong upon either side and might have had an equal difficulty in classifying his residence or occupation It was evident that he was not ill at ease in this environment for as he met coming around the corner an old colored man who with a rag in one hand and a bottle in the other seemed intent upon some errand at the dog kennel beyond he paused not in query or salutation but tossed his umbrella to the servant and at the same time handed him his traveling bag Take care of these Bill said he Bill for that was indeed his name placed the bag and umbrella upon a gallery floor and with the air of owning the place himself invited the visitor to enter The Cunnel s not to home suh said Bill But you better come in and sed down I ll go call the folks Never mind said the visitor I reckon I ll just walk around a little outside I hear Colonel Blount is off on a bear hunt Yassah said Bill An when he goes he mostly gets b ah I m right spondent dis time though deed I is suh What s the matter Why you see suh replied Bill leaning comfortably back against a gallery post It s dis a way I m just gwine out to fix up Old Hec s foot He s ouah bestest b ah dog but he got so blame biggoty las time he was out stuck his foot right intoe a ba h s mouth Now Hec s lef home an me lef home to ten to Hec How kin Cunnel Blount git any b ah widout me an Hec along I se right spondent dat s whut I is Well now that s too bad said the stranger with a smile Too bad I reckon it sho is Fer if

lane crosses de railroad track ef he come ridin long easy like now an den tootin his hawn to sort o let us know he s a comin ef he do dat a way dat s all right dat s all right Here the garrulous old

ligious hymns somethin s wrong and somethin gwine ter drap He hain t right easy ter git long wif when he s a singin But if you ll scuse me suh I got ter take care o Hec Jest make yourself to home suh anyways you like The visitor contented himself with wandering about the yard until at length he seated himself on the board pile beneath the evergreen trees and so sank into an idle reverie his chin in his hand and his eyes staring out across the wide field He sat thus for some time and the sun was beginning to encroach upon his refuge when suddenly he was aroused by the faint and far off sound of a hunting horn That the listener distinguished it at such a distance might have argued that he himself had known hound and saddle in his day yet he readily caught the note of the short hunting horn universally used by the Southern hunters and recognized the assembly call for the hunting pack As it came near all the dogs in the kennel yards heard it and raged to escape from their confinement Old Bill came hobbling around the corner Steps were heard on the gallery The visitor s face showed a slight uneasiness as he caught a glance of a certain spot now suddenly made alive by the flutter of a soft gown and the flash of a bunch of scarlet ribbons Thither he gazed as directly as he might under these circumstances but the girl was gone before he had opportunity even to rise and remove his hat That s her That s Miss Lady said Bill to his new friend in a low voice Han somest gal in the hull Delta They ll all be right glad ter see the Cunnel back He s got a b ah shore fer he s comin a blowin Bill s joy was not long lived for even as the little cavalcade came in view a tall figure on a chestnut hunting horse riding well in advance certain colored stragglers coming behind and the party colored pack trotting or limping along on all sides the music of the summoning horn suddenly ceased Looking neither to the right nor to the left the leader of the hunt rode on up the lane sitting loose and careless in the saddle his right hand steadying a short rifle across the saddle front He rode thus until presently those at the Big House heard softly rising on the morning air the chant of an old church hymn On Jordan s strand I ll take my stand An n n Oh Lawd exclaimed Bill Dat s his very wustest chune saying which he dodged around the corner of the house Turning in from the lane at the yard gate Colonel Calvin Blount and his retinue rode close up to the side door of the plantation house but even here the master vouchsafed no salutation to those who awaited his coming He was a tall man broad shouldered lean and muscular yet so far from being thin and dark he was spare rather from physical exercise than through gaunt habit of body his complexion was ruddy and sun colored and the long mustache hanging across his jaws showed a deep mahogany red Western ranchman one might have called him rather than Southern planter Scotch Irish generations back perhaps yet Southern always and by birthright American he might have been a war lord of another land and day No feudal baron ever dismounted with more assuredness at his own hall to toss careless rein to a retainer He stood now tall and straight a trifle rough looking in his careless planter s dress but every inch the master A slight frown puckered up his forehead giving to his face an added hint of sternness Colonel Blount busied himself with directions as to the horses and dogs The latter came straggling along in groups or pairs or singly some of them hobbling on three legs many showing bitter wounds The chase of the great bear had proved stern pastime for them Of half a hundred hounds which had started not two thirds were back again and many of these would be unfit for days for the resumption of their savage trade None the less as the master sounded again loud and clear the call for the assembly all the dogs about the place young and old homekeepers and warriors came pouring in with heads uplifted each pealing out his sweet and mournful music Blount spoke to dozens of them calling each by its proper name In the confusion of the disbandment of the hunt the master of the Big House had as yet hardly had time to look about him but now as the conclave scattered he found himself alone and turning discovered the occupant of the board pile who arose and advanced offering his hand This is Colonel Blount I presume said he Yes sir that s my name I beg your pardon I m sure but I didn t know you were there Come right on into the house and sit down sir Now your name was Eddring said the new comer John Eddring I am just down on the morning s train from the city I m right glad to see you mister Eddring said Colonel Blount extending his hand The two without plan wandered over toward the shade of the evergreen and presently seated themselves at the board pile Well Colonel Blount said the visitor I reckon you must have had a good hunt Yes sir there ain t a ba h in the Delta can get away from those dogs We run this fellow straight on end for ten miles put him across the river twice and all around the Black Bayou but the dogs kept him hot all the time I m telling you for more than five miles through the cane beyond the bayou Who got the shot Colonel asked Eddring a question apparently most unwelcome Well I ought to have had it said Blount with a frown of displeasure The fact is I did take a flying chance from horseback when the ba h ran by in the cane half a mile back of where they killed him Somehow I must have missed But man you ought to have heard that pack for two hours through the woods It certainly would have raised your hair straight up You ever hunt ba h sir A little once in a while when I have had the time You see a railroad man can t always choose Railroad man said Colonel Blount A sudden gloom fell upon his ruddy face Railroad man eh Well I wish you was something else Now I helped get that railroad through this country if it hadn t been for me they never could have laid a mile of track through here But now do you know what they done did to me the other day with their damned old railroad No sir I haven t heard Well I ll tell you Bill Oh Bill Go into the house and get me some ice and go pick some mint and bring it here to this gentleman and me Say do you know what that railroad did Why it just killed the best filly on my plantation my best running stock too Now I was the man to help get that railroad through the Delta and I Well now Colonel Blount said the other the road isn t a bad sort of thing for you all down here after all It relieves you of the river market and it gives you a double chance to get out your cotton You don t have to haul your cotton twelve miles back to the boat any more Here is your station right at your door and you can load on the cars any day you want to Oh that s all right that s all right But how about this killing of my stock Well that s so said the other facing the point and ruminatingly biting a splinter between his teeth It does look as if we had killed about everything loose in the whole Delta during the last month or so Are you on this railroad asked Blount suddenly I reckon I ll have to admit that I am said the other smiling Passenger agent or something of that sort I reckon Well let me tell you you change your road Say there was a man down below here last week settling up claims Bill Ah h Bill Where ve you gone Yes said Eddring it certainly did seem that when we built this road every cow and every nigger not to mention a lot of white folks made a bee line straight for our right of way Why sir it was a solid line of cows and niggers from Memphis to New Orleans How could you blame an engineer if he run into something once in a while He couldn t help it Yes Now do you know what this claim settler or this claim agent man did Why he paid a man down below here two stations what do you think he paid him for as fine a heifer as ever eat cane Why fifteen dollars Fifteen dollars Yes fifteen dollars That looks like a heap of money for a heifer doesn t it Colonel Blount A heap of money Why no Heap of money Why what do you mean Heifers didn t bring that before the road came through Why you would have had to drive that heifer twenty five miles before you could get a market and then she wouldn t have brought over twelve dollars Now fifteen dollars seems to me is about right Well let the heifer go But there was a cow killed three miles below here the other day Neighbors of mine I reckon that claim agent wouldn t want to allow any more than fifteen dollars for Jim Bowles cow neither Maybe not Well never mind about the cow either but look here A nigger lost his wife down there killed by these steam kyars looks like the niggers get fascinated by them kyars But here s Bill coming at last Now mister Eddring we ll just make a little julep Tell me how do you make a julep sir Eddring hitched a little nearer on the board pile Well Colonel Blount said he in our family we used to have an old silver mug sort of plain mug you know few flowers around the edge of it been in the family for years Now you take a mug like that and let it lie in the ice box all the time and when you take it out it s sort of got a white frost all over it Now my old daddy he would take this mug and put some fine ice into it not too fine Then he d take a little cut loaf sugar in another glass and he d mash it up in a little water not too much water then he d pour that in over the ice Then he would pour in some good corn whisky till all the interstices of that ice were filled plumb up then he d put some mint Didn t smash the mint Say he didn t smash the mint did he said Colonel Blount eagerly hitching over toward the speaker Smash it I should say not sir Sometimes at certain seasons of the mint he might just sort of take a twist at the leaf to sort of release a little of the flavor you know You don t want to be rough with mint Just twist it gently between the thumb and finger Then you set it in nicely around the edge of the glass Sometimes just a little powder of fine sugar around on top of the mint leaves and then a straw Sir said Colonel Blount gravely rising and taking off his hat you are welcome to my home Eddring with equal courtesy arose and removed his own hat For my part resumed Blount judicially I rather lean to a piece of cut glass for the green and the crystal look mighty fine together I don t always make them with any sugar on top of the mint But you know just a circle of mint not crushed not crushed mind you just a green ring of fragrance so that you can bury your nose in it and forget your troubles Sir allow me once more to shake your hand I think I know a gentleman when I see one A gentleman said the other smiling slightly Well don t shake hands with me yet sir I don t know You see I m a railroad man and I m here on business Damn it sir if it was only your description of a julep if it was only your mention of that old family silver mug devoted to that sacred purpose sir that would be your certificate of character here Forget your business Come down here and live with me We ll go huntin ba h together Why man I m mighty glad to make your acquaintance But wait said Eddring there may be two ways of looking at this Well there s only one way of looking at a julep said Blount and that s down a straw Now I ll show you how we make them down here in the Sunflower country But as I as a sayin and here Blount set down the glasses midway in his compounding and went on with his interrupted proposition now here was that nigger that lost his wife Of course he had a whole flock of children Now what do you think that claim agent said he would pay that nigger for his wife Well I Well but what do you reckon Why I reckon about fifteen dollars That s it that s it said Blount slapping his hand upon the board until the glasses jingled That s just what he did offer fifteen dollars Not a cent more Well now Colonel Blount said Eddring you know there s a heap of mighty trifling niggers loose in this part of the world You see that fellow would marry again in a little while and he might get a heap better woman next time There s a lot of swapping wives among the niggers at best Now here s a man lost his wife decent and respectable and there s nothing on earth a nigger likes better than a good funeral even if it has to be his own wife Now how many nigger funerals are there that cost fifteen dollars I ll bet you if that nigger had it to do over again he d a heap rather be rid of her and have the fifteen dollars Look at it Fine funeral for one wife and something left over to get a bonnet for his new wife I ll bet there isn t a nigger on your place that wouldn t jump at a chance like that Colonel Blount scratched his head You understand niggers all right I ll admit said he But now supposin it had been a white man Well supposing it was We don t need to suppose There was the same thing happened to a white family Wife got killed left three children Oh you mean that accident down at Shelby Yes missus Something or other she was Well sir damn me if that infernal claim agent didn t have the face to offer fifteen dollars for her too Looks almost like he played a fifteen dollar limit all the time doesn t it said the visitor It certainly does It ain t right Well now I heard about that woman She was a tall thin creature with no liver left at all and her chills came three times a week She wouldn t work she was red headed and had only one straight eye and as for a tongue well I only hope Colonel Blount that you and I will never have a chance to meet anything like that Of course I know she was killed Her husband just hated her before she died but blame me just as soon as she was dead he loved her more than if she was his sweetheart all over again Now that s how it goes Say I want to tell you Colonel Blount this road is plumb beneficent if only for the fact that it develops human affection the way it does Fifteen dollars Why I tell you sir fifteen dollars was more than enough for that woman He turned indignantly on the board pile I reckon said Colonel Blount that you would say that about my neighbor Jim Bowles cow Certainly I know about that cow too She was twenty years old and on her last legs Road kills her and all at once she becomes a dream of heifer loveliness I know I reckon said Colonel Blount still more grimly I reckon if that damned claim agent was to come here he would just about say that fifteen dollars was enough for my filly I shouldn t wonder Now look here Colonel Blount You see I m a railroad man and I m able to see the other side of these things Oh well all right said Blount but that don t bring my filly back You can t get Himyah blood every day in the week That filly would have seen Churchill Downs in her day if she had lived Yes and if she had you would have had to back her wouldn t you You would have trained that filly and paid a couple of hundred for it You would have fitted her at the track and paid several hundred more You would have bet a couple of thousand anyway as a matter of principle and like enough you d have lost it Now if this road paid you fifteen dollars for that filly and saved you twenty five hundred or three thousand into the bargain how ought you to feel about it Are you twenty five hundred behind or fifteen ahead Colonel Calvin Blount had now feverishly finished his julep and as the other stopped he placed his glass beside him on the board pile and swung a long leg across so that he sat directly facing his enigmatical guest The latter in the enthusiasm of his argument swung into a similar position and so they sat both hammering on the board between them Well I would like to see that damned claim agent offer me fifteen dollars for that filly said Blount I might take fifty for the sake of the road but fifteen Well what would you do Well by God sir if I saw that claim agent Well by God sir I m that claim agent and I do offer you fifteen dollars for that filly right now What You Yes me Fifteen dollars Yes sir fifteen dollars Colonel Blount burst into a sudden song On Jor dan s strand I ll take my stand he began It s all she s worth interrupted the claim agent Blount fairly gasped Do you mean to tell me said he in forced calm that you are this claim agent I have told you That s the way I make my living That s my duty Your duty to give me fifteen dollars for a Himyah filly I said fifteen And I said fifty You don t get it I don t eh Say my friend Blount pushed the glasses away his choler rising at the temerity of this the only man who in many a year had dared to confront him You look here Write me a check for fifty an write it now With a sudden whip of his hand he reached behind him Like a flash he pulled a long revolver from its holster Eddring gazed into the round aperture of the muzzle and certain surrounding apertures of the cylinder Write me a check said Blount slowly and write it for fifty I may tear it up when I get it I don t care fifty cents for it but you write it The eyes of the two met and which were the braver man it had been hard to tell Neither flinched Eddring returned a gaze as direct as that which he received The florid face back of the barrel held a gleam of half admiration at witnessing his deliberation The claim agent s eye did not falter You said fifty dollars Colonel Blount said he just a suggestion of a smile at the corner of his mouth Don t you think there has been a slight misunderstanding between us two If you are so blamed particular and really want a check for fifty why here it is He busied himself a moment and passed over a strip of paper Even as he did so the ire of Colonel Blount cooled as suddenly as it had gained warmth A sudden contrition sat on his face and he crowded the paper into his pocket with an air half shamed faced Sir mister Eddring he began falteringly Well what do you want You ve got your check and you ve got the railroad We ve paid our little debt to you Sir said Blount My friend why sir here is your julep To hell with your julep sir My friend said Blount flushing You serve me right I am forgetting my duties as a gentleman I asked you into my house I ll see you damned first said Eddring hotly Right cried Blount exultingly You re right You are one of the fighting Eddrings sure as you re born Why sir come on in You wouldn t punish the son of your uncle s friend your own daddy s friend would you Why man I know your folks But the ire of Eddring was now aroused A certain smoldering fire long with difficulty suppressed began to flame in spite of him Bring me out a plate said he bitterly and let me eat on the gallery As you say I am only a claim agent Good God man And then of a sudden his wrath arose still higher His own hand made a swift motion Give me back that check he said and his extended hand presented a weapon held steady as though supported by the limb of a tree You didn t give me a fair show Well by the eternal half whispered Colonel Calvin Blount to himself Ain t he a fightin chicken Give it to me demanded Eddring and the other astounded humbled reached into his pocket and produced the paper I will give it to you boy said he soberly and twenty like it if you ll forget all this and come into my house I will not sir said Eddring This was business and you made it personal Oh business said Blount Sir said John Eddring the world never understands when a fellow has to choose between being a business man and a gentleman I can t afford to be a gentleman And you are so much one my son said Calvin Blount grimly that you won t do anything but what you know is right My friend I won t ask you in again not any more right now But when you can come again sir some day When you come right easy and pleasant my son why you know I want you John Eddring s hard set jaw relaxed trembled and he dared not commit himself to speech With a straight look into Colonel Blount s eyes he half turned away and passed on down the path Blount looking after him more than half yearningly So intent indeed was the latter in his gaze upon the receding figure that he did not hear the swift rush of light feet on the gallery nor turn until Miss Lady stood before him The girl swept him a deep curtsey spreading out the skirt of her biscuit colored gown in mocking deference of posture Please mister Colonel said she since he can t hear the dinner bell would he be good enough to tell whether or not he will come in and eat Everything is growing cold and I made the biscuits Calvin Blount put out his hand and a softer shade came upon his face Oh it is you Miss Lady is it said he Yes I m back home again And you made the biscuits eh I called to you several times said Miss Lady Who is that gentleman you are staring at Why doesn t he come in and eat with us Colonel Blount turned slowly as Miss Lady tugged at his arm Who is he he replied half musingly Who is he You tell me He refused to eat in Calvin Blount s house that s why he didn t come in Miss Lady He says he s the cow coroner on the railroad but I want to tell you he s the finest fellow and the nearest to a gentleman that ever struck this country That s what he is I m mighty troubled over his going away Why he didn t drink his julep said Miss Lady severely No said Blount miserably And he hasn t any other place to eat said Miss Lady argumentatively No And he he hasn t been introduced to me said Miss Lady conclusively No Colonel Cal call him said Miss Lady decisively Her words roused the old planter You I say Eddring you there Come on back here Forgot something In spite of himself or was it in union with himself John Eddring turned back and at last stood hat in hand near to the others A smile softened the stern features of Colonel Blount as he pointed half quizzically to the untasted julep on the board pile Besides mister Eddring said he besides you have not yet heard that this young lady of ours Miss Lady here helped make the dinner this evenin Now sir I ask will you come The same odd tremble caught the claim agent s lip and he frowned to pull himself out of his own weakness before he made reply Miss Lady tall well rounded dark eyed her ruff of red brown hair thrown back stood looking at him her hand clasped upon Blount s arm Eddring bowed deeply Sir he said it wasn t fair of you but I yield to your superior weapons THE FINAL CHOICE three BY

Grandfather clamored for Uriah While grandma mentioned Obadiah Then mother spoke of Clarence Cyril And Reginald and Claude But I thought none of them were virile Like some such name as Ichabod

FOOTNOTES three Lippincott s Magazine honorable RANSOM PEABODY BY GEORGE ADE The Fable of the Hoosier Bill of Fare and How the Women Folks Cooked Up Things for the Well known Citizen Once upon a Time there was a Hired Hand who felt that he was cut out to be Somebody Among the Agriculturists he was said to be too dosh burned Toney because he wore gloves when he Toiled and on Sundays put on a slew of Agony with sheet iron Shoes pointed at the End and a neat Derby purchased in Terry Hut Now this Freckled Swain whose name was Ransom wanted to hop on the Inter Reuben and go zipping away to see the Great World He wanted to live in a Big Town where he would not have to walk on the Ploughed Ground and where he could get something Good to Eat He was tired of the plain Vittles out on the Farm They very seldom had anything on the Table except Chicken with Gravy Salt Rising Bread Milk seven or eight Vegetables Crulls Cookies Apple Butter Whortleberry Pie Light Biscuit Spare Ribs Pig s Feet Hickory Nut Cake and such like This thing of drawing up every A M to the same old Lay Out of home made Sausage Buckwheat Cakes Recent Eggs Fried Mush and Mother s Coffee was beginning to wear on him Often he dreamt of being in the Metropolis where he could get an Oyster Stew Sardines and Ice Cream in the Winter Time At last his Dream came out of the Box He went up to the City to attend a Law School and found himself domiciled in a Refined Joint that was a Cross between a Salon and a Beanery It was one of those Regular Places kept by a thin Lady who had once ridden in her Own Carriage Her Long Suit was Home Atmosphere She had the Hall Ways filled with it What is more she came from an Old Family Lord Cornwallis once stopped at their House to get a Drink of Water and George Washington came very near sleeping in one of the Bed Rooms So that made the Board about fifty cents more on the Week Like all high class Boarding Houses it was infested by some Lovely People There was the girl who spelled it Edythe and was having her voice done over She had a Mother to keep Cases on her and do the Press Work Also there was the Grass Widow who remembered her Husband s name but had mislaid the Address Also the Old Boarder who was always under the influence of Pepsin He would come down to Breakfast wearing the Hoof Marks of a Nightmare Seventeen Hands high and holler about the Food and tell the Young Lawyer how you can t believe anything you see in the Papers Also there was a young man employed in a Furniture Store who knew that he could put Eddie Sothern on the Fritz if he ever got a Whack at the Drama Unless some one got out an Injunction he would recite Poe s Raven while Edythe played Chills and Fever music on the Once Piano So the Astute Reader will understand that this was a sure enough Boarding House Ranse could have stood for the Intellectual Environment if there had been a little more doing in the Food Line Instead of stacking it up on the Table and giving the word to Pitch In the Refined Landlady had it brought on in stingy little Dabs by several Beautiful Heiresses who hated to hold Converse with Ordinary Boarders About the time that Ranse with the Farm Appetite began to settle down to Business he would notice all the other People rolling up the Red Napkins and trying to get them into the Rings If he kept on eating after that they would give him the Eye Cereals were strongly featured at the polite Prunery Ransom while employed on the Farm had often mixed up Chop Feed and Bran for the Shoats and Yearlings but he never thought he would come down to eating it himself Another Strong Card was a Soup that was quite Pale and had a couple of Vermicelli swimming around in it And every Tuesday they served Dried Currants with Clinkers in them Before Ranse had been against the Health Food Proposition many moons he began to hanker for the yellow legged Plymouth Rocks the golden Butter and the kind of milk that comes from the Cow take a Tin Cup and go right out to the Spring House and dip it up for yourself Poor eh Still he figured that as soon as he got into Practice and began to connect with the Currency he could shake the Oatmeal Circuit and put up at an Aone Hotel Like all the other Country Boys of the Story Books Ransom made a Ten Strike in the City He worked eighteen hours per and in Due Time he was taken into the Firm and stopped shaving his Neck and wore Pajamas instead of a home made Nightie Then he moved into a Hotel that had forty thousand dollars worth of Paintings on the First Floor so that no one had a right to kick even if the Push Button failed to work All the Furniture was Louie Something You take an ex Farm Hand and let him sit in a Gold Chair with Satin Monogram that is too Nice to lean against and you can see at a Glance that he is sure enjoying himself Ranse now began to go against the a la Carte Gag The Menu was prepared by a Near French Chef For Fear that People might find Fault with the Food he always smothered it and covered it over with Goo Ranse began to find out that Goulasch meant Boiled Dinner with Perfumery in it and also that there were seven different names for Hash The only Thing that saved it from being Hash was the Piece of Lemon Peel tucked on the Side Ranse was not very strong for the French Cooking Sometimes he would find himself Chicken Hungry and he would order what he thought was Chicken and he would get a half section of cold storage Poulet covered with Armor Plate a neat Ruffle around the Ankle and an Olive reposing on the Bosom If he ordered Ice Cream he got something resembling a sample Paper Weight from the Quarries at Bedford Indiana And the Buckwheat Cakes They looked like Doilies and tasted like Blotters And the Demi Tasse is an Awful Joke to spring on the Man who wants a Cup of Coffee Here was the honorable Ransom rich and prosperous and apparently happy but in reality he was Dead Sore Things appeared to be coming very Soft for him and yet that which he wanted most of all he could not get He wanted the real old simon pure Home Cooking He recalled the Happy Days of Bean Soup and Punkin Pie and Cottage Cheese Time and again he would see one of those old Friends on a Score Card in a Restaurant and he would order it and get some Fake Imitation with Smilax all around the edges So after a while he became discouraged and ate all the Junk that was set before him Dope Lemon Peel Floral Decoration and all Often he would go to Banquets that cost as much as Ten a Throw He would dally with Fish that had Glue Dressing on top of it and Golf Balls lying alongside He would tackle Siberian Slush that had Hair Tonic floating on top of it Then the Petrified Quail and the Cheese that should have been served in eighteen eighty four Often sitting at these Magnificent Spreads he thought to himself that he would willingly trade all the Tiffany Water on the Table for one Goblet of real Buttermilk After Ransom had insulted his Digestive Apparatus for many years with the horrible Concoctions of the Gents Cafe he resolved to go back to his native Town and visit some of his Blood Relations so that he could get at least one more Crack at real American Grub He wrote that he was coming and his Kin became greatly Agitated Our celebrated Cousin the honorable Ransom Peabody is coming to visit us they said We must make unusual Preparations to receive the big Battleship He is Rich and High Toned and has been living at one of those six dollars a Day Palaces and we must cut a big Melon when he shows up He is accustomed to City Food and we must not insult him with ordinary Provender So they began framing up Dishes out of a Subscription Cook Book purchased the year before from a Lady with Gold Glasses and a grand flow of Language The honorable Ransom arrived late one Evening and all Night he lay awake in the Spare Bed Room gloating over the prospect of a Home Breakfast Me for the Sausage Cakes with the good old Sage rubbed into them said Ranse I will certainly show the Buckwheats how to take a Joke and the way I ll dip into that Coffee will be a Caution And mebbe I won t go to those Eggs direct from the Hen He arose early but had to wait two Hours As he was from the City the Family had postponed Breakfast until nine o clock When he faced up to the Table he was Wolfish First they gave him Grape Fruit au Kirsch Then the Finger Bowl with the cute Rose Leaves floating idly on the dimpled Surface Then a dainty Lamb Chop with an ornamental Fence around it and a sweet little cup of Cocoa in the China that Uncle Henry bought at the World s Fair Then French Toast and Eggs a la Gazaza with Christmas Trees stuck into them The honorable Ransom arose and howled like a Siberian Wolf which was Impolite of him Before he went Home he did manage to get a little real Eating but every one said he was very Eccentric to prefer such a simple dish as Fried Chicken Moral Hurry up and get it before the Chef and the Cook Book have us entirely Civilized NOTHING TO WEAR BY WILLIAM ALLEN BUTLER Miss Flora M Flimsey of Madison Square Has made three separate journeys to Paris And her father assures me each time she was there That she and her friend missus Harris Not the lady whose name is so famous in history But plain missus H without romance or mystery Spent six consecutive weeks without stopping In one continuous round of shopping Shopping alone and shopping together At all hours of the day and in all sorts of weather For all manner of things that a woman can put On the crown of her head or the sole of her foot Or wrap round her shoulders or fit round her waist Or that can be sewed on or pinned on or laced Or tied on with a string or stitched on with a bow In front or behind above or below For bonnets mantillas capes collars and shawls Dresses for breakfast and dinners and balls Dresses to sit in and stand in and walk in Dresses to dance in and flirt in and talk in Dresses in which to do nothing at all Dresses for winter spring summer and fall All of them different in color and shape Silk muslin and lace velvet satin and crape Brocade and broadcloth and other material Quite as expensive and much more ethereal In short for all things that could ever be thought of Or milliner modiste or tradesman be bought of From ten thousand franc robes to twenty sous frills In all quarters of Paris and to every store While M Flimsey in vain stormed scolded and swore They footed the streets and he footed the bills The last trip their goods shipped by the steamer Arago Formed M Flimsey declares the bulk of her cargo Not to mention a quantity kept from the rest Sufficient to fill the largest sized chest Which did not appear on the ship s manifest But for which the ladies themselves manifested Such particular interest that they invested Their own proper persons in layers and rows Of muslin embroideries worked underclothes Gloves handkerchiefs scarfs and such trifles as those Then wrapped in great shawls like Circassian beauties Gave good by to the ship and go by to the duties Her relations at home all marveled no doubt Miss Flora had grown so enormously stout For an actual belle and a possible bride But the miracle ceased when she turned inside out And the truth came to light and the dry goods besides Which in spite of Collector and Custom House sentry Had entered the port without any entry And yet though scarce three months have passed since the day This merchandise went on twelve carts up Broadway This same Miss M Flimsey of Madison Square The last time we met was in utter despair Because she had nothing whatever to wear Nothing to wear Now as this is a true ditty I do not assert this you know is between us That she s in a state of absolute nudity Like Powers s Greek Slave or the Medici Venus But I do mean to say I have heard her declare When at the same moment she had on a dress Which cost five hundred dollars and not a cent less And jewelry worth ten times more I should guess That she had not a thing in the wide world to wear I should mention just here that out of Miss Flora s Two hundred and fifty or sixty adorers I had just been selected as he who should throw all The rest in the shade by the gracious bestowal On myself after twenty or thirty rejections Of those fossil remains which she called her affections And that rather decayed but well known work of art Which Miss Flora persisted in styling her heart So we were engaged Our troth had been plighted Not by moonbeam or starbeam by fountain or grove But in a front parlor most brilliantly lighted Beneath the gas fixtures we whispered our love Without any romance or raptures or sighs Without any tears in Miss Flora s blue eyes Or blushes or transports or such silly actions It was one of the quietest business transactions With a very small sprinkling of sentiment if any And a very large diamond imported by Tiffany On her virginal lips while I printed a kiss She exclaims as a sort of parenthesis And by way of putting me quite at my ease You know I m to polka as much as I please And flirt when I like now stop don t you speak And you must not come here more than twice in the week Or talk to me either at party or ball But always be ready to come when I call So don t prose to me about duty and stuff If we don t break this off there will be time enough For that sort of thing but the bargain must be That as long as I choose I am perfectly free For this is a kind of engagement you see Which is binding on you but not binding on me Well having thus wooed Miss M Flimsey and gained her With the silks crinolines and hoops that contained her I had as I thought a contingent remainder At least in the property and the best right To appear as its escort by day and by night And it being the week of the Stuckups grand ball Their cards had been out a fortnight or so And set all the Avenue on the tiptoe I considered it only my duty to call And see if Miss Flora intended to go I found her as ladies are apt to be found When the time intervening between the first sound Of the bell and the visitor s entry is shorter Than usual I found I won t say I caught her Intent on the pier glass undoubtedly meaning To see if perhaps it didn t need cleaning She turned as I entered Why Harry you sinner I thought that you went to the Flashers to dinner So I did I replied the dinner is swallowed And digested I trust for tis now nine and more So being relieved from that duty I followed Inclination which led me you see to your door And now will your ladyship so condescend As just to inform me if you intend Your beauty and graces and presence to lend All of which when I own I hope no one will borrow To the Stuckups whose party you know is to morrow The fair Flora looked up with a pitiful air And answered quite promptly Why Harry mon cher I should like above all things to go with you there But really and truly I ve nothing to wear Nothing to wear Go just as you are Wear the dress you have on and you ll be by far I engage the most bright and particular star On the Stuckup horizon I stopped for her eye Notwithstanding this delicate onset of flattery Opened on me at once a most terrible battery Of scorn and amazement She made no reply But gave a slight turn to the end of her nose That pure Grecian feature as much as to say How absurd that any sane man should suppose That a lady would go to a ball in the clothes No matter how fine that she wears every day So I ventured again Wear your crimson brocade Second turn up of nose That s too dark by a shade Your blue silk That s too heavy Your pink That s too light Wear tulle over satin I can t endure white Your rose colored then the best of the batch I haven t a thread of point lace to match Your brown moire antique Yes and look like a Quaker The pearl colored I would but that plaguy dressmaker Has had it a week Then that exquisite lilac In which you would melt the heart of a Shylock Here the nose took again the same elevation I wouldn t wear that for the whole of creation Why not It s my fancy there s nothing could strike it As more comme il faut Yes but dear me that lean Sophronia Stuckup has got one just like it And I won t appear dressed like a chit of sixteen Then that splendid purple the sweet Mazarine That superb point d aiguille that imperial green That zephyr like tarletan that rich grenadine Not one of all which is fit to be seen Said the lady becoming excited and flushed Then wear I exclaimed in a tone which quite crushed Opposition that gorgeous toilette which you sported In Paris last spring at the grand presentation When you quite turned the head of the head of the nation And by all the grand court were so very much courted The end of the nose was portentously tipped up And both the bright eyes shot forth indignation As she burst upon me with the fierce exclamation I have worn it three times at the least calculation And that and most of my dresses are ripped up Here I ripped out something perhaps rather rash Quite innocent though but to use an expression More striking than classic it settled my hash And proved very soon the last act of our session Fiddlesticks is it sir I wonder the ceiling Doesn t fall down and crush you you men have no feeling You selfish unnatural illiberal creatures Who set yourselves up as patterns and preachers Your silly pretense why what a mere guess it is Pray what do you know of a woman s necessities I have told you and shown you I ve nothing to wear And it s perfectly plain you not only don t care But you do not believe me here the nose went still higher I suppose if you dared you would call me a liar Our engagement is ended sir yes on the spot You re a brute and a monster and I don t know what I mildly suggested the words Hottentot Pickpocket and cannibal Tartar and thief As gentle expletives which might give relief But this only proved as a spark to the powder And the storm I had raised came faster and louder It blew and it rained thundered lightened and hailed Interjections verbs pronouns till language quite failed To express the abusive and then its arrears Were brought up all at once by a torrent of tears And my last faint despairing attempt at an obs Ervation was lost in a tempest of sobs Well I felt for the lady and felt for my hat too Improvised on the crown of the latter a tattoo In lieu of expressing the feelings which lay Quite too deep for words as Wordsworth would say Then without going through the form of a bow Found myself in the entry I hardly know how On doorstep and sidewalk past lamp post and square At home and upstairs in my own easy chair Poked my feet into slippers my fire into blaze And said to myself as I lit my cigar Supposing a man had the wealth of the Czar Of the Russias to boot for the rest of his days On the whole do you think he would have much to spare If he married a woman with nothing to wear Since that night taking pains that it should not be bruited Abroad in society I ve instituted A course of inquiry extensive and thorough On this vital subject and find to my horror That the fair Flora s case is by no means surprising But that there exists the greatest distress In our female community solely arising From this unsupplied destitution of dress Whose unfortunate victims are filling the air With the pitiful wail of Nothing to wear Researches in some of the Upper Ten districts Reveal the most painful and startling statistics Of which let me mention only a few In one single house on the Fifth Avenue Three young ladies were found all below twenty two Who have been three whole weeks without anything new In the way of flounced silks and thus left in the lurch Are unable to go to ball concert or church In another large mansion near the same place Was found a deplorable heartrending case Of entire destitution of Brussels point lace In a neighboring block there was found in three calls Total want long continued of camel s hair shawls And a suffering family whose case exhibits The most pressing need of real ermine tippets One deserving young lady almost unable To survive for the want of a new Russian sable Still another whose tortures have been most terrific Ever since the sad loss of the steamer Pacific In which were engulfed not friend or relation For whose fate she perhaps might have found consolation Or borne it at least with serene resignation But the choicest assortment of French sleeves and collars Ever sent out from Paris worth thousands of dollars And all as to style most recherche and rare The want of which leaves her with nothing to wear And renders her life so drear and dyspeptic That she s quite a recluse and almost a skeptic For she touchingly says that this sort of grief Can not find in Religion the slightest relief And Philosophy has not a maxim to spare For the victims of such overwhelming despair But the saddest by far of all these sad features Is the cruelty practised upon the poor creatures By husbands and fathers real Bluebeards and Timons Who resist the most touching appeals made for diamonds By their wives and their daughters and leave them for days Unsupplied with new jewelry fans or bouquets Even laugh at their miseries whenever they have a chance And deride their demands as useless extravagance One case of a bride was brought to my view Too sad for belief but alas twas too true Whose husband refused as savage as Charon To permit her to take more than ten trunks to Sharon The consequence was that when she got there At the end of three weeks she had nothing to wear And when she proposed to finish the season At Newport the monster refused out and out For his infamous conduct alleging no reason Except that the waters were good for his gout Such treatment as this was too shocking of course And proceedings are now going on for divorce But why harrow the feelings by lifting the curtain From these scenes of woe Enough it is certain Has here been disclosed to stir up the pity Of every benevolent heart in the city And spur up humanity into a canter To rush and relieve these sad cases instanter Won t somebody moved by this touching description Come forward to morrow and head a subscription Won t some kind philanthropist seeing that aid is So needed at once by these indigent ladies Take charge of the matter Or won t Peter Cooper The corner stone lay of some new splendid super Structure like that which to day links his name In the Union unending of Honor and Fame And found a new charity just for the care Of these unhappy women with nothing to wear Which in view of the cash which would daily be claimed The Laying out Hospital well might be named Won t Stewart or some of our dry goods importers Take a contract for clothing our wives and our daughters Or

O ladies dear ladies the next sunny day Please trundle your hoops just out of Broadway From its swirl and its bustle its fashion and pride And the temples of Trade which tower on each side To the alleys and lanes where Misfortune and Guilt Their children have gathered their city have built Where Hunger and Vice like twin beasts of prey Have hunted their victims to gloom and despair Raise the rich dainty dress and the fine broidered skirt Pick your delicate way through the dampness and dirt Grope through the dark dens climb the rickety stair To the garret where wretches the young and the old Half starved and half naked lie crouched from the cold See those skeleton limbs those frost bitten feet All bleeding and bruised by the stones of the street Hear the sharp cry of childhood the deep groans that swell From the poor dying creature who writhes on the floor Hear the curses that sound like the echoes of Hell As you sicken and shudder and fly from the door Then home to your wardrobes and say if you dare Spoiled children of fashion you ve nothing to wear And O if perchance there should be a sphere Where all is made right which so puzzles us here Where the glare and the glitter and tinsel of Time Fade and die in the light of that region sublime Where the soul disenchanted of flesh and of sense Unscreened by its trappings and shows and pretense Must be clothed for the life and the service above With purity truth faith meekness and love O daughters of Earth foolish virgins beware Lest in that upper realm you have nothing to wear A BRANCH LIBRARY four BY JAMES

STEWART CUTTING Haven t you any coffee spoons Kitty I thought you had a couple of dozen when you went to housekeeping Marcia with her sleeves rolled up from her round white arms was rummaging in the sideboard as she knelt beside it on the floor her brown eyes peering into the corners Yes of course I have coffee spoons Aren t they there I m sure I don t know what becomes of things Young missus Fosdyke stout and matronly held a fat and placid year old baby on her lap with one arm while with the other hand she lunged out intermittently to pick up a much chewed rubber dog cast upon the floor by the infant Oh now I remember they re at the bank with the rest of the silver we sent them there the summer we went to the seashore and forgot to take them out again I know it s dreadful to get in the habit of living in this picnic fashion I m ashamed sometimes to have any one come here Not that I mind your having asked missus Devereaux for Thanksgiving Marcia I don t want you to feel that way for a minute I think it was nice of you to want to If you don t mind having her here I m sure I don t You know I ve had such a time changing servants and when you have three babies missus Fosdyke was accustomed to anticipate possible astonishment at the size of her young family by stating tersely to begin with that the three were all of the same age if this were not literally true it was true enough to account for the disposal of most of her time In a small house on a small income with one maid all departments can not receive attention under such circumstances something has to go missus Fosdyke s attention went rightly enough to the children there were no graces of management left for the household there couldn t be that was one reason why she never invited company any more She felt apologetic even before her sister I wish things were a little nicer here but I know just how you feel about missus Devereaux No matter how rich a person is it seems sort of desolate to be alone at a hotel in a small town on a holiday Thanksgiving Day especially And she was so good to you in Paris I shall never forget it I m sure I never shall said Marcia She saw with retrospective vision the scene of two years ago when she a terrified girl of twenty just recovering from an illness had missed connections with her party at a railway station and had been blessedly taken in charge by a stranger whose spoken name carried recognition with it to any American abroad Marcia had been taken to missus Devereaux s luxurious house for the day put to bed comforted telegrams and messages sent hither and thither to her friends truly it was the kind of a thing one does not forget that must claim gratitude forever She went on now I can t get over our meeting in the street here in this place just the day we both came the strangest coincidence I could hardly believe my eyes And then to drive back to her rooms with her and find myself telling her all I ve been doing just as if I had known her always I m sure though I feel as if I had I do want to do something for her so much it doesn t make any real difference her being so rich and grand And then I thought of our Thanksgiving dinner and she seemed so pleased and accepted at once Of course she stipulated that we were to promise not to make any difference on her account but I do want to have everything as pretty and characteristic as possible And you needn t bother a bit about anything Kitty I ll do all the work and there s a whole week to get ready in We ll have Frank bring your wedding silver from the bank you had so many lovely large pieces I had ten cut glass and silver loving cups annotated Kitty in the tone of injury the recollection always produced in the light of her present needs It will take you hours and days to clean all those things Marcia that s why I never use them When you have three babies all the same age Kersley will help me said Marcia deftly introducing another subject Kersley There was deep surprise in Kitty s voice she turned to fix her eyes on her sister Marcia flushed independently of her will Yes didn t I tell you He s coming out to his brother s over Thanksgiving Oh said Kitty with significance she made a precipitate lunge for the rubber dog There was an alert tone in her voice when she spoke again Marcia Well How long is this thing to go on Are you engaged to Kersley Battersby or are you not For if you re not I don t think it s decent to keep him dangling on in this way any longer Oh Kitty do stop Marcia ceased her investigations to relapse into a jumbled heap on the rug her chin resting on her hand her dark vivacious little face tense I suppose I do consider that I m engaged if you will have me say it he s the only man I could ever care for but I m not going to let him know it not until he gets on his feet not while he s only making fifteen dollars here and twenty dollars there and some weeks not even that painting labels for tomato cans and patent medicines It does seem a pity that after all the studying in Paris and winning the prize for his portraits in the Salon it should take him so long to get a start here I suppose you have to have a pull as in everything else If he once knew that I really cared for him he d lose his head and want to be married out of hand I couldn t do a thing with him He d insist that it would help him to work if I were near all the time Perhaps it would suggested Kitty Yes and have all his family say that I ve ruined his prospects you can imagine how pleasant that would be Everyone says that if a poor artist is hampered at the beginning he has no career at all I enjoy things as they are anyway and if Kersley doesn t it s his own lookout He s a perfect baby great big blue eyed ridiculous unpractical thing What do you suppose he did when he was in Chester last month just after I d left there Walked all the way into town and back twenty miles he hadn t enough money for his car fare to buy me a little trumpery pin I wanted when they had the identical thing on sale at the little shop by the station Wasn t that like him And with all his artistic talent I have to tell him what kind of a necktie to get Imagine him with his hair in a scarlet one when he looks so adorable in dull blue Let s change the subject Is this your best centerpiece with the color all washed out Yes Then I ll finish that lace one I m making and put yellow under it Yellow is to be the color scheme Kitty I m going to present you with some of those lovely glasses I saw at Ketterer s with gilt flowers on them I want you to let me pay for the chrysanthemums and all the extras a few palms can be hired they add so much to the effect You know I got the money for those illustrations yesterday and I don t care whether I have any clothes or not I just want to do my prettiest for a Thanksgiving for missus Devereaux Very well dear said Kitty I should think that woman wouldn t want such a time made over her said mister Fosdyke to his wife disgustedly in private There are married men who may on occasion be mistaken for bachelors but mister Fosdyke was not of that ilk the respectable bondage of one wedded to family claims was stamped upon him as with a die in spite of a humorous tendency that was sometimes trying to his wife What s the sense With all her millions she must be used to everything I should think she d like something plain and homelike for a change instead of all this fuss and feathers I m worn out with it already There seems to be a perfect upheaval downstairs with all Marcia s decorations and color schemes and artistic effects My arm s broken lugging loving cups home from the bank they weigh a ton Why can t missus Devereaux take us as we are Now Frank I ve told you how Marcia feels about it said his wife reprovingly You know how intense she is it gives her positive satisfaction to show her gratitude by working her fingers off and spending all the money she s got She wants to make it a special occasion Well she s doing it said Frank Fosdyke with however a relenting smile he was fond of whole souled little Marcia I say though Kitty what s Kersley doing here all the time I thought he was living in New York I can t go anywhere that I don t see that big smile of his and the gray suit I m always running across him with Marcia It makes me feel like a fool Am I to treat them as if they were engaged or not missus Fosdyke shook her head Not yet Can t he stop her shillyshallying Frank I said Not yet All right said Frank resignedly moving around the darkened room as he disrobed with the catlike step of one whose ever haunting fear is that he may wake the baby Marcia had decreed against the old fashioned middle of the day Thanksgiving dinner half past seven was early enough And it ought to be eight she added ruefully At any rate the babies will be asleep and missus Fogarty is going to let her Maggie come and sit upstairs with them Thank goodness Ellen can cook the dinner with my help and wait on the table afterward She s as nice and interested as she can be and I ll keep her in good humor I ve promised to buy her a lovely new cap and apron We ve just decided what to have for the nine courses Nine courses Now Kitty it s no more trouble to have nine courses than two if you manage properly I ll make a number of the dishes the day before and Ellen can see to the turkey herself I ll show you my bill of fare afterward I m going to have the loveliest little menu cards with golden pumpkins in wheat sheaves painted on them so nice and Thanksgivingy You ve seen the yellow paper cases I ve made for the ice pudding and the candle shades the color scheme you know is yellow I m going to ornament the dishes for the almonds and raisins and olives and the candied ginger and other things in the same way Now please don t worry about anything Kitty If people only make the arrangements beforehand it s no trouble at all It s all in the way one plans and having a system about things I hope so said missus Fosdyke for she had her misgivings In housekeeping it is only too often that two and two fail to make four Kersley Battersby tall and handsome coming in gayly at four o clock on Thanksgiving afternoon during a brief interval of the festivities at his brother s house stopped short at the sight of Marcia s face What s up he asked reaching out his arms with the unconsciousness of habit while Marcia in her blue gingham gown as mechanically retreated Her tone was tragic Ellen says she won t wait on the table she says there s work for ten in the kitchen and no lady would ask it of her And I had it all arranged so beautifully I don t know what we re to do Kitty and I have been busy every minute and Frank has had to take care of the babies all day I didn t mean to make everyone so uncomfortable He s gone out now and she s upstairs with a headache Well you know you ve always got me to fall back on said Kersley firmly My word but the dining room looks fine though I wouldn t know it for the same place His gaze rested on the pretty scene with genuine admiration Loving cups in the corner of the room held the tall yellow chrysanthemums against the florist s palms yellow chrysanthemums waved from the vine draped mantel and drooped from the prettiest loving cup of all over the yellow lined lace centerpiece set on the satin smooth best tablecloth The silver was polished to perfection The new goblets with their gilt flowers shone like bubbles and on the sideboard a golden pumpkin hollowed into a dish among trailing vines was heaped high with yellow oranges and crimson apples and pearly hothouse grapes Oh yes this is all right sighed Marcia and the cooking is and Frank has had his dress suit pressed and Kitty s gown is dear But Kersley the dinner Her swimming eyes looked at him helplessly as she pushed back her disheveled hair You can t have nine courses with no one to serve them Ellen even refuses to bring anything in We can t get up and keep running around the table It makes the whole thing a failure worse than that ridiculous I didn t mind how hard I worked for dear missus Devereaux but I did want it all to be right Poor girl said Kersley tenderly moving sympathetically very very near her with a repetition of the arm movement You re tired Now Kersley please don t Marcia again retreated with glowing cheeks She tried to keep an unexpected tremulousness out of her voice I have enough on my mind without having you too If I were to spoil all your prospects now I d never forgive myself You get so in the habit of saying that absurd thing began Kersley doggedly that Never mind never mind Marcia dear I won t bother you now But you ll have to let me have my way in one thing anyway I m going to help you out I m going to stay and wait on the table myself Kersley I ll make a bang up waiter do it in style Kersley Just pretend I m the butler It s been done lots of times before you know it s not a bit original And I d like to do something for missus Devereaux too good old multi millionairess I owe her one for being such a trump to you I ll make her one of my omelets too if Ellen will let me But missus Devereaux will recognize you Marcia felt wildly that she was half assenting in spite of the absurdity of it Recognize the butler She won t know that he exists except to pass her things Besides she s only seen me a couple of times But the family party at your brother s They ll have to get along without me I ll cut back now and tell them and get my dress suit and then I ll turn myself loose in your kitchen It s all decided Marcia He smiled brilliantly down at her from the height of his six feet as Kersley could smile sometimes when he wanted to get his own way His finger tips touched her curling locks on his way past the ottoman upon which she had dropped She sat there after he had gone her chin supported by her hand her dark eyes looking intently before her into the yellow chrysanthemum In spite of her boast to Kitty that she was satisfied with things as they were there were moments when a long drawn out future of joy withheld pressed upon little Marcia with strange heaviness moments when it was hard to be always wise for two there were indeed sudden inexplicable moments when she longed weakly to give herself up to the alluring blissfulness of Kersley s kisses on her soft lips no matter how unpractical he was But she was too stanchly eager to do what was best for him to give way in the conduct of life it was even a giddy sort of thing that she had given way to him in anything If a nervous and uncertain hilarity characterized the atmosphere of the dinner table that night missus Devereaux in her black lace and diamonds was happily unaware of its cause in the antics of the obsequious butler who in the intervals of his calling threw kisses from behind the guest to the yellow gowned Marcia attempted to poise in the attitude of flight or that of benediction or indulged in other pantomimes as extraordinary It was almost a relief when the intervals between the courses were unduly prolonged and conversation could proceed without spasmodic jerks on the part of the entertainers missus Devereaux herself a rather slight elderly woman with soft white hair elaborately arranged and kind brown eyes responded with evident pleasure to Marcia s pretty childlike warmth and was politely cordial to Frank and Kitty Her manner was at once quietly assured and quietly unassuming although on her entrance her eyes had seemed furtively observant as one who found herself among strange if interesting surroundings I feel as if we might be Eskimos by Jove Frank Fosdyke whispered with a secret gurgle to his wife who responded only with an agonized Hush This omelet is really delicious said missus Devereaux kindly in one of the pauses of the dinner I don t know that I have eaten one as good since I left Paris May I ask if you have a woman or a man cook We have a man in the kitchen said Marcia unblushingly Kersley being out there at the moment He has lived in Paris Oh the touch was unmistakable said missus Devereaux She turned graciously to Kitty I take a great interest in small establishments my niece Angela Homestead is about to marry in moderate circumstances Unlike many women in society I have always looked after my own household When I am at home the servants report to me for half an hour every morning to receive their orders for the day So when Angela naturally came to me for advice I said to her Above all things Angela remember that a good cook is always worth what you pay for him The health of the family is so largely dependent on the food With a French cook a butler a laundress and three maids a simple establishment for two people can be kept up decently and in order a retinue of servants is not necessary when you do not entertain Of course with less than three maids it is impossible to be clean No indeed said Kitty I should think not assented mister Fosdyke with unnecessary ardor It is pleasant to have you agree with me said missus Devereaux politely But speaking of Paris oddly enough since we ve been sitting here I have been reminded forcibly though I can t imagine why of a young man whom I met there a couple of times over a year ago a tall blond young artist who won a prize at the Salon I haven t heard of him since though he seemed to have rather unusual talent I believe he left for New York I can t recall his name but perhaps you can help me to it He painted children very fetchingly Was it Kersley Battersby asked Marcia with a swift frown at the owner of the name who had doubled over suddenly Kersley Battersby The very man exclaimed missus Devereaux with animation How clever you are my dear to guess it My sister the Countess of Crayford who has just come over this autumn wants some one to paint her twin girls It strikes me that he would be the very person to do it if possibly you have his address There was a sentiment a bloom one might call it that seemed to characterize his children s heads particularly They made a real impression on me Yes Battersby has a great deal of bloom said mister Fosdyke solemnly Bloom is what he excels in Alphonse fill missus Devereaux s glass I will look up his address in my notebook missus Devereaux I have an impression that he is within reach He turned to Marcia provocatively but she did not respond Her brain was suddenly in a whirl that carried her past the wild incongruities of the situation If Kersley had prospects like that She did not dare to meet his eyes The dinner was excellent the waiting perfect Marcia was in a glow of happiness She felt repaid for her work her struggles and the expenditure which would make a new gown this winter impossible This was as she had wanted it to be a little Thanksgiving feast for this woman who was her friend Through all missus Devereaux s interest in the others the little inner bond was between her and Marcia It did not matter that Ellen had stumped upstairs after the last cup of coffee leaving Kersley to clear the table or that the babies might wake up and cry Nothing mattered when she knew that dear missus Devereaux was pleased She said to herself that this was what gave her such a strangely exhilarated feeling and yet When it was time for the guest to depart and Marcia came from upstairs bringing missus Devereaux s fur cloak that lady and Kitty both looked smilingly at the girl from the midst of a conversation Must you go so soon pleaded Marcia Yes the carriage is waiting said missus Devereaux I am under the doctor s orders you remember my dear I ve had a charming Thanksgiving you don t know how much I appreciate missus Fosdyke s letting me spend it here And one thing has appealed to me particularly if you won t mind my saying it I am more complimented more touched by being made one of your little family circle without any alteration in your usual mode of living than by any amount of the ceremony which is often so foolishly considered necessary a man behind each chair masses of orchids and expensive menus She smiled warmly at Marcia and added It is to you that I really owe my introduction into this charmingly domestic household Your sister however has made me partner to a little secret in response to my inquiries she says that you are about to be engaged to the very mister Battersby of whom we were speaking and whose address she has given me so that I may make arrangements at once for my nieces portraits She tells me that he has excellent prospects Oh murmured Marcia in sudden crimson embarrassment She could actually feel Kersley s triumphant smile behind the dining room portieres And as I am about to start on the Egyptian tour that will take me away for a year I want to know if I may take advantage of having been made one of the family and ask you to make use of my cottage at Ardsley for the honeymoon which I hope may last until my return if mister Battersby s commissions don t call him away before I will have my people put it at your disposal Dear dear missus Devereaux cried Marcia If something odd in the beating of her heart made her feel her further speech to be foolishly incoherent it was perhaps not unattractively so to her smiling elders She did not hear mister Fosdyke s exclamation as the lights of missus Devereaux s carriage disappeared from view Of all the Arabian Nights entertainments Who am I anyway She had been drawn into the dining room with Kersley s outstretched arms closing around her firmly as she mechanically but ineffectually strove to retreat his blue eyes beaming down on her as he whispered Oh Marcia Marcia This comes of trying to show gratitude to strangers About to be engaged Accepting a honeymoon cottage before you d accepted the man mister CARTERET AND HIS FELLOW AMERICANS ABROAD six BY DAVID GRAY It must have been highly interesting observed missus Archie Brawle so much pleasanter than a concert Rather replied Lord Frederic It was ripping missus Ascott Smith turned to mister Carteret She had been listening to Lord Frederic Westcote who had just come down from town where he had seen the Wild West show Is it so she asked Have you ever seen them By them she meant the Indians mister Carteret nodded It seems so odd continued missus Archie Brawle that they should ride without saddles Is it a pose No I fancy not replied Lord Frederic They must get very tired without stirrups insisted missus Archie But perhaps they never ride very long at a time That is possible said Lord Frederic doubtfully They are only on about twenty minutes in the show mister Pringle the curate who had happened in to pay his monthly call upon missus Ascott Smith took advantage of the pause Of course I am no horseman he began apprehensively and I have never seen the red Indians either in their native wilds or in a show but I have read not a little about them and I have gathered that they almost live on horseback Major Hammerslea reached toward the tea table for another muffin and hemmed It is a very different thing he said with heavy impressiveness It is a very different thing The curate looked expectant as if believing that his remarks were going to be noticed But nothing was further from the Major s mind What is so very different inquired missus Ascott Smith after a pause had made it clear that the Major had ignored Pringle It is one thing my dear Madame to ride a stunted half starved pony as you say bareback and another thing to ride a conditioned British Hunter he pronounced it huntaw without a saddle I must say that the latter is an impossibility The oracle came to an end and the material Major began on the muffin There was an approving murmur of assent The Major was the author of Schooling and Riding British Hunters however it was not only his authority which swayed the company but individual conviction Of the dozen people in the room excepting Pringle all rode to hounds with more or less enthusiasm and no one had ever seen any one hunting without a saddle and no one had ever experienced any desire to try the experiment Obviously it was an absurdity Nevertheless observed Lord Frederic I must say their riding was very creditable quite as good as one sees on any polo field in England Major Hammerslea looked at him severely as if his youth were not wholly an excuse It is as I said he observed It is one thing to ride an American pony and another to ride a British Hunter One requires horsemanship the other does not And horsemanship he continued which properly is the guiding of a horse across country requires years of study and experience Lord Frederic looked somewhat unconvinced but he said nothing Of course the dear Major she called it deah Majaw is unquestionably right said missus Ascott Smith Undoubtedly said mister Carteret I suppose that he has often seen Indians ride Have you often seen these Indians ride inquired missus Ascott Smith of the Major Do you mean Indians or the Red Men of North America replied the Major And do you mean upon ponies in a show or upon British Hunters Which do you mean asked missus Ascott Smith I suppose that I mean American Indians said mister Carteret and either upon ponies or upon British Hunters No said the Major I have not Have you Not upon British Hunters said mister Carteret But do you think that they could inquired Lord Frederic It would be foolish of me to express an opinion replied mister Carteret because in the first place I have never seen them ride British Hunters over jumps They would come off at the first obstacle observed the Major more in sorrow than in anger And in the second place continued mister Carteret I am perhaps naturally prejudiced in behalf of my fellow countrymen missus Ascott Smith looked at him anxiously His sister had married a British peer But you Americans are quite distinct from the red Indians she said We quite understand that nowadays To be sure my dear Aunt She stopped Rather said missus Archie Brawle You don t even intermarry with them do you That is a matter of personal taste said mister Carteret There is no law against it But nobody that one knows began missus Ascott Smith There was John Rohlfs said mister Carteret he was a very well known chap Do you know him asked missus Brawle The Curate sniggered His hour of triumph had come Rohlfs is dead he said Really said missus Brawle coldly It had quite slipped my mind You see I never read the papers during the hunting But is his wife received I believe that she was said mister Carteret The Curate was still sniggering and missus Brawle put her glass in her eye and looked at him Then she turned to mister Carteret But all this she said of course has nothing to do with the question Do you think that these red Indians could ride bareback across our country As I said before replied mister Carteret it would be silly of me to express an opinion but I should be interested in seeing them try it I have a topping idea cried Lord Frederic He was a simple minded fellow You must tell us exclaimed missus Ascott Smith Let us have them down and take them hunting How exciting exclaimed missus Ascott Smith What sport The Major looked at her reprovingly It would be as I said he observed But it would be rather interesting said missus Brawle It might said the Major it might be interesting It would be ripping said Lord Frederic But how can we manage it I ll mount them said the Major with a grim smile My word They shall have the pick of my stable though I have to spend a month rebreaking horses that have run away But it isn t the mounts said Lord Frederic You see I ve never met any of these chaps He turned to mister Carteret with a sudden inspiration Are any of them friends of yours he asked missus Ascott Smith looked anxiously at mister Carteret as if she feared that it would develop that some of the people in the show were his cousins No he replied I don t think so although I may have met some of them in crossing the reservations But I once went shooting with Grady one of the managers of the show Better yet said Lord Frederic Do you think that he would come and bring some of them down he asked I think he would said mister Carteret He knew that the showman was strong in Grady if not the sportsman The Major rose to go to the billiard room I have one piece of advice to give you he said This prank is harmless enough but establish a definite understanding with this fellow that you are not to be liable in damages for personal injuries which his Indians may receive Explain to him that it is not child s play and have him put it in writing You mean to have him execute a kind of release said mister Carteret Precisely that said the Major I was once sued for twenty pounds by a groom that fell off my best hunter and let him run away and damme the fellow recovered He bowed to the ladies and left the room Of course we can fix all that up said Lord Frederic The old chap is a bit over cautious nowadays but how can we get hold of this fellow Grady I ll wire him at once if you wish said mister Carteret and he went to the writing table When do you want him to come down he asked as he wrote the address We might take them out with the Pytchley on Saturday said Lord Frederic but the meet is rather far from our station Perhaps it would be better to have them on Thursday with Charley Ploversdale s hounds mister Carteret hesitated a moment Wouldn t Ploversdale be apt to be fussy about experiments He s rather conservative you know about the way people are turned out I saw him send a man home one day who was out without a hat It was an American who was afraid that his hair was coming out Pish said Lord Frederic Charley Ploversdale is mild as a dove Suit yourself said mister Carteret I ll make it Thursday One more question he added How many shall I ask him to bring down At this moment the Major came into the room again He had mislaid his eyeglasses I should think that a dozen would be about the right number said Lord Frederic replying to mister Carteret It would be very imposing Too many said the Major We must mount them on good horses and I don t want my entire stable ruined by men who have never lepped a fence I think the Major is right about the matter of numbers said mister Carteret How would three do Make it three said the Major Before dinner was over a reply came from Grady saying that he and three bucks would be pleased to arrive Thursday morning prepared for a hunting party This took place on Monday and at various times during Tuesday and Wednesday mister Carteret gave the subject thought By Thursday morning his views had ripened He ordered his tea and eggs to be served in his room and came down a little past ten dressed in morning clothes He wandered into the dining room and found missus Ascott Smith sitting by the fire entertaining Lord Frederic as he went to and from the sideboard in search of things to eat Good morning said mister Carteret hoarsely Lord Frederic looked around and as he noticed mister Carteret s morning clothes his face showed surprise Hello he said you had better hurry and change or you will be late We have to start in half an hour to meet Grady mister Carteret coughed I don t think that I can go out to day It is a great disappointment Not going hunting exclaimed missus Ascott Smith What is the matter I have a bad cold said mister Carteret miserably But my dear fellow exclaimed Lord Frederic it will do your cold a world of good Not a cold like mine said mister Carteret But this is the day don t you know said Lord Frederic How am I going to manage things without you All that you have to do is to meet them at the station and take them to the meet said mister Carteret Everything else has been arranged But I m awfully disappointed said Lord Frederic I had counted on you to help don t you see and introduce them to Ploversdale It would be more graceful for an American to do it than for me You understand Yes said mister Carteret I understand It s a great disappointment but I must bear it philosophically missus Ascott Smith looked at him sympathetically and he coughed twice You are suffering she said Lord Frederic you really must not urge him to expose himself Have you a pain here she inquired touching herself in the region of the pleura Yes said mister Carteret it is rather bad but I daresay that it will soon be better I am afraid that it may be pneumonia said his hostess You must take a medicine that I have They say that it is quite wonderful for inflammatory colds I ll send Hodgson for it and she touched the bell Please please don t take that trouble entreated mister Carteret But you must take it said missus Ascott Smith They call it Broncholine You pour it in a tin and inhale it or swallow it I forget which but it s very efficacious They used it on Teddy s pony when it was sick The little creature died but that was because they gave it too much or not enough I forget which Hodgson appeared and missus Ascott Smith gave directions about the Broncholine I thank you very much said mister Carteret humbly I ll go to my room and try it at once That s a good chap said Lord Frederic perhaps you will feel so much better that you can join us Perhaps said mister Carteret gloomily or it may work as it did on the pony And he left the room After Hodgson had departed from his chamber leaving explicit directions as to how and how not to use the excellent Broncholine mister Carteret poured a quantity of it from the bottle and threw it out of the window resolving to be on the safe side Then he looked at his boots and his pink coat and white leathers which were laid out upon a chair I don t think there can be any danger he thought if I turn up after they have started I loathe stopping in all day He dressed leisurely ordered his horse and some time after the rest of the household had sallied forth he followed As he knew the country and the coverts which Lord Ploversdale would draw he counted on joining the tail of the hunt thus keeping out of sight He inquired of a rustic if he had seen hounds pass and receiving no for an answer he jogged on at a faster trot fearing that the hounds might have gone away in some other direction As he came around a bend in the road he saw four women riding toward him and as they drew near he saw that it was Lady Violet Weatherbone and her three daughters These young ladies were known as the Three Guardsmen a sobriquet not wholly inappropriate for as Lord Frederic described them they were uncommon big boned upstanding fillies between twenty five and thirty and very hard goers across any country and always together Good morning said mister Carteret bowing I suppose the hounds are close by It was a natural assumption as Lady Violet on hunting days was never very far from the hounds I do not know she responded and her tone further implied that she did not care mister Carteret hesitated a moment Has anything happened he asked Yes said Lady Violet frankly something has happened Here the daughters modestly turned their horses away Some one continued Lady Violet brought savages to the meet She paused impressively Not really said mister Carteret with hypocritical surprise Yes said Lady Violet and while it would have mattered little to me it was impossible She motioned with her head toward the three maidens and paused Forgive me said mister Carteret but I hardly understand At the first I thought said Lady Violet that they were attired in painted fleshings but upon using my glass it was clear that I was mistaken Otherwise I should have brought them away at the first moment I see said mister Carteret It is outrageous It is indeed said Lady Violet but the matter will not be allowed to drop They were brought to the meet by that young profligate Lord Frederic Westcote You surprise me said mister Carteret wholly without shame He bowed started his horse and jogged along for five minutes then he turned to the right upon a crossroad and suddenly found himself upon the hounds They were feathering excitedly about the mouth of a tile drain into which the fox had evidently gone No master huntsmen nor whips were in sight but sitting wet and mud daubed upon horses dripping with muddy water were Grady dressed in cowboy costume and three naked Indians mister Carteret glanced about over the country and understood They had swum the brook at the place where it ran between steep clay banks and the rest of the field had gone around to the bridge As he looked toward the south he saw Lord Ploversdale riding furiously toward him followed by Smith the first whip Grady had not recognized him turned out in pink as he was and for the moment he decided to remain incognito Before Lord Ploversdale Master of Fox hounds reached the road he began waving his crop He appeared excited What do you mean by riding upon my hounds he shouted He said this in several ways with various accompanying phrases but neither the Indians nor Grady seemed to notice him It occurred to mister Carteret that although Lord Ploversdale s power of expression was wonderful for England it nevertheless fell short of Arizona standards Then however he noticed that Grady was absorbed in adjusting a kodak camera with which he was evidently about to take a picture of the Indians alone with the hounds He drew back in order both to avoid being in the field of the picture and to avoid too close proximity with Lord Ploversdale as he came over the fence into the road What do you mean sir shouted the enraged Master of Fox hounds as he pulled up his horse A little more in the middle replied Grady still absorbed in taking the picture Lord Ploversdale hesitated He was speechless with surprise for the moment Grady pressed the button and began putting up the machine What do you mean by riding on my hounds you and these persons demanded Lord Ploversdale We didn t said Grady amiably but if your bunch of dogs don t know enough to keep out of the way of a horse they ought to learn Lord Ploversdale looked aghast and Smith the whip pinched himself to make sure that he was not dreaming Many thanks for your advice said Lord Ploversdale May I inquire who you and your friends may be I m James Grady said that gentleman This he said pointing to the Indian nearest is Chief Hole in the Ground of the Olgallala Sioux Him in the middle is mister Jim Snake and the one beyond is Chief Skytail being a Pawnee Thank you that is very interesting said Lord Ploversdale with polite irony Now will you kindly take them home See here said Grady strapping the camera to his saddle I was invited to this round up regular and if you hand me out any more hostile talk He paused Who invited you inquired Lord Ploversdale One of your own bunch said Grady Lord Frederic Westcote I m no butter in Your language is unintelligible said Lord Ploversdale Where is Lord Westcote mister Carteret had watched the field approaching as fast as whip and spur could drive them and in the first flight he noticed Lord Frederic and the Major For this reason he still hesitated about thrusting himself into the discussion It seemed that the interference of a third party could only complicate matters inasmuch as Lord Frederic would so soon be upon the spot Lord Ploversdale looked across the field impatiently I ve no doubt my good fellow that Lord Westcote brought you here and I ll see him about it but kindly take these fellows home They ll kill all my hounds Now you re beginning to talk reasonable said Grady I ll discuss with you The words were hardly out of his mouth before the hounds gave tongue riotously and went off The fox had slipped out of the other end of the drain and old Archer had found the line As if shot out of a gun the three Indians dashed at the stake and bound fence on the farther side of the road joyously using their heavy quirts on the Major s thoroughbreds Skytail s horse being hurried top much blundered his take off hit above the knees and rolled over on the Chief who was sitting tight There was a stifled grunt and then the Pawnee word Go dam Hole in the Ground looked back and laughed one of the few laughs of his life It was a joke which he could understand Then he used the quirt again to make the most of his advantage That one is finished said Lord Ploversdale gratefully But as the words were in his mouth Skytail rose with his horse vaulted up and was away The M F H followed over the hedge shouting at Smith to whip off the hounds But the hounds were going too fast They had got a view of the fox and three whooping horsemen were behind them driving them on The first flight of the field followed the M F H out of the road and so did mister Carteret and presently he found himself riding between Lord Frederic and the Major They were both a bit winded and had evidently come fast I say exclaimed Lord Frederic where did you come from I was cured by the Broncholine said mister Carteret Is your horse fresh asked Lord Frederic Yes replied mister Carteret I happened upon them at the road Then go after that man Grady said Lord Frederic and implore him to take those beggars home They have been riding on the hounds for twenty minutes Were they able asked mister Carteret to stay with their horses at the fences Stay with their horses puffed the Major Go on like a good chap said Lord Frederic stop that fellow or I shall be expelled from the hunt Was Lord Ploversdale vexed he added I should judge by his language said mister Carteret that he was vexed Hurry on said Lord Frederic Put your spurs in mister Carteret gave his horse its head and he shot to the front but Grady was nearly a field in the lead and it promised to be a long chase as he was on the Major s black thoroughbred The cowboy rode along with a loose rein and an easy balance seat At his fences he swung his hat and cheered He seemed to be enjoying himself and mister Carteret was anxious lest he might begin to shoot for pure delight Such a demonstration would have been misconstrued Nearly two hundred yards ahead at the heels of the pack galloped the Indians and in the middle distance between them and Grady rode Lord Ploversdale and Smith vainly trying to overtake the hounds and whip them off Behind and trailing over a mile or more came the field and the rest of the hunt servants in little groups all awestruck at what had happened It was unspeakable that Lord Ploversdale s hounds which had been hunted by his father and his grandfather should be so scandalized mister Carteret finally got within a length of Grady and hailed him Hello Carty said Grady glad to see you I thought you was sick What can I do They ve stampeded But it s a great ad for the show isn t it There s four reporters that I brought along Forget about the show said mister Carteret This isn t any laughing matter It s one of the smartest packs in England You don t understand It will make all the better story in the papers said Grady No it won t said mister Carteret They won t print it It s like a blasphemy upon the Church Whoop yelled Grady as they tore through a bullfinch Call them off said mister Carteret straightening his hat But I can t catch em said Grady and that was the truth Lord Ploversdale however had been gaining on the Indians and by the way in which he clubbed his heavy crop loaded at the butt it was apparent that he meant to put an end to the proceedings if he could Just then the hounds swept over the crest of a green hill and as they went down the other side they viewed the fox in the field beyond He was in distress and it looked as if the pack would kill in the open They were running wonderfully together a blanket would have covered them and in the natural glow of pride which came over the M F H he loosened his grip upon the crop But as the hounds viewed the fox so did the three sons of the wilderness who were following close behind From the hill top fifty of the hardest going men in England saw Hole in the Ground flogging his horse with the heavy quirt which hung from his wrist The outraged British hunter shot forward scattering hounds to right and left flew a ditch and hedge and was close on the fox who had stopped to make a last stand Without drawing rein the astonished onlookers saw the lean Indian suddenly disappear under the neck of his horse and almost instantly swing back into his seat waving a brown thing above his head Hole in the Ground had caught the fox Most unprecedented mister Carteret heard the Major exclaim He pulled up his horse as the field did with theirs and waited apprehensively He saw Hole in the Ground circle around jerk the Major s five hundred guinea hunter to a standstill close to Lord Ploversdale and address him He was speaking in his own language As the Chief went on he saw Grady smile He says says Grady translating that the white chief can eat the fox if he wants him He s proud himself bein packed with store grub The English onlookers heard and beheld with blank faces It was beyond them The M F H bowed stiffly as Hole in the Ground s offer was made known to him He regarded them a moment in thought A vague light was breaking in upon him Aw thank you he said Smith take the fox Good afternoon Then he wheeled his horse called the hounds in with his horn and trotted out to the road that led to the kennels Lord Ploversdale though he had never been out of England was cast in a large mold The three Indians sat on their panting horses motionless stolidly facing the curious gaze of the crowd or rather they looked through the crowd as the lion with the high breeding of the desert looks through and beyond the faces that stare and gape before the bars of his cage Most amazing Most amazing muttered the Major It is said mister Carteret if you have never been away from this He made a sweeping gesture over the restricted English scenery pampered and brought up by hand Been away from this repeated the Major I don t understand mister Carteret turned to him How could he explain it With us he began laying an emphasis on the us Then he stopped Look into their eyes he said hopelessly The Major looked at him blankly How could he Major Hammerslea know what those inexplicable dark eyes saw beyond the fenced tillage the brown bare illimitable range under the noonday sun the evening light on far silent mountains the starlit desert FOOTNOTES six Copyright nineteen oh five by the Metropolitan Magazine Company A BOSTON BALLAD BY WALT WHITMAN To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early Here s a good place at the corner I must stand and see the show Clear the way there Jonathan Way for the President s marshal Way for the government cannon Way for the Federal foot and dragoons and the apparitions copiously tumbling I love to look on the stars and stripes I hope the fifes will play Yankee Doodle How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops Every man holds his revolver marching stiff through Boston town A fog follows antiques of the same come limping Some appear wooden legged and some appear bandaged and bloodless Why this is indeed a show It has called the dead out of the earth The old grave yards of the hills have hurried to see Phantoms phantoms countless by flank and rear Cocked hats of mothy mould crutches made of mist Arms in slings old men leaning on young men s shoulders What troubles you Yankee phantoms What is all this chattering of bare gums Does the ague convulse your limbs Do you mistake your crutches for fire locks and level them If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President s marshal If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon For shame old maniacs Bring down those tossed arms and let your white hair be Here gape your great grand sons their wives gaze at them from the windows See how well dressed see how

to its own and more than its own Stick your hands in your pockets Jonathan you are a made man from this day You are mighty cute and here is one of your bargains THE CHIEF MATE BY JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL My first glimpse of Europe was the shore of Spain Since we got into the Mediterranean we have been becalmed for some days within easy view of it All along are fine mountains brown all day and with a bloom on them at sunset like that of a ripe plum Here and there at their feet little white towns are sprinkled along the edge of the water like the grains of rice dropped by the princess in the story Sometimes we see larger buildings on the mountain slopes probably convents I sit and wonder whether the farther peaks may not be the Sierra Morena the rusty saw of Don Quixote I resolve that they shall be and am content Surely latitude and longitude never showed me any particular respect that I should be over scrupulous with them But after all Nature though she may be more beautiful is nowhere so entertaining as in man and the best thing I have seen and learned at sea is our Chief Mate My first acquaintance with him was made over my knife which he asked to look at and after a critical examination handed back to me saying I shouldn t wonder if that ere was a good piece o stuff Since then he has transferred a part of his regard for my knife to its owner I like folks who like an honest bit of steel and take no interest whatever in your Raphaels Correggios and stuff There is always more than the average human nature in the man who has a hearty sympathy with iron It is a manly metal with no sordid associations like gold and silver My sailor fully came up to my expectation on further acquaintance He might well be called an old salt who had been wrecked on Spitzbergen before I was born He was not an American but I should never have guessed it by his speech which was the purest Cape Cod and I reckon myself a good taster of dialects Nor was he less Americanized in all his thoughts and feelings a singular proof of the ease with which our omnivorous country assimilates foreign matter provided it be Protestant for he was a man ere he became an American citizen He used to walk the deck with his hands in his pockets in seeming abstraction but nothing escaped his eyes How he saw I could never make out though I had a theory that it was with his elbows After he had taken me or my knife into his confidence he took care that I should see whatever he deemed of interest to a landsman Without looking up he would say suddenly There s a whale blowin clearn up to win ard or Them s porpises to leeward that means change o wind He is as impervious to cold as a polar bear and paces the deck during his watch much as one of those yellow hummocks goes slumping up and down his cage On the Atlantic if the wind blew a gale from the northeast and it was cold as an English summer he was sure to turn out in a calico shirt and trousers his furzy brown chest half bare and slippers without stockings But lest you might fancy this to have chanced by defect of wardrobe he comes out in a monstrous pea jacket here in the Mediterranean when the evening is so hot that Adam would have been glad to leave off his fig leaves It s a kind o damp and unwholesome in these ere waters he says evidently regarding the Midland Sea as a vile standing pool in comparison with the bluff ocean At meals he is superb not only for his strengths but his weaknesses He has somehow or other come to think me a wag and if I ask him to pass the butter detects an occult joke and laughs as much as is proper for a mate For you must know that our social hierarchy on shipboard is precise and the second mate were he present would only laugh half as much as the first mister X always combs his hair and works himself into a black frock coat on Sundays he adds a waist coat before he comes to meals sacrificing himself nobly and painfully to the social proprieties The second mate on the other hand who eats after us enjoys the privilege of shirt sleeves and is I think the happier man of the two We do not have seats above and below the salt as in old time but above and below the white sugar mister X always takes brown sugar and it is delightful to see how he ignores the existence of certain delicates which he considers above his grade tipping his head on one side with an air of abstraction so that he may seem not to deny himself but to omit helping himself from inadvertence or absence of mind At such times he wrinkles his forehead in a peculiar manner inscrutable at first as a cuneiform inscription but as easily read after you once get the key The sense of it is something like this I X know my place a height of wisdom attained by few Whatever you may think I do not see that currant jelly nor that preserved grape Especially a kind Providence has made me blind to bowls of white sugar and deaf to the pop of champagne corks It is much that a merciful compensation gives me a sense of the dingier hue of Havana and the muddier gurgle of beer Are there potted meats My physician has ordered me three pounds of minced salt junk at every meal There is such a thing you know as a ship s husband X is the ship s poor relation As I have said he takes also a below the white sugar interest in the jokes laughing by precise point of compass just as he would lay the ship s course all yawing being out of the question with his scrupulous decorum at the helm Once or twice I have got the better of him and touched him off into a kind of compromised explosion like that of damp fireworks that splutter and simmer a little and then go out with painful slowness and occasional relapses But his fuse is always of the unwillingest and you must blow your match and touch him off again and again with the same joke Or rather you must magnetize him many times to get him en rapport with a jest This once accomplished you have him and one bit of fun will last the whole voyage He prefers those of one syllable the a b abs of humor The gradual fattening of the steward a benevolent mulatto with whiskers and ear rings who looks as if he had been meant for a woman and had become a man by accident as in some of those stories by the elder physiologists is an abiding topic of humorous comment with mister X That ere stooard he says with a brown grin like what you might fancy on the face of a serious and aged seal s agittin as fat s a porpis He was as thin s a shingle when he come aboord last v yge Them trousis ll bust yit He don t darst take em off nights for the whole ship s company couldn t git him into em agin And then he turns aside to enjoy the intensity of his emotion by himself and you hear at intervals low rumblings an indigestion of laughter He tells me of saint Elmo s fires Marvell s corposants though with him the original corpos santos has suffered a sea change and turned to comepleasants pledges of fine weather I shall not soon find a pleasanter companion It is so delightful to meet a man who knows just what you do not Nay I think the tired mind finds something in plump ignorance like what the body feels in cushiony moss Talk of the sympathy of kindred pursuits It is the sympathy of the upper and nether mill stones both forever grinding the same grist and wearing each other smooth One has not far to seek for book nature artist nature every variety of superinduced nature in short but genuine human nature is hard to find And how good it is Wholesome as a potato fit company for any dish The free masonry of cultivated men is agreeable but artificial and I like better the natural grip with which manhood recognizes manhood X has one good story and with that I leave him wishing him with all my heart that little inland farm at last which is his calenture as he paces the windy deck One evening when the clouds looked wild and whirling I asked X if it was coming on to blow No I guess not said he bumby the moon ll be up and scoff away that ere loose stuff His intonation set the phrase scoff away in quotation marks as plain as print So I put a query in each eye and he went on Ther was a Dutch cappen onct an his mate come to him in the cabin where he sot takin his schnapps an says Cappen it s agittin thick an looks kin o squally hedn t we s good s shorten sail Gimmy my alminick says the cappen So he looks at it a spell an says he The moon s due in less n half an hour an she ll scoff away ev ythin clare agin So the mate he goes an bumby down he comes agin an says Cappen this ere s the allfiredest powerfullest moon t ever you did see She s scoffed away the main togallants l an she s to work on the foretops l now Guess you d better look in the alminick agin and fin out when this moon sets So the cappen thought twas bout time to go on deck Dreadful slow them Dutch cappens be And X walked away rumbling inwardly like the rote of the sea heard afar THE ROAD TO A WOMAN S HEART

4267_78186_000002_000000	train-clean-100	As we approached the inn at Amherst the Clockmaker grew uneasy 
4267_78186_000002_000001	train-clean-100	 It s pretty well on in the evening I guess said he and Marm Pugwash is as onsartin in her temper as a mornin in April it s all sunshine or all clouds with her and if she s in one of her tantrums she ll stretch out her neck and hiss like a goose with a flock of goslin s 
4267_78186_000002_000002	train-clean-100	I wonder what on airth Pugwash was a thinkin on when he signed articles of partnership with that are woman she s not a bad lookin piece of furniture neither and it s a proper pity sich a clever woman should carry sich a stiff upper lip 
4267_78186_000002_000003	train-clean-100	She reminds me of our old minister Joshua Hopewell s apple trees 
none	none	The old minister had an orchard of most particular good fruit for he was a great hand at buddin graftin and what not and the orchard it was on the south side of the house stretched right up to the road Well there were some trees hung over the fence I never seed such bearers the apples hung in ropes for all the world like strings of onions and the fruit was beautiful Nobody touched the minister s apples and when other folks lost their n from the boys his n always hung there like bait t a hook but there never was so much as a nibble at em So I said to him one day Minister said I how on airth do you manage to keep your fruit that s so exposed when no one else can t do it nohow Why says he they are dreadfully pretty fruit ain t they I guess said I there ain t the like on em in all Connecticut Well says he I ll tell you the secret but you needn t let on to no one about it 
4267_78186_000003_000003	train-clean-100	That are row next the fence I grafted it myself I took great pains to get the right kind 
none	none	I sent clean up to Roxberry and away down to Squawneck Creek I was afeard he was a goin to give me day and date for every graft bein a terrible long winded man in his stories so says I I know that minister but how do you preserve them Why I was a goin to tell you said he when you stopped me 
4267_78186_000003_000005	train-clean-100	That are outward row I grafted myself with the choicest kind I could find and I succeeded 
none	none	They are beautiful but so etarnal sour no human soul can eat them 
4267_78186_000003_000007	train-clean-100	Well the boys think the old minister s graftin has all succeeded about as well as that row and they sarch no further 
4267_78186_000003_000008	train-clean-100	They snicker at my graftin and I laugh in my sleeve I guess at their penetration 
4267_78186_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 Now Marm Pugwash is like the minister s apples very temptin fruit to look at but desperate sour 
4267_78186_000004_000001	train-clean-100	If Pugwash had a watery mouth when he married I guess it s pretty puckery by this time 
4267_78186_000004_000002	train-clean-100	However if she goes to act ugly I ll give her a dose of soft sawder that will take the frown out of her frontispiece and make her dial plate as smooth as a lick of copal varnish 
4267_78186_000004_000003	train-clean-100	It s a pity she s such a kickin devil too for she has good points good eye good foot neat pastern fine chest a clean set of limbs and carries a good But here we are 
none	none	Now you ll see what soft sawder will do 
4267_78186_000005_000000	train-clean-100	When we entered the house the travelers room was all in darkness and on opening the opposite door into the sitting room we found the female part of the family extinguishing the fire for the night 
4267_78186_000005_000001	train-clean-100	missus Pugwash had a broom in her hand and was in the act the last act of female housewifery of sweeping the hearth 
4267_78186_000005_000002	train-clean-100	The strong flickering light of the fire as it fell upon her tall fine figure and beautiful face revealed a creature worthy of the Clockmaker s comments 
4267_78186_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Good evening marm said mister Slick 
4267_78186_000006_000001	train-clean-100	 How do you do and how s mister Pugwash He said she why he s been abed this hour 
4267_78186_000006_000002	train-clean-100	You don t expect to disturb him this time of night I hope Oh no said mister Slick certainly not and I am sorry to have disturbed you but we got detained longer than we expected I am sorry that 
4267_78186_000006_000003	train-clean-100	 So am I said she but if mister Pugwash will keep an inn when he has no occasion to his family can t expect no rest 
4267_78186_000007_000000	train-clean-100	Here the Clockmaker seeing the storm gathering stooped down suddenly and staring intently held out his hand and exclaimed Well if that ain t a beautiful child 
4267_78186_000007_000001	train-clean-100	Come here my little man and shake hands along with me 
4267_78186_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Well I declare if that are little feller ain t the finest child I ever seed 
4267_78186_000007_000003	train-clean-100	What not abed yet 
none	none	Ah you rogue where did you get them are pretty rosy cheeks 
4267_78186_000007_000005	train-clean-100	Stole them from mama eh 
4267_78186_000007_000006	train-clean-100	Well I wish my old mother could see that child it is such a treat 
4267_78186_000007_000007	train-clean-100	In our country said he turning to me the children are all as pale as chalk or as yaller as an orange 
4267_78186_000007_000008	train-clean-100	Lord that are little feller would be a show in our country 
none	none	Come to me my man Here the soft sawder began to operate missus Pugwash said in a milder tone than we had yet heard Go my dear to the gentleman go dear mister Slick kissed him asked him if he would go to the States along with him told him all the little girls would fall in love with him for they didn t see such a beautiful face once in a month of Sundays
4267_78186_000007_000010	train-clean-100	 Black eyes let me see ah mama s eyes too and black hair also as I am alive you are mama s own boy the very image of mama Do be seated gentlemen said missus Pugwash 
none	none	Sally make a fire in the next room She ought to be proud of you he continued Well if I live to return here I must paint your face and have it put on my clocks and our folks will buy the clocks for the sake of the face 
4267_78186_000007_000012	train-clean-100	Did you ever see said he again addressing me such a likeness between one human and another as between this beautiful little boy and his mother 
4267_78186_000007_000013	train-clean-100	 I am sure you have had no supper said missus Pugwash to me you must be hungry and weary too 
4267_78186_000007_000014	train-clean-100	I will get you a cup of tea I am sorry to give you so much trouble said I Not the least trouble in the world she replied on the contrary a pleasure 
4267_78186_000008_000000	train-clean-100	We were then shown into the next room where the fire was now blazing up but mister Slick protested he could not proceed without the little boy and lingered behind to ascertain his age and concluded by asking the child if he had any aunts that looked like mama 
4267_78186_000009_000000	train-clean-100	As the door closed mister Slick said It s a pity she don t go well in gear 
none	none	The difficulty with those critters is to git them to start arter that there is no trouble with them if you don t check em too short If you do they ll stop again run back and kick like mad and then Old Nick himself wouldn t start em 
4267_78186_000009_000003	train-clean-100	Pugwash I guess don t understand the natur of the crittur she ll never go kind in harness for him 
none	none	When I see a child said the Clockmaker I always feel safe with these women folk for I have always found that the road to a woman s heart lies through her child You seem said I to understand the female heart so well I make no doubt you are a general favorite among the fair sex Any man he replied that understands horses has a pretty considerable fair knowledge of women for they are jist alike in temper and require the very identical same treatment Encourage the timid ones be gentle and steady with the fractious but lather the sulky ones like blazes People talk an everlastin sight of nonsense about wine women and horses I ve bought and sold em all I ve traded in all of them and I tell you there ain t one in a thousand that knows a grain about either on em You hear folks say Oh such a man is an ugly grained critter he ll break his wife s heart jist as if a woman s heart was as brittle as a pipe stalk The female heart as far as my experience goes is jist like a new india rubber shoe you may pull and pull at it till it stretches out a yard long and then let go and it will fly right back to its old shape Their hearts are made of stout leather I tell you there s a plaguy sight of wear in em
4267_78186_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 I never knowed but one case of a broken heart and that was in t other sex one Washington Banks 
4267_78186_000012_000001	train-clean-100	He was a sneezer 
none	none	He was tall enough to spit down on the heads of your grenadiers and near about high enough to wade across Charlestown River and as strong as a tow boat I guess he was somewhat less than a foot longer than the moral law and catechism too He was a perfect pictur of a man you couldn t fault him in no particular he was so just a made critter folks used to run to the winder when he passed and say There goes Washington Banks beant he lovely I do believe there wasn t a gal in the Lowell factories that warn t in love with him Sometimes at intermission on Sabbath days when they all came out together an amazin handsom sight too near about a whole congregation of young gals Banks used to say I vow young ladies I wish I had five hundred arms to reciprocate one with each of you but I reckon I have a heart big enough for you all it s a whopper you may depend and every mite and morsel of it at your service Well how you do act mister Banks half a thousand little clipper clapper tongues would say all at the same time and their dear little eyes sparklin like so many stars twinklin of a frosty night
4267_78186_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Well when I last seed him he was all skin and bone like a horse turned out to die 
4267_78186_000013_000001	train-clean-100	He was teetotally defleshed a mere walkin skeleton I am dreadful sorry says I to see you Banks lookin so peaked Why you look like a sick turkey hen all legs 
none	none	What on airth ails you I m dyin says he of a broken heart What I says I have the gals been jiltin you No no says he I beant such a fool as that neither Well says I have you made a bad speculation No says he shakin his head I hope I have too much clear grit in me to take on so bad for that What under the sun is it then said I Why says he I made a bet the fore part of the summer with Leftenant Oby Knowles that I could shoulder the best bower of the Constitution frigate I won my bet but the anchor was so etarnal heavy that it broke my heart Sure enough he did die that very fall and he was the only instance I ever heard tell of a broken heart ICARUS BY JOHN G SAXE I All modern themes of poesy are spun so very fine That now the most amusing muse e gratia such as mine Is often forced to cut the thread that strings our recent rhymes And try the stronger staple of the good old classic times II There lived and flourished long ago in famous Athens town One Daedalus a carpenter of genius and renown Twas he who with an auger taught mechanics how to bore An art which the philosophers monopolized before III His only son was Icarus a most precocious lad The pride of missus Daedalus the image of his dad And while he yet was in his teens such progress he had made He d got above his father s size and much above his trade IV Now Daedalus the carpenter had made a pair of wings Contrived of wood and feathers and a cunning set of springs By means of which the wearer could ascend to any height And sail about among the clouds as easy as a kite V O father said young Icarus how I should like to fly And go like you where all is blue along the upper sky How very charming it would be above the moon to climb And scamper through the Zodiac and have a high old time VI Oh wouldn t it be jolly though to stop at all the inns To take a luncheon at The Crab and tipple at The Twins And just for fun and fancy while careering through the air To kiss the Virgin tease the Ram and bait the biggest Bear VII O father please to let me go was still the urchin s cry I ll be extremely careful sir and won t go very high Oh if this little pleasure trip you only will allow I promise to be back again in time to fetch the cow VIII You re rather young said Daedalus to tempt the upper air But take the wings and mind your eye with very special care And keep at least a thousand miles below the nearest star Young lads when out upon a lark are apt to go too far IX He took the wings that foolish boy without the least dismay His father stuck em on with wax and so he soared away Up up he rises like a bird and not a moment stops Until he s fairly out of sight beyond the mountain tops X And still he flies away away it seems the merest fun No marvel he is getting bold and aiming at the sun No marvel he forgets his sire it isn t very odd That one so far above the earth should think himself a god XI Already in his silly pride he s gone too far aloft The heat begins to scorch his wings the wax is waxing soft Down down he goes Alas next day poor Icarus was found Afloat upon the AEgean Sea extremely damp and drowned L ENVOI The moral of this mournful tale is plain enough to all Don t get above your proper sphere or you may chance to fall Remember too that borrowed plumes are most uncertain things And never try to scale the sky with other people s wings VIVE LA BAGATELLE Swift s Cheerful Creed BY CLINTON SCOLLARD A bumper to the jolly Dean Who in Augustan times Made merriment for fat and lean In jocund prose and rhymes Ah but he drove a pranksome quill With quips he wove a spell His creed he cried it with a will Was Vive la bagatelle Oh there were reckless jesters then And when a man was hit He quick returned the stroke again With trenchant blade of wit Twas parry thrust and counter thrust That round the board befell They quaffed the wine and crunched the crust With Vive la bagatelle How rang the genial laugh of Gay At Pope s defiant ire How Parnell s sallies brought in play The rapier wit of Prior And how o er all the banter s shift The laughter s fall and swell Upleaped the great guffaw of Swift With Vive la bagatelle O moralist frown not so dark

STACCATO TO O LE LUPE BY BLISS CARMAN O Le Lupe Gelett Burgess this is very sad to find In The Bookman for September in a manner most unkind There appears a half page picture makes me think I ve lost

and Verlaine we all adore And a little book of verses with its betters by the score With three faces on the cover I believe I ve seen before Well here s matter for reflection makes me wonder where I am Here is Ibsen the gray lion linked to Beardsley the black lamb I was never out of Boston all that I can say is Damn Who could think in two short summers we should cause so much remark With no purpose but our pastime and to make the public hark When I soloed on The Chap Book and you answered with The Lark Do young people take much pleasure when they read that sort of thing Well they buy it answered Doxey and I take what it will bring Publishers may dread extinction not with such fads on the string There is always sale for something and demand for what is new These young men who are so restless and have nothing else to do Like to think there is a movement just to keep themselves in view There is nothing in Decadence but the magic of a name People talk and papers drivel scent a vice and hint a shame And all that is good for business helps to boom my little game But when I sit down to reason think to stand upon my nerve Meditate on portly leisure with a balance in reserve In he comes with his Decadence like a fly in my preserve I can see myself O Burgess half a century from now Laid to rest among the ghostly like a broken toy somehow All my lovely songs and ballads vanished with your Purple Cow But I will return some morning though I know it will be hard To Cornhill among the bookstalls and surprise some minor bard Turning over their old rubbish for the treasures we discard I shall warn him like a critic creeping when his back is turned Ink and paper dead and done with Doxey spent what Doxey earned Poems doubtless are immortal where a poem can be discerned How his face will go to ashes when he feels his empty purse How he ll wish his vogue were greater plume himself it is no worse Then go bother the dear public with his puny little verse Don t I know how he will pose it patronize our larger time Poor old Browning little Kipling what attempts they made to rhyme Just let me have half an hour with the nincompoop sublime I will haunt him like a purpose I will ghost him like a fear When he least expects my presence I ll be mumbling in his ear O Le Lupe lived in Frisco and I lived in Boston here Never heard of us Good heavens can you never have been told Of the Larks we used to publish and the Chap Books that we sold Where are all our first edition I feel damp and full of mould A GUEST AT THE LUDLOW BY BILL NYE We are stopping quietly here taking our meals in our rooms mostly and going out very little indeed When I say we I use the term editorially We notice first of all the great contrast between this and other hotels and in several instances this one is superior In the first place there is a sense of absolute security when one goes to sleep here that can not be felt at a popular hotel where burglars secrete themselves in the wardrobe during the day and steal one s pantaloons and contents at night This is one of the compensations of life in prison Here the burglars go to bed at the hour that the rest of us do We all retire at the same time and a murderer can not sit up any later at night than the smaller or unknown criminal can You can get to Ludlow Street Jail by taking the Second avenue Elevated train to Grand street and then going east two blocks or you can fire a shotgun into a Sabbath school You can pay five cents to the Elevated Railroad and get here or you can put some other man s nickel in your own slot and come here with an attendant William Marcy Tweed was the contractor of Ludlow Street Jail and here also he died He was the son of a poor chair maker and was born April three eighteen twenty three From the chair business in eighteen fifty three to congress was the first false step Exhilarated by the delirium of official life and the false joys of franking his linen home every week and having cake and preserves franked back to him at Washington he resolved to still further taste the delights of office and in eighteen fifty seven we find him as a school commissioner In eighteen sixty he became Grand Sachem of the Tammany Society an association at that time more purely political than politically pure As president of the board of supervisors head of the department of public works state senator and Grand Sachem of Tammany Tweed had a large and seductive influence over the city and state The story of how he earned a scanty livelihood by stealing a million of dollars at a pop and thus with the most rigid economy scraped together twenty million dollars in a few years by patient industry and smoking plug tobacco has been frequently told Tweed was once placed here in Ludlow Street Jail in default of three million dollars bail How few there are of us who could slap up that amount of bail if rudely gobbled on the street by the hand of the law While riding out with the sheriff in eighteen seventy five Tweed asked to see his wife and said he would be back in a minute He came back by way of Spain in the fall of seventy six looking much improved But the malaria and dissipation of Blackwell s Island afterward impaired his health and having done time there and having been arrested afterward and placed in Ludlow Street Jail he died here April twelve eighteen seventy eight leaving behind him a large vain world and an equally vain judgment for six million five hundred thirty seven thousand one hundred seventeen dollars thirty eight cents to which he said he would give his attention as soon as he could get a paving contract in the sweet ultimately From the exterior Ludlow Street Jail looks somewhat like a conservatory of music but as soon as one enters he readily discovers his mistake The structure has one hundred feet frontage and a court which is sometimes called the court of last resort The guest can climb out of this court by ascending a polished brick wall about one hundred feet high and then letting himself down in a similar way on the Ludlow street side That one thing is doing a great deal toward keeping quite a number of people here who would otherwise I think go away James D Fish and Ferdinand Ward both remained here prior to their escape to Sing Sing Red Leary also made his escape from this point but did not succeed in reaching the penitentiary Forty thousand prisoners have been confined in Ludlow Street Jail mostly for civil offenses A man in New York runs a very short career if he tries to be offensively civil As you enter Ludlow Street Jail the door is carefully closed after you and locked by means of an iron lock about the size of a pictorial family Bible You then remain on the inside for quite a spell You do not hear the prattle of soiled children any more All the glad sunlight and stench condensing pavements and the dark haired inhabitants of Rivington street are seen no longer and the heavy iron storm door shuts out the wail of the combat from the alley near by Ludlow Street Jail may be surrounded by a very miserable and dirty quarter of the city but when you get inside all is changed You register first There is a good pen there that you can write with and the clerk does not chew tolu and read a sporting paper while you wait for a room He is there to attend to business and he attends to it He does not seem to care whether you have any baggage or not You can stay here for days even if you don t have any baggage All you need is a kind word and a mittimus from the court One enters this sanitarium either as a boarder or a felon If you decide to come in as a boarder you pay the warden fifteen dollars a week for the privilege of sitting at his table and eating the luxuries of the market You also get a better room than at many hotels and you have a good strong door with a padlock on it which enables you to prevent the sudden and unlooked for entrance of the chambermaid It is a good sized room with a wonderful amount of seclusion a plain bed table chairs carpet and so forth After a few weeks at the seaside at nineteen dollars per day I think the room in which I am writing is not unreasonable at two dollars Still of course we miss the sea breeze You can pay fifty dollars to one hundred dollars per week here if you wish and get your money s worth too For the latter sum one may live in the bridal chamber so to speak and eat the very best food all the time Heavy iron bars keep the mosquitoes out and at night the house is brilliantly lighted by incandescent lights of one candle power each Neat snuffers consisting of the thumb and forefinger polished on the hair are to be found in each occupied room Bread is served to the Freshmen and Juniors in rectangular wads It is such bread as convicts tears have moistened many thousand years In that way it gets quite moist The most painful feature about life in Ludlow Street Jail is the confinement One can not avoid a feeling of being constantly hampered and hemmed in One more disagreeable thing is the great social distinction here The poor man who sleeps in a stone niche near the roof and who is constantly elbowed and hustled out of his bed by earnest and restless vermin with a tendency toward insomnia is harassed by meeting in the court yard and corridors the paying boarders who wear good clothes live well have their cigars brandy and Kentucky Sec all the time The Mc Allister crowd here is just as exclusive as it is on the outside But great Scott what a comfort it is to a man like me who has been nearly killed by a cyclone to feel the firm secure walls and solid time lock when he goes to bed at night Even if I can not belong to the four hundred I am almost happy We retire at seven thirty o clock at night and arise at six thirty in the morning so as to get an early start A man who has five or ten years to stay in a place like this naturally likes to get at it as soon as possible each day and so he gets up at six thirty We dress by the gaudy light of the candle and while we do so we remember far away at home our wife and the little boy asleep in her arms They do not get up at six thirty It is at this hour we remember the fragrant drawer in the dresser at home where our clean shirts and collars and cuffs and socks and handkerchiefs are put every week by our wife We also recall as we go about our stone den with its odor of former corned beef and the ghost of some bloody handed predecessor s snore still moaning in the walls the picture of green grass by our own doorway and the apples that were just ripening when the bench warrant came The time from six thirty to breakfast is occupied by the average or non paying inmate in doing the chamberwork and tidying up his state room I do not know how others feel about it but I dislike chamberwork most heartily especially when I am in jail Nothing has done more to keep me out of jail I guess than the fact that while there I have to make up my bed and dust the piano Breakfast is generally table d hote and consists of bread A tin cup of coffee takes the taste of the bread out of your mouth and then if you have some Limburger cheese in your pocket you can with that remove the taste of the coffee Dinner is served at twelve o clock and consists of more bread with soup This soup has everything in it except nourishment The bead on this soup is noticeable for quite a distance It is disagreeable Several days ago I heard that the Mayor was in the soup but I didn t realize it before I thought it was a newspaper yarn There is everything in this soup from shop worn rice up to neat s foot oil Once I thought I detected cuisine in it The dinner menu is changed on Fridays Sundays and Thursdays on which days you get the soup first and the bread afterward In this way the bread is saved Three days in a week each man gets at dinner a potato containing a thousand legged worm At six o clock comes supper with toast and responses Bread is served at supper time together with a cup of tea To those who dislike bread and never eat soup or do not drink tea or coffee life at Ludlow Street Jail is indeed irksome I asked for kumiss and a pony of Benedictine as my stone boudoir made me feel rocky but it has not yet been sent up Somehow while here I can not forget poor old man Dorrit the Master of the Marshalsea and how the Debtors Prison preyed upon his mind till he didn t enjoy anything except to stand off and admire himself Ludlow Street Jail is a good deal like it in many ways and I can see how in time the canker of unrest and the bitter memories of those who did us wrong but who are basking in the bright and bracing air while we to meet their obligations sacrifice our money our health and at last our minds would kill hope and ambition In a few weeks I believe I should also get a preying on my mind That is about the last thing I would think of preying on but a man must eat something Before closing this brief and incomplete account as a guest at Ludlow Street Jail I ought in justice to my family to say perhaps that I came down this morning to see a friend of mine who is here because he refuses to pay alimony to his recreant and morbidly sociable wife He says he is quite content to stay here so long as his wife is on the outside He is writing a small ready reference book on his side of the great problem Is Marriage a Failure With this I shake him by the hand and in a moment the big iron storm door clangs behind me the big lock clicks in its hoarse black throat and I welcome even the air of Ludlow street so long as the blue sky is above it THE ENCHANTED HAT The Adventure of My Lady s Letter BY HAROLD MACGRATH It was half after six when I entered Martin s from the Broadway side I chose a table by the north wall and sat down on the cushioned seat I ordered dinner and the ample proportions of it completely hoodwinked the waiter as to the condition of my cardiac affliction being as I was desperately and hopelessly and miserably in love Old owls say that a man can not eat when he is in love He can if he is mad at the way the object of his affections has treated him and I was mad To be sure I can not recall what my order was but the amount of the waiter s check is still vivid to my recollection I glanced about The cafe was crowded as it usually is at this hour Here and there I caught glimpses of celebrities and familiar faces journalists musicians authors artists and actors This is the time they drop in to be pointed out to strangers from out of town It s a capital advertisement To night however none of these interested me in the slightest degree rather their animated countenances angered me How could they laugh and look happy At my left sat a young man about my own age He was also in evening dress At my right a benevolent old gentleman whose eye glasses balanced neatly upon the end of his nose was deeply interested in The Law Journal and a pint pf mineral water A little beyond my table was an exiled Frenchman and the irritating odor of absinthe drifted at times across my nostrils With my coffee I ordered a glass of Dantzic and watched the flakes of beaten gold waver and settle and presently I devoted myself entirely to my own particularly miserable thoughts To be in love and in debt To be with the gods one moment and hunted by a bill collector the next To have the girl you love snub and dismiss you for no more lucid reason than that you did not attend the dance at the Country Club when you promised you would It did not matter that you had a case on that night from which depended a large slice of your bread and butter no that did not matter Neither did the fact that you had mixed the dates You had promised to go and you hadn t gone or notified the girl that you wouldn t go Your apologetic telegram she had torn into halves and returned the following morning together with a curt note to the effect that she could not value the friendship of a man who made and broke a promise so easily It was all over It was a dashed hard world How the deuce do you win a girl anyhow Supposing besides that you possessed a rich uncle who said that on the day of your wedding he would make over to you fifty thousand in Government three per cents Hard wasn t it Suppose that you were earning about two thousand a year and that the struggle to keep up smart appearances was a keen one Wouldn t you have been eager to marry especially the girl you loved A man can not buy flowers twice a week dine before and take supper after the theater twice a week belong and pay dues and house accounts to a country club a town club and keep respectable bachelor apartments on two thousand and save anything And suppose the girl was independently rich Heigh ho I find that a man needs more money in love than he does in debt This is not to say that I was ever very hard pressed but I hated to pay ten dollars on account when the total was only twenty You understand me don t you If you don t somebody who reads this will Of course the girl knew nothing about these things A young man always falls into the fault of magnifying his earning capacity to the girl he loves You see I hadn t told her yet that I loved her though I was studying up somebody on Moral and Physical Courage for that purpose And now it was all over I did not care so much about my uncle s gold bonds but I did think a powerful lot of the girl Why when I recall the annoyances I ve put up with from that kid brother of hers Pshaw what s the use His mother called him Toddy One Boy in memory of a book she had read long years ago He was six years old and I never think of him without that jingle coming to mind Little Willie choked his sister She was dead before they missed her Willie s always up to tricks Ain t he cute he s only six He had the face of a Bouguereau cherub and mild blue eyes such as we are told inhabit the countenances of angels He was the most innocent looking chap you ever set eyes on His mother called him an angel I should hate to tell you what the neighbors called him He lacked none of that subtle humor so familiar in child life Heavens the deeds I could if I dared enumerate They turned him loose among the comic supplements one Sunday and after that it was all over Hadn t he emptied his grandma s medicine capsules and substituted cotton And hadn t dear old grandma come down stairs three days later saying that she felt much improved Hadn t he beaten out the brains of his toy bank and bought up the peanut man on the corner Yes indeed And hadn t he taken my few letters from his sister s desk and played postman up and down the street His papa thought it all a huge joke till one of the neighbors brought back a dunning dressmaker s bill that had lain on the said neighbor s porch It was altogether a different matter then Toddy One Boy crawled under the bed that night and only his mother s tears saved him from a hiding All these I thought over as I sat at my table She knew that I would have gone had it been possible Women and logic are only cousins german Six months ago I hadn t been in love with any one but myself and now the Virgil of love s dream was leading me like a new Dante through his Inferno and was pointing out the foster brother of Sisyphus if he had a foster brother pushing the stone of my lady s favor up the steeps of Forlorn Hope Well I would go up to the club and if I didn t get home till mor r ning who was there to care The Frenchman had gone and the benevolent old gentleman The crowd was thinning out The young man at my left rose and I rose also We both stared thoughtfully at the hat rack There hung two hats an opera hat and a dilapidated old stovepipe The young fellow reached up and quite naturally selected the opera hat He glanced into it and immediately a wrinkle of annoyance darkened his brow He held the hat toward me Is this yours he asked I looked at the label No The wrinkle of annoyance sprang from his brow to mine My opera hat had cost me eight dollars The young fellow laughed rather lamely Do you live in New York he asked I nodded So do I he continued and yet it is evident that both of us have been neatly caught He thought for a moment then brightened I ll tell you what let s match for the good one I gazed indignantly at the rusty stovepipe Done said I I lost I knew that I should and the young fellow walked off with the good hat Then with the relic in my hand a waiter and myself began a systematic search My hat was nowhere to be found How the deuce was I to get up town to the club I couldn t wear the old plug I wasn t rich enough for such an eccentricity I had nothing but a silk hat at the apartment and I hated it because it was always in the way when I entered carriages and elevators Angrily I strode up to the cashier s desk and explained the situation leaving my address and the number of my apartment my name wasn t necessary Troubles never come singly Here I had lost my girl and my hat to say nothing of my temper of the three the most certain to be found again I passed out of the cafe bareheaded and hotheaded I hailed a cab and climbed in I had finally determined to return to my rooms and study I simply could not afford to be seen with that stovepipe hat either on my head or under my arm Had I been green from college it is probable that I should have worn it proudly and defiantly But I had left college behind these six years Hang these old duffers who are so absent minded For I was confident that the benevolent old gentleman was the cause of all this confusion Inside the cab I tried on the thing just to get a picture in my mind of the old gentleman going it up Broadway with my opera hat on his head The hat sagged over my ears and I laughed The picture I had conjured up was too much for my anger which vanished suddenly And once I had laughed I felt a trifle more agreeable toward the world So long as a man can see the funny side of things he has no active desire to leave life behind and laughter does more to lighten his sorrows than sympathy which only aggravates them After all the old gentleman would feel the change more sharply than I This was in all probability the only hat he had I turned it over and scrutinized it It was a genteel old beaver with an air of respectability that was quite convincing There was nothing smug about it either It suggested amiability in the man who had recently possessed it It suggested also a mild contempt for public opinion which is always a sign of superior mentality and advanced years I began to draw a mental portrait of the old man He was a family lawyer doubtless who lived in the past and hugged his retrospections When we are young there is never any vanishing point to our day dreams Well well On the morrow he would have a new hat of approved shape and pattern unless indeed he possessed others like this which had fallen into my keeping Perhaps he would soon discover his mistake return to the cafe and untangle the snarl I sincerely hoped he would As I remarked my hat had cost me eight dollars I soon arrived at my apartments and got into a smoking jacket I rather delight in lolling around in a dress shirt it looks so like the pictures we see in the fashionable novels I picked up Blackstone and turned to his promissory notes I had two or three out myself It was nine o clock when the hall boy s bell rang and I placed my ear to the tube A gentleman wished to see me in regard to a lost hat Send him up James send him up I bawled down the tube Visions of the club returned and I tossed Blackstone into a corner Presently there came a tap on the door and I flung it wide But my visitor was not the benevolent old gentleman He was the Frenchman whose absinthe had offended me He glanced at the slip of paper in his hand I have zee honaire to address zee ah gentleman in numbaire six I live here Delight We have meexed zee hats I have zee r r regret Ees thees your hat He held out for my inspection an opera hat I am so absent mind what you call deestrait affably I took the hat which at first glance I thought to be mine and went over to the rack taking down the old stovepipe This is yours then I said smiling Thousand thanks m sieu Eet ees certain mine I have zee honaire to beg pardon for zee confusion My compliments Good night Without giving the hat a single glance he clapped it on his head bowed and disappeared leaving me his card He hadn t been gone two minutes when I discovered that the hat he had exchanged for the stovepipe was not mine It came from the same firm but the initials proved it without doubt to belong to the young fellow I had met at the table I said some uncomplimentary things Where the deuce was my hat Evidently the benevolent old gentleman hadn t waked up yet Ting a ling It was the boy s bell again Well Another man after a hat What s goin on Send him up I yelled It came over me that the Frenchman had made a second mistake I was not disappointed this time in my visitor It was the benevolent old gentleman Evidently he had not located his hat either and might not for some time to come I began to believe that I had given it to the Frenchman He seemed terribly excited You are the gentleman who occupies number six Yes sir This is my apartment You have come in regard to a hat Yes sir My name is Chittenden Our hats got mixed up at Martin s this evening my fault as usual I am always doing something absurd my memory is so bad When I discovered my mistake I was calling on the family of a client with whom I had spent most of the afternoon I missed some valuable papers legal documents I believed as usual that I had forgotten to take them with me They were nowhere to be found at the house My client has a very mischievous son and it seems that he stuffed the papers behind the inside band of my hat With them there was a letter I have had two very great scares A great deal of trouble would ensue if the papers were lost I just telephoned that I had located the hat He laughed pleasantly Good heavens here was a howdy do My dear mister Chittenden there has been a great confusion I faltered I had your hat but but you have come too late Too late he roared or I should say to be exact shouted Yes sir What have you done with it Not five minutes ago I gave it to a Frenchman who seemed to recognize it as his It was the Frenchman if you will remember who sat near your table in the cafe And this hat isn t yours then helplessly This was a flat brimmed hat of the Paris boulevards the father of all stovepipe hats dear to the Frenchman s heart Candidly now said I with a bit of excusable impatience do I look like a man who would wear a hat like that He surveyed me miserably through his eye glasses No I can t say that you do But what in the world am I to do He mopped his brow in the ecstasy of anguish The hat must be found The legal papers could be replaced but You see sir that boy put a private letter of his sister s in the band of that hat and it must be recovered at all hazards I am very sorry sir But what shall I do I do not see what can be done save for you to leave word at the cafe The Frenchman is doubtless a frequenter and may easily be found If you had come a few moments sooner With a gurgle of dismay he fled leaving me with a half finished sentence hanging on my lips and the Frenchman s chapeau hanging on my fingers And my hat where was my hat I may as well add here in parenthesis that the disappearance of my eight dollar hat still remains a mystery I have had to buy a new one So the boy had put a letter of his sister s in the band of the hat I mused How like her kid brother It seemed that more or less families had Toddy One Boys to look after Pshaw what a muddle because a man couldn t keep his thoughts from wool gathering Well here I had two hats neither of which was mine I could at a pinch wear the opera hat as it was the exact size of the one I had lost But what was to be done with the Frenchman s Fool that I was I rushed over to the table The Frenchman had left his card and I had forgotten all about it And I hadn t asked the benevolent old gentleman where he lived The Frenchman s card read M de Beausire No Washington Place I decided to go myself to the address state the matter to Monsieur de Beausire and rescue the letter I knew all about these Toddy One Boys and I might be doing some girl a signal service I looked at my watch It was closing on to ten So I reluctantly got into my coat again drew on a topcoat and put on the hat that fitted me Probably the girl had been writing some fortunate fellow a love letter No gentleman will ever overlook a chance to do a favor for a young girl in distress I had scarcely drawn my stick from the umbrella jar when the bell rang once again Hello I called down the tube Why couldn t they let me be Lady wants to see you sir A lady Yes sir A real lady l a d y She says she s come to see the gentleman in number six about a plug hat What s the graft anyway A plug hat Yes sir a plug hat She seems a bit anxious Shall I send her up She s a peach Yes send her up I answered feebly enough And now there was a woman in the case I wiped the perspiration from my brow and wondered what I should say to her A woman By Jove the sister of the mischievous boy Old Chittenden must have told her where he had gone and as he hasn t shown up she s worried It must be a tremendously important letter to cause all this hubbub So I laid aside my hat and waited tugging and gnawing at my mustache Had the Girl acted reasonably I shouldn t have gone to Martin s that night How easy it is for a woman to hurt the man she knows I is in love with her And the Girl had hurt me more than I was willing to confess even to myself She had implied that I had carelessly broken an engagement Soon there came a gentle tapping Certainly the young woman had abundant pluck I approached the door quickly and flung it open The Girl herself stood on the threshold and we stared at each other with bewildered eyes II She was the most exquisite creature in all the wide world and here she was within reach of my hungry arms You she cried stepping back one hand at her throat and the other against the jamb of the door Dumb as ever was Lot s wife after the turning point in her career I stood and stared and admired A woman would instantly have noticed the beauty of her sables but I was a man to whom such details were inconsequent I did not expect that is only the number of the apartment was given she stammered I Then her slender figure straightened and with an effort she subdued the fright and dismay which had evidently seized her Have you mister Chittenden s hat mister Chittenden s hat I repeated with a tingling in my throat similar to that when you hit your elbow smartly on a corner mister Chittenden s hat Yes he is so thoughtless that I dared not trust him to search for it alone Have you got it Heavens how my heart beat at the sight of this beautiful being as she stood there palpitating between shame and anxiety She was beautiful and I knew instantly that I loved her better than anything else on earth mister Chittenden s hat I continued as lucid as a trained parrot and in tones not wholly dissimilar Can t you say anything more than that impatiently How much more easily a woman recovers her poise than a man especially when that man gives himself over as tamely as I did Was it your letter he was seeking I cried all eagerness and excitement as this one sane thought entered my head Did he tell you that there was a letter in it scornfully Yes guiltily Heaven only knows why I should have had any sense of guilt Give it to me at once imperatively The hat or the letter Truly I did not know what I was about Only one thing was plain to my confused mind and that was the knowledge that I wanted to put my arms around her and carry her far far away from Toddy One Boy Are you mad to anger me in this fashion she said balling her little gloved hands wrathfully Had there been real lightning in her eyes I d have been dead this long while Do you dare believe that I knew you lived in this apartment I haven t the hat You dared to search it drawing herself up to a supreme height which was something less than five feet two I became angry and somehow found myself I never pry into other people s affairs You are the last person I expected to see this night Will you answer a single question I promise not to intrude further upon your time which doubtless is very valuable Have you either the hat or the letter Neither I knew nothing about any letter till mister Chittenden came But he came too late Too late in an agonized whisper Yes too late I had unfortunately given his hat to another gentleman who made a trifling mistake in thinking it to be his own Suddenly my manners returned to me Will you come in Come in No You have given the hat to another man A trifling mistake He calls it a trifling mistake addressing the heavens obscured though they were by the thickness of several ceilings Oh what shall I do She began to wring her hands and when a woman does that what earthly hope is there for the man who looks on Don t do that I implored I ll find the hat At a word from her for all she had trampled on me I would gladly have gone to Honolulu in search of a hat pin The gentleman left me his card With your permission I will go at once in search of him I have a cab outside Give me the address I refuse to permit you to go alone You have absolutely nothing to say in regard to where I shall or shall not go In this one instance I shall withhold the address How her eyes blazed Oh it is easily to be seen that you do not trust me I was utterly discouraged I did not imply that with the least bit of softening Certainly I would trust you But Well as laughingly as I could I must be the one to take out that letter decidedly I offer to bring you the hat untouched I replied I insist on going Very well we shall go together under no other circumstances This is a common courtesy that I would show to a perfect stranger I put on my hat took up the Frenchman s card and tile and bowed her gravely into the main hallway We did not speak on the way down to the street We entered the cab in silence and went rumbling off southwest When the monotony became positively unbearable I spoke I regret to force myself upon you No reply It must be a very important letter To no one but myself with extreme frigidity His father ought to wring his neck thinking of Toddy One Boy Sir he is my brother I beg your pardon It seemed that I wasn t getting on very well We bumped across the Broadway tracks Once or twice our shoulders touched and the thrill I experienced was as painful as it was rapturous What was in a letter that she should go to this extreme to recall it A heat flash of jealousy went over me She had written to some other fellow for there always is some other fellow hang him And then a grand idea came into my erstwhile stupid head Here she was alone with me in a cab It was the opportunity of a lifetime I could force her to listen to my explanation I received your note I began It was cruel and without justice Her chin went up a degree The worst criminal is not condemned without a hearing and I have had none No perceptible movement We are none of us infallible in keeping appointments We are liable to make mistakes occasionally Had I known that Tuesday night was the night of the dance I d have crossed to Jersey in a rowboat The chin remained precipitously inclined I am poor and the case involved some of my bread and butter The work was done at ten and even then I did not discover that I had in any way affronted you I had it down in my note book as Wednesday night The lips above the chin curled slightly You see I went on striving to keep my voice even toned my uncle is rich but I ask no odds of him I live entirely upon what I earn at law It s the only way I can maintain my individuality my self respect and independence My uncle has often expressed his desire to make me a handsome allowance but what would be the use now bitterly The chin moved a little It was too dark to see what this movement expressed It seems that I am only a very unfortunate fellow You had given me your promise I know it Not that I cared with cat like cruelty but I lost the last train out while waiting for you Not even a note to warn me Not the slightest chance to find an escort When a man gives his promise to a lady it does not seem possible that he could forget it if he cared to keep it I tell you honestly that I mixed the dates How weak my excuses seemed now that they had passed my lips You are sure that you mixed nothing else ironically She afterward apologized for this It appears that it would have been better to come alone I regret I did not give you the address It is not too late I never retreat from any position I have taken Indeed Then both our chins assumed an acute angle and remained thus When a woman is angry she is about as reasonable as a frightened horse when a man is angry he longs to hit something or smoke a cigar Imagine my predicament When the cab reached Washington Place and came to a stand I spoke again Shall I take the hat in or will you We shall go together Ah if only I had had the courage to say I would it were for ever But I feared that it wouldn t take I rang the bell and presently a maid opened the door Is Monsieur de Beausire in I asked No sir he is not the maid answered civilly Do you know where he may be found If you have a bill you may leave it frostily and with sudden suspicion There was a smothered sound from behind me and I flushed angrily I am not a bill collector Oh it s the second day of the month you know I thought perhaps you were He has in his possession a hat which does not belong to him Good gracious he hasn t been stealing I don t believe making as though to shut the door This was too much and I laughed No my girl he hasn t been stealing But being absent minded he has taken another man s hat and I am bringing his home in hopes of getting the one he took by mistake Oh And the maid laughed shrilly I held out the hat My land that s his hat sure enough I was wondering what made him look so funny when he went out Where has he gone came sharply over my shoulder If you will wait said the maid good naturedly I will inquire We waited So far as I was concerned I hoped he was miles away and that we might go on riding for hours and hours The maid returned soon He has gone to meet the French consul at Mouquin s Which one I asked There are two one down and one up town I m sure I don t know You can leave the hat and your card Thank you we shall retain the hat If we find monsieur he will need it I m sorry said the maid sympathetically He s the worst man you ever saw for forgetting things Sometimes he goes right by the house and has to walk back I m sorry to have bothered you said I and the only girl in the world and myself reentered the cab This is terrible she murmured as we drove off It might be worse I replied thinking of the probable long ride with her perhaps the last I should ever take How could it be I had nothing to offer and subsided for a space If we should not find him I ll sit on his front stoop all night Forgive me if I sound flippant but I mean it Snow was in the air and I considered it a great sacrifice on my part to sit on a cold stone in the small morning hours It looks flippant in print too but I honestly meant it I am sorry You are in great trouble of some sort I know and there s nothing in the world I would not do to save you from this trouble Let me take you home and continue the search alone I ll find him if I have to search the whole town We shall continue the search together wearily What had she written to this other fellow Did she love some one else and was she afraid that I might learn who it was My heart became as lead in my bosom I simply could not lose this charming creature And now how was I ever to win her It was not far up town to the restaurant and we made good time Would you know him if you saw him she asked as we left the cab Not the least doubt of it confidently She sighed and together we entered the restaurant It was full of theater going people music and the hum of voices We must have created a small sensation wandering from table to table from room to room the girl with a look of dread and weariness on her face and I with the Frenchman s hat grasped firmly in my hand and my brows scowling If I hadn t been in love it would have been a fine comedy Once I surprised her looking toward the corner table near the orchestra How many joyous Sunday dinners we had had there Heigh ho Is that he she whispered clutching my arm of a sudden her gaze directed to a near by table I looked and shook my head No my Frenchman had a mustache and a goatee Her hand dropped listlessly I confess to the thought that it must have been very trying for her What a plucky girl she was She held me in contempt and yet she clung to me patiently and unmurmuring And I had lost her We may have to go down town No as I live there he is now Where There was half a sob in her throat The table by the short flight of stairs the man just lighting the cigarette I ll go alone But I can not stand here alone in the middle of the floor I called a waiter Give this lady a chair for a moment and I dropped a coin in his palm He bowed and beckoned for her to follow Women are always writing fool things and then moving Heaven and earth to recall them Monsieur de Beausire I said Beausire glanced up Oh eet ees I forget zee name I told him I am delight he cried joyfully as if he had known me all my life Zee chair be seat Thank you but it s about the hats Hats Yes It seems that the hat I gave you belongs to another man In your haste you did not notice the mistake This is your hat producing the shining tile Mon Dieu he gasped seizing the hat eet ees mine See I bring heem from France zee nom ees mine V la And I nevaire look in zee uzzer hat I am pair fickly dumfound And his astonishment was genuine Where is the other hat the one I gave you I was in a great hurry I have heem here reaching to the vacant chair at his side while the French consul eyed us both with some suspicion We might be lunatics Beausire handed me the benevolent old gentleman s hat and the burden dropped from my shoulders Eet ees such a meestake I laugh eh He shook with merriment I wear two hats and not know zee meestake I thanked him and made off as gracefully as I could The girl rose as she saw me returning When I reached her side she was standing with her slender body inclined toward me She stretched forth a hand and solemnly I gave her mister Chittenden s hat I wondered vaguely if anybody was looking at us and if so what he thought of us The girl pulled the hat literally inside out in her eagerness but her gloved fingers trembled so that the precious letter fluttered to the floor We both stooped but I was quicker It was no attempt on my part to see the address my act was one of common politeness But I could not help seeing the name It was my own Give it to me she cried breathlessly I did so I was not at that particular moment capable of doing anything else I was too bewildered My own name She turned hugging the hat the legal documents and the letter and hurried down the main stairs I at her heels Tell the driver my address I can return alone I can not permit that I objected decidedly The driver is a stranger to us both I insist on seeing you to the door after that you may rest assured that I shall no longer inflict upon you my presence odious as it doubtless is to you As she was already in the cab and could not get out without aid I climbed in beside her and called the street and number to the driver Legally the letter is mine it is addressed to me and had passed out of your keeping You shall never never have it vehemently It is not necessary that I should I replied for I vaguely understand I saw that it was all over There was now no reason why I should not speak my mind fully I can understand without reading You realized that your note was cruel and unlike anything you had done and your good heart compelled you to write an apology but your pride got the better of you and upon second thought you concluded to let the unmerited hurt go on Will you kindly stop the driver or shall I Does truth annoy you I decline to discuss truth with you Will you stop the driver Not until we reach Seventy first Street West By what right The right of a man who loves you There it is out and my pride has gone down the wind After to night I shall trouble you no further But every man has the right to tell one woman that he loves her and I love you I loved you the moment I first laid eyes on you I couldn t help it I say this to you now because I perceive how futile it is What dreams I have conjured up about you Poor fool When I was at work your face was always crossing the page or peering up from the margins I never saw a fine painting that I did not think of you or heard a fine piece of music that I did not think of your voice There was a long interval of silence block after block went by I never once looked at her If I had been rich I should have put it to the touch some time ago but my poverty seems to have been fortunate it has saved me a refusal In some way I have mortally offended you how I can not imagine It can not be simply because I innocently broke an engagement Then she spoke You dined after the theater that night with a comic opera singer You were quite at liberty to do so only you might have done me the honor to notify me that you had made your choice of entertainment So it was out Decidedly it was all over now I never could explain away the mistake I have already explained to you my unfortunate mistake There was and is no harm that I can see in dining with a woman of her attainments But I shall put up no defense You have convicted me I retract nothing I have said I do love you I was very sorry for myself Cabby drew up I alighted and she silently permitted me to assist her down I expected her immediately to mount the steps Instead she hesitated the knuckle of a forefinger against her lips and assumed the thoughtful pose of one who contemplates two courses Have you a stamp she asked finally A stamp blankly Yes a postage stamp I fumbled in my pocket and found luckily a single pink square which I gave to her She moistened it with the tip of her tongue and stuck it on the letter Now please drop this in the corner box for me and take this hat over to mister Chittenden s Sixty ninth What Do as I say or I shall ask you to return the letter to me I rushed off toward the letter box drew down the lid and deposited the letter my letter When I turned she was running up the steps and a second later she had disappeared I hadn t been so happy in all my life Cabby waited at the curb Suddenly I became conscious that I was holding something in my hand It was the benevolent old gentleman s stovepipe hat I pushed the button pushed it good and hard Presently I heard a window open cautiously What is it asked a querulous voice mister Chittenden Yes Well here s your hat I cried LITIGATION BY BILL ARP The fust case I ever had in a Justice Court I emploid old Bob Leggins who was a sorter of a self eddicated fool I giv him two dollars in advanse and he argud the case as I thot on two sides and was more luminus agin me than for me I lost the case and found out atterwards that the defendant had employed Leggins atter I did and gin him five dollars to lose my case I look upon this as a warnin to all klients to pay big fees and keep your lawyer out of temtashun My xperience in litigashun hav not been satisfaktory I sued Sugar Black onst for the price of a lode of shuks He sed he wanted to buy sum ruffness and I agreed to bring him a lode of shuks for two dollers My waggin got broke and he got tired a waitin and sent out atter the shuks himself When I called on him for the pay he seemed surprised and sed it had cost him two dollars and a half to hav the shuks hauld and that I justly owd him a half a dollar He were more bigger than I was so I swallered my bile and sued him His lawyer pled a set off for haulin He pled that the shuks was unsound that they was barred by limitashuns that they didn t agree with his cow and that he never got any shuks from me He spoak about a hour and allooded to me as a swindler about forty five times The bedevild jewry went out and brot in a verdik agin me for fifty cents and four dollars for costs I hain t saved many shuks on my plantashun sence and I don t intend to til it gits less xpensiv I look upon this as a warnin to all foaks never to go to law about shuks or any other small sirkumstanse The next trubble I had was with a feller I hired to dig me a well He was to dig it for twenty dollers and I was to pay him in meat and meal and sich like The vagabon kep gittin along til he got all the pay but hadn t dug nary a foot in the ground So I made out my akkount and sued him as follers to wit Old John Hanks to Bill Arp doctor To one well you didn t dig twenty dollars Well Hanks he hired a cheep lawyer who rared round xtensively and sed a heep of funny things at my xpense and finally dismissd my case for what he calld its ridikulum abserdum I paid those costs and went home a sadder and a wiser man I pulld down my little kabbin and mooved it sum three hundred yards nigher the spring and I hav drunk mity little well water sence I look upon this case as a warnin to all foaks never to pay for enything till you git it espeshally if it has to be dug The next law case I had I ganed it all by myself by the forse of sirkumstanses I bot a man s note that was giv for the hire of a nigger boy Dik Findin he wouldn t pay me I sued him before old Squire Maginnis beleevin that it was sich a ded thing that the devil couldn t keep me out of a verdik The feller pled failur of konsiderashun and non est faktum and ignis fatuis and infansy and that the nigger s name wasn t Dik but Richard The old Squire was a powerful sesesh and hated the Yankees amazin So atter the lawyer had got thru his speech and finished up his readin from a book called Greenleaf I rose forward to a attitood Stretchin forth my arms ses I Squire Maginnis I would ax sur if this is a time in the histry of our afflikted kountry when Yankee law books should be admitted in a Southern patriot s Court Hain t we got a State of our own and a code of Georgy laws that s printed on Georgy sile On the very fust page of the gentleman s book I seed the name of the sitty of Bosting Yes sur it was ritten in Bosting where they don t know no more about the hire of a nigger than an ox knows the man who will tan his hide I sed sum more things that was pinted and patriotik and closd my argyment by handin the book to the Squire He put on his speks and atter lookin at the book about a minit ses he mister Arp you can have a judgment and I hope that from hensefourth no lawyer will presoom to cum before this honerabul court with pisen dokyments to proove his case If he do this court will take it as an insult and send him to jail I look upon this case as a warnin to all foaks who gambel in law to hold a good hand and play it well High jestice and patriotism are winning trumps My next case was about steelin a hog Larseny from the woods I think they call it I didn t hav but one hog and we had to let him run out to keep him alive for akorns was cheeper than corn at my house Old Romulus Ramsour sorter wanted sum fresh meat and so he shot my shote in the woods and was catched carrying him home He had cut off his ears and throwed em away but we found em with the under bit in the right and swaller fork in the left and so Romulus was brot up square before the jewry and his defense was that it was a wild hog The jewry was out about two hours and brot in a verdik We the jewry know that shortly atter the war the kountry was scarce of provishuns and in considerashun of the hard time our poor peepul had in maintainin their families and the temtashuns that surrounded em we find the defendant not guilty but we rekommend him not to do so any more The motto of this case is that a man ortent to keep hogs in a poor naberhood After this I had a diffikulty with a man by the name of Kohen and I thot I wouldn t go to law but would arbytrate I had bot Tom Swillins wheat at a dollar a bushel if he couldn t do any better and if he could do better he was to cum back and giv me the prefferense The skamp went off and sold the wheat to Kohen for a dollar and five cents and Kohen knowd all about his kontrak with me Me and him lik to hav fit and perhaps would if I hadn t been puny but we finally left it to Josh Billins to arbytrate Old Josh deliberated on the thing three days and nites and finally brot in an award that Kohen should hav the wheat an I should hav the prefferense I hain t submitted no more cases to arbytration sinse and my advise to all peepul is to arbytrate nuthin if your case is honest for there ain t no judge there to keep one man from trikkin the other An honest man don t stan no chance nowhere xceptin in a court house with a good lawyer to back him The motto of this case is never to arbytrate nuthin but a bad case and take a good lawyer to advise and pay him fur it before you do that But I got Fretman I didn t but my lawyer Marks did Fretman was a nutmeg skhool teacher who had gone round my naborhood with his skool artikles and I put down of Troup and Calhoun to go and intended to send seven or eight more if he proved himself right I soon found that the little nullifiers warn t lernin enything and on inquiry I found that nutmeg was a givin powerful long recessess and employin his time cheefly in carryin on with a tolerbul sized female gal that was a goin to him Troup sed he heerd the gal squeel one day and he knowed Fretman was a squeezin of her I don t mind our boys a squeezin of the Yankee gals but I ll be blamed if the Yankees shall be a squeezin ourn So I got mad and took the children away At the end of the term Fretman sued me for eighteen dollars and hired a cheep lawyer to kollekt it Before this time I had lerned sum sense about a lawyer so I hired a good one and spred my pokit book down before him and told him to take what would satisfi him And he took Old Phil Davis was the jestice Marks made the openin speech to the effek that every profeshunal man ort to be able to illustrate his trade and he therefore proposed to put mister Fretman on the stan and spell him This moshun was fout hard but it agreed with old Phil s noshuns of high jestice and ses he mister Fretman you will hav to spell sur Marks then swore him that he would giv true evidense in this case and that he would spell evry word in Dan l Webster s spellin book correkly to the best of his knowledge and beleef so help him et cetera I saw that he were a tremblin all over like a cold wet dog Ses Marks mister Fretman spell tisik Well he spelt it puttin in a ph and a th and a gh and a zh and I don t know what all and I thot he were gone up the fust pop but Marks sed it were right He then spelt him right strate along on all sorts of big words and little words and long words and short words and he knowd em all til finally Marks ses Now sur spell Ompompynusuk Fretman drawd a long breth and sed it warn t in the book Marks proved it was by a old preecher who was a settin by and old Phil spoke up with power ses he mister Fretman you must spell it sur Fretman was a swettin like a run down filly He took one pass at it and missd You can cum down sur ses Marks you ve lost your case and shore enuf old Phil giv a verdik agin him like a darn Marks was a whale in his way At the same court he was about to nonsoot a Doktor bekaus he didn t hav his diplomy and the Doktor begged the court for time to go home after it He rode seven miles and back as hard as he could lick it and when he handed it over Marks ses he Now sur you will just take the stand and translate this lattin into English so that the court may onderstand it Well he jest caved for he couldn t do it He lost his case in two minits for the old squire sed that a dokter who couldn t read his diplomy had no more right to praktise than a magistrate what couldn t read the license had to jine two cuple together DARIUS GREEN AND HIS FLYING MACHINE

none	none	 If ever there lived a Yankee lad Wise or otherwise good or bad Who seeing the birds fly didn t jump With flapping arms from stake or stump Or spreading the tail Of his coat for a sail Take a soaring leap from post or rail And wonder why He couldn t fly And flap and flutter and wish and try If ever you knew a country dunce Who didn t try that as often as once All I can say is that s a sign He never would do for a hero of mine An aspiring genius was D Green The son of a farmer age fourteen His body was long and lank and lean Just right for flying as will be seen He had two eyes as bright as a bean And a freckled nose that grew between A little awry for I must mention That he had riveted his attention Upon his wonderful invention Twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings And working his face as he worked the wings And with every turn of gimlet and screw Turning and screwing his mouth round too Till his nose seemed bent To catch the scent Around some corner of new baked pies And his wrinkled cheeks and his squinting eyes Grew puckered into a queer grimace That made him look very droll in the face And also very wise And wise he must have been to do more Than ever a genius did before Excepting Daedalus of yore And his son Icarus who wore Upon their backs Those wings of wax He had read of in the old almanacs Darius was clearly of the opinion That the air is also man s dominion And that with paddle or fin or pinion We soon or late shall navigate The azure as now we sail the sea The thing looks simple enough to me And if you doubt it Hear how Darius reasoned about it The birds can fly an why can t I Must we give in says he with a grin That the bluebird an phoebe Are smarter n we be Jest fold our hands an see the swaller An blackbird an catbird beat us holler Does the little chatterin sassy wren No bigger n my thumb know more than men Jest show me that Ur prove t the bat Hez got more brains than s in my hat An I ll back down an not till then He argued further Nur I can t see What s the use o wings to a bumble bee Fur to git a livin with more n to me Ain t my business Important s his n is That Icarus Made a perty muss Him an his daddy Daedalus They might a knowed wings made o wax Wouldn t stand sun heat an hard whacks I ll make mine o luther Ur suthin ur other And he said to himself as he tinkered and planned But I ain t goin to show my hand To nummies that never can understand The fust idee that s big an grand So he kept his secret from all the rest Safely buttoned within his vest And in the loft above the shed Himself he locks with thimble and thread And wax and hammer and buckles and screws And all such things as geniuses use Two bats for patterns curious fellows A charcoal pot and a pair of bellows Some wire and several old umbrellas A carriage cover for tail and wings A piece of harness and straps and strings And a big strong box In which he locks These and a hundred other things His grinning brothers Reuben and Burke And Nathan and Jotham and Solomon lurk Around the corner to see him work Sitting cross legged like a Turk Drawing the wax end through with a jerk And boring the holes with a comical quirk Of his wise old head and a knowing smirk But vainly they mounted each other s backs And poked through knot holes and pried through cracks With wood from the pile and straw from the stacks He plugged the knot holes and calked the cracks And a bucket of water which one would think He had brought up into the loft to drink When he chanced to be dry Stood always nigh For Darius was sly And whenever at work he happened to spy At chink or crevice a blinking eye He let a dipper of water fly Take that an ef ever ye git a peep Guess ye ll ketch a weasel asleep And he sings as he locks His big strong box SONG The weasel s head is small an trim An he is leetle an long an slim An quick of motion an nimble of limb An ef yeou ll be Advised by me Keep wide awake when ye re ketchin him So day after day He stitched and tinkered and hammered away Till at last twas done The greatest invention under the sun An now says Darius hooray fer some fun T was the Fourth of July And the weather was dry And not a cloud was on all the sky Save a few light fleeces which here and there Half mist half air Like foam on the ocean went floating by Just as lovely a morning as ever was seen For a nice little trip in a flying machine Thought cunning Darius Now I shan t go Along ith the fellers to see the show I ll say I ve got sich a terrible cough An then when the folks ave all gone off I ll hev full swing Fer to try the thing An practyse a leetle on the wing Ain t goin to see the celebration Says Brother Nate No botheration I ve got sich a cold a toothache I My gracious feel s though I should fly Said Jotham Sho Guess ye better go But Darius said No Shouldn t wonder f yeou might see me though Long bout noon ef I git red O this jumpin thumpin pain n my head For all the while to himself he said I tell ye what I ll fly a few times around the lot To see how t seems then soon s I ve got The hang o the thing ez likely s not I ll astonish the nation An all creation By flyin over the celebration I ll balance myself on my wings like a sea gull I ll dance on the chimbleys I ll stan on the steeple I ll flop up to winders an scare the people I ll light on the libbe ty pole an crow An I ll say to the gawpin fools below What world s this ere That I ve come near Fer I ll make em b lieve I m a chap f m the moon An I ll try a race ith their ol bulloon He crept from his bed And seeing the others were gone he said I m gittin over the cold n my head And away he sped To open the wonderful box in the shed His brothers had walked but a little way When Jotham to Nathan chanced to say What is the feller up to hey Do no the s suthin ur other to pay Ur he wouldn t a stayed to hum to day Says Burke His toothache s all n his eye He never d miss a Fo th o July Ef he hedn t got some machine to try Then Sol the little one spoke By darn Le s hurry back an hide n the barn An pay him fur tellin us that yarn Agreed Through the orchard they crept back Along by the fences behind the stack And one by one through a hole in the wall In under the dusty barn they crawl Dressed in their Sunday garments all And a very astonishing sight was that When each in his cobwebbed coat and hat Came up through the floor like an ancient rat And there they hid And Reuben slid The fastenings back and the door undid Keep dark said he While I squint an see what the is to see As knights of old put on their mail From head to foot an iron suit Iron jacket and iron boot Iron breeches and on the head No hat but an iron pot instead And under the chin the bail I believe they call the thing a helm Then sallied forth to overwhelm The dragons and pagans that plagued the realm So this modern knight Prepared for flight Put on his wings and strapped them tight Jointed and jaunty strong and light Buckled them fast to shoulder and hip Ten feet they measured from tip to tip And a helm had he but that he wore Not on his head like those of yore But more like the helm of a ship Hush Reuben said He s up in the shed He s opened the winder I see his head He stretches it out an pokes it about Lookin to see f the coast is clear An nobody near Guess he do no who s hid in here He s riggin a spring board over the sill Stop laffin Solomon

none	none	I van it s wings An that t other thing I vum it s a tail An there he sets like a hawk on a rail Steppin careful he travels the length Of his spring board and teeters to try its strength Now he stretches his wings like a monstrous bat Peeps over his shoulder this way an that Fur to see f the s any one passin by But the s on y a ca f an a goslin nigh They turn up at him a wonderin eye To see The dragon he s goin to fly Away he goes Jimminy what a jump Flop flop an plump To the ground with a thump Flutt rin an flound rin all n a lump As a demon is hurled by an angel s spear Heels over head to his proper sphere Heels over head and head over heels Dizzily down the abyss he wheels So fell Darius Upon his crown In the midst of the barn yard he came down In a wonderful whirl of tangled strings Broken braces and broken springs Broken tail and broken wings Shooting stars and various things Barn yard litter of straw and chaff And much that wasn t so sweet by half Away with a bellow fled the calf And what was that Did the gosling laugh Tis a merry roar from the old barn door And he hears the voice of Jotham crying Say D rius how do you like flyin Slowly ruefully where he lay Darius just turned and looked that way As he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cuff Wal I like flyin well enough He said but the ain t sich a thunderin sight O fun in t when ye come to light I just have room for the MORAL here And this is the moral Stick to your sphere Or if you insist as you have the right On spreading your wings for a loftier flight The moral is Take care how you light PAPER A

in the kitchen I thought the dinner had b iled dry Are you gittin a b iled dinner It smells wonderful good What you got in it Corned beef and cabbage and onions and potatoes and turnips I ve het up a squash pie and put out some of the cider apple sauce that will spile if it isn t et pretty soon I ll put the tea a drawin soon s the kittle b iles Andrew s voice came into the sick room in a mechanical recitative as if accustomed to recount every particular of the day s doings Well I guess you can bring me some of it You bring me a piece of the corned beef and consid able of the cabbage and potaters and an onion or two And if that cider apple sauce is likely to spile I might eat a little of it bring me a cooky to eat with it And a piece of the squash pie What else did you say you had That s all Don t forgit to put on consid able of bread It s a good while till supper and I don t dast to eat between meals Andrew brought the tray to the bedside and propped up the invalid before he ate his own dinner He had finished it and cleared up the table before the high voice called again An ndrew Yes Marthy Is there any more of the corned beef You brought me such a little mite of a piece Yes there s plenty more but I knew you d object if I brought it first Like it did you Yes it was tol able Them vegetables was a little rich but maybe they won t hurt me You might bring me another cooky when you come Now you set down a minute while you re waitin for my dishes I ve ben worryin bout them moths every minute since you told me and somethin has got to be done I know it I hated to tell you but I thought you ought to know I guess I c n clean em out the next rainy spell when I have to stay in No you can t wait for that And you can t do it anyway There s things a man can do and then again there s things he can t You re uncommon handy Andrew but you re a man Andrew s deprecatory gesture implied that he couldn t help it I ve thought of that ever so much in the years that I ve ben layin here and I ve worried about what you re goin to do when I ain t here to plan and direct for you Those moths are jest an instance Now what you goin to do when you have to think for yourself I do know but you ain t goin to git up a new worry bout that I hope No it is not a new worry It s an old one but it s such a delicate subject even between man and wife that I ve hesitated to speak of it Andrew I don t want you to stay single but jest six months jest six months to the very day after I m laid away I ve spoken to Hannah Brewster to come in and do for you twice a week same as she does now and to mend your socks and underclothes for six months and then I want you to git married Why Marthy You needn t gasp like you was struck I presume to say you d do it anyway without thinkin it over well beforehand I ve allus planned and thought things over for you till I don t know whether you d be capable of attendin to that or not And I d go off a sight easier if I knew twas all settled satisfactory I d like to know who s goin to keep my house and wear my clothes and sun my bed quilts and I could have her come and learn my ways beforehand Good gracious Marthy There s a limit to plannin and directin even for as smart a woman as you be You re not goin to know whether she ll consent or not not while while you re here yet And you re gittin no worse it does seem like you re gittin better all the time Last time Aunt Lyddy was here she said you was lookin better n she ever see you before I told her you d picked up in your appetite consid able You ll git up yet and be my second wife yourself Yes Aunt Lyddy allus thinks great things bout me she never would believe how low I ve ben but I guess I know how I be No you can t head me off that way with the moths in my best things and one of my grandmother s silver spoons missin If there s one thing a forethoughtful woman ought to plan beforehand it s to pick out the woman who s to have her house and her things and her husband Andrew wriggled uncomfortably I shouldn t wonder if the dish water was a b ilin Marthy No it isn t You haven t got fire enough And we d better settle this matter while we re at it Settle it Why Marthy you talk s if you wanted me to go n git married on the spot and bring my second wife home to you before while you re still here I m no Mormon Like s not you ve got her selected you re such a wonderful hand to settle things I can t say s I ve got her selected not the exact one but I ve ben runnin over several in my mind We d better have several to pick from and then if some refused you we d still have a chance But how would you git any of em to consent asked Andrew with a show of interest How else but ask em They would understand how I feel about you The hull town knows how I ve laid here expectin every day to be to morrow and if I want that thing settled before I go I don t see how it could make talk Now who had you sorted out to pick from and Andrew leaned back comfortably in his chair His wife punched up her pillow to lift her head higher Well there s the widows first I ve sorted them over and over till I ve got em down to four that ain t wasteful cooks nor got too many relations There s Widow Jackson She s weakly promptly decided Andrew And Mary Josephine Wilson She don t go to our church What about the old maids I don t take much stock in old maids The likeliest person I know and I wouldn t call her an old maid either is Abilonia Supe Her mother was counted the best breadmaker in North Sudbury and Abby was the neatest darner in her class at sewing school But why Marthy isn t Abby promised to Willy Parks No I asked Mis Parks about that yisterday She said Willy had been waitin on Abby for four or five years but they d had a misunderstandin this summer and it was broke off for good He ought to be horsewhipped said Andrew warmly Abilonia Supe is the finest girl in North Sudbury Ye es admitted Marthy reluctantly You re sure she wouldn t be too young for you are you Too young For me I don t want to marry my grandmother I guess And I m not Methusalem myself and he shook the stoop out of his back and spread the thin hair across his bald spot His wife looked at him in wondering surprise Abby has had rather a hard time since her mother died she said weakly Indeed she has and she deserves to have it easy now She needs somebody to take care of her if that scamp and she isn t bad lookin either Abby isn t I tell you Marthy there isn t your beat in the hull town for managin forethoughtedness Sick or well you ve allus ben a captain at managin Now come to think it over this isn t a bad idee But how ll we git her consent Maybe I d better step over and well ruther lead up to the subject I might That dish water s a b ilin Andrew It s a b ilin hard I c n hear it Andrew started briskly for the kitchen and the dishes clattered merrily An hour later he framed himself in the doorway in his Sunday clothes I have to go down to the store this afternoon to git that baggin for the hops and I can jest as well s not go round by Supes and sort of talk that over with Abby and tell her your wishes I never deny you nothin Marthy you know that If it ll be any comfort to you I ll jest brace up and do it no matter how hard it is Well say Andrew wait a minute Maybe you d better wait till we talk it over a little more I might consult with Abby myself on the subject An ndrew An ndrew That man is gittin a good deal deafer n he ll own to It was quite supper time when Andrew returned it was too late to cook anything so he brought Marthy some of the Sunday baked beans and brown bread with the cider apple sauce Well you must a had a time of it with her suggested his wife as he placed the tray I hope you didn t do more n make a suppositious case and find out what her sentiments was That was what I set out to do but she was so surprised an asked so many questions that I jest had to up and tell her what I was drivin at I told her that it was your last wish and that you d set your heart on it till you felt like you couldn t die easy unless you knew who was goin to have your house and your beddin and me and after I d reasoned with her quite a spell and she d ruther got used to the idee she saw how twas I thought you d like to have it settled because you allus do and as you say there s no tellin what day ll be to morrow Then that Willy Parks is likely to come back and spile the hull plan Settle it all Why what did she say to it I guess you may call it settled I asked her if she d consider herself engaged to me What What s that Engaged to you Yes isn t that what you wanted What did she say to that She said yes she guessed that she would though she would like to think it over a little I didn t presume to think you d go and get it all settled without talkin it over with me and I calc lated to to do the arrangin myself What did she say when she consented to it Andrew Andrew squirmed on the edge of his chair I guess my tea is coolin out there I d better go and eat now A minute more won t make no difference What did she say She said why she said a whole lot of things She said she never expected to marry that she wanted to give her life to makin folks happy and doin for them folks that had a sorrow but the Lord hadn t given her any sorrowful folks to do for It s my opinion that she thought consid able of that fickle Willy Parks Then I reasoned with her some and she come to see that maybe this was the app inted work for her to do considerin you d set your heart on it so She said she didn t know but I needed lookin after and doin for as much as any one she knew and it would be a pleasure to now Marthy let me go and have my tea What else did she say Well she said I certainly had that I had a hard trial this trip and I d served my time so faithfully it would be a comfort and a pleasure to now Marthy I know my tea s cold It took him so long to have his tea and wash the dishes and bring in the squashes for fear of frost that Marthy had no further opportunity to consider the new position of her husband as an engaged man that night She resumed the subject early the next morning Andrew I want you should go and bring Abilonia over here as soon as you git the work done up There s so much I want to arrange with her and you never know what day ll be to morrow And them moths ought to be seen to right off What be you goin up stairs for You needn t put on your Sunday clothes jest for that She ll have to see you in your old clothes many a year after you re ah when she comes to live here Yes but that s not now I m only engaged to her I m only sort of courtin now as you might say He came back in a little while bringing a gentle brown eyed young woman who laid away her things and took an apron from her bag with the air of one accustomed to do for others Did you want to see me particularly Mis Dobson I hope you re not feelin worse I do know s I slep much las night and I have an awful funny feelin round my heart this mornin I m preparin for the worst You know Two men shall be grindin at the mill and Oh now you aren t so bad as all that You look as smart as a spring robin you do look wonderful well Mis Dobson Now what can I do for you There s a lot of things to look after Abilonia now that you that you that Yes I know there are and I ll just delight to take hold and do them I told mister Dobson that I wanted to begin to do for you both right away I m real glad you thought of it Mis Dobson for I ve nobody else now to care for and I should love to take care of poor mister Dobson and try to make him happy just real happy the best of anybody in the world He looked so pleased when I told him so Did he He did Yes his face just lighted up when I told him that we all knew how faithful he d been to his trust through such a long hard siege how kind and patient and that it would be a privilege to try to make it up to him a little Oh ah well what did he say to that He just said the hand of the Lord had fallen rather heavy on him but he d tried to bear the burden the best he could and if he held out to the end the Lord would reward him And he said it was the Lord s mercy to give him such a good clever wife to take care of since she was sickly Now would you like me to bake you some cookies this morning or do the mending I don t know Did Andrew say that Well he has been faithful You re goin to git an awful good man Abilonia Say don t you tell him or it ll scare him but I m goin to do a terrible resky thing I m goin to set up here in the bed a little spell Go you up to the top bureau drawer in the spare room and git my black shawl I know I might fall over dead but I m goin to take the resk Why Mis Dobson it isn t safe Safe or not I m goin to do it I m goin to set up a spell I never stop for consequences to myself when I set out to do a thing The perilous feat was accomplished without tragedy After she had had a nap propped up in the bed missus Dobson s soul rose to greater heights of daring when Abilonia remarked that missus Dobson s plum colored silk was the very thing for a lining to her own silk quilt and as it would not be worn again she might as well take it over and make it up She was adding that she would like to have a crayon portrait made of mister Dobson to hang beside that of his wife which adorned the parlor in ante mortem state when Marthy interrupted Abilonia go you and git me a dress There ought to be a brown poplin hangin in the little room closet unless somebody moved it last spring in housecleanin time You bring that down I want to git my feet onto the floor When Andrew came home to get dinner he stopped in the kitchen door dumb with amazement Marthy sat by the table in the big wooden chair peeling apples while Abilonia rolled out the pie crust and told about the church quilting bee The next Sunday Andrew did not change his best suit as usual after church and his wife remarked the fact as she sat in a blanketed chair by the living room fire in the evening with her Christian Register in her hand Well you know I ve ben thinkin Abby s settin over there by herself and it must be lonesome for the girl And if I m sort of engaged to her don t you see Marthy I don t want to leave you but it s my duty to keep company with her I want to carry out your wishes exact every one You can t ask a thing too hard for me to do Yes I know that Andrew If ever a man done his duty it s you And you ve had little reward for it too I m tryin to git you a second wife that ll have her health and and yes I presume to say that Abilonia ll ruther look for you to set a while now that she is bespoke to you Yes that s what I guess I ought to do and he rose briskly Say Andrew Don t be in such a hurry Come back a minute You gear up ole Jule to the buggy and git down a comforter for me I c n walk some to day and if you help me I c n git into the buggy I feel like the air would do me good Yes I presume to say it ll be the death of me but you never knew me to stop for that did you Git my circular cloak and the white cloud for my head Yes I m goin Andrew When I git my mind made up you know what it means There was a light in Abilonia s parlor when they drove up and a man s figure showed through the glass panel of the door as he opened it Willy Parks cried missus Dobson in a queer voice Yes walk right in mister Dobson That isn t missus Dobson with you is it possible after so many years Let me help you steady her Well this is a surprise Just walk into the parlor and sit down Abby s down cellar putting away the milk but she ll be up in a minute It s consid able of a surprise to see you here Willy it s consid able of a disapp intment to Mis Dobson She had set her mind on on ventured Andrew mildly Yes so I heard and I thought I d come home Abby tells me that she is engaged to you that she has given her solemn promise That s what she has said Andrew firmly That s what she has and Mis Dobson has set her mind on it and I never refuse her nothin I don t want nothin to reproach myself for You went off and left that girl the finest girl in town and near about broke her heart You ought to be ashamed to show yourself now I am mister Dobson said the young man gravely and I deserve to lose her But when I heard that she was engaged to you as it were it brought me to my senses and since you are my rival I am going to ask you to be magnanimous She is so good and true that I believe she will forgive me and take me back if you will release her you and missus Dobson You wouldn t hold her while missus Dobson looks so smart as she does to night No Andrew we won t hold her It wouldn t be right She s young and and real good lookin and it would be a pity to spile a good match for her We oughtn t to hold her here she is We will release you from your engagement to to us Abilonia and may you be happy I m feelin a sight better lately that last bitters you got for me is a wonderful medicine Andrew I presume to say I ll be round on my feet yet before long and be able to take as good care of you as you have took of me all these years It s a powerful medicine that root bitters We better be goin Andrew They ve got things to talk about Good night Abilonia Good night Willy THE KAISER S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY BY BERT LESTON TAYLOR Auf wiedersehen brother mine Farewells will soon be kissed And ere you leave to breast the brine Give me

GRANDFATHER SQUEERS BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY My grandfather Squeers said the Raggedy Man As he solemnly lighted his pipe and began The most indestructible man for his years And the grandest on earth was my grandfather Squeers He said when he rounded his three score and ten I ve the hang of it now and can do it again He had frozen his heels so repeatedly he Could tell by them just what the weather would be And would laugh and declare while the Almanac would Most falsely prognosticate he never could Such a hale constitution had grandfather Squeers That though he d used navy for sixty odd years He still chewed a dime s worth six days of the week While the seventh he passed with a chew in each cheek Then my grandfather Squeers had a singular knack Of sitting around on the small of his back With his legs like a letter Y stretched o er the grate Wherein twas his custom to ex pec tor ate He was fond of tobacco in manifold ways And would sit on the door step of sunshiny days And smoke leaf tobacco he d raised strictly for The pipe he d used all through The Mexican War And The Raggedy Man said refilling the bowl Of his own pipe and leisurely picking a coal From the stove with his finger and thumb You can see What a tee nacious habit he s fastened on me And my grandfather Squeers took a special delight In pruning his corns every Saturday night With a horn handled razor whose edge he excused By saying twas one that his grandfather used And though deeply etched in the haft of the same Was the ever euphonious Wostenholm s name Twas my grandfather s custom to boast of the blade As A Seth Thomas razor the best ever made No Old Settlers Meeting or Pioneers Fair Was complete without grandfather Squeers in the chair To lead off the programme by telling folks how He used to shoot deer where the Court House stands now How he felt of a truth to live over the past When the country was wild and unbroken and vast That the little log cabin was just plenty fine For himself his companion and fambly of nine When they didn t have even a pump or a tin But drunk surface water year out and year in From the old fashioned gourd that was sweeter by odds Than the goblets of gold at the lips of the gods Then The Raggedy Man paused to plaintively say It was clockin along to rds the close of the day And he d ought to get back to his work on the lawn Then dreamily blubbered his pipe and went on His teeth were imperfect my grandfather owned That he couldn t eat oysters unless they were boned And his eyes were so weak and so feeble of sight He couldn t sleep with them unless every night He put on his spectacles all he possessed Three pairs with his goggles on top of the rest And my grandfather always retiring at night Blew down the lamp chimney to put out the light Then he d curl up on edge like a shaving in bed And puff and smoke pipes in his sleep it is said And would snore oftentimes as the legends relate Till his folks were wrought up to a terrible state Then he d snort and rear up and roll over and there In the subsequent hush they could hear him chew air And so glaringly bald was the top of his head That many s the time he has musingly said As his eyes journeyed o er its reflex in the glass I must set out a few signs of Keep Off the Grass So remarkably deaf was my grandfather Squeers That he had to wear lightning rods over his ears To even hear thunder and oftentimes then He was forced to request it to thunder again THE GENTLE ART OF BOOSTING BY JOHN KENDRICK BANGS The Idiot was very late at breakfast so extremely late in fact that some apprehension was expressed by his fellow boarders as to the state of his health I hope he isn t ill said mister Whitechoker He is usually so prompt at his meals that I fear something is the matter with him He s all right said the Doctor whose room adjoins that of the Idiot in missus Smithers Pedagog s Select Home for Gentlemen He ll be down in a minute He s suffering from an overdose of vacation rested too hard Just then the subject of the conversation appeared in the doorway pale and haggard but with an eye that boded ill for the larder Quick he cried as he entered Lead me to a square meal Mary please give me four bowls of mush ten medium soft boiled eggs a barrel of sautee potatoes and eighteen dollars worth of corned beef hash I ll have two pots of coffee missus Pedagog please four pounds of sugar and a can of condensed milk If there is any extra charge you may put it on the bill and some day when Hot Air Common goes up thirty or forty points I ll pay What s the matter with you mister Idiot asked mister Brief Been fasting for a week No replied the Idiot I ve just taken my first week s vacation and between you and me I ve come back to business so as to get rested up for the second Doesn t look as though vacation agreed with you said the Bibliomaniac It doesn t said the Idiot Hereafter I am an advocate of the Russell Sage system Never take a day off if you can help it There s nothing so restful as paying attention to business and no greater promoter of weariness of spirit and vexation of your digestion than the modern style of vacating No more for mine if you please Humph sneered the Bibliomaniac I suppose you went to Coney Island to get rested up Bumping the Bump and Looping the Loop and doing a lot of other crazy things Not I quoth the Idiot I didn t have sense enough to go to some quiet place like Coney Island where you can get seven square meals a day and then climb into a Ferris Wheel and be twirled around in the air until they have been properly shaken down I took one of the four hundred Vacations Know what that is No said mister Brief I didn t know there were four hundred Vacations with only three hundred sixty five days in the year What do you mean I mean the kind of Vacation the people in the four hundred take explained the Idiot I ve been to a house party up in Newport with some friends of mine who re in the swim and I tell you it s hard swimming You ll never hear me talking about a leisure class in this country again Those people don t know what leisure is I don t wonder they re always such a tired looking lot I was not aware that you were in with the smart set said the Bibliomaniac Oh yes said the Idiot I m in with several of em way in So far in that I m sometimes afraid I ll never get out We re carrying a whole lot of wild cats on margin for Billie Van Gelder the cotillion leader Tommy de Cahoots the famous yachtsman owes us about eight thousand dollars more than he can spare from his living expenses on one of his plunges into Copper and altogether we are pretty long on swells in our office And do you mean to say those people invite you out asked the Bibliomaniac All the time said the Idiot Just as soon as one of our swell customers finds he can t pay his margins he comes down to the office and gets very chummy with all of us The deeper he is in it the more affable he becomes The result is there are house parties and yacht cruises and all that sort of thing galore on tap for us every summer And you accept them eh said the Bibliomaniac scornfully As a matter of business of course replied the Idiot We ve got to get something out of it If one of our customers can t pay cash why we get what we can In this particular case mister Reginald Squandercash had me down at Newport for five full days and I know now why he can t pay up his little shortage of eight hundred dollars He s got the money but he needs it for other things and now that I know it I shall recommend the firm to give him an extension of thirty days By that time he will have collected from the De Boodles whom he is launching in society C O D and will be able to square matters with us Your conversation is Greek to me said the Bibliomaniac Who are the De Boodles and for what do they owe your friend Reginald Squandercash money The De Boodles explained the Idiot are what is known as Climbers and Reginald Squandercash is a Booster A what cried the Bibliomaniac A Booster said the Idiot There are several Boosters in the four hundred For a consideration they will boost wealthy Climbers into Society The Climbers are people like the De Boodles who have suddenly come into great wealth and who wish to be in it with others of great wealth who are also of high social position They don t know how to do the trick so they seek out some Booster like Reggie strike a bargain with him and he steers em up against the Among Those Present Game until finally you find the De Boodles have a social cinch Do you mean to say that Society tolerates such a business as that demanded the Bibliomaniac Tolerates laughed the Idiot What a word to use Tolerates Why Society encourages because Society shares the benefits Take this especial vacation of mine Society had two five o clock teas four of the swellest dinners you ever sat down to a cotillion where the favors were of solid silver and real ostrich feathers a whole day s clam bake on Reggie s steam yacht with automobile runs and coaching trips galore Nobody ever declines one of Reggie s invitations because what he has from a Society point of view is the best the market affords Why the floral decorations alone at the Fete Champetre he gave in honor of the De Boodles at his villa last Thursday night must have cost five thousand dollars and everything was on the same scale I don t believe a cent less than seven thousand five hundred dollars was burned up in the fire works and every lady present received a souvenir of the occasion that cost at least one hundred dollars Your story doesn t quite hold together said mister Brief If your friend Reggie has a villa and a steam yacht and automobiles and coaches and gives fetes champetres that cost fifteen or twenty thousand dollars I don t see why he has to make himself a Booster of inferior people who want to get into Society What does he gain by it It surely isn t sport to do a thing like that and I should think he d find it a dreadful bore The man must live said the Idiot He boosts for a living When he has the wealth of Monte Cristo at his command demanded mister Brief Reggie hasn t a cent to his name said the Idiot I ve already told you he owes us eight hundred dollars he can t pay Then who in thunder pays for the villa and the lot and all those hundred dollar souvenirs asked the Doctor Why this year the De Boodles said the Idiot Last year it was Colonel and missus Moneybags whose daughter Miss Fayette Moneybags is now clinching the position Reggie sold her at Newport over in London whither Reggie has consigned her to his sister an impecunious American Duchess the Duchess of Nocash who is also in the boosting business The chances are Miss Moneybags will land one of England s most deeply indebted peers and if she does Reggie will receive a handsome cheque for steering the family up against so attractive a proposition And you mean to tell us that a plain man like old John De Boodle of Nevada is putting out his hard earned wealth in that way demanded mister Brief I didn t mean to mention any names said the Idiot But you ve spotted the victim Old John De Boodle who made his sixty million dollars in six months after having kept a saloon on the frontier for forty years is the man His family wants to get in the swim and Reggie is turning the trick for them and after all what better way is there for De Boodle to get in He might take sixty villas at Newport and not get a peep at the Divorce Colony there much less a glimpse of the monogamous set acting independently Not a monkey in the Zoo would dine with the De Boodles and in his most eccentric moment I doubt if Tommy Dare would take them up unless there was somebody to stand sponsor for them A cool million might easily be expended without results by the De Boodles themselves but hand that money over to Reggie Squandercash whose blood is as blue as his creditors sometimes get and you can look for results What the Frohmans are to the stage Reggie Squandercash is to Society He s right in it popular as all spenders are lavish as all people spending other people s money are apt to be Old De Boodle egged on by missus De Boodle and Miss Mary Ann De Boodle now known as Miss Marianne De Boodle goes to Reggie and says The old lady and my girl are nutty on Society Can you land em Certainly says Reggie if your pocket is long enough How long is that asks De Boodle wincing a bit A hundred thousand a month and no extras until you re in says Reggie No reduction for families asks De Boodle anxiously No says Reggie Harder job All right says De Boodle here s my cheque for the first month That s how Reggie gets his Newport villa his servants his horses yacht automobiles and coaches Then he invites the De Boodles up to visit him They accept and the fun begins First it s a little dinner to meet my friends mister and missus De Boodle of Nevada Everybody there hungry dinner from Sherrys best wines in the market De Boodles covered with diamonds a great success especially old John De Boodle who tells racy stories over the demi tasse when the ladies have gone into the drawing room De Boodle voted a character Next thing Bridge Whist party Everybody there Society a good winner The De Boodles magnificent losers Popularity cinched Next yachting party Everybody on board De Boodle on deck in fine shape Champagne flows like Niagara Poker game in main cabin Food everywhere De Boodles much easier Stiffness wearing off and so on and so on until finally Miss De Boodle s portrait is printed in nineteen Sunday newspapers all over the country They re launched and Reggie comes into his own with a profit for the season in a cash balance of fifty thousand dollars He s had a bully time all summer entertained like a Prince and comes to the rainy season with a tidy little umbrella to keep him out of the wet And can he count on that as a permanent business asked mister Whitechoker My dear sir the Rock of Gibraltar is no solider and no more permanent said the Idiot For as long as there is a four hundred in existence human nature is such that there will also be a million who will want to get into it At such a cost demanded the Bibliomaniac At any cost replied the Idiot Even people who know they can not swim want to get in it COLUMBIA AND THE COWBOY BY ALICE MACGOWAN When the circus come to town Mighty me Mighty me Jest one wink from that ol clown When he s struttin up an down To the music Bim bam bee Oh sich sights sich sights to see When the circus come to town Blowout was on a boom The railroad from above was coming through and Blowout was to be a city with that mysterious and rather disconcerting abruptness with which tiny Western villages do become cities in these circumstances It had been hoped that the railroad would be through by the Fourth of July when the less important celebration of the nation s birthday might be combined with the proper marking of that event But though tales came down to Blowout of how the contractors were working night and day shifts and shipping men from the East in order to have the road through in time though the Wagon Tire House had entertained many squads of engineers and even occasional parties of the contractors men the railroad was not through on the Fourth Something much more important was arranged by Providence however at least more important in the eyes of the children of the Wagon Tire House Frosty La Rue s grand aggregation of talent was to be in Blowout for a week and the human performers were stopping at Huldah Sarvice s hotel If one can go far enough back to remember the awe and mystery surrounding a circus and then imagine a circus coming bodily to lodge in one s own dwelling to eat with the knives and forks at one s table a circus which could swallow fire and swords and things of that sort just eating off plates in the ordinary manner with Sissy waiting on the table behind its chairs if one can get back to this happy time it will be possible to comprehend some of the rapture the twins Gess and Tell experienced while Frosty La Rue s show abode at the Wagon Tire House They lorded it over every other child in Blowout shining with reflected splendor They were the most sought after of any of the boys in school for Romey was too young to afford information La Rue himself looked upon them and said that they were likely little fellers and that he wouldn t mind having them to train Think of that To train Aunt Huldah with bat like blindness to their best advantages had stated to mister La Rue that their father was in well in Kansas and had only left them with her as it were on demand For one dreadful moment the twins envied Aunt Huldah s real orphans Then realizing that Aunt Huldah would no more give up Sissy or Ally than she would give up them they reflected that the ambition of boys is apt in this cold unsympathetic world to be thwarted by their elders and settled down to the more active and thorough enjoyment of what they might have The company consisted of old La Rue his second wife who figured upon the bill as Signorina Ippolita di Castelli an ex circus rider of very mature years Frosty s factotum a Mexican by the name of Jose Romero little Roy the Aerial Wonder son of Frosty and the Signorina and last and most important of all Minnie La Rue The show was well known in the Texas cattle country and well loved Frosty s daughter she was only sixteen when he was last at Blowout more than a year ago was a pretty little thing and her father had trained her to be a graceful tight rope performer He himself did some shooting from horseback which most of the cowboys who applauded it could have beaten Frosty La Rue drank hard and he was very surly when he was drinking Even Aunt Huldah s boundless charity found it difficult to speak well of his treatment of Minnie The Signorina could take care of herself and of the Aerial Wonder as well But the heft of her father s temper and sometimes the weight of his hand also fell on the young girl when things went amiss And things had gone amiss more particularly in regard to her during the last six months Up to that time she had looked like a child small for her age silent with big wistful eyes deft clever fingers and a voice and manner that charmed every audience in short the most valuable piece of property in La Rue s outfit The girl had bloomed into sudden and lovely girlhood when Kid Barringer saw her at Abilene in April patiently performing the tricks that had been taught her obediently risking her young life that there might be plenty of money for her father to lose at the monte table and that they might all be clothed and fed Kid had known the La Rue family and the girl for years and when he promptly lost his heart to this surprising development of its daughter he went frankly to the head of the clan and asked for her like a man There was no fault to find with Kid Barringer He was good looking more intelligent than most of his mates an honest industrious and kind hearted fellow of whom his employers spoke well If the girl cared for him and Kid asserted that he had asked her and found out that she did care she could not hope to do better But of course for La Rue to give up this most valuable chattel was out of the question What he did therefore was to fly into a rage refuse the Kid s offer in language which would have precipitated a brawl had the young man been less earnest in his wooing and consign Minnie to the watchful vigilance of her stepmother And the cowboy had been vainly following the show during the whole two months that had passed since this episode anxiously watching his poor little hard worked sweetheart hoping to get a word from her meaning in any case to reassure her and show her that he had not given up Matters were in this state when the aggregation settled down at the Wagon Tire House for the week during which the Fourth of July was to occur For this occasion La Rue promised a display of fireworks superior to anything ever shown in West Texas The fame of this spectacle had preceded the show It had been given in Emerald the year before and all the cowboys who had seen it there brought back word that it was the finest ever The particular feature was in the closing act which La Rue had christened Columbia Enlightening the World For this performance a wire was stretched across the street from the top of one building to another La Rue intended this year to have it stretched from the Roundup to the Wagon Tire House Across this wire Minnie was to walk dressed as Columbia with a high spiked diadem upon her head her whole form outlined with colored fires and bearing certain rockets which were set off when she reached the center of the street Everybody in the Wagon Tire House liked the girl Frosty was offensively polite or aggressively insulting missus La Rue was as Troy Gilbert said a pretty tough specimen or if one would rather follow Aunt Huldah s cheerful and charitable lead She looked a heap nicer and appeared a heap better in the show than out of it the Aerial Wonder was something of a terrestrial terror but there was no question that Minnie La Rue was one of the sweetest and best little girls ever brought up in an inappropriate circus Therefore when Kid Barringer appeared a day after the La Rue family and told the boys freely what the situation of his affairs was he received unlimited sympathy and offers of assistance I wish I could help you Kid Troy Gilbert said There isn t a soul in town that doesn t feel as though that little girl ought to be taken out of that man s keeping But you see he s her own father I reckon says he is and the law can t go behind that If you boys would fix up a scheme to get me a chance to speak to Minnie Kid began At first I thought I could steal her just as easy as anything She d be glad to go I had a little note from her Say Gib he broke off suddenly with a catch in his voice he s liable to strike her to hurt her when he s drinking Well if it went as far as that here in Blowout I would arrest him you know Gilbert suggested It won t Kid returned dejectedly not at the Wagon Tire House Aunt Huldy has a good effect on him or rather bad effect for that purpose He s jest behavin himself so straight that Aunt Huldy won t hear a word about him bein the meanest that ever was Troy was thinking intently Say Kid I ve got an idea Do you reckon Aunt Huldy thinks too well of Frosty to help us out a little If she doesn t I believe the thing s as good as done I saw that there Columbia Enlightening the World at Emerald last year and I know exactly how I could fix it so as to let you well you wait a minute and I ll give you all the details It s the only thing on the program that separates your girl from the Signorina for five minutes It must have been that Aunt Huldah saw more harm in Frosty La Rue than she was willing to mention for an hour later Gilbert had made his arrangements Now Kid he counseled I want you to make yourself scarce around here from now on Don t let Frosty know you re in the diggin s at all We boys are going to give it out that you ve gone to Fort Worth so that he and missus La Rue won t watch Miss Minnie quite so close The Kid obediently withdrew from public life spending most of his days in the back room of the big store where a few sympathizing friends were always ready to bear him company and the word went out that he had in despair given up camping on Miss Minnie s trail and gone off to Fort Worth This intelligence reaching old man La Rue Gilbert wondered a little if it were possible any of it came to him through Aunt Huldah had the desired effect of relaxing the watch upon the girl The first move in Gilbert s game was to waylay Frosty s Mexican and bribe him to feign sickness To this Jose promptly consented and he counterfeited with such vigor and so to the life that the proprietor of the show was beside himself for it was too late to teach a new man the management of the fireworks And now came Gilbert s second move He approached the old man with the inquiry Why what s the racket Frosty Something the matter with some of your outfit La Rue sweepingly condemned the whole republic of Mexico in general and Jose Romero in particular winding up with the statement that the no account greaser had gone and got sick here at the last minute Frosty would seem to imply out of sheer perversity and when it was too late to teach another his duties Upon this Gilbert unfolded his scheme with a careful carelessness Fireworks Why do you know Frosty I believe I could do your fireworks for you all right I know fireworks pretty well and I saw your Columbia at Emerald last year And would you do it Gilbert asked La Rue It wouldn t pay added the tight fisted old fellow It wouldn t pay you a man like you but Oh I just don t want to see the boys disappointed and the show spoiled rejoined Gilbert I don t want any money La Rue was almost ready to embrace the sheriff of Wild Horse County His burdens had not been light even before the despised Jose s defection There was a multitude of things big and little which could not well be carried with a show of the sort but had always to be picked up locally at the last moment and a crude little cow town like Blowout not only failed to supply many of these but stood as one might say with dropped jaw at the very suggestion of them at the mere mention of their unfamiliar names And so the company otherwise the La Rue family had to produce much of the paraphernalia out of its inner consciousness which meant that the old man s temper was continually rasped that the Signorina s nerves and her ingenuity were on a strain and that Minnie was hard at work from dawn till dark practising between whiles Troy Gilbert had put it most hopefully when he said that he knew fireworks pretty well or one might say that the statement was susceptible of two different interpretations As a matter of fact Troy knew fireworks only from the spectator s side of the question He now had Jose Romero moved over into the back room of his place where he might mitigate the rigors of that alien s confinement and at the same time receive from the Mexican very necessary instruction Mercifully there was an ample supply of fireworks for the show was to be repeated at Antelope over in Lone Jack County and again at Cinche Moreover drawing heavily as he had been instructed upon Kid Barringer s bank account Gilbert wrote to Fort Worth and ordered a duplicate set of these fireworks sent on to Cinche And in the darkness of night when Blowout was wrapped in slumber Gilbert and Romero rode silently out down the flank of the divide across the plain and into a little canon six or seven miles distant in the breaks of Wild Horse Creek All day in the intervals of his business duties Gilbert had been receiving theoretical instructions now with the set of fireworks which was to have dazzled and delighted the residents of Antelope he made practical experiment of the knowledge so gained The little show witnessed only by the naked walls of the canon and such prairie dogs and jack rabbits as had been untimely aroused from their slumbers went off fairly well which is to say that most of Gilbert s fingers and nearly all of his features went back to Blowout sound and entire Oh I got the hang of the business he declared again and again as they rode along through the soft Texas night I got the hang of it I can make the whole first part go all right The thing now is to get that Columbia act fixed so as to give the boys a run for their money and leave a chance for Minnie and Kid The two rode home and later Jose went to bed in Gilbert s back room where work was going forward upon a mysterious looking structure II In our village hall a Justice stands A neater form was never made of board Frosty La Rue s grand aggregation of talent had given two shows in a tent on the third of July On the Fourth there would again be two tent shows one in the afternoon and one at night and at the close of the night performance when the concert of an ordinary circus takes place there was to be a grand open air spectacle as Frosty himself put it For this purpose a platform had been erected upon which Frosty and the Signorina could do a knife throwing turn and where the Aerial Wonder could give an infantile exhibition with a small bicycle A wire had been stretched across Comanche Street from the top of the Roundup to the top of the Wagon Tire House and upon this was to be given the most ambitious performance of the evening Columbia Enlightening the World All day long on the Fourth the town was full of rejoicing young Texas masculinity mounted upon Texas ponies careering about the streets in conspicuously full enjoyment of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness And all day long Frosty La Rue s tent show did a land office business Poor old Frosty Many of the cowboys could shoot better than he but they didn t shoot at colored glass balls The bareback riding also came under some contempt but the spangles and pink fleshings carried much weight the Signorina painted most artistically and as Aunt Huldah said When she was a goin right fast on that fat white hoss with the little platform on his back an a smilin an kissin her hand she did really look right nice Minnie s trapeze acts were truly fine and were appreciated at their full value and the beautiful little figure walking the wire twenty feet above the ground was greeted with unlimited enthusiasm When the evening came old Frosty inclined to be as nervous and irritable with Gilbert as he dared came running into the latter s place worrying about the fireworks Now you chase yourself along advised the sheriff good naturedly Just get right along an tend to your little old illuminated knife throwin trick Tain t ten minutes till that s due an you ve got a crowd that s good for five hundred dollars if it s good for a cent when you pass the hat And he added delight in the scheme he was working getting the better of his natural instinct for literal truth and luck just fool luck has sent you the finest fireworks operator in West Texas Shoo out of here now an tend to your own job an let me tend to mine As for the children of the Wagon Tire House they were perhaps more glorious on that warm dark July night than anything in their after lives could make them This is not to say that the six were not destined for happy or distinguished careers but after all the magnificence of an occasion depends greatly upon the point of view and the small hill is a high mountain to the little child They had been permitted to extend invitations to the more favored of their young friends Bunt Tarver and Roach Porterman s two small girls with Eddie Beach who lived on a ranch outside of Blowout and stayed all night at the Wagon Tire House in a state of bliss that was almost cataleptic were among the little bunch that presented themselves to go upon the roof of the kitchen from which a magnificent view of the fireworks was to be had I can t have it Troy announced I can t have you children up here Oh yes Gib oh yes you can They won t Aunt Huldah s voice sank to a murmur which Troy Gilbert answered with a shake of the head Well ef they do see anything they ll keep still my chil en are trained to mind and these others are all good people and Aunt Huldah beamed upon the palpitating expectant alarmed little band Keep still what an awful phrase for such a connection Gilbert turned and asked them kindly Will you kids Will you keep right still whatever you see Only Gess and Tell were bold enough to put the horror into words Tain t no use fer us to promise Gess said huskily We re jest bound to holler when the fireworks begins to go off even if we had promised cross yer heart And Tell piped in after him as usual W y a circus is jest hollerin or some hollerin is the best part of a circus And he added with a suspicious tremble in his voice I d rather go downstairs an set in the kitchen if we can t holler Troy burst out laughing at sight of the dejected faces Oh holler all you want to holler as much as you can I don t mean hollerin I expect to do some pretty considerable hollerin myself and I ve got a lot of the boys promised to holler at the right time But there s to be a little a little extra performance up here on the roof and if you see anything queer about it you mustn t let on you mustn t tell That s all right assured Aunt Huldah turning to descend the narrow little stairway They ll do jest as you tell em Gib Mind you don t tip them soap boxes over an fall off n the roof chil en Sissy you keep tight hold of Ally s hand she s apt to fly when the big performance comes and Aunt Huldah s rich mellow chuckling laugh came back to them up the stairs One would have said that nothing on earth could make matters more glorious to the children of the Wagon Tire House on this Fourth of July evening but after Troy Gilbert s words they trod not upon the earthen roof of the hotel but on air they sat not upon soap boxes but on thrones Nay kings were small people compared to them There was to be a mysterious extra performance in which the sheriff was implicated it would take place under their very noses and they were asked to assist to keep still about it Gilbert had said truly the crowd was a big one and most enthusiastic As a matter of fact there were nearly a hundred cowboys on hand who had been let into Gilbert s scheme The fireworks were equally successful whether they blazed splendidly or fizzled ingloriously It was enough for the boys that Troy Gilbert was doing the act they whooped at every figure and whooped again at Troy s unaccustomed drollery There was a strain of intense expectancy in the audience communicated though without their knowledge to those not in the secret from those who were so that the crowd was wildly eager without altogether knowing why After the display of pin wheels fiery serpents bouquets Roman candles and rockets old Frosty and missus Frosty otherwise the Signorina Ippolita di Castelli came on the small platform to do their knife throwing act the knives trailing fiery tails This kept the audience entertained during the time necessary to prepare the Columbia act Bet you d be scared to do that whispered Eddie Beach Bet I wouldn t Gess made answer I d jest as soon sling them old knives mister La Rue said me an Tell was likely boys to train I bet Ally d hold as still as the Signorina f I was to throw them knives at her For the Columbia performance Gilbert had during the day stretched another wire about five feet and three inches above the big wire on which Minnie was to walk Indeed it was this secondary wire which had caused the eruption of old Frosty demanding to know When the knife throwing act was finished there was a short pause followed by a little murmur of applause and this grew louder and louder until it was a medley of whoops yells stamping and calls in every tone and key for the next act the grand stroke of the performance Frosty and the Signorina forbore to go upon the roof of the Roundup to receive Minnie until they should see her start from the roof of the hotel Figures were seen upon the top of the Wagon Tire House both roofs were flat and Frosty strained his eyes eagerly toward that end of the big wire The wondering children drew back and refrained even from whispering among themselves Troy s caution was not needed Strange doings indeed were going forward about the end of the wire Troy Gilbert was apparently pushing a reluctant figure toward it it looked as though the person were tied and he laughed and struck her when she seemed unwilling Finally Columbia began to move out slowly along the wire She was everything that audience or proprietor could desire The spiked tiara was on her head blazing with violet light Down her back hung her fair curling hair in her hands was the long balancing pole Columbia s scepter of power and her white draperies were illuminated with fires of blue and crimson and violet The children stared silent motionless expectant They were nearer than those in the street and had had opportunity to observe the irregularity of Columbia s launching There was a little outburst of applause when she first appeared But as she moved out over the wire the silence was so complete that the coughing of one of the patient ponies on the outskirts of the crowd was plainly audible Those in the secret were silent in ecstasies of admiration The children kept still because they had been told to whatever they saw Those not instructed were mute with amazement a sort of creeping awe Most of the audience had seen Minnie that afternoon in the tent show her slender girlish form clad in spangled gauze her delicate blonde prettiness enhanced by the attire doing her trapeze act She had then moved with the lithe grace of a young deer her face had been all eager animation What sort of thing was this that seemed to advance along the wire as though it were on casters that was never seen to take a step What face was this strange staring immobile as a face carved in wood Gee murmured one of the X Q K boys who had come in late and was uninformed Gee I ain t been a drinkin a thing what in the name o pity ails that gal Great Scott she gives me the mauley grubs Ugh and his companion shivered But save for these murmured comments the crowd was intensely still Suddenly about the middle of the street Columbia s forward movement slackened checked altogether This was not unexpected for midway the rockets fastened about her waist and upon her crown were to be discharged The manner in which these latter went off brought shrieks and groans from the crowd below They fizzed up into Columbia s face they burned against her bodice they struck her arms Oh oh Poor soul she ll have her eyes put out She ll be killed cried a woman s voice from the street I might a known better than to trust that fool Gilbert with them fireworks groaned old Frosty That there girl is worth more n a hundred dollars a month to me If I was to take her East I could hire her out for two hundred easy an here she s likely to get all crippled up so s t she won t never be no account Columbia was the only personage unmoved by all the fiery demonstrations she stood rigid looking strangely massive and tall till the last rocket had spent itself Then her progress began again with a sort of jerk A shudder went over her frame the pole wavered in her hands those hands that seemed so limp and lifeless she tottered made a violent movement with her head then swayed out sidewise and fell holding the pole tight in her hands And the strangest sound went up from that big assembly a mingled sound of groans and smothered outcries and also what one might have sworn had it not seemed impossible was wild hysteric laughter Gess and Tell and Eddie Beach luxuriating in Troy s permission to holler as much as they pleased emitted shrieks that would have chilled the blood of any whom this strange spectacle had not already terrified For instead of falling to the ground twenty feet below as would have been natural and lying there a mangled body Columbia hung to the wire a mad fantastic incredible spectacle head downward in a blaze of inverted patriotic splendor The wildest confusion ensued Frosty was beside himself He simply danced and yelled where he stood Those who were in the secret shouted themselves hoarse with rapture capering like dervishes embracing one another those who were not screamed with horror and dismay As all gazed fascinated something drifted down from the hanging figure A cowboy plunged forward caught it up and there broke upon the sudden stillness which had followed this incident a roar of hearty laughter as he held high in the blaze of light that came from the pendent figure Columbia s wooden seeming countenance a false face Instantly the shouting and confusion broke out again The figure began to sway and the light draperies were ignited by some bit of fire which had been brought into contact with them by the inversion of Columbia s proper position The figure showed that beyond the streaming golden hair the beautiful fair hair which Aunt Huldah had cut from Daisy s head and which Daisy had given with loving generosity and the stuffed out waist of Columbia s classic robe the only anatomy Columbia possessed was an upright post with a wheel at the bottom a caster indeed which had run upon the big wire At the top of Columbia s head there had been another wheel which ran trolley like upon the upper wire and a slender wire traveling along the lower or footway wire had drawn the figure forward Some obstacle had been met in the overhead wire and when the figure was jerked forward harder and harder to overcome this the upper attachment finally gave way entirely and allowed the figure to fall Only Gilbert s precaution of looping a heavy wire from axle to axle of the lower wheel around the footway wire had prevented Columbia from falling to the ground As the explanation began to spread over the crowd not in whispers but in shouts mingled with roars of laughter those who had been instructed beforehand pressed round old Frosty and the Signorina in a dense mass Threats complaints demands all sorts of outcries filled the air You old fakir What do you mean by it Frosty Do you think you re a goin to run a blazer like this on us and we ll swaller hit like hit was catnip tea What fer did ye want to fool us thataway We ain t a goin to stand it we ll Gentlemen jest be quiet Let me out let me git across the street to the Wagon Tire where my daughter is and I can explain things Explain nothin was the cry you ll explain right here Do you think Blowout is a goin to stand this kind o thing Who put you up to run this blazer on us Them fellers at Plain View Er them scrubs at Cinche This town ain t a goin to stand it Gentlemen came Frosty s pipe again gentlemen let me out jest let me git to my daughter let me git out o here before it s too late This is some o that scoundrel Kid Barringer s doin s Let me out gentlemen But the old man had gone the wrong way about it Kid was one of them a good fellow and much liked Even those who knew nothing now scented a romance The big crowd hemmed old Frosty in and held him there with pretended wrath and resentment At the back door of the Wagon Tire House just before the wooden Columbia appeared to the eyes of Blowout a meeting had taken place From that door Aunt Huldah had stepped with Minnie clinging to her arm In the dense shadow Kid Barringer was waiting with two of the best ponies in Wild Horse County He came eagerly forward Kid said Aunt Huldah s heartsome voice here s Minnie I ve brung her to you I b lieve we re doin right You re a good boy Kid An I know you love her an will take keer o her Ef you wasn t to you d shore have me to fight and she chuckled genially Good by honey Ye needn t to look skeered We all have got ye now an we ll take keer of ye the hull kit an bilin o us Good by bless your sweet little heart With the word Minnie was in her saddle swung there by her lover s strong arms and away across the levels beside him And while back in Blowout the Signorina fairly clawed cat like to get through that wall of cowboys and across the street to where believing Kid Barringer to be as far away as Fort Worth she had left Minnie scarce half an hour before while the old man shouted and swore and protested and fairly wept with rage and apprehension Kid Barringer reached his left hand out to his companion saying Slack him down a little honey we re safe now mister Ferguson the Presbyterian preacher he s promised me I told him an he s a goin to marry us His place ain t half a mile further on an he s lookin fer us We re safe now my poor little girl The cowboys with roars of delight fished down the remains of the dangling Columbia while the original performer to whom Columbia s figure was understudy stood in mister Ferguson s little parlor waiting for that gentleman to bring in a second witness Her little fair head was resting on Kid s broad shoulder Kid s arm was around her slender figure and she was saying between laughter and tears Kid how do you reckon that old machine Columbia is getting along with my turn back there at Blowout And the happy bridegroom made blissful answer I don t know or keer honey She can go it on her head for all of us can t she She give us our chance to get away and that was all we wanted Aunt Huldy is the Lord s own people I ll never forget her You wouldn t hardly a thought I was good enough if Aunt Huldy hadn t a recommended me I don t believe My little girl ain t never a goin to get to walk no more wires ONE OF THE PALLS BY DOANE ROBINSON I were a pall to the burrying Joe s finally out of the way Nothing special ailing of him Just old age and

construct a railroad from the saint Croix river or lake to the west end of Lake Superior and to Bayfield mister Knott said mister SPEAKER If I could be actuated by any conceivable inducement to betray the sacred trust reposed in me by those to whose generous confidence I am indebted for the honor of a seat on this floor if I could be influenced by any possible consideration to become instrumental in giving away in violation of their known wishes any portion of their interest in the public domain for the mere promotion of any railroad enterprise whatever I should certainly feel a strong inclination to give this measure my most earnest and hearty support for I am assured that its success would materially enhance the pecuniary prosperity of some of the most valued friends I have on earth friends for whose accommodation I would be willing to make almost any sacrifice not involving my personal honor or my fidelity as the trustee of an express trust And that fact of itself would be sufficient to countervail almost any objection I might entertain to the passage of this bill not inspired by an imperative and inexorable sense of public duty But independent of the seductive influences of private friendship to which I admit I am perhaps as susceptible as any of the gentlemen I see around me the intrinsic merits of the measure itself are of such an extraordinary character as to commend it most strongly to the favorable consideration of every member of this House myself not excepted notwithstanding my constituents in whose behalf alone I am acting here would not be benefited by its passage one particle more than they would be by a project to cultivate an orange grove on the bleakest summit of Greenland s icy mountains Laughter Now sir as to those great trunk lines of railway spanning the continent from ocean to ocean I confess my mind has never been fully made up It is true they may afford some trifling advantages to local traffic and they may even in time become the channels of a more extended commerce Yet I have never been thoroughly satisfied either of the necessity or expediency of projects promising such meagre results to the great body of our people But with regard to the transcendent merits of the gigantic enterprise contemplated in this bill I never entertained the shadow of a doubt Laughter Years ago when I first heard that there was somewhere in the vast terra incognita somewhere in the bleak regions of the great Northwest a stream of water known to the nomadic inhabitants of the neighborhood as the river saint Croix I became satisfied that the construction of a railroad from that raging torrent to some point in the civilized world was essential to the happiness and prosperity of the American people if not absolutely indispensable to the perpetuity of republican institutions on this continent Great laughter I felt instinctively that the boundless resources of that prolific region of sand and pine shrubbery would never be fully developed without a railroad constructed and equipped at the expense of the Government and perhaps not then Laughter I had an abiding presentiment that some day or other the people of this whole country irrespective of party affiliations regardless of sectional prejudices and without distinction of race color or previous condition of servitude would rise in their majesty and demand an outlet for the enormous agricultural productions of those vast and fertile pine barrens drained in the rainy season by the surging waters of the turbid saint Croix Great laughter These impressions derived simply and solely from the eternal fitness of things were not only strengthened by the interesting and eloquent debate on this bill to which I listened with so much pleasure the other day but intensified if possible as I read over this morning the lively colloquy which took place on that occasion as I find it reported in last Friday s Globe I will ask the indulgence of the House while I read a few short passages which are sufficient in my judgment to place the merits of the great enterprise contemplated in the measure now under discussion beyond all possible controversy The honorable gentleman from Minnesota mister Wilson who I believe is managing this bill in speaking of the character of the country through which this railroad is to pass says this We want to have the timber brought to us as cheaply as possible Now if you tie up the lands in this way so that no title can be obtained to them for no settler will go on these lands for he can not make a living you deprive us of the benefit of that timber Now sir I would not have it by any means inferred from this that the gentleman from Minnesota would insinuate that the people out in his section desire this timber merely for the purpose of fencing up their farms so that their stock may not wander off and die of starvation among the bleak hills of the saint Croix Laughter I read it for no such purpose sir and make no such comment on it myself In corroboration of this statement of the gentleman from Minnesota I find this testimony given by the honorable gentleman from Wisconsin mister Washburn Speaking of these same lands he says Under the bill as amended by my friend from Minnesota nine tenths of the land is open to actual settlers at two dollars fifty cents per acre the remaining one tenth is pine timbered land that is not fit for settlement and never will be settled upon but the timber will be cut off I admit that it is the most valuable portion of the grant for most of the grant is not valuable It is quite valueless and if you put in this amendment of the gentleman from Indiana you may as well just kill the bill for no man and no company will take the grant and build the road I simply pause here to ask some gentleman better versed in the science of mathematics than I am to tell me if the timbered lands are in fact the most valuable portion of that section of country and they would be entirely valueless without the timber that is on them what the remainder of the land is worth which has no timber on it at all Laughter But further on I find a most entertaining and instructive interchange of views between the gentleman from Arkansas mister Rogers the gentleman from Wisconsin mister Washburn and the gentleman from Maine mister Peters upon the subject of pine lands generally which I will tax the patience of the House to read mister Rogers Will the gentleman allow me to ask him a question mister Washburn of Wisconsin Certainly mister Rogers Are these pine lands entirely worthless except for timber mister Washburn of Wisconsin They are generally worthless for any other purpose I am perfectly familiar with that subject These lands are not valuable for purposes of settlement mister Farnsworth They will be after the timber is taken off mister Washburn of Wisconsin No sir mister Rogers I want to know the character of these pine lands mister Washburn of Wisconsin They are generally sandy barren lands My friend from the Green Bay district mister Sawyer is himself perfectly familiar with this question and he will bear me out in what I say that these pine timber lands are not adapted to settlement mister Rogers The pine lands to which I am accustomed are generally very good What I want to know is what is the difference between our pine lands and your pine lands mister Washburn of Wisconsin The pine timber of Wisconsin generally grows upon barren sandy land The gentleman from Maine mister Peters who is familiar with pine lands will I have no doubt say that pine timber grows generally upon the most barren lands mister Peters As a general thing pine lands are not worth much for cultivation And further on I find this pregnant question the joint production of the two gentlemen from Wisconsin mister Paine Does my friend from Indiana suppose that in any event settlers will occupy and cultivate these pine lands mister Washburn of Wisconsin Particularly without a railroad Yes sir particularly without a railroad It will be asked after a while I am afraid if settlers will go anywhere unless the Government builds a railroad for them to go on Laughter I desire to call attention to only one more statement which I think sufficient to settle the question It is one made by the gentleman from Wisconsin mister Paine who says These lands will be abandoned for the present It may be that at some remote period there will spring up in that region a new kind of agriculture which will cause a demand for these particular lands and they may then come into use and be valuable for agricultural purposes But I know and I can not help thinking that my friend from Indiana understands that for the present and for many years to come these pine lands can have no possible value other than that arising from the pine timber which stands on them Now sir who after listening to this emphatic and unequivocal testimony of these intelligent competent and able bodied witnesses laughter who that is not as incredulous as saint Thomas himself will doubt for a moment that the Goshen of America is to be found in the sandy valleys and upon the pine clad hills of saint Croix Laughter Who will have the hardihood to rise in his seat on this floor and assert that excepting the pine bushes the entire region would not produce vegetation enough in ten years to fatten a grasshopper Great laughter Where is the patriot who is willing that his country shall incur the peril of remaining another day without the amplest railroad connection with such an inexhaustible mine of agricultural wealth Laughter Who will answer for the consequences of abandoning a great and warlike people in possession of a country like that to brood over the indifference and neglect of their Government Laughter How long would it be before they would take to studying the Declaration of Independence and hatching out the damnable heresy of secession How long before the grim demon of civil discord would rear again his horrid head in our midst gnash loud his iron fangs and shake his crest of bristling bayonets Laughter Then sir think of the long and painful process of reconstruction that must follow with its concomitant amendments to the Constitution the seventeenth eighteenth and nineteenth articles The sixteenth it is of course understood is to be appropriated to those blushing damsels who are day after day beseeching us to let them vote hold office drink cock tails ride astraddle and do everything else the men do Roars of laughter But above all sir let me implore you to reflect for a single moment on the deplorable condition of our country in case of a foreign war with all our ports blockaded all our cities in a state of siege the gaunt spectre of famine brooding like a hungry vulture over our starving land our commissary stores all exhausted and our famishing armies withering away in the field a helpless prey to the insatiate demon of hunger our navy rotting in the docks for want of provisions for our gallant seamen and we without any railroad communication whatever with the prolific pine thickets of the saint Croix Great laughter Ah sir I could very well understand why my amiable friends from Pennsylvania mister Myers mister Kelley and mister O Neill should be so earnest in their support of this bill the other day and if their honorable colleague my friend mister Randall will pardon the remark I will say I considered his criticism of their action on that occasion as not only unjust but ungenerous I knew they were looking forward with the far reaching ken of enlightened statesmanship to the pitiable condition in which Philadelphia will be left unless speedily supplied with railroad connection in some way or other with this garden spot of the universe Laughter And besides sir this discussion has relieved my mind of a mystery that has weighed upon it like an incubus for years I could never understand before why there was so much excitement during the last Congress over the acquisition of Alta Vela I could never understand why it was that some of our ablest statesmen and most disinterested patriots should entertain such dark forebodings of the untold calamities that were to befall our beloved country unless we should take immediate possession of that desirable island But I see now that they were laboring under the mistaken impression that the Government would need the guano to manure the public lands on the saint Croix Great laughter Now sir I repeat I have been satisfied for years that if there was any portion of the inhabited globe absolutely in a suffering condition for want of a railroad it was these teeming pine barrens of the saint Croix Laughter At what particular point on that noble stream such a road should be commenced I knew was immaterial and so it seems to have been considered by the draughtsman of this bill It might be up at the spring or down at the foot log or the Watergate or the fish dam or anywhere along the bank no matter where Laughter But in what direction should it run or where should it terminate were always to my mind questions of the most painful perplexity I could conceive of no place on God s green earth in such straitened circumstances for railroad facilities as to be likely to desire or willing to accept such a connection Laughter I knew that neither Bayfield nor Superior City would have it for they both indignantly spurned the munificence of the Government when coupled with such ignominious conditions and let this very same land grant die on their hands years and years ago rather than submit to the degradation of a direct communication by railroad with the piny woods of the saint Croix and I knew that what the enterprising inhabitants of those giant young cities would refuse to take would have few charms for others whatever their necessities or cupidity might be Laughter Hence as I have said sir I was utterly at a loss to determine where the terminus of this great and indispensable road should be until I accidentally overheard some gentleman the other day mention the name of Duluth Great laughter Duluth The word fell upon my ear with peculiar and indescribable charm like the gentle murmur of a low fountain stealing forth in the midst of roses or the soft sweet accents of an angel s whisper in the bright joyous dream of sleeping innocence Duluth Twas the name for which my soul had panted for years as the hart panteth for the water brooks Renewed laughter But where was Duluth Never in all my limited reading had my vision been gladdened by seeing the celestial word in print Laughter And I felt a profounder humiliation in my ignorance that its dulcet syllables had never before ravished my delighted ear Roars of laughter I was certain the draughtsman of this bill had never heard of it or it would have been designated as one of the termini of this road I asked my friends about it but they knew nothing of it I rushed to the library and examined all the maps I could find Laughter I discovered in one of them a delicate hair like line diverging from the Mississippi near a place marked Prescott which I supposed was intended to represent the river saint Croix but I could nowhere find Duluth Nevertheless I was confident it existed somewhere and that its discovery would constitute the crowning glory of the present century if not of all modern times Laughter I knew it was bound to exist in the very nature of things that the symmetry and perfection of our planetary system would be incomplete without it renewed laughter that the elements of material nature would long since have resolved themselves back into original chaos if there had been such a hiatus in creation as would have resulted from leaving out Duluth Roars of laughter In fact sir I was overwhelmed with the conviction that Duluth not only existed somewhere but that wherever it was it was a great and glorious place I was convinced that the greatest calamity that ever befell the benighted nations of the ancient world was in their having passed away without a knowledge of the actual existence of Duluth that their fabled Atlantis never seen save by the hallowed vision of inspired poesy was in fact but another name for Duluth that the golden orchard of the Hesperides was but a poetical synonym for the beer gardens in the vicinity of Duluth Great laughter I was certain that Herodotus had died a miserable death because in all his travels and with all his geographical research he had never heard pf Duluth Laughter I knew that if the immortal spirit of Homer could look down from another heaven than that created by his own celestial genius upon the long lines of pilgrims from every nation of the earth to the gushing fountain of poesy opened by the touch of his magic wand if he could be permitted to behold the vast assemblage of grand and glorious productions of the lyric art called into being by his own inspired strains he would weep tears of bitter anguish that instead of lavishing all the stores of his mighty genius upon the fall of Ilion it had not been his more blessed lot to crystallize in deathless song the rising glories of Duluth Great and continued laughter Yet sir had it not been for this map kindly furnished me by the Legislature of Minnesota I might have gone down to my obscure and humble grave in an agony of despair because I could nowhere find Duluth Renewed laughter Had such been my melancholy fate I have no doubt that with the last feeble pulsation of my breaking heart with the last faint exhalation of my fleeting breath I should have whispered Where is Duluth Roars of laughter But thanks to the beneficence of that band of ministering angels who have their bright abodes in the far off capital of Minnesota just as the agony of my anxiety was about to culminate in the frenzy of despair this blessed map was placed in my hands and as I unfolded it a resplendent scene of ineffable glory opened before me such as I imagine burst upon the enraptured vision of the wandering peri through the opening gates of paradise Renewed laughter There there for the first time my enchanted eye rested upon the ravishing word Duluth This map sir is intended as it appears from its title to illustrate the position of Duluth in the United States but if gentlemen will examine it I think they will concur with me in the opinion that it is far too modest in its pretensions It not only illustrates the position of Duluth in the United States but exhibits its relations with all created things It even goes farther than this It lifts the shadowy veil of futurity and affords us a view of the golden prospects of Duluth far along the dim vista of ages yet to come If gentlemen will examine it they will find Duluth not only in the centre of the map but represented in the centre of a series of concentric circles one hundred miles apart and some of them as much as four thousand miles in diameter embracing alike in their tremendous sweep the fragrant savannas of the sun lit South and the eternal solitudes of snow that mantle the ice bound North Laughter How these circles were produced is perhaps one of those primordial mysteries that the most skillful paleologist will never be able to explain Renewed laughter But the fact is sir Duluth is preeminently a central place for I am told by gentlemen who have been so reckless of their own personal safety as to venture away into those awful regions where Duluth is supposed to be that it is so exactly in the centre of the visible universe that the sky comes down at precisely the same distance all around it Roars of laughter I find by reference to this map that Duluth is situated somewhere near the western end of Lake Superior but as there is no dot or other mark indicating its exact location I am unable to say whether it is actually confined to any particular spot or whether it is just lying around there loose Renewed laughter I really can not tell whether it is one of those ethereal creations of intellectual frostwork more intangible than the rose tinted clouds of a summer sunset one of those airy exhalations of the speculator s brain which I am told are ever flitting in the form of towns and cities along those lines of railroad built with Government subsidies luring the unwary settlers as the mirage of the desert lures the famishing traveler on and ever on until it fades away in the darkening horizon or whether it is a real bona fide substantial city all staked off with the lots marked with their owners names like that proud commercial metropolis recently discovered on the desirable shores of San Domingo Laughter But however that may be I am satisfied Duluth is there or thereabout for I see it stated here on this map that it is exactly thirty nine hundred and ninety miles from Liverpool laughter though I have no doubt for the sake of convenience it will be moved back ten miles so as to make the distance an even four thousand Renewed laughter Then sir there is the climate of Duluth unquestionably the most salubrious and delightful to be found anywhere on the Lord s earth Now I have always been under the impression as I presume other gentlemen have that in the region around Lake Superior it was cold enough for at least nine months in the year to freeze the smokestack off a locomotive Great laughter But I see it represented on this map that Duluth is situated exactly halfway between the latitudes of Paris and Venice so that gentlemen who have inhaled the exhilarating airs of the one or basked in the golden sunlight of the other may see at a glance that Duluth must be a place of untold delights laughter a terrestrial paradise fanned by the balmy zephyrs of an eternal spring clothed in the gorgeous sheen of ever blooming flowers and vocal with the silvery melody of nature s choicest songsters Laughter In fact sir since I have seen this map I have no doubt that Byron was vainly endeavoring to convey some faint conception of the delicious charms of Duluth when his poetic soul gushed forth in the rippling strains of that beautiful rhapsody Know ye the land of the cedar and vine Where the flowers ever blossom the beams ever shine Where the light wings of Zephyr oppressed with perfume Wax faint o er the gardens of Gul in her bloom Where the citron and olive are fairest of fruit And the voice of the nightingale never is mute Where the tints of the earth and the hues of the sky In color though varied in beauty may vie Laughter As to the commercial resources of Duluth sir they are simply illimitable and inexhaustible as is shown by this map I see it stated here that there is a vast scope of territory embracing an area of over two million square miles rich in every element of material wealth and commercial prosperity all tributary to Duluth Look at it sir pointing to the map Here are inexhaustible mines of gold immeasurable veins of silver impenetrable depths of boundless forest vast coal measures wide extended plains of richest pasturage all all embraced in this vast territory which must in the very nature of things empty the untold treasures of its commerce into the lap of Duluth Laughter Look at it sir Pointing to the map Do not you see from these broad brown lines drawn around this immense territory that the enterprising inhabitants of Duluth intend some day to inclose it all in one vast corral so that its commerce will be bound to go there whether it would or not Great laughter And here sir still pointing to the map I find within a convenient distance the Piegan Indians which of all the many accessories to the glory of Duluth I consider by far the most inestimable For sir I have been told that when the small pox breaks out among the women and children of that famous tribe as it sometimes does they afford the finest subjects in the world for the strategical experiments of any enterprising military hero who desires to improve himself in the noble art of war laughter especially for any valiant lieutenant general whose Trenchant blade Toledo trusty For want of fighting has grown rusty And eats into itself for lack Of somebody to hew and hack Great laughter Sir the great conflict now raging in the Old World has presented a phenomenon in military science unprecedented in the annals of mankind a phenomenon that has reversed all the traditions of the past as it has disappointed all the expectations of the present A great and warlike people renowned alike for their skill and valor have been swept away before the triumphant advance of an inferior foe like autumn stubble before a hurricane of fire For aught I know the next flash of electric fire that shimmers along the ocean cable may tell us that Paris with every fibre quivering with the agony of impotent despair writhes beneath the conquering heel of her loathed invader Ere another moon shall wax and wane the brightest star in the galaxy of nations may fall from the zenith of her glory never to rise again Ere the modest violets of early spring shall ope their beauteous eyes the genius of civilization may chant the wailing requiem of the proudest nationality the world has ever seen as she scatters her withered and tear moistened lilies o er the bloody tomb of butchered France But sir I wish to ask if you honestly and candidly believe that the Dutch would have ever overrun the French in that kind of style if General Sheridan had not gone over there and told King William and Von Moltke how he had managed to whip the Piegan Indians Great laughter And here sir recurring to this map I find in the immediate vicinity of the Piegans vast herds of buffalo and immense fields of rich wheat lands Here the hammer fell Many cries Go on Go on The Speaker Is there objection to the gentleman from Kentucky continuing his remarks The Chair hears none The gentleman will proceed mister Knott I was remarking sir upon these vast wheat fields represented on this map as in the immediate neighborhood of the buffaloes and the Piegans and was about to say that the idea of there being these immense wheat fields in the very heart of a wilderness hundreds and hundreds of miles beyond the utmost verge of civilization may appear to some gentlemen as rather incongruous as rather too great a strain on the blankets of veracity But to my mind there is no difficulty in the matter whatever The phenomenon is very easily accounted for It is evident sir that the Piegans sowed that wheat there and plowed it with buffalo bulls Great laughter Now sir this fortunate combination of buffaloes and Piegans considering their relative positions to each other and to Duluth as they are arranged on this map satisfies me that Duluth is destined to be the beef market of the world Here you will observe pointing to the map are the buffaloes directly between the Piegans and Duluth and here right on the road to Duluth are the Creeks Now sir when the buffaloes are sufficiently fat from grazing on these immense wheat fields you see it will be the easiest thing in the world for the Piegans to drive them on down stay all night with their friends the Creeks and go into Duluth in the morning Great laughter I think I see them now sir a vast herd of buffaloes with their heads down their eyes glaring their nostrils dilated their tongues out and their tails curled over their backs tearing along toward Duluth with about a thousand Piegans on their grass bellied ponies yelling at their heels Great laughter On they come And as they sweep past the Creeks they join in the chase and away they all go yelling bellowing ripping and tearing along amid clouds of dust until the last buffalo is safely penned in the stockyards of Duluth Shouts of laughter Sir I might stand here for hours and hours and expatiate with rapture upon the gorgeous prospects of Duluth as depicted upon this map But human life is too short and the time of this House far too valuable to allow me to linger longer upon the delightful theme Laughter I think every gentleman on this floor is as well satisfied as I am that Duluth is destined to become the commercial metropolis of the universe and that this road should be built at once I am fully persuaded that no patriotic representative of the American people who has a proper appreciation of the associated glories of Duluth and the saint Croix will hesitate a moment to say that every able bodied female in the land between the ages of eighteen and forty five who is in favor of women s rights should be drafted and set to work upon this great work without delay Roars of laughter Nevertheless sir it grieves my very soul to be compelled to say that I can not vote for the grant of lands provided for in this bill Ah sir you can have no conception of the poignancy of my anguish that I am deprived of that blessed privilege Laughter There are two insuperable obstacles in the way In the first place my constituents for whom I am acting here have no more interest in this road than they have in the great question of culinary taste now perhaps agitating the public mind of Dominica as to whether the illustrious commissioners who recently left this capital for that free and enlightened republic would be better fricasseed boiled or roasted great laughter and in the second place these lands which I am asked to give away alas are not mine to bestow My relation to them is simply that of trustee to an express trust And shall I ever betray that trust Never sir Rather perish Duluth Shouts of laughter Perish the paragon of cities Rather let the freezing cyclones of the bleak Northwest bury it forever beneath the eddying sands of the raging saint Croix Great laughter DICTUM SAPIENTI BY JOHN PAUL That tis well to be off with the old love Before one is on with the new Has somehow passed into a proverb But I never have found it true No love can be quite like the old love Whate er may be said for the new And if you dismiss me my darling

resembles a brick Come get for me some supper A good and regular meal That shall soothe this restless feeling And banish the pain I feel Not from the pastry bakers Not from the shops for cake I wouldn

fresh and nice As any they have in the city And get a liberal slice Such things through days of labor And nights devoid of ease For sad and desperate feelings Are wonderful remedies They have an astonishing power To aid and reinforce And come like the finally brethren That follows a long discourse Then get me a tender sirloin From off the bench or hook And lend to its sterling goodness The
