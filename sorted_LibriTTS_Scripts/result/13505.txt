Constance Garnett CONTENTS THE DUEL EXCELLENT PEOPLE MIRE NEIGHBOURS AT HOME EXPENSIVE LESSONS THE PRINCESS THE CHEMIST S WIFE THE DUEL I It was eight o clock in the morning the time when the officers the local officials and the visitors usually took their morning dip in the sea after the hot stifling night and then went into the pavilion to drink tea or coffee Ivan Andreitch Laevsky a thin fair young man of twenty eight wearing the cap of a clerk in the Ministry of Finance and with slippers on his feet coming down to bathe found a number of acquaintances on the beach and among them his friend Samoylenko the army doctor With his big cropped head short neck his red face his big nose his shaggy black eyebrows and grey whiskers his stout puffy figure and his hoarse military bass this Samoylenko made on every newcomer the unpleasant impression of a gruff bully but two or three days after making his acquaintance one began to think his face extraordinarily good natured kind and even handsome In spite of his clumsiness and rough manner he was a peaceable man of infinite kindliness and goodness of heart always ready to be of use He was on familiar terms with every one in the town lent every one money doctored every one made matches patched up quarrels arranged picnics at which he cooked shashlik and an awfully good soup of grey mullets He was always looking after other people s affairs and trying to interest some one on their behalf and was always delighted about something The general opinion about him was that he was without faults of character He had only two weaknesses he was ashamed of his own good nature and tried to disguise it by a surly expression and an assumed gruffness and he liked his assistants and his soldiers to call him Your Excellency although he was only a civil councillor Answer one question for me Alexandr Daviditch Laevsky began when both he and Samoylenko were in the water up to their shoulders Suppose you had loved a woman and had been living with her for two or three years and then left off caring for her as one does and began to feel that you had nothing in common with her How would you behave in that case It s very simple You go where you please madam and that would be the end of it It s easy to say that But if she has nowhere to go A woman with no friends or relations without a farthing who can t work Well Five hundred roubles down or an allowance of twenty five roubles a month and nothing more It s very simple Even supposing you have five hundred roubles and can pay twenty five roubles a month the woman I am speaking of is an educated woman and proud Could you really bring yourself to offer her money And how would you do it Samoylenko was going to answer but at that moment a big wave covered them both then broke on the beach and rolled back noisily over the shingle The friends got out and began dressing Of course it is difficult to live with a woman if you don t love her said Samoylenko shaking the sand out of his boots But one must look at the thing humanely Vanya If it were my case I should never show a sign that I did not love her and I should go on living with her till I died He was at once ashamed of his own words he pulled himself up and said But for aught I care there might be no females at all Let them all go to the devil The friends dressed and went into the pavilion There Samoylenko was quite at home and even had a special cup and saucer Every morning they brought him on a tray a cup of coffee a tall cut glass of iced water and a tiny glass of brandy He would first drink the brandy then the hot coffee then the iced water and this must have been very nice for after drinking it his eyes looked moist with pleasure he would stroke his whiskers with both hands and say looking at the sea A wonderfully magnificent view After a long night spent in cheerless unprofitable thoughts which prevented him from sleeping and seemed to intensify the darkness and sultriness of the night Laevsky felt listless and shattered He felt no better for the bathe and the coffee Let us go on with our talk Alexandr Daviditch he said I won t make a secret of it I ll speak to you openly as to a friend Things are in a bad way with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and me a very bad way Forgive me for forcing my private affairs upon you but I must speak out Samoylenko who had a misgiving of what he was going to speak about dropped his eyes and drummed with his fingers on the table I ve lived with her for two years and have ceased to love her Laevsky went on or rather I realised that I never had felt any love for her These two years have been a mistake It was Laevsky s habit as he talked to gaze attentively at the pink palms of his hands to bite his nails or to pinch his cuffs And he did so now I know very well you can t help me he said But I tell you because unsuccessful and superfluous people like me find their salvation in talking I have to generalise about everything I do I m bound to look for an explanation and justification of my absurd existence in somebody else s theories in literary types in the idea that we upper class Russians are degenerating for instance and so on Last night for example I comforted myself by thinking all the time Ah how true Tolstoy is how mercilessly true And that did me good Yes really brother he is a great writer say what you like Samoylenko who had never read Tolstoy and was intending to do so every day of his life was a little embarrassed and said Yes all other authors write from imagination but he writes straight from nature My God sighed Laevsky how distorted we all are by civilisation I fell in love with a married woman and she with me To begin with we had kisses and calm evenings and vows and Spencer and ideals and interests in common What a deception We really ran away from her husband but we lied to ourselves and made out that we ran away from the emptiness of the life of the educated class We pictured our future like this to begin with in the Caucasus while we were getting to know the people and the place I would put on the Government uniform and enter the service then at our leisure we would pick out a plot of ground would toil in the sweat of our brow would have a vineyard and a field and so on If you were in my place or that zoologist of yours Von Koren you might live with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna for thirty years perhaps and might leave your heirs a rich vineyard and three thousand acres of maize but I felt like a bankrupt from the first day In the town you have insufferable heat boredom and no society if you go out into the country you fancy poisonous spiders scorpions or snakes lurking under every stone and behind every bush and beyond the fields mountains and the desert Alien people an alien country a wretched form of civilisation all that is not so easy brother as walking on the Nevsky Prospect in one s fur coat arm in arm with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna dreaming of the sunny South What is needed here is a life and death struggle and I m not a fighting man A wretched neurasthenic an idle gentleman From the first day I knew that my dreams of a life of labour and of a vineyard were worthless As for love I ought to tell you that living with a woman who has read Spencer and has followed you to the ends of the earth is no more interesting than living with any Anfissa or Akulina There s the same smell of ironing of powder and of medicines the same curl papers every morning the same self deception You can t get on in the house without an iron said Samoylenko blushing at Laevsky s speaking to him so openly of a lady he knew You are out of humour to day Vanya I notice Nadyezhda Fyodorovna is a splendid woman highly educated and you are a man of the highest intellect Of course you are not married Samoylenko went on glancing round at the adjacent tables but that s not your fault and besides one ought to be above conventional prejudices and rise to the level of modern ideas I believe in free love myself yes But to my thinking once you have settled together you ought to go on living together all your life Without love I will tell you directly said Samoylenko Eight years ago there was an old fellow an agent here a man of very great intelligence Well he used to say that the great thing in married life was patience Do you hear Vanya Not love but patience Love cannot last long You have lived two years in love and now evidently your married life has reached the period when in order to preserve equilibrium so to speak you ought to exercise all your patience You believe in your old agent to me his words are meaningless Your old man could be a hypocrite he could exercise himself in the virtue of patience and as he did so look upon a person he did not love as an object indispensable for his moral exercises but I have not yet fallen so low If I want to exercise myself in patience I will buy dumb bells or a frisky horse but I ll leave human beings alone Samoylenko asked for some white wine with ice When they had drunk a glass each Laevsky suddenly asked Tell me please what is the meaning of softening of the brain How can I explain it to you It s a disease in which the brain becomes softer as it were dissolves Is it curable Yes if the disease is not neglected Cold douches blisters Something internal too Oh Well you see my position I can t live with her it is more than I can do While I m with you I can be philosophical about it and smile but at home I lose heart completely I am so utterly miserable that if I were told for instance that I should have to live another month with her I should blow out my brains At the same time parting with her is out of the question She has no friends or relations she cannot work and neither she nor I have any money What could become of her To whom could she go There is nothing one can think of Come tell me what am I to do H m growled Samoylenko not knowing what to answer Does she love you Yes she loves me in so far as at her age and with her temperament she wants a man It would be as difficult for her to do without me as to do without her powder or her curl papers I am for her an indispensable integral part of her boudoir Samoylenko was embarrassed You are out of humour to day Vanya he said You must have had a bad night Yes I slept badly Altogether I feel horribly out of sorts brother My head feels empty there s a sinking at my heart a weakness I must run away Run where There to the North To the pines and the mushrooms to people and ideas I d give half my life to bathe now in some little stream in the province of Moscow or Tula to feel chilly you know and then to stroll for three hours even with the feeblest student and to talk and talk endlessly And the scent of the hay Do you remember it And in the evening when one walks in the garden sounds of the piano float from the house one hears the train passing Laevsky laughed with pleasure tears came into his eyes and to cover them without getting up he stretched across the next table for the matches I have not been in Russia for eighteen years said Samoylenko I ve forgotten what it is like To my mind there is not a country more splendid than the Caucasus Vereshtchagin has a picture in which some men condemned to death are languishing at the bottom of a very deep well Your magnificent Caucasus strikes me as just like that well If I were offered the choice of a chimney sweep in Petersburg or a prince in the Caucasus I should choose the job of chimney sweep Laevsky grew pensive Looking at his stooping figure at his eyes fixed dreamily at one spot at his pale perspiring face and sunken temples at his bitten nails at the slipper which had dropped off his heel displaying a badly darned sock Samoylenko was moved to pity and probably because Laevsky reminded him of a helpless child he asked Is your mother living Yes but we are on bad terms She could not forgive me for this affair Samoylenko was fond of his friend He looked upon Laevsky as a good natured fellow a student a man with no nonsense about him with whom one could drink and laugh and talk without reserve What he understood in him he disliked extremely Laevsky drank a great deal and at unsuitable times he played cards despised his work lived beyond his means frequently made use of unseemly expressions in conversation walked about the streets in his slippers and quarrelled with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna before other people and Samoylenko did not like this But the fact that Laevsky had once been a student in the Faculty of Arts subscribed to two fat reviews often talked so cleverly that only a few people understood him was living with a well educated woman all this Samoylenko did not understand and he liked this and respected Laevsky thinking him superior to himself There is another point said Laevsky shaking his head Only it is between ourselves I m concealing it from Nadyezhda Fyodorovna for the time Don t let it out before her I got a letter the day before yesterday telling me that her husband has died from softening of the brain The Kingdom of Heaven be his sighed Samoylenko Why are you concealing it from her To show her that letter would be equivalent to Come to church to be married And we should first have to make our relations clear When she understands that we can t go on living together I will show her the letter Then there will be no danger in it Do you know what Vanya said Samoylenko and a sad and imploring expression came into his face as though he were going to ask him about something very touching and were afraid of being refused Marry her my dear boy Why Do your duty to that splendid woman Her husband is dead and so Providence itself shows you what to do But do understand you queer fellow that it is impossible To marry without love is as base and unworthy of a man as to perform mass without believing in it But it s your duty to Why is it my duty Laevsky asked irritably Because you took her away from her husband and made yourself responsible for her But now I tell you in plain Russian I don t love her Well if you ve no love show her proper respect consider her wishes Show her respect consider her wishes Laevsky mimicked him As though she were some Mother Superior You are a poor psychologist and physiologist if you think that living with a woman one can get off with nothing but respect and consideration What a woman thinks most of is her bedroom Vanya Vanya said Samoylenko overcome with confusion You are an elderly child a theorist while I am an old man in spite of my years and practical and we shall never understand one another We had better drop this conversation Mustapha Laevsky shouted to the waiter What s our bill No no the doctor cried in dismay clutching Laevsky s arm It is for me to pay I ordered it Make it out to me he cried to Mustapha The friends got up and walked in silence along the sea front When they reached the boulevard they stopped and shook hands at parting You are awfully spoilt my friend Samoylenko sighed Fate has sent you a young beautiful cultured woman and you refuse the gift while if God were to give me a crooked old woman how pleased I should be if only she were kind and affectionate I would live with her in my vineyard and Samoylenko caught himself up and said And she might get the samovar ready for me there the old hag After parting with Laevsky he walked along the boulevard When bulky and majestic with a stern expression on his face he walked along the boulevard in his snow white tunic and superbly polished boots squaring his chest decorated with the Vladimir cross on a ribbon he was very much pleased with himself and it seemed as though the whole world were looking at him with pleasure Without turning his head he looked to each side and thought that the boulevard was extremely well laid out that the young cypress trees the eucalyptuses and the ugly anemic palm trees were very handsome and would in time give abundant shade that the Circassians were an honest and hospitable people It s strange that Laevsky does not like the Caucasus he thought very strange Five soldiers carrying rifles met him and saluted him On the right side of the boulevard the wife of a local official was walking along the pavement with her son a schoolboy Good morning Marya Konstantinovna Samoylenko shouted to her with a pleasant smile Have you been to bathe Ha ha ha My respects to Nikodim Alexandritch And he went on still smiling pleasantly but seeing an assistant of the military hospital coming towards him he suddenly frowned stopped him and asked Is there any one in the hospital No one Your Excellency Eh No one Your Excellency Very well run along Swaying majestically he made for the lemonade stall where sat a full bosomed old Jewess who gave herself out to be a Georgian and said to her as loudly as though he were giving the word of command to a regiment Be so good as to give me some soda water II Laevsky s not loving Nadyezhda Fyodorovna showed itself chiefly in the fact that everything she said or did seemed to him a lie or equivalent to a lie and everything he read against women and love seemed to him to apply perfectly to himself to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and her husband When he returned home she was sitting at the window dressed and with her hair done and with a preoccupied face was drinking coffee and turning over the leaves of a fat magazine and he thought the drinking of coffee was not such a remarkable event that she need put on a preoccupied expression over it and that she had been wasting her time doing her hair in a fashionable style as there was no one here to attract and no need to be attractive And in the magazine he saw nothing but falsity He thought she had dressed and done her hair so as to look handsomer and was reading in order to seem clever Will it be all right for me to go to bathe to day she said Why There won t be an earthquake whether you go or not I suppose No I only ask in case the doctor should be vexed Well ask the doctor then I m not a doctor On this occasion what displeased Laevsky most in Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was her white open neck and the little curls at the back of her head And he remembered that when Anna Karenin got tired of her husband what she disliked most of all was his ears and thought How true it is how true Feeling weak and as though his head were perfectly empty he went into his study lay down on his sofa and covered his face with a handkerchief that he might not be bothered by the flies Despondent and oppressive thoughts always about the same thing trailed slowly across his brain like a long string of waggons on a gloomy autumn evening and he sank into a state of drowsy oppression It seemed to him that he had wronged Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and her husband and that it was through his fault that her husband had died It seemed to him that he had sinned against his own life which he had ruined against the world of lofty ideas of learning and of work and he conceived that wonderful world as real and possible not on this sea front with hungry Turks and lazy mountaineers sauntering upon it but there in the North where there were operas theatres newspapers and all kinds of intellectual activity One could only there not here be honest intelligent lofty and pure He accused himself of having no ideal no guiding principle in life though he had a dim understanding now what it meant Two years before when he fell in love with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna it seemed to him that he had only to go with her as his wife to the Caucasus and he would be saved from vulgarity and emptiness in the same way now he was convinced that he had only to part from Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and to go to Petersburg and he would get everything he wanted Run away he muttered to himself sitting up and biting his nails Run away He pictured in his imagination how he would go aboard the steamer and then would have some lunch would drink some cold beer would talk on deck with ladies then would get into the train at Sevastopol and set off Hurrah for freedom One station after another would flash by the air would keep growing colder and keener then the birches and the fir trees then Kursk Moscow In the restaurants cabbage soup mutton with kasha sturgeon beer no more Asiaticism but Russia real Russia The passengers in the train would talk about trade new singers the Franco Russian entente on all sides there would be the feeling of keen cultured intellectual eager life Hasten on on At last Nevsky Prospect and Great Morskaya Street and then Kovensky Place where he used to live at one time when he was a student the dear grey sky the drizzling rain the drenched cabmen Ivan Andreitch some one called from the next room Are you at home I m here Laevsky responded What do you want Papers Laevsky got up languidly feeling giddy walked into the other room yawning and shuffling with his slippers There at the open window that looked into the street stood one of his young fellow clerks laying out some government documents on the window sill One minute my dear fellow Laevsky said softly and he went to look for the ink returning to the window he signed the papers without looking at them and said It s hot Yes Are you coming to day I don t think so I m not quite well Tell Sheshkovsky that I will come and see him after dinner The clerk went away Laevsky lay down on his sofa again and began thinking And so I must weigh all the circumstances and reflect on them Before I go away from here I ought to pay up my debts I owe about two thousand roubles I have no money Of course that s not important I shall pay part now somehow and I shall send the rest later from Petersburg The chief point is Nadyezhda Fyodorovna First of all we must define our relations Yes A little later he was considering whether it would not be better to go to Samoylenko for advice I might go he thought but what use would there be in it I shall only say something inappropriate about boudoirs about women about what is honest or dishonest What s the use of talking about what is honest or dishonest if I must make haste to save my life if I am suffocating in this cursed slavery and am killing myself One must realise at last that to go on leading the life I do is something so base and so cruel that everything else seems petty and trivial beside it To run away he muttered sitting down to run away The deserted seashore the insatiable heat and the monotony of the smoky lilac mountains ever the same and silent everlastingly solitary overwhelmed him with depression and as it were made him drowsy and sapped his energy He was perhaps very clever talented remarkably honest perhaps if the sea and the mountains had not closed him in on all sides he might have become an excellent Zemstvo leader a statesman an orator a political writer a saint Who knows If so was it not stupid to argue whether it were honest or dishonest when a gifted and useful man an artist or musician for instance to escape from prison breaks a wall and deceives his jailers Anything is honest when a man is in such a position At two o clock Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sat down to dinner When the cook gave them rice and tomato soup Laevsky said The same thing every day Why not have cabbage soup There are no cabbages It s strange Samoylenko has cabbage soup and Marya Konstantinovna has cabbage soup and only I am obliged to eat this mawkish mess We can t go on like this darling As is common with the vast majority of husbands and wives not a single dinner had in earlier days passed without scenes and fault finding between Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Laevsky but ever since Laevsky had made up his mind that he did not love her he had tried to give way to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna in everything spoke to her gently and politely smiled and called her darling This soup tastes like liquorice he said smiling he made an effort to control himself and seem amiable but could not refrain from saying Nobody looks after the housekeeping If you are too ill or busy with reading let me look after the cooking In earlier days she would have said to him Do by all means or I see you want to turn me into a cook but now she only looked at him timidly and flushed crimson Well how do you feel to day he asked kindly I am all right to day There is nothing but a little weakness You must take care of yourself darling I am awfully anxious about you Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was ill in some way Samoylenko said she had intermittent fever and gave her quinine the other doctor Ustimovitch a tall lean unsociable man who used to sit at home in the daytime and in the evenings walk slowly up and down on the sea front coughing with his hands folded behind him and a cane stretched along his back was of opinion that she had a female complaint and prescribed warm compresses In old days when Laevsky loved her Nadyezhda Fyodorovna s illness had excited his pity and terror now he saw falsity even in her illness Her yellow sleepy face her lustreless eyes her apathetic expression and the yawning that always followed her attacks of fever and the fact that during them she lay under a shawl and looked more like a boy than a woman and that it was close and stuffy in her room all this in his opinion destroyed the illusion and was an argument against love and marriage The next dish given him was spinach with hard boiled eggs while Nadyezhda Fyodorovna as an invalid had jelly and milk When with a preoccupied face she touched the jelly with a spoon and then began languidly eating it sipping milk and he heard her swallowing he was possessed by such an overwhelming aversion that it made his head tingle He recognised that such a feeling would be an insult even to a dog but he was angry not with himself but with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna for arousing such a feeling and he understood why lovers sometimes murder their mistresses He would not murder her of course but if he had been on a jury now he would have acquitted the murderer Merci darling he said after dinner and kissed Nadyezhda Fyodorovna on the forehead Going back into his study he spent five minutes in walking to and fro looking at his boots then he sat down on his sofa and muttered Run away run away We must define the position and run away He lay down on the sofa and recalled again that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna s husband had died perhaps by his fault To blame a man for loving a woman or ceasing to love a woman is stupid he persuaded himself lying down and raising his legs in order to put on his high boots Love and hatred are not under our control As for her husband maybe I was in an indirect way one of the causes of his death but again is it my fault that I fell in love with his wife and she with me Then he got up and finding his cap set off to the lodgings of his colleague Sheshkovsky where the Government clerks met every day to play vint and drink beer My indecision reminds me of Hamlet thought Laevsky on the way How truly Shakespeare describes it Ah how truly III For the sake of sociability and from sympathy for the hard plight of newcomers without families who as there was not an hotel in the town had nowhere to dine doctor Samoylenko kept a sort of table d hote At this time there were only two men who habitually dined with him a young zoologist called Von Koren who had come for the summer to the Black Sea to study the embryology of the medusa and a deacon called Pobyedov who had only just left the seminary and been sent to the town to take the duty of the old deacon who had gone away for a cure Each of them paid twelve roubles a month for their dinner and supper and Samoylenko made them promise to turn up at two o clock punctually Von Koren was usually the first to appear He sat down in the drawing room in silence and taking an album from the table began attentively scrutinising the faded photographs of unknown men in full trousers and top hats and ladies in crinolines and caps Samoylenko only remembered a few of them by name and of those whom he had forgotten he said with a sigh A very fine fellow remarkably intelligent When he had finished with the album Von Koren took a pistol from the whatnot and screwing up his left eye took deliberate aim at the portrait of Prince Vorontsov or stood still at the looking glass and gazed a long time at his swarthy face his big forehead and his black hair which curled like a negro s and his shirt of dull coloured cotton with big flowers on it like a Persian rug and the broad leather belt he wore instead of a waistcoat The contemplation of his own image seemed to afford him almost more satisfaction than looking at photographs or playing with the pistols He was very well satisfied with his face and his becomingly clipped beard and the broad shoulders which were unmistakable evidence of his excellent health and physical strength He was satisfied too with his stylish get up from the cravat which matched the colour of his shirt down to his brown boots While he was looking at the album and standing before the glass at that moment in the kitchen and in the passage near Samoylenko without his coat and waistcoat with his neck bare excited and bathed in perspiration was bustling about the tables mixing the salad or making some sauce or preparing meat cucumbers and onion for the cold soup while he glared fiercely at the orderly who was helping him and brandished first a knife and then a spoon at him Give me the vinegar he said That s not the vinegar it s the salad oil he shouted stamping Where are you off to you brute To get the butter Your Excellency answered the flustered orderly in a cracked voice Make haste it s in the cupboard And tell Daria to put some fennel in the jar with the cucumbers Fennel Cover the cream up gaping laggard or the flies will get into it And the whole house seemed resounding with his shouts When it was ten or fifteen minutes to two the deacon would come in he was a lanky young man of twenty two with long hair with no beard and a hardly perceptible moustache Going into the drawing room he crossed himself before the ikon smiled and held out his hand to Von Koren Good morning the zoologist said coldly Where have you been I ve been catching sea gudgeon in the harbour Oh of course Evidently deacon you will never be busy with work Why not Work is not like a bear it doesn t run off into the woods said the deacon smiling and thrusting his hands into the very deep pockets of his white cassock There s no one to whip you sighed the zoologist Another fifteen or twenty minutes passed and they were not called to dinner and they could still hear the orderly running into the kitchen and back again noisily treading with his boots and Samoylenko shouting Put it on the table Where are your wits Wash it first The famished deacon and Von Koren began tapping on the floor with their heels expressing in this way their impatience like the audience at a theatre At last the door opened and the harassed orderly announced that dinner was ready In the dining room they were met by Samoylenko crimson in the face wrathful perspiring from the heat of the kitchen he looked at them furiously and with an expression of horror took the lid off the soup tureen and helped each of them to a plateful and only when he was convinced that they were eating it with relish and liked it he gave a sigh of relief and settled himself in his deep arm chair His face looked blissful and his eyes grew moist He deliberately poured himself out a glass of vodka and said To the health of the younger generation After his conversation with Laevsky from early morning till dinner Samoylenko had been conscious of a load at his heart although he was in the best of humours he felt sorry for Laevsky and wanted to help him After drinking a glass of vodka before the soup he heaved a sigh and said I saw Vanya Laevsky to day He is having a hard time of it poor fellow The material side of life is not encouraging for him and the worst of it is all this psychology is too much for him I m sorry for the lad Well that is a person I am not sorry for said Von Koren If that charming individual were drowning I would push him under with a stick and say Drown brother drown away That s untrue You wouldn t do it Why do you think that The zoologist shrugged his shoulders I m just as capable of a good action as you are Is drowning a man a good action asked the deacon and he laughed Laevsky Yes I think there is something amiss with the soup said Samoylenko anxious to change the conversation Laevsky is absolutely pernicious and is as dangerous to society as the cholera microbe Von Koren went on To drown him would be a service It does not do you credit to talk like that about your neighbour Tell us what do you hate him for Don t talk nonsense doctor To hate and despise a microbe is stupid but to look upon everybody one meets without distinction as one s neighbour whatever happens thanks very much that is equivalent to giving up criticism renouncing a straightforward attitude to people washing one s hands of responsibility in fact I consider your Laevsky a blackguard I do not conceal it and I am perfectly conscientious in treating him as such Well you look upon him as your neighbour and you may kiss him if you like you look upon him as your neighbour and that means that your attitude to him is the same as to me and to the deacon that is no attitude at all You are equally indifferent to all To call a man a blackguard muttered Samoylenko frowning with distaste that is so wrong that I can t find words for it People are judged by their actions Von Koren continued Now you decide deacon I am going to talk to you deacon mister Laevsky s career lies open before you like a long Chinese puzzle and you can read it from beginning to end What has he been doing these two years that he has been living here We will reckon his doings on our fingers First he has taught the inhabitants of the town to play vint two years ago that game was unknown here now they all play it from morning till late at night even the women and the boys Secondly he has taught the residents to drink beer which was not known here either the inhabitants are indebted to him for the knowledge of various sorts of spirits so that now they can distinguish Kospelov s vodka from Smirnov s No twenty one blindfold Thirdly in former days people here made love to other men s wives in secret from the same motives as thieves steal in secret and not openly adultery was considered something they were ashamed to make a public display of Laevsky has come as a pioneer in that line he lives with another man s wife openly Fourthly Von Koren hurriedly ate up his soup and gave his plate to the orderly I understood Laevsky from the first month of our acquaintance he went on addressing the deacon We arrived here at the same time Men like him are very fond of friendship intimacy solidarity and all the rest of it because they always want company for vint drinking and eating besides they are talkative and must have listeners We made friends that is he turned up every day hindered me working and indulged in confidences in regard to his mistress From the first he struck me by his exceptional falsity which simply made me sick As a friend I pitched into him asking him why he drank too much why he lived beyond his means and got into debt why he did nothing and read nothing why he had so little culture and so little knowledge and in answer to all my questions he used to smile bitterly sigh and say I am a failure a superfluous man or What do you expect my dear fellow from us the debris of the serf owning class or We are degenerate Or he would begin a long rigmarole about Onyegin Petchorin Byron s Cain and Bazarov of whom he would say They are our fathers in flesh and in spirit So we are to understand that it was not his fault that Government envelopes lay unopened in his office for weeks together and that he drank and taught others to drink but Onyegin Petchorin and Turgenev who had invented the failure and the superfluous man were responsible for it The cause of his extreme dissoluteness and unseemliness lies do you see not in himself but somewhere outside in space And so an ingenious idea it is not only he who is dissolute false and disgusting but we we men of the eighties we the spiritless nervous offspring of the serf owning class civilisation has crippled us in fact we are to understand that such a great man as Laevsky is great even in his fall that his dissoluteness his lack of culture and of moral purity is a phenomenon of natural history sanctified by inevitability that the causes of it are world wide elemental and that we ought to hang up a lamp before Laevsky since he is the fated victim of the age of influences of heredity and so on All the officials and their ladies were in ecstasies when they listened to him and I could not make out for a long time what sort of man I had to deal with a cynic or a clever rogue Such types as he on the surface intellectual with a smattering of education and a great deal of talk about their own nobility are very clever in posing as exceptionally complex natures Hold your tongue Samoylenko flared up I will not allow a splendid fellow to be spoken ill of in my presence Don t interrupt Alexandr Daviditch said Von Koren coldly I am just finishing Laevsky is by no means a complex organism Here is his moral skeleton in the morning slippers a bathe and coffee then till dinner time slippers a constitutional and conversation at two o clock slippers dinner and wine at five o clock a bathe tea and wine then vint and lying at ten o clock supper and wine and after midnight sleep and la femme His existence is confined within this narrow programme like an egg within its shell Whether he walks or sits is angry writes rejoices it may all be reduced to wine cards slippers and women Woman plays a fatal overwhelming part in his life He tells us himself that at thirteen he was in love that when he was a student in his first year he was living with a lady who had a good influence over him and to whom he was indebted for his musical education In his second year he bought a prostitute from a brothel and raised her to his level that is took her as his kept mistress and she lived with him for six months and then ran away back to the brothel keeper and her flight caused him much spiritual suffering Alas his sufferings were so great that he had to leave the university and spend two years at home doing nothing But this was all for the best At home he made friends with a widow who advised him to leave the Faculty of Jurisprudence and go into the Faculty of Arts And so he did When he had taken his degree he fell passionately in love with his present what s her name married lady and was obliged to flee with her here to the Caucasus for the sake of his ideals he would have us believe seeing that to morrow if not to day he will be tired of her and flee back again to Petersburg and that too will be for the sake of his ideals How do you know growled Samoylenko looking angrily at the zoologist You had better eat your dinner The next course consisted of boiled mullet with Polish sauce Samoylenko helped each of his companions to a whole mullet and poured out the sauce with his own hand Two minutes passed in silence Woman plays an essential part in the life of every man said the deacon You can t help that Yes but to what degree For each of us woman means mother sister wife friend To Laevsky she is everything and at the same time nothing but a mistress She that is cohabitation with her is the happiness and object of his life he is gay sad bored disenchanted on account of woman his life grows disagreeable woman is to blame the dawn of a new life begins to glow ideals turn up and again look for the woman He only derives enjoyment from books and pictures in which there is woman Our age is to his thinking poor and inferior to the forties and the sixties only because we do not know how to abandon ourselves obviously to the passion and ecstasy of love These voluptuaries must have in their brains a special growth of the nature of sarcoma which stifles the brain and directs their whole psychology Watch Laevsky when he is sitting anywhere in company You notice when one raises any general question in his presence for instance about the cell or instinct he sits apart and neither speaks nor listens he looks languid and disillusioned nothing has any interest for him everything is vulgar and trivial But as soon as you speak of male and female for instance of the fact that the female spider after fertilisation devours the male his eyes glow with curiosity his face brightens and the man revives in fact All his thoughts however noble lofty or neutral they may be they all have one point of resemblance You walk along the street with him and meet a donkey for instance Tell me please he asks what would happen if you mated a donkey with a camel And his dreams Has he told you of his dreams It is magnificent First he dreams that he is married to the moon then that he is summoned before the police and ordered to live with a guitar The deacon burst into resounding laughter Samoylenko frowned and wrinkled up his face angrily so as not to laugh but could not restrain himself and laughed And it s all nonsense he said wiping his tears Yes by Jove it s nonsense IV The deacon was very easily amused and laughed at every trifle till he got a stitch in his side till he was helpless It seemed as though he only liked to be in people s company because there was a ridiculous side to them and because they might be given ridiculous nicknames He had nicknamed Samoylenko the tarantula his orderly the drake and was in ecstasies when on one occasion Von Koren spoke of Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna as Japanese monkeys He watched people s faces greedily listened without blinking and it could be seen that his eyes filled with laughter and his face was tense with expectation of the moment when he could let himself go and burst into laughter He is a corrupt and depraved type the zoologist continued while the deacon kept his eyes riveted on his face expecting he would say something funny It is not often one can meet with such a nonentity In body he is inert feeble prematurely old while in intellect he differs in no respect from a fat shopkeeper s wife who does nothing but eat drink and sleep on a feather bed and who keeps her coachman as a lover The deacon began guffawing again Don t laugh deacon said Von Koren It grows stupid at last I should not have paid attention to his insignificance he went on after waiting till the deacon had left off laughing I should have passed him by if he were not so noxious and dangerous His noxiousness lies first of all in the fact that he has great success with women and so threatens to leave descendants that is to present the world with a dozen Laevskys as feeble and as depraved as himself Secondly he is in the highest degree contaminating I have spoken to you already of vint and beer In another year or two he will dominate the whole Caucasian coast You know how the mass especially its middle stratum believe in intellectuality in a university education in gentlemanly manners and in literary language Whatever filthy thing he did they would all believe that it was as it should be since he is an intellectual man of liberal ideas and university education What is more he is a failure a superfluous man a neurasthenic a victim of the age and that means he can do anything He is a charming fellow a regular good sort he is so genuinely indulgent to human weaknesses he is compliant accommodating easy and not proud one can drink with him and gossip and talk evil of people The masses always inclined to anthropomorphism in religion and morals like best of all the little gods who have the same weaknesses as themselves Only think what a wide field he has for contamination Besides he is not a bad actor and is a clever hypocrite and knows very well how to twist things round Only take his little shifts and dodges his attitude to civilisation for instance He has scarcely sniffed at civilisation yet Ah how we have been crippled by civilisation Ah how I envy those savages those children of nature who know nothing of civilisation We are to understand you see that at one time in ancient days he has been devoted to civilisation with his whole soul has served it has sounded it to its depths but it has exhausted him disillusioned him deceived him he is a Faust do you see a second Tolstoy As for Schopenhauer and Spencer he treats them like small boys and slaps them on the shoulder in a fatherly way Well what do you say old Spencer He has not read Spencer of course but how charming he is when with light careless irony he says of his lady friend She has read Spencer And they all listen to him and no one cares to understand that this charlatan has not the right to kiss the sole of Spencer s foot let alone speaking about him in that tone Sapping the foundations of civilisation of authority of other people s altars spattering them with filth winking jocosely at them only to justify and conceal one s own rottenness and moral poverty is only possible for a very vain base and nasty creature I don t know what it is you expect of him Kolya said Samoylenko looking at the zoologist not with anger now but with a guilty air He is a man the same as every one else Of course he has his weaknesses but he is abreast of modern ideas is in the service is of use to his country Ten years ago there was an old fellow serving as agent here a man of the greatest intelligence and he used to say Nonsense nonsense the zoologist interrupted You say he is in the service but how does he serve Do you mean to tell me that things have been done better because he is here and the officials are more punctual honest and civil On the contrary he has only sanctioned their slackness by his prestige as an intellectual university man He is only punctual on the twentieth of the month when he gets his salary on the other days he lounges about at home in slippers and tries to look as if he were doing the Government a great service by living in the Caucasus No Alexandr Daviditch don t stick up for him You are insincere from beginning to end If you really loved him and considered him your neighbour you would above all not be indifferent to his weaknesses you would not be indulgent to them but for his own sake would try to make him innocuous That is Innocuous Since he is incorrigible he can only be made innocuous in one way Von Koren passed his finger round his throat Or he might be drowned he added In the interests of humanity and in their own interests such people ought to be destroyed They certainly ought What are you saying muttered Samoylenko getting up and looking with amazement at the zoologist s calm cold face Deacon what is he saying Why are you in your senses I don t insist on the death penalty said Von Koren If it is proved that it is pernicious devise something else If we can t destroy Laevsky why then isolate him make him harmless send him to hard labour What are you saying said Samoylenko in horror With pepper with pepper he cried in a voice of despair seeing that the deacon was eating stuffed aubergines without pepper You with your great intellect what are you saying Send our friend a proud intellectual man to penal servitude Well if he is proud and tries to resist put him in fetters Samoylenko could not utter a word and only twiddled his fingers the deacon looked at his flabbergasted and really absurd face and laughed Let us leave off talking of that said the zoologist Only remember one thing Alexandr Daviditch primitive man was preserved from such as Laevsky by the struggle for existence and by natural selection now our civilisation has considerably weakened the struggle and the selection and we ought to look after the destruction of the rotten and worthless for ourselves otherwise when the Laevskys multiply civilisation will perish and mankind will degenerate utterly It will be our fault If it depends on drowning and hanging said Samoylenko damnation take your civilisation damnation take your humanity Damnation take it I tell you what you are a very learned and intelligent man and the pride of your country but the Germans have ruined you Yes the Germans The Germans Since Samoylenko had left Dorpat where he had studied medicine he had rarely seen a German and had not read a single German book but in his opinion every harmful idea in politics or science was due to the Germans Where he had got this notion he could not have said himself but he held it firmly Yes the Germans he repeated once more Come and have some tea All three stood up and putting on their hats went out into the little garden and sat there under the shade of the light green maples the pear trees and a chestnut tree The zoologist and the deacon sat on a bench by the table while Samoylenko sank into a deep wicker chair with a sloping back The orderly handed them tea jam and a bottle of syrup It was very hot thirty degrees Reaumur in the shade The sultry air was stagnant and motionless and a long spider web stretching from the chestnut tree to the ground hung limply and did not stir The deacon took up the guitar which was constantly lying on the ground near the table tuned it and began singing softly in a thin voice Gathered round the tavern were the seminary lads but instantly subsided overcome by the heat mopped his brow and glanced upwards at the blazing blue sky Samoylenko grew drowsy the sultry heat the stillness and the delicious after dinner languor which quickly pervaded all his limbs made him feel heavy and sleepy his arms dropped at his sides his eyes grew small his head sank on his breast He looked with almost tearful tenderness at Von Koren and the deacon and muttered The younger generation A scientific star and a luminary of the Church I shouldn t wonder if the long skirted alleluia will be shooting up into a bishop I dare say I may come to kissing his hand Well please God Soon a snore was heard Von Koren and the deacon finished their tea and went out into the street Are you going to the harbour again to catch sea gudgeon asked the zoologist No it s too hot Come and see me You can pack up a parcel and copy something for me By the way we must have a talk about what you are to do You must work deacon You can t go on like this Your words are just and logical said the deacon But my laziness finds an excuse in the circumstances of my present life You know yourself that an uncertain position has a great tendency to make people apathetic God only knows whether I have been sent here for a time or permanently I am living here in uncertainty while my wife is vegetating at her father s and is missing me And I must confess my brain is melting with the heat That s all nonsense said the zoologist You can get used to the heat and you can get used to being without the deaconess You mustn t be slack you must pull yourself together V Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went to bathe in the morning and her cook Olga followed her with a jug a copper basin towels and a sponge In the bay stood two unknown steamers with dirty white funnels obviously foreign cargo vessels Some men dressed in white and wearing white shoes were walking along the harbour shouting loudly in French and were answered from the steamers The bells were ringing briskly in the little church of the town To day is Sunday Nadyezhda Fyodorovna remembered with pleasure She felt perfectly well and was in a gay holiday humour In a new loose fitting dress of coarse thick tussore silk and a big wide brimmed straw hat which was bent down over her ears so that her face looked out as though from a basket she fancied she looked very charming She thought that in the whole town there was only one young pretty intellectual woman and that was herself and that she was the only one who knew how to dress herself cheaply elegantly and with taste That dress for example cost only twenty two roubles and yet how charming it was In the whole town she was the only one who could be attractive while there were numbers of men so they must all whether they would or not be envious of Laevsky She was glad that of late Laevsky had been cold to her reserved and polite and at times even harsh and rude in the past she had met all his outbursts all his contemptuous cold or strange incomprehensible glances with tears reproaches and threats to leave him or to starve herself to death now she only blushed looked guiltily at him and was glad he was not affectionate to her If he had abused her threatened her it would have been better and pleasanter since she felt hopelessly guilty towards him She felt she was to blame in the first place for not sympathising with the dreams of a life of hard work for the sake of which he had given up Petersburg and had come here to the Caucasus and she was convinced that he had been angry with her of late for precisely that When she was travelling to the Caucasus it seemed that she would find here on the first day a cosy nook by the sea a snug little garden with shade with birds with little brooks where she could grow flowers and vegetables rear ducks and hens entertain her neighbours doctor poor peasants and distribute little books amongst them It had turned out that the Caucasus was nothing but bare mountains forests and huge valleys where it took a long time and a great deal of effort to find anything and settle down that there were no neighbours of any sort that it was very hot and one might be robbed Laevsky had been in no hurry to obtain a piece of land she was glad of it and they seemed to be in a tacit compact never to allude to a life of hard work He was silent about it she thought because he was angry with her for being silent about it In the second place she had without his knowledge during those two years bought various trifles to the value of three hundred roubles at Atchmianov s shop She had bought the things by degrees at one time materials at another time silk or a parasol and the debt had grown imperceptibly I will tell him about it to day she used to decide but at once reflected that in Laevsky s present mood it would hardly be convenient to talk to him of debts Thirdly she had on two occasions in Laevsky s absence received a visit from Kirilin the police captain once in the morning when Laevsky had gone to bathe and another time at midnight when he was playing cards Remembering this Nadyezhda Fyodorovna flushed crimson and looked round at the cook as though she might overhear her thoughts The long insufferably hot wearisome days beautiful languorous evenings and stifling nights and the whole manner of living when from morning to night one is at a loss to fill up the useless hours and the persistent thought that she was the prettiest young woman in the town and that her youth was passing and being wasted and Laevsky himself though honest and idealistic always the same always lounging about in his slippers biting his nails and wearying her with his caprices led by degrees to her becoming possessed by desire and as though she were mad she thought of nothing else day and night Breathing looking walking she felt nothing but desire The sound of the sea told her she must love the darkness of evening the same the mountains the same And when Kirilin began paying her attentions she had neither the power nor the wish to resist and surrendered to him Now the foreign steamers and the men in white reminded her for some reason of a huge hall together with the shouts of French she heard the strains of a waltz and her bosom heaved with unaccountable delight She longed to dance and talk French She reflected joyfully that there was nothing terrible about her infidelity Her soul had no part in her infidelity she still loved Laevsky and that was proved by the fact that she was jealous of him was sorry for him and missed him when he was away Kirilin had turned out to be very mediocre rather coarse though handsome everything was broken off with him already and there would never be anything more What had happened was over it had nothing to do with any one and if Laevsky found it out he would not believe in it There was only one bathing house for ladies on the sea front men bathed under the open sky Going into the bathing house Nadyezhda Fyodorovna found there an elderly lady Marya Konstantinovna Bityugov and her daughter Katya a schoolgirl of fifteen both of them were sitting on a bench undressing Marya Konstantinovna was a good natured enthusiastic and genteel person who talked in a drawling and pathetic voice She had been a governess until she was thirty two and then had married Bityugov a Government official a bald little man with his hair combed on to his temples and with a very meek disposition She was still in love with him was jealous blushed at the word love and told every one she was very happy My dear she cried enthusiastically on seeing Nadyezhda Fyodorovna assuming an expression which all her acquaintances called almond oily My dear how delightful that you have come We ll bathe together that s enchanting Olga quickly flung off her dress and chemise and began undressing her mistress It s not quite so hot to day as yesterday said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna shrinking at the coarse touch of the naked cook Yesterday I almost died of the heat Oh yes my dear I could hardly breathe myself Would you believe it I bathed yesterday three times Just imagine my dear three times Nikodim Alexandritch was quite uneasy Is it possible to be so ugly thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna looking at Olga and the official s wife she glanced at Katya and thought The little girl s not badly made Your Nikodim Alexandritch is very charming she said I m simply in love with him Ha ha ha cried Marya Konstantinovna with a forced laugh that s quite enchanting Free from her clothes Nadyezhda Fyodorovna felt a desire to fly And it seemed to her that if she were to wave her hands she would fly upwards When she was undressed she noticed that Olga looked scornfully at her white body Olga a young soldier s wife was living with her lawful husband and so considered herself superior to her mistress Marya Konstantinovna and Katya were afraid of her and did not respect her This was disagreeable and to raise herself in their opinion Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said At home in Petersburg summer villa life is at its height now My husband and I have so many friends We ought to go and see them I believe your husband is an engineer said Marya Konstantinovna timidly I am speaking of Laevsky He has a great many acquaintances But unfortunately his mother is a proud aristocrat not very intelligent Nadyezhda Fyodorovna threw herself into the water without finishing Marya Konstantinovna and Katya made their way in after her There are so many conventional ideas in the world Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went on and life is not so easy as it seems Marya Konstantinovna who had been a governess in aristocratic families and who was an authority on social matters said Oh yes Would you believe me my dear at the Garatynskys I was expected to dress for lunch as well as for dinner so that like an actress I received a special allowance for my wardrobe in addition to my salary She stood between Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Katya as though to screen her daughter from the water that washed the former Through the open doors looking out to the sea they could see some one swimming a hundred paces from their bathing place Mother it s our Kostya said Katya Ach ach Marya Konstantinovna cackled in her dismay Ach Kostya she shouted Come back Kostya come back Kostya a boy of fourteen to show off his prowess before his mother and sister dived and swam farther but began to be exhausted and hurried back and from his strained and serious face it could be seen that he could not trust his own strength The trouble one has with these boys my dear said Marya Konstantinovna growing calmer Before you can turn round he will break his neck Ah my dear how sweet it is and yet at the same time how difficult to be a mother One s afraid of everything Nadyezhda Fyodorovna put on her straw hat and dashed out into the open sea She swam some thirty feet and then turned on her back She could see the sea to the horizon the steamers the people on the sea front the town and all this together with the sultry heat and the soft transparent waves excited her and whispered that she must live live A sailing boat darted by her rapidly and vigorously cleaving the waves and the air the man sitting at the helm looked at her and she liked being looked at After bathing the ladies dressed and went away together I have fever every alternate day and yet I don t get thin said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna licking her lips which were salt from the bathe and responding with a smile to the bows of her acquaintances I ve always been plump and now I believe I m plumper than ever That my dear is constitutional If like me one has no constitutional tendency to stoutness no diet is of any use But you ve wetted your hat my dear It doesn t matter it will dry Nadyezhda Fyodorovna saw again the men in white who were walking on the sea front and talking French and again she felt a sudden thrill of joy and had a vague memory of some big hall in which she had once danced or of which perhaps she had once dreamed And something at the bottom of her soul dimly and obscurely whispered to her that she was a pretty common miserable worthless woman Marya Konstantinovna stopped at her gate and asked her to come in and sit down for a little while Come in my dear she said in an imploring voice and at the same time she looked at Nadyezhda Fyodorovna with anxiety and hope perhaps she would refuse and not come in With pleasure said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna accepting You know how I love being with you And she went into the house Marya Konstantinovna sat her down and gave her coffee regaled her with milk rolls then showed her photographs of her former pupils the Garatynskys who were by now married She showed her too the examination reports of Kostya and Katya The reports were very good but to make them seem even better she complained with a sigh how difficult the lessons at school were now She made much of her visitor and was sorry for her though at the same time she was harassed by the thought that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna might have a corrupting influence on the morals of Kostya and Katya and was glad that her Nikodim Alexandritch was not at home Seeing that in her opinion all men are fond of women like that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna might have a bad effect on Nikodim Alexandritch too As she talked to her visitor Marya Konstantinovna kept remembering that they were to have a picnic that evening and that Von Koren had particularly begged her to say nothing about it to the Japanese monkeys that is Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna but she dropped a word about it unawares crimsoned and said in confusion I hope you will come too VI It was agreed to drive about five miles out of town on the road to the south to stop near a duhan at the junction of two streams the Black River and the Yellow River and to cook fish soup They started out soon after five Foremost of the party in a char a banc drove Samoylenko and Laevsky they were followed by Marya Konstantinovna Nadyezhda Fyodorovna Katya and Kostya in a coach with three horses carrying with them the crockery and a basket with provisions In the next carriage came the police captain Kirilin and the young Atchmianov the son of the shopkeeper to whom Nadyezhda Fyodorovna owed three hundred roubles opposite them huddled up on the little seat with his feet tucked under him sat Nikodim Alexandritch a neat little man with hair combed on to his temples Last of all came Von Koren and the deacon at the deacon s feet stood a basket of fish R r right Samoylenko shouted at the top of his voice when he met a cart or a mountaineer riding on a donkey In two years time when I shall have the means and the people ready I shall set off on an expedition Von Koren was telling the deacon I shall go by the sea coast from Vladivostok to the Behring Straits and then from the Straits to the mouth of the Yenisei We shall make the map study the fauna and the flora and make detailed geological anthropological and ethnographical researches It depends upon you to go with me or not It s impossible said the deacon Why I m a man with ties and a family Your wife will let you go we will provide for her Better still if you were to persuade her for the public benefit to go into a nunnery that would make it possible for you to become a monk too and join the expedition as a priest I can arrange it for you The deacon was silent Do you know your theology well asked the zoologist No rather badly H m I can t give you any advice on that score because I don t know much about theology myself You give me a list of books you need and I will send them to you from Petersburg in the winter It will be necessary for you to read the notes of religious travellers too among them are some good ethnologists and Oriental scholars When you are familiar with their methods it will be easier for you to set to work And you needn t waste your time till you get the books come to me and we will study the compass and go through a course of meteorology All that s indispensable To be sure muttered the deacon and he laughed I was trying to get a place in Central Russia and my uncle the head priest promised to help me If I go with you I shall have troubled them for nothing I don t understand your hesitation If you go on being an ordinary deacon who is only obliged to hold a service on holidays and on the other days can rest from work you will be exactly the same as you are now in ten years time and will have gained nothing but a beard and moustache while on returning from this expedition in ten years time you will be a different man you will be enriched by the consciousness that something has been done by you From the ladies carriage came shrieks of terror and delight The carriages were driving along a road hollowed in a literally overhanging precipitous cliff and it seemed to every one that they were galloping along a shelf on a steep wall and that in a moment the carriages would drop into the abyss On the right stretched the sea on the left was a rough brown wall with black blotches and red veins and with climbing roots while on the summit stood shaggy fir trees bent over as though looking down in terror and curiosity A minute later there were shrieks and laughter again they had to drive under a huge overhanging rock I don t know why the devil I m coming with you said Laevsky How stupid and vulgar it is I want to go to the North to run away to escape but here I am for some reason going to this stupid picnic But look what a view said Samoylenko as the horses turned to the left and the valley of the Yellow River came into sight and the stream itself gleamed in the sunlight yellow turbid frantic I see nothing fine in that Sasha answered Laevsky To be in continual ecstasies over nature shows poverty of imagination In comparison with what my imagination can give me all these streams and rocks are trash and nothing else The carriages now were by the banks of the stream The high mountain banks gradually grew closer the valley shrank together and ended in a gorge the rocky mountain round which they were driving had been piled together by nature out of huge rocks pressing upon each other with such terrible weight that Samoylenko could not help gasping every time he looked at them The dark and beautiful mountain was cleft in places by narrow fissures and gorges from which came a breath of dewy moisture and mystery through the gorges could be seen other mountains brown pink lilac smoky or bathed in vivid sunlight From time to time as they passed a gorge they caught the sound of water falling from the heights and splashing on the stones Ach the damned mountains sighed Laevsky How sick I am of them At the place where the Black River falls into the Yellow and the water black as ink stains the yellow and struggles with it stood the Tatar Kerbalay s duhan with the Russian flag on the roof and with an inscription written in chalk The Pleasant duhan Near it was a little garden enclosed in a hurdle fence with tables and chairs set out in it and in the midst of a thicket of wretched thornbushes stood a single solitary cypress dark and beautiful Kerbalay a nimble little Tatar in a blue shirt and a white apron was standing in the road and holding his stomach he bowed low to welcome the carriages and smiled showing his glistening white teeth Good evening Kerbalay shouted Samoylenko We are driving on a little further and you take along the samovar and chairs Look sharp Kerbalay nodded his shaven head and muttered something and only those sitting in the last carriage could hear We ve got trout your Excellency Bring them bring them said Von Koren Five hundred paces from the duhan the carriages stopped Samoylenko selected a small meadow round which there were scattered stones convenient for sitting on and a fallen tree blown down by the storm with roots overgrown by moss and dry yellow needles Here there was a fragile wooden bridge over the stream and just opposite on the other bank there was a little barn for drying maize standing on four low piles and looking like the hut on hen s legs in the fairy tale a little ladder sloped from its door The first impression in all was a feeling that they would never get out of that place again On all sides wherever they looked the mountains rose up and towered above them and the shadows of evening were stealing rapidly rapidly from the duhan and dark cypress making the narrow winding valley of the Black River narrower and the mountains higher They could hear the river murmuring and the unceasing chirrup of the grasshoppers Enchanting said Marya Konstantinovna heaving deep sighs of ecstasy Children look how fine What peace Yes it really is fine assented Laevsky who liked the view and for some reason felt sad as he looked at the sky and then at the blue smoke rising from the chimney of the duhan Yes it is fine he repeated Ivan Andreitch describe this view Marya Konstantinovna said tearfully Why asked Laevsky The impression is better than any description The wealth of sights and sounds which every one receives from nature by direct impression is ranted about by authors in a hideous and unrecognisable way Really Von Koren asked coldly choosing the biggest stone by the side of the water and trying to clamber up and sit upon it Really he repeated looking directly at Laevsky What of Romeo and Juliet Or for instance Pushkin s Night in the Ukraine Nature ought to come and bow down at their feet Perhaps said Laevsky who was too lazy to think and oppose him Though what is Romeo and Juliet after all he added after a short pause The beauty of poetry and holiness of love are simply the roses under which they try to hide its rottenness Romeo is just the same sort of animal as all the rest of us Whatever one talks to you about you always bring it round to Von Koren glanced round at Katya and broke off What do I bring it round to asked Laevsky One tells you for instance how beautiful a bunch of grapes is and you answer Yes but how ugly it is when it is chewed and digested in one s stomach Why say that It s not new and altogether it is a queer habit Laevsky knew that Von Koren did not like him and so was afraid of him and felt in his presence as though every one were constrained and some one were standing behind his back He made no answer and walked away feeling sorry he had come Gentlemen quick march for brushwood for the fire commanded Samoylenko They all wandered off in different directions and no one was left but Kirilin Atchmianov and Nikodim Alexandritch Kerbalay brought chairs spread a rug on the ground and set a few bottles of wine The police captain Kirilin a tall good looking man who in all weathers wore his great coat over his tunic with his haughty deportment stately carriage and thick rather hoarse voice looked like a young provincial chief of police his expression was mournful and sleepy as though he had just been waked against his will What have you brought this for you brute he asked Kerbalay deliberately articulating each word I ordered you to give us kvarel and what have you brought you ugly Tatar Eh What We have plenty of wine of our own Yegor Alekseitch Nikodim Alexandritch observed timidly and politely What But I want us to have my wine too I m taking part in the picnic and I imagine I have full right to contribute my share I im ma gine so Bring ten bottles of kvarel Why so many asked Nikodim Alexandritch in wonder knowing Kirilin had no money Twenty bottles Thirty shouted Kirilin Never mind let him Atchmianov whispered to Nikodim Alexandritch I ll pay Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was in a light hearted mischievous mood she wanted to skip and jump to laugh to shout to tease to flirt In her cheap cotton dress with blue pansies on it in her red shoes and the same straw hat she seemed to herself little simple light ethereal as a butterfly She ran over the rickety bridge and looked for a minute into the water in order to feel giddy then shrieking and laughing ran to the other side to the drying shed and she fancied that all the men were admiring her even Kerbalay When in the rapidly falling darkness the trees began to melt into the mountains and the horses into the carriages and a light gleamed in the windows of the duhan she climbed up the mountain by the little path which zigzagged between stones and thorn bushes and sat on a stone Down below the camp fire was burning Near the fire with his sleeves tucked up the deacon was moving to and fro and his long black shadow kept describing a circle round it he put on wood and with a spoon tied to a long stick he stirred the cauldron Samoylenko with a copper red face was fussing round the fire just as though he were in his own kitchen shouting furiously Where s the salt gentlemen I bet you ve forgotten it Why are you all sitting about like lords while I do the work Laevsky and Nikodim Alexandritch were sitting side by side on the fallen tree looking pensively at the fire Marya Konstantinovna Katya and Kostya were taking the cups saucers and plates out of the baskets Von Koren with his arms folded and one foot on a stone was standing on a bank at the very edge of the water thinking about something Patches of red light from the fire moved together with the shadows over the ground near the dark human figures and quivered on the mountain on the trees on the bridge on the drying shed on the other side the steep scooped out bank was all lighted up and glimmering in the stream and the rushing turbid water broke its reflection into little bits The deacon went for the fish which Kerbalay was cleaning and washing on the bank but he stood still half way and looked about him My God how nice it is he thought People rocks the fire the twilight a monstrous tree nothing more and yet how fine it is On the further bank some unknown persons made their appearance near the drying shed The flickering light and the smoke from the camp fire puffing in that direction made it impossible to get a full view of them all at once but glimpses were caught now of a shaggy hat and a grey beard now of a blue shirt now of a figure ragged from shoulder to knee with a dagger across the body then a swarthy young face with black eyebrows as thick and bold as though they had been drawn in charcoal Five of them sat in a circle on the ground and the other five went into the drying shed One was standing at the door with his back to the fire and with his hands behind his back was telling something which must have been very interesting for when Samoylenko threw on twigs and the fire flared up and scattered sparks and threw a glaring light on the shed two calm countenances with an expression on them of deep attention could be seen looking out of the door while those who were sitting in a circle turned round and began listening to the speaker Soon after those sitting in a circle began softly singing something slow and melodious that sounded like Lenten Church music Listening to them the deacon imagined how it would be with him in ten years time when he would come back from the expedition he would be a young priest and monk an author with a name and a splendid past he would be consecrated an archimandrite then a bishop and he would serve mass in the cathedral in a golden mitre he would come out into the body of the church with the ikon on his breast and blessing the mass of the people with the triple and the double candelabra would proclaim Look down from Heaven O God behold and visit this vineyard which Thy Hand has planted and the children with their angel voices would sing in response Holy God Deacon where is that fish he heard Samoylenko s voice As he went back to the fire the deacon imagined the Church procession going along a dusty road on a hot July day in front the peasants carrying the banners and the women and children the ikons then the boy choristers and the sacristan with his face tied up and a straw in his hair then in due order himself the deacon and behind him the priest wearing his calotte and carrying a cross and behind them tramping in the dust a crowd of peasants men women and children in the crowd his wife and the priest s wife with kerchiefs on their heads The choristers sing the babies cry the corncrakes call the lark carols Then they make a stand and sprinkle the herd with holy water They go on again and then kneeling pray for rain Then lunch and talk And that s nice too thought the deacon VII Kirilin and Atchmianov climbed up the mountain by the path Atchmianov dropped behind and stopped while Kirilin went up to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna Good evening he said touching his cap Good evening Yes said Kirilin looking at the sky and pondering Why yes asked Nadyezhda Fyodorovna after a brief pause noticing that Atchmianov was watching them both And so it seems said the officer slowly that our love has withered before it has blossomed so to speak How do you wish me to understand it Is it a sort of coquetry on your part or do you look upon me as a nincompoop who can be treated as you choose It was a mistake Leave me alone Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said sharply on that beautiful marvellous evening looking at him with terror and asking herself with bewilderment could there really have been a moment when that man attracted her and had been near to her So that s it said Kirilin he thought in silence for a few minutes and said Well I ll wait till you are in a better humour and meanwhile I venture to assure you I am a gentleman and I don t allow any one to doubt it Adieu He touched his cap again and walked off making his way between the bushes After a short interval Atchmianov approached hesitatingly What a fine evening he said with a slight Armenian accent He was nice looking fashionably dressed and behaved unaffectedly like a well bred youth but Nadyezhda Fyodorovna did not like him because she owed his father three hundred roubles it was displeasing to her too that a shopkeeper had been asked to the picnic and she was vexed at his coming up to her that evening when her heart felt so pure The picnic is a success altogether he said after a pause Yes she agreed and as though suddenly remembering her debt she said carelessly Oh tell them in your shop that Ivan Andreitch will come round in a day or two and will pay three hundred roubles I don t remember exactly what it is I would give another three hundred if you would not mention that debt every day Why be prosaic Nadyezhda Fyodorovna laughed the amusing idea occurred to her that if she had been willing and sufficiently immoral she might in one minute be free from her debt If she for instance were to turn the head of this handsome young fool How amusing absurd wild it would be really And she suddenly felt a longing to make him love her to plunder him throw him over and then to see what would come of it Allow me to give you one piece of advice Atchmianov said timidly I beg you to beware of Kirilin He says horrible things about you everywhere It doesn t interest me to know what every fool says of me Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said coldly and the amusing thought of playing with handsome young Atchmianov suddenly lost its charm We must go down she said they re calling us The fish soup was ready by now They were ladling it out by platefuls and eating it with the religious solemnity with which this is only done at a picnic and every one thought the fish soup very good and thought that at home they had never eaten anything so nice As is always the case at picnics in the mass of dinner napkins parcels useless greasy papers fluttering in the wind no one knew where was his glass or where his bread They poured the wine on the carpet and on their own knees spilt the salt while it was dark all round them and the fire burnt more dimly and every one was too lazy to get up and put wood on They all drank wine and even gave Kostya and Katya half a glass each Nadyezhda Fyodorovna drank one glass and then another got a little drunk and forgot about Kirilin A splendid picnic an enchanting evening said Laevsky growing lively with the wine But I should prefer a fine winter to all this His beaver collar is silver with hoar frost Every one to his taste observed Von Koren Laevsky felt uncomfortable the heat of the campfire was beating upon his back and the hatred of Von Koren upon his breast and face this hatred on the part of a decent clever man a feeling in which there probably lay hid a well grounded reason humiliated him and enervated him and unable to stand up against it he said in a propitiatory tone I am passionately fond of nature and I regret that I m not a naturalist I envy you Well I don t envy you and don t regret it said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna I don t understand how any one can seriously interest himself in beetles and ladybirds while the people are suffering Laevsky shared her opinion He was absolutely ignorant of natural science and so could never reconcile himself to the authoritative tone and the learned and profound air of the people who devoted themselves to the whiskers of ants and the claws of beetles and he always felt vexed that these people relying on these whiskers claws and something they called protoplasm he always imagined it in the form of an oyster should undertake to decide questions involving the origin and life of man But in Nadyezhda Fyodorovna s words he heard a note of falsity and simply to contradict her he said The point is not the ladybirds but the deductions made from them VIII It was late eleven o clock when they began to get into the carriages to go home They took their seats and the only ones missing were Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Atchmianov who were running after one another laughing the other side of the stream Make haste my friends shouted Samoylenko You oughtn t to give ladies wine said Von Koren in a low voice Laevsky exhausted by the picnic by the hatred of Von Koren and by his own thoughts went to meet Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and when gay and happy feeling light as a feather breathless and laughing she took him by both hands and laid her head on his breast he stepped back and said dryly You are behaving like a cocotte It sounded horribly coarse so that he felt sorry for her at once On his angry exhausted face she read hatred pity and vexation with himself and her heart sank at once She realised instantly that she had gone too far had been too free and easy in her behaviour and overcome with misery feeling herself heavy stout coarse and drunk she got into the first empty carriage together with Atchmianov Laevsky got in with Kirilin the zoologist with Samoylenko the deacon with the ladies and the party set off You see what the Japanese monkeys are like Von Koren began rolling himself up in his cloak and shutting his eyes You heard she doesn t care to take an interest in beetles and ladybirds because the people are suffering That s how all the Japanese monkeys look upon people like us They re a slavish cunning race terrified by the whip and the fist for ten generations they tremble and burn incense only before violence but let the monkey into a free state where there s no one to take it by the collar and it relaxes at once and shows itself in its true colours Look how bold they are in picture galleries in museums in theatres or when they talk of science they puff themselves out and get excited they are abusive and critical they are bound to criticise it s the sign of the slave You listen men of the liberal professions are more often sworn at than pickpockets that s because three quarters of society are made up of slaves of just such monkeys It never happens that a slave holds out his hand to you and sincerely says Thank you to you for your work I don t know what you want said Samoylenko yawning the poor thing in the simplicity of her heart wanted to talk to you of scientific subjects and you draw a conclusion from that You re cross with him for something or other and with her too to keep him company She s a splendid woman Ah nonsense An ordinary kept woman depraved and vulgar Listen Alexandr Daviditch when you meet a simple peasant woman who isn t living with her husband who does nothing but giggle you tell her to go and work Why are you timid in this case and afraid to tell the truth Simply because Nadyezhda Fyodorovna is kept not by a sailor but by an official What am I to do with her said Samoylenko getting angry Beat her or what Not flatter vice We curse vice only behind its back and that s like making a long nose at it round a corner I am a zoologist or a sociologist which is the same thing you are a doctor society believes in us we ought to point out the terrible harm which threatens it and the next generation from the existence of ladies like Nadyezhda Ivanovna Fyodorovna Samoylenko corrected But what ought society to do Society That s its affair To my thinking the surest and most direct method is compulsion Manu militari she ought to be returned to her husband and if her husband won t take her in then she ought to be sent to penal servitude or some house of correction Ouf sighed Samoylenko He paused and asked quietly You said the other day that people like Laevsky ought to be destroyed Tell me if you if the State or society commissioned you to destroy him could you bring yourself to it My hand would not tremble IX When they got home Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went into their dark stuffy dull rooms Both were silent Laevsky lighted a candle while Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sat down and without taking off her cloak and hat lifted her melancholy guilty eyes to him He knew that she expected an explanation from him but an explanation would be wearisome useless and exhausting and his heart was heavy because he had lost control over himself and been rude to her He chanced to feel in his pocket the letter which he had been intending every day to read to her and thought if he were to show her that letter now it would turn her thoughts in another direction It is time to define our relations he thought I will give it her what is to be will be He took out the letter and gave it her Read it It concerns you Saying this he went into his own room and lay down on the sofa in the dark without a pillow Nadyezhda Fyodorovna read the letter and it seemed to her as though the ceiling were falling and the walls were closing in on her It seemed suddenly dark and shut in and terrible She crossed herself quickly three times and said Give him peace O Lord give him peace And she began crying Vanya she called Ivan Andreitch There was no answer Thinking that Laevsky had come in and was standing behind her chair she sobbed like a child and said Why did you not tell me before that he was dead I wouldn t have gone to the picnic I shouldn t have laughed so horribly The men said horrid things to me What a sin what a sin Save me Vanya save me I have been mad I am lost Laevsky heard her sobs He felt stifled and his heart was beating violently In his misery he got up stood in the middle of the room groped his way in the dark to an easy chair by the table and sat down This is a prison he thought I must get away I can t bear it It was too late to go and play cards there were no restaurants in the town He lay down again and covered his ears that he might not hear her sobbing and he suddenly remembered that he could go to Samoylenko To avoid going near Nadyezhda Fyodorovna he got out of the window into the garden climbed over the garden fence and went along the street It was dark A steamer judging by its lights a big passenger one had just come in He heard the clank of the anchor chain A red light was moving rapidly from the shore in the direction of the steamer it was the Customs boat going out to it The passengers are asleep in their cabins thought Laevsky and he envied the peace of mind of other people The windows in Samoylenko s house were open Laevsky looked in at one of them then in at another it was dark and still in the rooms Alexandr Daviditch are you asleep he called Alexandr Daviditch He heard a cough and an uneasy shout Who s there What the devil It is I Alexandr Daviditch excuse me A little later the door opened there was a glow of soft light from the lamp and Samoylenko s huge figure appeared all in white with a white nightcap on his head What now he asked scratching himself and breathing hard from sleepiness Wait a minute I ll open the door directly Don t trouble I ll get in at the window Laevsky climbed in at the window and when he reached Samoylenko seized him by the hand Alexandr Daviditch he said in a shaking voice save me I beseech you I implore you Understand me My position is agonising If it goes on for another two days I shall strangle myself like like a dog Wait a bit What are you talking about exactly Light a candle Oh oh sighed Samoylenko lighting a candle My God My God Why it s past one brother Excuse me but I can t stay at home said Laevsky feeling great comfort from the light and the presence of Samoylenko You are my best my only friend Alexandr Daviditch You are my only hope For God s sake come to my rescue whether you want to or not I must get away from here come what may Lend me the money Oh my God my God sighed Samoylenko scratching himself I was dropping asleep and I hear the whistle of the steamer and now you Do you want much Three hundred roubles at least I must leave her a hundred and I need two hundred for the journey I owe you about four hundred already but I will send it you all all Samoylenko took hold of both his whiskers in one hand and standing with his legs wide apart pondered Yes he muttered musing Three hundred Yes But I haven t got so much I shall have to borrow it from some one Borrow it for God s sake said Laevsky seeing from Samoylenko s face that he wanted to lend him the money and certainly would lend it Borrow it and I ll be sure to pay you back I will send it from Petersburg as soon as I get there You can set your mind at rest about that I ll tell you what Sasha he said growing more animated let us have some wine Yes we can have some wine too They both went into the dining room And how about Nadyezhda Fyodorovna asked Samoylenko setting three bottles and a plate of peaches on the table Surely she s not remaining I will arrange it all I will arrange it all said Laevsky feeling an unexpected rush of joy I will send her the money afterwards and she will join me Then we will define our relations To your health friend Wait a bit said Samoylenko Drink this first This is from my vineyard This bottle is from Navaridze s vineyard and this one is from Ahatulov s Try all three kinds and tell me candidly There seems a little acidity about mine Eh Don t you taste it Yes You have comforted me Alexandr Daviditch Thank you I feel better Is there any acidity Goodness only knows I don t know But you are a splendid wonderful man Looking at his pale excited good natured face Samoylenko remembered Von Koren s view that men like that ought to be destroyed and Laevsky seemed to him a weak defenceless child whom any one could injure and destroy And when you go make it up with your mother he said It s not right Yes yes I certainly shall They were silent for a while When they had emptied the first bottle Samoylenko said You ought to make it up with Von Koren too You are both such splendid clever fellows and you glare at each other like wolves Yes he s a fine very intelligent fellow Laevsky assented ready now to praise and forgive every one He s a remarkable man but it s impossible for me to get on with him No Our natures are too different I m an indolent weak submissive nature Perhaps in a good minute I might hold out my hand to him but he would turn away from me with contempt Laevsky took a sip of wine walked from corner to corner and went on standing in the middle of the room I understand Von Koren very well His is a resolute strong despotic nature You have heard him continually talking of the expedition and it s not mere talk He wants the wilderness the moonlit night all around in little tents under the open sky lie sleeping his sick and hungry Cossacks guides porters doctor priest all exhausted with their weary marches while only he is awake sitting like Stanley on a camp stool feeling himself the monarch of the desert and the master of these men He goes on and on and on his men groan and die one after another and he goes on and on and in the end perishes himself but still is monarch and ruler of the desert since the cross upon his tomb can be seen by the caravans for thirty or forty miles over the desert I am sorry the man is not in the army He would have made a splendid military genius He would not have hesitated to drown his cavalry in the river and make a bridge out of dead bodies And such hardihood is more needed in war than any kind of fortification or strategy Oh I understand him perfectly Tell me why is he wasting his substance here What does he want here He is studying the marine fauna No no brother no Laevsky sighed A scientific man who was on the steamer told me the Black Sea was poor in animal life and that in its depths thanks to the abundance of sulphuric hydrogen organic life was impossible All the serious zoologists work at the biological station at Naples or Villefranche But Von Koren is independent and obstinate he works on the Black Sea because nobody else is working there he is at loggerheads with the university does not care to know his comrades and other scientific men because he is first of all a despot and only secondly a zoologist And you ll see he ll do something He is already dreaming that when he comes back from his expedition he will purify our universities from intrigue and mediocrity and will make the scientific men mind their p s and q s Despotism is just as strong in science as in the army And he is spending his second summer in this stinking little town because he would rather be first in a village than second in a town Here he is a king and an eagle he keeps all the inhabitants under his thumb and oppresses them with his authority He has appropriated every one he meddles in other people s affairs everything is of use to him and every one is afraid of him I am slipping out of his clutches he feels that and hates me Hasn t he told you that I ought to be destroyed or sent to hard labour Yes laughed Samoylenko Laevsky laughed too and drank some wine His ideals are despotic too he said laughing and biting a peach Ordinary mortals think of their neighbour me you man in fact if they work for the common weal To Von Koren men are puppets and nonentities too trivial to be the object of his life He works will go for his expedition and break his neck there not for the sake of love for his neighbour but for the sake of such abstractions as humanity future generations an ideal race of men He exerts himself for the improvement of the human race and we are in his eyes only slaves food for the cannon beasts of burden some he would destroy or stow away in Siberia others he would break by discipline would like Araktcheev force them to get up and go to bed to the sound of the drum would appoint eunuchs to preserve our chastity and morality would order them to fire at any one who steps out of the circle of our narrow conservative morality and all this in the name of the improvement of the human race And what is the human race Illusion mirage despots have always been illusionists I understand him very well brother I appreciate him and don t deny his importance this world rests on men like him and if the world were left only to such men as us for all our good nature and good intentions we should make as great a mess of it as the flies have of that picture Yes Laevsky sat down beside Samoylenko and said with genuine feeling I m a foolish worthless depraved man The air I breathe this wine love life in fact for all that I have given nothing in exchange so far but lying idleness and cowardice Till now I have deceived myself and other people I have been miserable about it and my misery was cheap and common I bow my back humbly before Von Koren s hatred because at times I hate and despise myself Laevsky began again pacing from one end of the room to the other in excitement and said I m glad I see my faults clearly and am conscious of them That will help me to reform and become a different man My dear fellow if only you knew how passionately with what anguish I long for such a change And I swear to you I ll be a man I will I don t know whether it is the wine that is speaking in me or whether it really is so but it seems to me that it is long since I have spent such pure and lucid moments as I have just now with you It s time to sleep brother said Samoylenko Yes yes Excuse me I ll go directly Laevsky moved hurriedly about the furniture and windows looking for his cap Thank you he muttered sighing Thank you Kind and friendly words are better than charity You have given me new life He found his cap stopped and looked guiltily at Samoylenko Alexandr Daviditch he said in an imploring voice What is it Let me stay the night with you my dear fellow Certainly Why not Laevsky lay down on the sofa and went on talking to the doctor for a long time X Three days after the picnic Marya Konstantinovna unexpectedly called on Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and without greeting her or taking off her hat seized her by both hands pressed them to her breast and said in great excitement My dear I am deeply touched and moved our dear kind hearted doctor told my Nikodim Alexandritch yesterday that your husband was dead Tell me my dear tell me is it true Yes it s true he is dead answered Nadyezhda Fyodorovna That is awful awful my dear But there s no evil without some compensation your husband was no doubt a noble wonderful holy man and such are more needed in Heaven than on earth Every line and feature in Marya Konstantinovna s face began quivering as though little needles were jumping up and down under her skin she gave an almond oily smile and said breathlessly enthusiastically And so you are free my dear You can hold your head high now and look people boldly in the face Henceforth God and man will bless your union with Ivan Andreitch It s enchanting I am trembling with joy I can find no words My dear I will give you away Nikodim Alexandritch and I have been so fond of you you will allow us to give our blessing to your pure lawful union When when do you think of being married I haven t thought of it said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna freeing her hands That s impossible my dear You have thought of it you have Upon my word I haven t said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna laughing What should we be married for I see no necessity for it We ll go on living as we have lived What are you saying cried Marya Konstantinovna in horror For God s sake what are you saying Our getting married won t make things any better On the contrary it will make them even worse We shall lose our freedom My dear my dear what are you saying exclaimed Marya Konstantinovna stepping back and flinging up her hands You are talking wildly Think what you are saying You must settle down Settle down How do you mean I have not lived yet and you tell me to settle down Nadyezhda Fyodorovna reflected that she really had not lived She had finished her studies in a boarding school and had been married to a man she did not love then she had thrown in her lot with Laevsky and had spent all her time with him on this empty desolate coast always expecting something better Was that life I ought to be married though she thought but remembering Kirilin and Atchmianov she flushed and said No it s impossible Even if Ivan Andreitch begged me to on his knees even then I would refuse Marya Konstantinovna sat on the sofa for a minute in silence grave and mournful gazing fixedly into space then she got up and said coldly Good bye my dear Forgive me for having troubled you Though it s not easy for me it s my duty to tell you that from this day all is over between us and in spite of my profound respect for Ivan Andreitch the door of my house is closed to you henceforth She uttered these words with great solemnity and was herself overwhelmed by her solemn tone Her face began quivering again it assumed a soft almond oily expression She held out both hands to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna who was overcome with alarm and confusion and said in an imploring voice My dear allow me if only for a moment to be a mother or an elder sister to you I will be as frank with you as a mother Nadyezhda Fyodorovna felt in her bosom warmth gladness and pity for herself as though her own mother had really risen up and were standing before her She impulsively embraced Marya Konstantinovna and pressed her face to her shoulder Both of them shed tears They sat down on the sofa and for a few minutes sobbed without looking at one another or being able to utter a word My dear child began Marya Konstantinovna I will tell you some harsh truths without sparing you For God s sake for God s sake do Trust me my dear You remember of all the ladies here I was the only one to receive you You horrified me from the very first day but I had not the heart to treat you with disdain like all the rest I grieved over dear good Ivan Andreitch as though he were my son a young man in a strange place inexperienced weak with no mother and I was worried dreadfully worried My husband was opposed to our making his acquaintance but I talked him over persuaded him We began receiving Ivan Andreitch and with him of course you If we had not he would have been insulted I have a daughter a son You understand the tender mind the pure heart of childhood who so offendeth one of these little ones I received you into my house and trembled for my children Oh when you become a mother you will understand my fears And every one was surprised at my receiving you excuse my saying so as a respectable woman and hinted to me well of course slanders suppositions At the bottom of my heart I blamed you but you were unhappy flighty to be pitied and my heart was wrung with pity for you But why why asked Nadyezhda Fyodorovna trembling all over What harm have I done any one You are a terrible sinner You broke the vow you made your husband at the altar You seduced a fine young man who perhaps had he not met you might have taken a lawful partner for life from a good family in his own circle and would have been like every one else now You have ruined his youth Don t speak don t speak my dear I never believe that man is to blame for our sins It is always the woman s fault Men are frivolous in domestic life they are guided by their minds and not by their hearts There s a great deal they don t understand woman understands it all Everything depends on her To her much is given and from her much will be required Oh my dear if she had been more foolish or weaker than man on that side God would not have entrusted her with the education of boys and girls And then my dear you entered on the path of vice forgetting all modesty any other woman in your place would have hidden herself from people would have sat shut up at home and would only have been seen in the temple of God pale dressed all in black and weeping and every one would have said in genuine compassion O Lord this erring angel is coming back again to Thee But you my dear have forgotten all discretion have lived openly extravagantly have seemed to be proud of your sin you have been gay and laughing and I looking at you shuddered with horror and have been afraid that thunder from Heaven would strike our house while you were sitting with us My dear don t speak don t speak cried Marya Konstantinovna observing that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna wanted to speak Trust me I will not deceive you I will not hide one truth from the eyes of your soul Listen to me my dear God marks great sinners and you have been marked out only think your costumes have always been appalling Nadyezhda Fyodorovna who had always had the highest opinion of her costumes left off crying and looked at her with surprise Yes appalling Marya Konstantinovna went on Any one could judge of your behaviour from the elaboration and gaudiness of your attire People laughed and shrugged their shoulders as they looked at you and I grieved I grieved And forgive me my dear you are not nice in your person When we met in the bathing place you made me tremble Your outer clothing was decent enough but your petticoat your chemise My dear I blushed Poor Ivan Andreitch No one ever ties his cravat properly and from his linen and his boots poor fellow one can see he has no one at home to look after him And he is always hungry my darling and of course if there is no one at home to think of the samovar and the coffee one is forced to spend half one s salary at the pavilion And it s simply awful awful in your home No one else in the town has flies but there s no getting rid of them in your rooms all the plates and dishes are black with them If you look at the windows and the chairs there s nothing but dust dead flies and glasses What do you want glasses standing about for And my dear the table s not cleared till this time in the day And one s ashamed to go into your bedroom underclothes flung about everywhere india rubber tubes hanging on the walls pails and basins standing about My dear A husband ought to know nothing and his wife ought to be as neat as a little angel in his presence I wake up every morning before it is light and wash my face with cold water that my Nikodim Alexandritch may not see me looking drowsy That s all nonsense Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sobbed If only I were happy but I am so unhappy Yes yes you are very unhappy Marya Konstantinovna sighed hardly able to restrain herself from weeping And there s terrible grief in store for you in the future A solitary old age ill health and then you will have to answer at the dread judgment seat It s awful awful Now fate itself holds out to you a helping hand and you madly thrust it from you Be married make haste and be married Yes we must we must said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna but it s impossible Why It s impossible Oh if only you knew Nadyezhda Fyodorovna had an impulse to tell her about Kirilin and how the evening before she had met handsome young Atchmianov at the harbour and how the mad ridiculous idea had occurred to her of cancelling her debt for three hundred it had amused her very much and she returned home late in the evening feeling that she had sold herself and was irrevocably lost She did not know herself how it had happened And she longed to swear to Marya Konstantinovna that she would certainly pay that debt but sobs and shame prevented her from speaking I am going away she said Ivan Andreitch may stay but I am going Where To Russia But how will you live there Why you have nothing I will do translation or or I will open a library Don t let your fancy run away with you my dear You must have money for a library Well I will leave you now and you calm yourself and think things over and to morrow come and see me bright and happy That will be enchanting Well good bye my angel Let me kiss you Marya Konstantinovna kissed Nadyezhda Fyodorovna on the forehead made the sign of the cross over her and softly withdrew It was getting dark and Olga lighted up in the kitchen Still crying Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went into the bedroom and lay down on the bed She began to be very feverish She undressed without getting up crumpled up her clothes at her feet and curled herself up under the bedclothes She was thirsty and there was no one to give her something to drink I ll pay it back she said to herself and it seemed to her in delirium that she was sitting beside some sick woman and recognised her as herself I ll pay it back It would be stupid to imagine that it was for money I I will go away and send him the money from Petersburg At first a hundred then another hundred and then the third hundred It was late at night when Laevsky came in At first a hundred Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said to him then another hundred You ought to take some quinine he said and thought To morrow is Wednesday the steamer goes and I am not going in it So I shall have to go on living here till Saturday Nadyezhda Fyodorovna knelt up in bed I didn t say anything just now did I she asked smiling and screwing up her eyes at the light No nothing We shall have to send for the doctor to morrow morning Go to sleep He took his pillow and went to the door Ever since he had finally made up his mind to go away and leave Nadyezhda Fyodorovna she had begun to raise in him pity and a sense of guilt he felt a little ashamed in her presence as though in the presence of a sick or old horse whom one has decided to kill He stopped in the doorway and looked round at her I was out of humour at the picnic and said something rude to you Forgive me for God s sake Saying this he went off to his study lay down and for a long while could not get to sleep Next morning when Samoylenko attired as it was a holiday in full dress uniform with epaulettes on his shoulders and decorations on his breast came out of the bedroom after feeling Nadyezhda Fyodorovna s pulse and looking at her tongue Laevsky who was standing in the doorway asked him anxiously Well Well There was an expression of terror of extreme uneasiness and of hope on his face Don t worry yourself there s nothing dangerous said Samoylenko it s the usual fever I don t mean that Laevsky frowned impatiently Have you got the money My dear soul forgive me he whispered looking round at the door and overcome with confusion For God s sake forgive me No one has anything to spare and I ve only been able to collect by five and by ten rouble notes Only a hundred and ten in all To day I ll speak to some one else Have patience But Saturday is the latest date whispered Laevsky trembling with impatience By all that s sacred get it by Saturday If I don t get away by Saturday nothing s any use nothing I can t understand how a doctor can be without money Lord have mercy on us Samoylenko whispered rapidly and intensely and there was positively a breaking note in his throat I ve been stripped of everything I am owed seven thousand and I m in debt all round Is it my fault Then you ll get it by Saturday Yes I ll try I implore you my dear fellow So that the money may be in my hands by Friday morning Samoylenko sat down and prescribed solution of quinine and kalii bromati and tincture of rhubarb tincturae gentianae aquae foeniculi all in one mixture added some pink syrup to sweeten it and went away XI You look as though you were coming to arrest me said Von Koren seeing Samoylenko coming in in his full dress uniform I was passing by and thought Suppose I go in and pay my respects to zoology said Samoylenko sitting down at the big table knocked together by the zoologist himself out of plain boards Good morning holy father he said to the deacon who was sitting in the window copying something I ll stay a minute and then run home to see about dinner It s time I m not hindering you Not in the least answered the zoologist laying out over the table slips of paper covered with small writing We are busy copying Ah Oh my goodness my goodness sighed Samoylenko He cautiously took up from the table a dusty book on which there was lying a dead dried spider and said Only fancy though some little green beetle is going about its business when suddenly a monster like this swoops down upon it I can fancy its terror Yes I suppose so Is poison given it to protect it from its enemies Yes to protect it and enable it to attack To be sure to be sure And everything in nature my dear fellows is consistent and can be explained sighed Samoylenko only I tell you what I don t understand You re a man of very great intellect so explain it to me please There are you know little beasts no bigger than rats rather handsome to look at but nasty and immoral in the extreme let me tell you Suppose such a little beast is running in the woods He sees a bird he catches it and devours it He goes on and sees in the grass a nest of eggs he does not want to eat them he is not hungry but yet he tastes one egg and scatters the others out of the nest with his paw Then he meets a frog and begins to play with it when he has tormented the frog he goes on licking himself and meets a beetle he crushes the beetle with his paw and so he spoils and destroys everything on his way He creeps into other beasts holes tears up the anthills cracks the snail s shell If he meets a rat he fights with it if he meets a snake or a mouse he must strangle it and so the whole day long Come tell me what is the use of a beast like that Why was he created I don t know what animal you are talking of said Von Koren most likely one of the insectivora Well he got hold of the bird because it was incautious he broke the nest of eggs because the bird was not skilful had made the nest badly and did not know how to conceal it The frog probably had some defect in its colouring or he would not have seen it and so on Your little beast only destroys the weak the unskilful the careless in fact those who have defects which nature does not think fit to hand on to posterity Only the cleverer the stronger the more careful and developed survive and so your little beast without suspecting it is serving the great ends of perfecting creation Yes yes yes By the way brother said Samoylenko carelessly lend me a hundred roubles Very good There are some very interesting types among the insectivorous mammals For instance the mole is said to be useful because he devours noxious insects There is a story that some German sent William I a fur coat made of moleskins and the Emperor ordered him to be reproved for having destroyed so great a number of useful animals And yet the mole is not a bit less cruel than your little beast and is very mischievous besides as he spoils meadows terribly Von Koren opened a box and took out a hundred rouble note The mole has a powerful thorax just like the bat he went on shutting the box the bones and muscles are tremendously developed the mouth is extraordinarily powerfully furnished If it had the proportions of an elephant it would be an all destructive invincible animal It is interesting when two moles meet underground they begin at once as though by agreement digging a little platform they need the platform in order to have a battle more conveniently When they have made it they enter upon a ferocious struggle and fight till the weaker one falls Take the hundred roubles said Von Koren dropping his voice but only on condition that you re not borrowing it for Laevsky And if it were for Laevsky cried Samoylenko flaring up what is that to you I can t give it to you for Laevsky I know you like lending people money You would give it to Kerim the brigand if he were to ask you but excuse me I can t assist you in that direction Yes it is for Laevsky I am asking it said Samoylenko standing up and waving his right arm Yes For Laevsky And no one fiend or devil has a right to dictate to me how to dispose of my own money It doesn t suit you to lend it me No The deacon began laughing Don t get excited but be reasonable said the zoologist To shower benefits on mister Laevsky is to my thinking as senseless as to water weeds or to feed locusts To my thinking it is our duty to help our neighbours cried Samoylenko In that case help that hungry Turk who is lying under the fence He is a workman and more useful and indispensable than your Laevsky Give him that hundred rouble note Or subscribe a hundred roubles to my expedition Will you give me the money or not I ask you Tell me openly what does he want money for It s not a secret he wants to go to Petersburg on Saturday So that is it Von Koren drawled out Aha We understand And is she going with him or how is it to be She s staying here for the time He ll arrange his affairs in Petersburg and send her the money and then she ll go That s smart said the zoologist and he gave a short tenor laugh Smart well planned He went rapidly up to Samoylenko and standing face to face with him and looking him in the eyes asked Tell me now honestly is he tired of her Yes tell me is he tired of her Yes Yes Samoylenko articulated beginning to perspire How repulsive it is said Von Koren and from his face it could be seen that he felt repulsion One of two things Alexandr Daviditch either you are in the plot with him or excuse my saying so you are a simpleton Surely you must see that he is taking you in like a child in the most shameless way Why it s as clear as day that he wants to get rid of her and abandon her here She ll be left a burden on you It is as clear as day that you will have to send her to Petersburg at your expense Surely your fine friend can t have so blinded you by his dazzling qualities that you can t see the simplest thing That s all supposition said Samoylenko sitting down Supposition But why is he going alone instead of taking her with him And ask him why he doesn t send her off first The sly beast Overcome with sudden doubts and suspicions about his friend Samoylenko weakened and took a humbler tone But it s impossible he said recalling the night Laevsky had spent at his house He is so unhappy What of that Thieves and incendiaries are unhappy too Even supposing you are right said Samoylenko hesitating Let us admit it Still he s a young man in a strange place a student We have been students too and there is no one but us to come to his assistance To help him to do abominable things because he and you at different times have been at universities and neither of you did anything there What nonsense Stop let us talk it over coolly I imagine it will be possible to make some arrangement Samoylenko reflected twiddling his fingers I ll give him the money you see but make him promise on his honour that within a week he ll send Nadyezhda Fyodorovna the money for the journey And he ll give you his word of honour in fact he ll shed tears and believe in it himself but what s his word of honour worth He won t keep it and when in a year or two you meet him on the Nevsky Prospect with a new mistress on his arm he ll excuse himself on the ground that he has been crippled by civilisation and that he is made after the pattern of Rudin Drop him for God s sake Keep away from the filth don t stir it up with both hands Samoylenko thought for a minute and said resolutely But I shall give him the money all the same As you please I can t bring myself to refuse a man simply on an assumption Very fine too You can kiss him if you like Give me the hundred roubles then Samoylenko asked timidly I won t A silence followed Samoylenko was quite crushed his face wore a guilty abashed and ingratiating expression and it was strange to see this pitiful childish shamefaced countenance on a huge man wearing epaulettes and orders of merit The bishop here goes the round of his diocese on horseback instead of in a carriage said the deacon laying down his pen It s extremely touching to see him sit on his horse His simplicity and humility are full of Biblical grandeur Is he a good man asked Von Koren who was glad to change the conversation Of course If he hadn t been a good man do you suppose he would have been consecrated a bishop Among the bishops are to be found good and gifted men said Von Koren The only drawback is that some of them have the weakness to imagine themselves statesmen One busies himself with Russification another criticises the sciences That s not their business They had much better look into their consistory a little A layman cannot judge of bishops Why so deacon A bishop is a man just the same as you or I The same but not the same The deacon was offended and took up his pen If you had been the same the Divine Grace would have rested upon you and you would have been bishop yourself and since you are not bishop it follows you are not the same Don t talk nonsense deacon said Samoylenko dejectedly Listen to what I suggest he said turning to Von Koren Don t give me that hundred roubles You ll be having your dinners with me for three months before the winter so let me have the money beforehand for three months I won t Samoylenko blinked and turned crimson he mechanically drew towards him the book with the spider on it and looked at it then he got up and took his hat Von Koren felt sorry for him What it is to have to live and do with people like this said the zoologist and he kicked a paper into the corner with indignation You must understand that this is not kindness it is not love but cowardice slackness poison What s gained by reason is lost by your flabby good for nothing hearts When I was ill with typhoid as a schoolboy my aunt in her sympathy gave me pickled mushrooms to eat and I very nearly died You and my aunt too must understand that love for man is not to be found in the heart or the stomach or the bowels but here Von Koren slapped himself on the forehead Take it he said and thrust a hundred rouble note into his hand You ve no need to be angry Kolya said Samoylenko mildly folding up the note I quite understand you but you must put yourself in my place You are an old woman that s what you are The deacon burst out laughing Hear my last request Alexandr Daviditch said Von Koren hotly When you give that scoundrel the money make it a condition that he takes his lady with him or sends her on ahead and don t give it him without There s no need to stand on ceremony with him Tell him so or if you don t I give you my word I ll go to his office and kick him downstairs and I ll break off all acquaintance with you So you d better know it Well To go with her or send her on beforehand will be more convenient for him said Samoylenko He ll be delighted indeed Well goodbye He said good bye affectionately and went out but before shutting the door after him he looked round at Von Koren and with a ferocious face said It s the Germans who have ruined you brother Yes The Germans XII Next day Thursday Marya Konstantinovna was celebrating the birthday of her Kostya All were invited to come at midday and eat pies and in the evening to drink chocolate When Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna arrived in the evening the zoologist who was already sitting in the drawing room drinking chocolate asked Samoylenko Have you talked to him Not yet Mind now don t stand on ceremony I can t understand the insolence of these people Why they know perfectly well the view taken by this family of their cohabitation and yet they force themselves in here If one is to pay attention to every prejudice said Samoylenko one could go nowhere Do you mean to say that the repugnance felt by the masses for illicit love and moral laxity is a prejudice Of course it is It s prejudice and hate When the soldiers see a girl of light behaviour they laugh and whistle but just ask them what they are themselves It s not for nothing they whistle The fact that girls strangle their illegitimate children and go to prison for it and that Anna Karenin flung herself under the train and that in the villages they smear the gates with tar and that you and I without knowing why are pleased by Katya s purity and that every one of us feels a vague craving for pure love though he knows there is no such love is all that prejudice That is the one thing brother which has survived intact from natural selection and if it were not for that obscure force regulating the relations of the sexes the Laevskys would have it all their own way and mankind would degenerate in two years Laevsky came into the drawing room greeted every one and shaking hands with Von Koren smiled ingratiatingly He waited for a favourable moment and said to Samoylenko Excuse me Alexandr Daviditch I must say two words to you Samoylenko got up put his arm round Laevsky s waist and both of them went into Nikodim Alexandritch s study To morrow s Friday said Laevsky biting his nails Have you got what you promised I ve only got two hundred I ll get the rest to day or to morrow Don t worry yourself Thank God sighed Laevsky and his hands began trembling with joy You are saving me Alexandr Daviditch and I swear to you by God by my happiness and anything you like I ll send you the money as soon as I arrive And I ll send you my old debt too Look here Vanya said Samoylenko turning crimson and taking him by the button You must forgive my meddling in your private affairs but why shouldn t you take Nadyezhda Fyodorovna with you You queer fellow How is that possible One of us must stay or our creditors will raise an outcry You see I owe seven hundred or more to the shops Only wait and I will send them the money I ll stop their mouths and then she can come away I see But why shouldn t you send her on first My goodness as though that were possible Laevsky was horrified Why she s a woman what would she do there alone What does she know about it That would only be a loss of time and a useless waste of money That s reasonable thought Samoylenko but remembering his conversation with Von Koren he looked down and said sullenly I can t agree with you Either go with her or send her first otherwise otherwise I won t give you the money Those are my last words He staggered back lurched backwards against the door and went into the drawing room crimson and overcome with confusion Friday Friday thought Laevsky going back into the drawing room Friday He was handed a cup of chocolate he burnt his lips and tongue with the scalding chocolate and thought Friday Friday For some reason he could not get the word Friday out of his head he could think of nothing but Friday and the only thing that was clear to him not in his brain but somewhere in his heart was that he would not get off on Saturday Before him stood Nikodim Alexandritch very neat with his hair combed over his temples saying Please take something to eat Marya Konstantinovna showed the visitors Katya s school report and said drawling It s very very difficult to do well at school nowadays So much is expected Mamma groaned Katya not knowing where to hide her confusion at the praises of the company Laevsky too looked at the report and praised it Scripture Russian language conduct fives and fours danced before his eyes and all this mixed with the haunting refrain of Friday with the carefully combed locks of Nikodim Alexandritch and the red cheeks of Katya produced on him a sensation of such immense overwhelming boredom that he almost shrieked with despair and asked himself Is it possible is it possible I shall not get away They put two card tables side by side and sat down to play post Laevsky sat down too Friday Friday he kept thinking as he smiled and took a pencil out of his pocket Friday He wanted to think over his position and was afraid to think It was terrible to him to realise that the doctor had detected him in the deception which he had so long and carefully concealed from himself Every time he thought of his future he would not let his thoughts have full rein He would get into the train and set off and thereby the problem of his life would be solved and he did not let his thoughts go farther Like a far away dim light in the fields the thought sometimes flickered in his mind that in one of the side streets of Petersburg in the remote future he would have to have recourse to a tiny lie in order to get rid of Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and pay his debts he would tell a lie only once and then a completely new life would begin And that was right at the price of a small lie he would win so much truth Now when by his blunt refusal the doctor had crudely hinted at his deception he began to understand that he would need deception not only in the remote future but to day and to morrow and in a month s time and perhaps up to the very end of his life In fact in order to get away he would have to lie to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna to his creditors and to his superiors in the Service then in order to get money in Petersburg he would have to lie to his mother to tell her that he had already broken with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and his mother would not give him more than five hundred roubles so he had already deceived the doctor as he would not be in a position to pay him back the money within a short time Afterwards when Nadyezhda Fyodorovna came to Petersburg he would have to resort to a regular series of deceptions little and big in order to get free of her and again there would be tears boredom a disgusting existence remorse and so there would be no new life Deception and nothing more A whole mountain of lies rose before Laevsky s imagination To leap over it at one bound and not to do his lying piecemeal he would have to bring himself to stern uncompromising action for instance to getting up without saying a word putting on his hat and at once setting off without money and without explanation But Laevsky felt that was impossible for him Friday Friday he thought Friday They wrote little notes folded them in two and put them in Nikodim Alexandritch s old top hat When there were a sufficient heap of notes Kostya who acted the part of postman walked round the table and delivered them The deacon Katya and Kostya who received amusing notes and tried to write as funnily as they could were highly delighted We must have a little talk Nadyezhda Fyodorovna read in a little note she glanced at Marya Konstantinovna who gave her an almond oily smile and nodded Talk of what thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna If one can t tell the whole it s no use talking Before going out for the evening she had tied Laevsky s cravat for him and that simple action filled her soul with tenderness and sorrow The anxiety in his face his absent minded looks his pallor and the incomprehensible change that had taken place in him of late and the fact that she had a terrible revolting secret from him and the fact that her hands trembled when she tied his cravat all this seemed to tell her that they had not long left to be together She looked at him as though he were an ikon with terror and penitence and thought Forgive forgive Opposite her was sitting Atchmianov and he never took his black love sick eyes off her She was stirred by passion she was ashamed of herself and afraid that even her misery and sorrow would not prevent her from yielding to impure desire to morrow if not to day and that like a drunkard she would not have the strength to stop herself She made up her mind to go away that she might not continue this life shameful for herself and humiliating for Laevsky She would beseech him with tears to let her go and if he opposed her she would go away secretly She would not tell him what had happened let him keep a pure memory of her I love you I love you I love you she read It was from Atchmianov She would live in some far remote place would work and send Laevsky anonymously money embroidered shirts and tobacco and would return to him only in old age or if he were dangerously ill and needed a nurse When in his old age he learned what were her reasons for leaving him and refusing to be his wife he would appreciate her sacrifice and forgive You ve got a long nose That must be from the deacon or Kostya Nadyezhda Fyodorovna imagined how parting from Laevsky she would embrace him warmly would kiss his hand and would swear to love him all her life all her life and then living in obscurity among strangers she would every day think that somewhere she had a friend some one she loved a pure noble lofty man who kept a pure memory of her If you don t give me an interview to day I shall take measures I assure you on my word of honour You can t treat decent people like this you must understand that That was from Kirilin XIII Laevsky received two notes he opened one and read Don t go away my darling Who could have written that he thought Not Samoylenko of course And not the deacon for he doesn t know I want to go away Von Koren perhaps The zoologist bent over the table and drew a pyramid Laevsky fancied that his eyes were smiling Most likely Samoylenko has been gossiping thought Laevsky In the other note in the same disguised angular handwriting with long tails to the letters was written Somebody won t go away on Saturday A stupid gibe thought Laevsky Friday Friday Something rose in his throat He touched his collar and coughed but instead of a cough a laugh broke from his throat Ha ha ha he laughed Ha ha ha What am I laughing at Ha ha ha He tried to restrain himself covered his mouth with his hand but the laugh choked his chest and throat and his hand could not cover his mouth How stupid it is he thought rolling with laughter Have I gone out of my mind The laugh grew shriller and shriller and became something like the bark of a lap dog Laevsky tried to get up from the table but his legs would not obey him and his right hand was strangely without his volition dancing on the table convulsively clutching and crumpling up the bits of paper He saw looks of wonder Samoylenko s grave frightened face and the eyes of the zoologist full of cold irony and disgust and realised that he was in hysterics How hideous how shameful he thought feeling the warmth of tears on his face Oh oh what a disgrace It has never happened to me They took him under his arms and supporting his head from behind led him away a glass gleamed before his eyes and knocked against his teeth and the water was spilt on his breast he was in a little room with two beds in the middle side by side covered by two snow white quilts He dropped on one of the beds and sobbed It s nothing it s nothing Samoylenko kept saying it does happen it does happen Chill with horror trembling all over and dreading something awful Nadyezhda Fyodorovna stood by the bedside and kept asking What is it What is it For God s sake tell me Can Kirilin have written him something she thought It s nothing said Laevsky laughing and crying go away darling His face expressed neither hatred nor repulsion so he knew nothing Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was somewhat reassured and she went into the drawing room Don t agitate yourself my dear said Marya Konstantinovna sitting down beside her and taking her hand It will pass Men are just as weak as we poor sinners You are both going through a crisis One can so well understand it Well my dear I am waiting for an answer Let us have a little talk No we are not going to talk said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna listening to Laevsky s sobs I feel depressed You must allow me to go home What do you mean what do you mean my dear cried Marya Konstantinovna in alarm Do you think I could let you go without supper We will have something to eat and then you may go with my blessing I feel miserable whispered Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and she caught at the arm of the chair with both hands to avoid falling He s got a touch of hysterics said Von Koren gaily coming into the drawing room but seeing Nadyezhda Fyodorovna he was taken aback and retreated When the attack was over Laevsky sat on the strange bed and thought Disgraceful I ve been howling like some wretched girl I must have been absurd and disgusting I will go away by the back stairs But that would seem as though I took my hysterics too seriously I ought to take it as a joke He looked in the looking glass sat there for some time and went back into the drawing room Here I am he said smiling he felt agonisingly ashamed and he felt others were ashamed in his presence Fancy such a thing happening he said sitting down I was sitting here and all of a sudden do you know I felt a terrible piercing pain in my side unendurable my nerves could not stand it and and it led to this silly performance This is the age of nerves there is no help for it At supper he drank some wine and from time to time with an abrupt sigh rubbed his side as though to suggest that he still felt the pain And no one except Nadyezhda Fyodorovna believed him and he saw that After nine o clock they went for a walk on the boulevard Nadyezhda Fyodorovna afraid that Kirilin would speak to her did her best to keep all the time beside Marya Konstantinovna and the children She felt weak with fear and misery and felt she was going to be feverish she was exhausted and her legs would hardly move but she did not go home because she felt sure that she would be followed by Kirilin or Atchmianov or both at once Kirilin walked behind her with Nikodim Alexandritch and kept humming in an undertone I don t al low people to play with me I don t al low it From the boulevard they went back to the pavilion and walked along the beach and looked for a long time at the phosphorescence on the water Von Koren began telling them why it looked phosphorescent XIV It s time I went to my vint They will be waiting for me said Laevsky Good bye my friends I ll come with you wait a minute said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and she took his arm They said good bye to the company and went away Kirilin took leave too and saying that he was going the same way went along beside them What will be will be thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna So be it And it seemed to her that all the evil memories in her head had taken shape and were walking beside her in the darkness breathing heavily while she like a fly that had fallen into the inkpot was crawling painfully along the pavement and smirching Laevsky s side and arm with blackness If Kirilin should do anything horrid she thought not he but she would be to blame for it There was a time when no man would have talked to her as Kirilin had done and she had torn up her security like a thread and destroyed it irrevocably who was to blame for it Intoxicated by her passions she had smiled at a complete stranger probably just because he was tall and a fine figure After two meetings she was weary of him had thrown him over and did not that she thought now give him the right to treat her as he chose Here I ll say good bye to you darling said Laevsky Ilya Mihalitch will see you home He nodded to Kirilin and quickly crossing the boulevard walked along the street to Sheshkovsky s where there were lights in the windows and then they heard the gate bang as he went in Allow me to have an explanation with you said Kirilin I m not a boy not some Atchkasov or Latchkasov Zatchkasov I demand serious attention Nadyezhda Fyodorovna s heart began beating violently She made no reply The abrupt change in your behaviour to me I put down at first to coquetry Kirilin went on now I see that you don t know how to behave with gentlemanly people You simply wanted to play with me as you are playing with that wretched Armenian boy but I m a gentleman and I insist on being treated like a gentleman And so I am at your service I m miserable said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna beginning to cry and to hide her tears she turned away I m miserable too said Kirilin but what of that Kirilin was silent for a space then he said distinctly and emphatically I repeat madam that if you do not give me an interview this evening I ll make a scandal this very evening Let me off this evening said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and she did not recognise her own voice it was so weak and pitiful I must give you a lesson Excuse me for the roughness of my tone but it s necessary to give you a lesson Yes I regret to say I must give you a lesson I insist on two interviews to day and to morrow After to morrow you are perfectly free and can go wherever you like with any one you choose To day and to morrow Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went up to her gate and stopped Let me go she murmured trembling all over and seeing nothing before her in the darkness but his white tunic You re right I m a horrible woman I m to blame but let me go I beg you She touched his cold hand and shuddered I beseech you Alas sighed Kirilin alas it s not part of my plan to let you go I only mean to give you a lesson and make you realise And what s more madam I ve too little faith in women I m miserable Nadyezhda Fyodorovna listened to the even splash of the sea looked at the sky studded with stars and longed to make haste and end it all and get away from the cursed sensation of life with its sea stars men fever Only not in my home she said coldly Take me somewhere else Come to Muridov s That s better Where s that Near the old wall She walked quickly along the street and then turned into the side street that led towards the mountains It was dark There were pale streaks of light here and there on the pavement from the lighted windows and it seemed to her that like a fly she kept falling into the ink and crawling out into the light again At one point he stumbled almost fell down and burst out laughing He s drunk thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna Never mind Never mind So be it Atchmianov too soon took leave of the party and followed Nadyezhda Fyodorovna to ask her to go for a row He went to her house and looked over the fence the windows were wide open there were no lights Nadyezhda Fyodorovna he called A moment passed he called again Who s there he heard Olga s voice Is Nadyezhda Fyodorovna at home No she has not come in yet Strange very strange thought Atchmianov feeling very uneasy She went home He walked along the boulevard then along the street and glanced in at the windows of Sheshkovsky s Laevsky was sitting at the table without his coat on looking attentively at his cards Strange strange muttered Atchmianov and remembering Laevsky s hysterics he felt ashamed If she is not at home where is she He went to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna s lodgings again and looked at the dark windows It s a cheat a cheat he thought remembering that meeting him at midday at Marya Konstantinovna s she had promised to go in a boat with him that evening The windows of the house where Kirilin lived were dark and there was a policeman sitting asleep on a little bench at the gate Everything was clear to Atchmianov when he looked at the windows and the policeman He made up his mind to go home and set off in that direction but somehow found himself near Nadyezhda Fyodorovna s lodgings again He sat down on the bench near the gate and took off his hat feeling that his head was burning with jealousy and resentment The clock in the town church only struck twice in the twenty four hours at midday and midnight Soon after it struck midnight he heard hurried footsteps To morrow evening then again at Muridov s Atchmianov heard and he recognised Kirilin s voice At eight o clock good bye Nadyezhda Fyodorovna made her appearance near the garden Without noticing that Atchmianov was sitting on the bench she passed beside him like a shadow opened the gate and leaving it open went into the house In her own room she lighted the candle and quickly undressed but instead of getting into bed she sank on her knees before a chair flung her arms round it and rested her head on it It was past two when Laevsky came home XV Having made up his mind to lie not all at once but piecemeal Laevsky went soon after one o clock next day to Samoylenko to ask for the money that he might be sure to get off on Saturday After his hysterical attack which had added an acute feeling of shame to his depressed state of mind it was unthinkable to remain in the town If Samoylenko should insist on his conditions he thought it would be possible to agree to them and take the money and next day just as he was starting to say that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna refused to go He would be able to persuade her that evening that the whole arrangement would be for her benefit If Samoylenko who was obviously under the influence of Von Koren should refuse the money altogether or make fresh conditions then he Laevsky would go off that very evening in a cargo vessel or even in a sailing boat to Novy Athon or Novorossiisk would send from there an humiliating telegram and would stay there till his mother sent him the money for the journey When he went into Samoylenko s he found Von Koren in the drawing room The zoologist had just arrived for dinner and as usual was turning over the album and scrutinising the gentlemen in top hats and the ladies in caps How very unlucky thought Laevsky seeing him He may be in the way Good morning Good morning answered Von Koren without looking at him Is Alexandr Daviditch at home Yes in the kitchen Laevsky went into the kitchen but seeing from the door that Samoylenko was busy over the salad he went back into the drawing room and sat down He always had a feeling of awkwardness in the zoologist s presence and now he was afraid there would be talk about his attack of hysterics There was more than a minute of silence Von Koren suddenly raised his eyes to Laevsky and asked How do you feel after yesterday Very well indeed said Laevsky flushing It really was nothing much Until yesterday I thought it was only ladies who had hysterics and so at first I thought you had saint Vitus s dance Laevsky smiled ingratiatingly and thought How indelicate on his part He knows quite well how unpleasant it is for me Yes it was a ridiculous performance he said still smiling I ve been laughing over it the whole morning What s so curious in an attack of hysterics is that you know it is absurd and are laughing at it in your heart and at the same time you sob In our neurotic age we are the slaves of our nerves they are our masters and do as they like with us Civilisation has done us a bad turn in that way As Laevsky talked he felt it disagreeable that Von Koren listened to him gravely and looked at him steadily and attentively as though studying him and he was vexed with himself that in spite of his dislike of Von Koren he could not banish the ingratiating smile from his face I must admit though he added that there were immediate causes for the attack and quite sufficient ones too My health has been terribly shaky of late To which one must add boredom constantly being hard up the absence of people and general interests My position is worse than a governor s Yes your position is a hopeless one answered Von Koren These calm cold words implying something between a jeer and an uninvited prediction offended Laevsky He recalled the zoologist s eyes the evening before full of mockery and disgust He was silent for a space and then asked no longer smiling How do you know anything of my position You were only just speaking of it yourself Besides your friends take such a warm interest in you that I am hearing about you all day long What friends Samoylenko I suppose Yes he too I would ask Alexandr Daviditch and my friends in general not to trouble so much about me Here is Samoylenko you had better ask him not to trouble so much about you I don t understand your tone Laevsky muttered suddenly feeling as though he had only just realised that the zoologist hated and despised him and was jeering at him and was his bitterest and most inveterate enemy Keep that tone for some one else he said softly unable to speak aloud for the hatred with which his chest and throat were choking as they had been the night before with laughter Samoylenko came in in his shirt sleeves crimson and perspiring from the stifling kitchen Ah you here he said Good morning my dear boy Have you had dinner Don t stand on ceremony Have you had dinner Alexandr Daviditch said Laevsky standing up though I did appeal to you to help me in a private matter it did not follow that I released you from the obligation of discretion and respect for other people s private affairs What s this asked Samoylenko in astonishment If you have no money Laevsky went on raising his voice and shifting from one foot to the other in his excitement don t give it refuse it But why spread abroad in every back street that my position is hopeless and all the rest of it I can t endure such benevolence and friend s assistance where there s a shilling worth of talk for a ha p orth of help You can boast of your benevolence as much as you please but no one has given you the right to gossip about my private affairs What private affairs asked Samoylenko puzzled and beginning to be angry If you ve come here to be abusive you had better clear out You can come again afterwards He remembered the rule that when one is angry with one s neighbour one must begin to count a hundred and one will grow calm again and he began rapidly counting I beg you not to trouble yourself about me Laevsky went on Don t pay any attention to me and whose business is it what I do and how I live Yes I want to go away Yes I get into debt I drink I am living with another man s wife I m hysterical I m ordinary I am not so profound as some people but whose business is that Respect other people s privacy Excuse me brother said Samoylenko who had counted up to thirty five but Respect other people s individuality interrupted Laevsky This continual gossip about other people s affairs this sighing and groaning and everlasting prying this eavesdropping this friendly sympathy damn it all They lend me money and make conditions as though I were a schoolboy I am treated as the devil knows what I don t want anything shouted Laevsky staggering with excitement and afraid that it might end in another attack of hysterics I shan t get away on Saturday then flashed through his mind I want nothing All I ask of you is to spare me your protecting care I m not a boy and I m not mad and I beg you to leave off looking after me The deacon came in and seeing Laevsky pale and gesticulating addressing his strange speech to the portrait of Prince Vorontsov stood still by the door as though petrified This continual prying into my soul Laevsky went on is insulting to my human dignity and I beg these volunteer detectives to give up their spying Enough What s that what did you say said Samoylenko who had counted up to a hundred He turned crimson and went up to Laevsky It s enough said Laevsky breathing hard and snatching up his cap I m a Russian doctor a nobleman by birth and a civil councillor said Samoylenko emphatically I ve never been a spy and I allow no one to insult me he shouted in a breaking voice emphasising the last word Hold your tongue The deacon who had never seen the doctor so majestic so swelling with dignity so crimson and so ferocious shut his mouth ran out into the entry and there exploded with laughter As though through a fog Laevsky saw Von Koren get up and putting his hands in his trouser pockets stand still in an attitude of expectancy as though waiting to see what would happen This calm attitude struck Laevsky as insolent and insulting to the last degree Kindly take back your words shouted Samoylenko Laevsky who did not by now remember what his words were answered Leave me alone I ask for nothing All I ask is that you and German upstarts of Jewish origin should let me alone Or I shall take steps to make you I will fight you Now we understand said Von Koren coming from behind the table mister Laevsky wants to amuse himself with a duel before he goes away I can give him that pleasure mister Laevsky I accept your challenge A challenge said Laevsky in a low voice going up to the zoologist and looking with hatred at his swarthy brow and curly hair A challenge By all means I hate you I hate you Delighted To morrow morning early near Kerbalay s I leave all details to your taste And now clear out I hate you Laevsky said softly breathing hard I have hated you a long while A duel Yes Get rid of him Alexandr Daviditch or else I m going said Von Koren He ll bite me Von Koren s cool tone calmed the doctor he seemed suddenly to come to himself to recover his reason he put both arms round Laevsky s waist and leading him away from the zoologist muttered in a friendly voice that shook with emotion My friends dear good you ve lost your tempers and that s enough and that s enough my friends Hearing his soft friendly voice Laevsky felt that something unheard of monstrous had just happened to him as though he had been nearly run over by a train he almost burst into tears waved his hand and ran out of the room To feel that one is hated to expose oneself before the man who hates one in the most pitiful contemptible helpless state My God how hard it is he thought a little while afterwards as he sat in the pavilion feeling as though his body were scarred by the hatred of which he had just been the object How coarse it is my God Cold water with brandy in it revived him He vividly pictured Von Koren s calm haughty face his eyes the day before his shirt like a rug his voice his white hand and heavy passionate hungry hatred rankled in his breast and clamoured for satisfaction In his thoughts he felled Von Koren to the ground and trampled him underfoot He remembered to the minutest detail all that had happened and wondered how he could have smiled ingratiatingly to that insignificant man and how he could care for the opinion of wretched petty people whom nobody knew living in a miserable little town which was not it seemed even on the map and of which not one decent person in Petersburg had heard If this wretched little town suddenly fell into ruins or caught fire the telegram with the news would be read in Russia with no more interest than an advertisement of the sale of second hand furniture Whether he killed Von Koren next day or left him alive it would be just the same equally useless and uninteresting Better to shoot him in the leg or hand wound him then laugh at him and let him like an insect with a broken leg lost in the grass let him be lost with his obscure sufferings in the crowd of insignificant people like himself Laevsky went to Sheshkovsky told him all about it and asked him to be his second then they both went to the superintendent of the postal telegraph department and asked him too to be a second and stayed to dinner with him At dinner there was a great deal of joking and laughing Laevsky made jests at his own expense saying he hardly knew how to fire off a pistol calling himself a royal archer and William Tell We must give this gentleman a lesson he said After dinner they sat down to cards Laevsky played drank wine and thought that duelling was stupid and senseless as it did not decide the question but only complicated it but that it was sometimes impossible to get on without it In the given case for instance one could not of course bring an action against Von Koren And this duel was so far good in that it made it impossible for Laevsky to remain in the town afterwards He got a little drunk and interested in the game and felt at ease But when the sun had set and it grew dark he was possessed by a feeling of uneasiness It was not fear at the thought of death because while he was dining and playing cards he had for some reason a confident belief that the duel would end in nothing it was dread at the thought of something unknown which was to happen next morning for the first time in his life and dread of the coming night He knew that the night would be long and sleepless and that he would have to think not only of Von Koren and his hatred but also of the mountain of lies which he had to get through and which he had not strength or ability to dispense with It was as though he had been taken suddenly ill all at once he lost all interest in the cards and in people grew restless and began asking them to let him go home He was eager to get into bed to lie without moving and to prepare his thoughts for the night Sheshkovsky and the postal superintendent saw him home and went on to Von Koren s to arrange about the duel Near his lodgings Laevsky met Atchmianov The young man was breathless and excited I am looking for you Ivan Andreitch he said I beg you to come quickly Where Some one wants to see you some one you don t know about very important business he earnestly begs you to come for a minute He wants to speak to you of something For him it s a question of life and death In his excitement Atchmianov spoke in a strong Armenian accent Who is it asked Laevsky He asked me not to tell you his name Tell him I m busy to morrow if he likes How can you Atchmianov was aghast He wants to tell you something very important for you very important If you don t come something dreadful will happen Strange muttered Laevsky unable to understand why Atchmianov was so excited and what mysteries there could be in this dull useless little town Strange he repeated in hesitation Come along though I don t care Atchmianov walked rapidly on ahead and Laevsky followed him They walked down a street then turned into an alley What a bore this is said Laevsky One minute one minute it s near Near the old rampart they went down a narrow alley between two empty enclosures then they came into a sort of large yard and went towards a small house That s Muridov s isn t it asked Laevsky Yes But why we ve come by the back yards I don t understand We might have come by the street it s nearer Never mind never mind It struck Laevsky as strange too that Atchmianov led him to a back entrance and motioned to him as though bidding him go quietly and hold his tongue This way this way said Atchmianov cautiously opening the door and going into the passage on tiptoe Quietly quietly I beg you they may hear He listened drew a deep breath and said in a whisper Open that door and go in don t be afraid Laevsky puzzled opened the door and went into a room with a low ceiling and curtained windows There was a candle on the table What do you want asked some one in the next room Is it you Muridov Laevsky turned into that room and saw Kirilin and beside him Nadyezhda Fyodorovna He didn t hear what was said to him he staggered back and did not know how he found himself in the street His hatred for Von Koren and his uneasiness all had vanished from his soul As he went home he waved his right arm awkwardly and looked carefully at the ground under his feet trying to step where it was smooth At home in his study he walked backwards and forwards rubbing his hands and awkwardly shrugging his shoulders and neck as though his jacket and shirt were too tight then he lighted a candle and sat down to the table XVI The humane studies of which you speak will only satisfy human thought when as they advance they meet the exact sciences and progress side by side with them Whether they will meet under a new microscope or in the monologues of a new Hamlet or in a new religion I do not know but I expect the earth will be covered with a crust of ice before it comes to pass Of all humane learning the most durable and living is of course the teaching of Christ but look how differently even that is interpreted Some teach that we must love all our neighbours but make an exception of soldiers criminals and lunatics They allow the first to be killed in war the second to be isolated or executed and the third they forbid to marry Other interpreters teach that we must love all our neighbours without exception with no distinction of plus or minus According to their teaching if a consumptive or a murderer or an epileptic asks your daughter in marriage you must let him have her If cretins go to war against the physically and mentally healthy don t defend yourselves This advocacy of love for love s sake like art for art s sake if it could have power would bring mankind in the long run to complete extinction and so would become the vastest crime that has ever been committed upon earth There are very many interpretations and since there are many of them serious thought is not satisfied by any one of them and hastens to add its own individual interpretation to the mass For that reason you should never put a question on a philosophical or so called Christian basis by so doing you only remove the question further from solution The deacon listened to the zoologist attentively thought a little and asked Have the philosophers invented the moral law which is innate in every man or did God create it together with the body I don t know But that law is so universal among all peoples and all ages that I fancy we ought to recognise it as organically connected with man It is not invented but exists and will exist I don t tell you that one day it will be seen under the microscope but its organic connection is shown indeed by evidence serious affections of the brain and all so called mental diseases to the best of my belief show themselves first of all in the perversion of the moral law Good So then just as our stomach bids us eat our moral sense bids us love our neighbours Is that it But our natural man through self love opposes the voice of conscience and reason and this gives rise to many brain racking questions To whom ought we to turn for the solution of those questions if you forbid us to put them on the philosophic basis Turn to what little exact science we have Trust to evidence and the logic of facts It is true it is but little but on the other hand it is less fluid and shifting than philosophy The moral law let us suppose demands that you love your neighbour Well Love ought to show itself in the removal of everything which in one way or another is injurious to men and threatens them with danger in the present or in the future Our knowledge and the evidence tells us that the morally and physically abnormal are a menace to humanity If so you must struggle against the abnormal if you are not able to raise them to the normal standard you must have strength and ability to render them harmless that is to destroy them So love consists in the strong overcoming the weak Undoubtedly But you know the strong crucified our Lord Jesus Christ said the deacon hotly The fact is that those who crucified Him were not the strong but the weak Human culture weakens and strives to nullify the struggle for existence and natural selection hence the rapid advancement of the weak and their predominance over the strong Imagine that you succeeded in instilling into bees humanitarian ideas in their crude and elementary form What would come of it The drones who ought to be killed would remain alive would devour the honey would corrupt and stifle the bees resulting in the predominance of the weak over the strong and the degeneration of the latter The same process is taking place now with humanity the weak are oppressing the strong Among savages untouched by civilisation the strongest cleverest and most moral takes the lead he is the chief and the master But we civilised men have crucified Christ and we go on crucifying Him so there is something lacking in us And that something one ought to raise up in ourselves or there will be no end to these errors But what criterion have you to distinguish the strong from the weak Knowledge and evidence The tuberculous and the scrofulous are recognised by their diseases and the insane and the immoral by their actions But mistakes may be made Yes but it s no use to be afraid of getting your feet wet when you are threatened with the deluge That s philosophy laughed the deacon Not a bit of it You are so corrupted by your seminary philosophy that you want to see nothing but fog in everything The abstract studies with which your youthful head is stuffed are called abstract just because they abstract your minds from what is obvious Look the devil straight in the eye and if he s the devil tell him he s the devil and don t go calling to Kant or Hegel for explanations The zoologist paused and went on Twice two s four and a stone s a stone Here to morrow we have a duel You and I will say it s stupid and absurd that the duel is out of date that there is no real difference between the aristocratic duel and the drunken brawl in the pot house and yet we shall not stop we shall go there and fight So there is some force stronger than our reasoning We shout that war is plunder robbery atrocity fratricide we cannot look upon blood without fainting but the French or the Germans have only to insult us for us to feel at once an exaltation of spirit in the most genuine way we shout Hurrah and rush to attack the foe You will invoke the blessing of God on our weapons and our valour will arouse universal and general enthusiasm Again it follows that there is a force if not higher at any rate stronger than us and our philosophy We can no more stop it than that cloud which is moving upwards over the sea Don t be hypocritical don t make a long nose at it on the sly and don t say Ah old fashioned stupid Ah it s inconsistent with Scripture but look it straight in the face recognise its rational lawfulness and when for instance it wants to destroy a rotten scrofulous corrupt race don t hinder it with your pilules and misunderstood quotations from the Gospel Leskov has a story of a conscientious Danila who found a leper outside the town and fed and warmed him in the name of love and of Christ If that Danila had really loved humanity he would have dragged the leper as far as possible from the town and would have flung him in a pit and would have gone to save the healthy Christ I hope taught us a rational intelligent practical love What a fellow you are laughed the deacon You don t believe in Christ Why do you mention His name so often Yes I do believe in Him Only of course in my own way not in yours Oh deacon deacon laughed the zoologist he put his arm round the deacon s waist and said gaily Well Are you coming with us to the duel to morrow My orders don t allow it or else I should come What do you mean by orders I have been consecrated I am in a state of grace Oh deacon deacon repeated Von Koren laughing I love talking to you You say you have faith said the deacon What sort of faith is it Why I have an uncle a priest and he believes so that when in time of drought he goes out into the fields to pray for rain he takes his umbrella and leather overcoat for fear of getting wet through on his way home That s faith When he speaks of Christ his face is full of radiance and all the peasants men and women weep floods of tears He would stop that cloud and put all those forces you talk about to flight Yes faith moves mountains The deacon laughed and slapped the zoologist on the shoulder Yes he went on here you are teaching all the time fathoming the depths of the ocean dividing the weak and the strong writing books and challenging to duels and everything remains as it is but behold some feeble old man will mutter just one word with a holy spirit or a new Mahomet with a sword will gallop from Arabia and everything will be topsy turvy and in Europe not one stone will be left standing upon another Well deacon that s on the knees of the gods Faith without works is dead but works without faith are worse still mere waste of time and nothing more The doctor came into sight on the sea front He saw the deacon and the zoologist and went up to them I believe everything is ready he said breathing hard Govorovsky and Boyko will be the seconds They will start at five o clock in the morning How it has clouded over he said looking at the sky One can see nothing there will be rain directly I hope you are coming with us said the zoologist No God preserve me I m worried enough as it is Ustimovitch is going instead of me I ve spoken to him already Far over the sea was a flash of lightning followed by a hollow roll of thunder How stifling it is before a storm said Von Koren I bet you ve been to Laevsky already and have been weeping on his bosom Why should I go to him answered the doctor in confusion What next Before sunset he had walked several times along the boulevard and the street in the hope of meeting Laevsky He was ashamed of his hastiness and the sudden outburst of friendliness which had followed it He wanted to apologise to Laevsky in a joking tone to give him a good talking to to soothe him and to tell him that the duel was a survival of mediaeval barbarism but that Providence itself had brought them to the duel as a means of reconciliation that the next day both being splendid and highly intelligent people they would after exchanging shots appreciate each other s noble qualities and would become friends But he could not come across Laevsky What should I go and see him for repeated Samoylenko I did not insult him he insulted me Tell me please why he attacked me What harm had I done him I go into the drawing room and all of a sudden without the least provocation Spy There s a nice thing Tell me how did it begin What did you say to him I told him his position was hopeless And I was right It is only honest men or scoundrels who can find an escape from any position but one who wants to be at the same time an honest man and a scoundrel it is a hopeless position But it s eleven o clock gentlemen and we have to be up early to morrow There was a sudden gust of wind it blew up the dust on the sea front whirled it round in eddies with a howl that drowned the roar of the sea A squall said the deacon We must go in our eyes are getting full of dust As they went Samoylenko sighed and holding his hat said I suppose I shan t sleep to night Don t you agitate yourself laughed the zoologist You can set your mind at rest the duel will end in nothing Laevsky will magnanimously fire into the air he can do nothing else and I daresay I shall not fire at all To be arrested and lose my time on Laevsky s account the game s not worth the candle By the way what is the punishment for duelling Arrest and in the case of the death of your opponent a maximum of three years imprisonment in the fortress The fortress of saint Peter and saint Paul No in a military fortress I believe Though this fine gentleman ought to have a lesson Behind them on the sea there was a flash of lightning which for an instant lighted up the roofs of the houses and the mountains The friends parted near the boulevard When the doctor disappeared in the darkness and his steps had died away Von Koren shouted to him I only hope the weather won t interfere with us to morrow Very likely it will Please God it may Good night What about the night What do you say In the roar of the wind and the sea and the crashes of thunder it was difficult to hear It s nothing shouted the zoologist and hurried home XVII Upon my mind weighed down with woe Crowd thoughts a heavy multitude In silence memory unfolds Her long long scroll before my eyes Loathing and shuddering I curse And bitterly lament in vain And bitter though the tears I weep I do not wash those lines away PUSHKIN Whether they killed him next morning or mocked at him that is left him his life he was ruined anyway Whether this disgraced woman killed herself in her shame and despair or dragged on her pitiful existence she was ruined anyway So thought Laevsky as he sat at the table late in the evening still rubbing his hands The windows suddenly blew open with a bang a violent gust of wind burst into the room and the papers fluttered from the table Laevsky closed the windows and bent down to pick up the papers He was aware of something new in his body a sort of awkwardness he had not felt before and his movements were strange to him He moved timidly jerking with his elbows and shrugging his shoulders and when he sat down to the table again he again began rubbing his hands His body had lost its suppleness On the eve of death one ought to write to one s nearest relation Laevsky thought of this He took a pen and wrote with a tremulous hand Mother He wanted to write to beg his mother for the sake of the merciful God in whom she believed that she would give shelter and bring a little warmth and kindness into the life of the unhappy woman who by his doing had been disgraced and was in solitude poverty and weakness that she would forgive and forget everything everything everything and by her sacrifice atone to some extent for her son s terrible sin But he remembered how his mother a stout heavily built old woman in a lace cap used to go out into the garden in the morning followed by her companion with the lap dog how she used to shout in a peremptory way to the gardener and the servants and how proud and haughty her face was he remembered all this and scratched out the word he had written There was a vivid flash of lightning at all three windows and it was followed by a prolonged deafening roll of thunder beginning with a hollow rumble and ending with a crash so violent that all the window panes rattled Laevsky got up went to the window and pressed his forehead against the pane There was a fierce magnificent storm On the horizon lightning flashes were flung in white streams from the storm clouds into the sea lighting up the high dark waves over the far away expanse And to right and to left and no doubt over the house too the lightning flashed The storm whispered Laevsky he had a longing to pray to some one or to something if only to the lightning or the storm clouds Dear storm He remembered how as a boy he used to run out into the garden without a hat on when there was a storm and how two fair haired girls with blue eyes used to run after him and how they got wet through with the rain they laughed with delight but when there was a loud peal of thunder the girls used to nestle up to the boy confidingly while he crossed himself and made haste to repeat Holy holy holy Oh where had they vanished to In what sea were they drowned those dawning days of pure fair life He had no fear of the storm no love of nature now he had no God All the confiding girls he had ever known had by now been ruined by him and those like him All his life he had not planted one tree in his own garden nor grown one blade of grass and living among the living he had not saved one fly he had done nothing but destroy and ruin and lie lie What in my past was not vice he asked himself trying to clutch at some bright memory as a man falling down a precipice clutches at the bushes School The university But that was a sham He had neglected his work and forgotten what he had learnt The service of his country That too was a sham for he did nothing in the Service took a salary for doing nothing and it was an abominable swindling of the State for which one was not punished He had no craving for truth and had not sought it spellbound by vice and lying his conscience had slept or been silent Like a stranger like an alien from another planet he had taken no part in the common life of men had been indifferent to their sufferings their ideas their religion their sciences their strivings and their struggles He had not said one good word not written one line that was not useless and vulgar he had not done his fellows one ha p orth of service but had eaten their bread drunk their wine seduced their wives lived on their thoughts and to justify his contemptible parasitic life in their eyes and in his own he had always tried to assume an air of being higher and better than they Lies lies lies He vividly remembered what he had seen that evening at Muridov s and he was in an insufferable anguish of loathing and misery Kirilin and Atchmianov were loathsome but they were only continuing what he had begun they were his accomplices and his disciples This young weak woman had trusted him more than a brother and he had deprived her of her husband of her friends and of her country and had brought her here to the heat to fever and to boredom and from day to day she was bound to reflect like a mirror his idleness his viciousness and falsity and that was all she had had to fill her weak listless pitiable life Then he had grown sick of her had begun to hate her but had not had the pluck to abandon her and he had tried to entangle her more and more closely in a web of lies These men had done the rest Laevsky sat at the table then got up and went to the window at one minute he put out the candle and then he lighted it again He cursed himself aloud wept and wailed and asked forgiveness several times he ran to the table in despair and wrote Mother Except his mother he had no relations or near friends but how could his mother help him And where was she He had an impulse to run to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna to fall at her feet to kiss her hands and feet to beg her forgiveness but she was his victim and he was afraid of her as though she were dead My life is ruined he repeated rubbing his hands Why am I still alive my God He had cast out of heaven his dim star it had fallen and its track was lost in the darkness of night It would never return to the sky again because life was given only once and never came a second time If he could have turned back the days and years of the past he would have replaced the falsity with truth the idleness with work the boredom with happiness he would have given back purity to those whom he had robbed of it He would have found God and goodness but that was as impossible as to put back the fallen star into the sky and because it was impossible he was in despair When the storm was over he sat by the open window and thought calmly of what was before him Von Koren would most likely kill him The man s clear cold theory of life justified the destruction of the rotten and the useless if it changed at the crucial moment it would be the hatred and the repugnance that Laevsky inspired in him that would save him If he missed his aim or in mockery of his hated opponent only wounded him or fired in the air what could he do then Where could he go Go to Petersburg Laevsky asked himself But that would mean beginning over again the old life which he cursed And the man who seeks salvation in change of place like a migrating bird would find nothing anywhere for all the world is alike to him Seek salvation in men In whom and how Samoylenko s kindness and generosity could no more save him than the deacon s laughter or Von Koren s hatred He must look for salvation in himself alone and if there were no finding it why waste time He must kill himself that was all He heard the sound of a carriage It was getting light The carriage passed by turned and crunching on the wet sand stopped near the house There were two men in the carriage Wait a minute I m coming directly Laevsky said to them out of the window I m not asleep Surely it s not time yet Yes it s four o clock By the time we get there Laevsky put on his overcoat and cap put some cigarettes in his pocket and stood still hesitating He felt as though there was something else he must do In the street the seconds talked in low voices and the horses snorted and this sound in the damp early morning when everybody was asleep and light was hardly dawning in the sky filled Laevsky s soul with a disconsolate feeling which was like a presentiment of evil He stood for a little hesitating and went into the bedroom Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was lying stretched out on the bed wrapped from head to foot in a rug She did not stir and her whole appearance especially her head suggested an Egyptian mummy Looking at her in silence Laevsky mentally asked her forgiveness and thought that if the heavens were not empty and there really were a God then He would save her if there were no God then she had better perish there was nothing for her to live for All at once she jumped up and sat up in bed Lifting her pale face and looking with horror at Laevsky she asked Is it you Is the storm over Yes She remembered put both hands to her head and shuddered all over How miserable I am she said If only you knew how miserable I am I expected she went on half closing her eyes that you would kill me or turn me out of the house into the rain and storm but you delay delay Warmly and impulsively he put his arms round her and covered her knees and hands with kisses Then when she muttered something and shuddered with the thought of the past he stroked her hair and looking into her face realised that this unhappy sinful woman was the one creature near and dear to him whom no one could replace When he went out of the house and got into the carriage he wanted to return home alive XVIII 
4484-37119-0000	train-other-500	The deacon got up dressed took his thick gnarled stick and slipped quietly out of the house It was dark and for the first minute when he went into the street
4484-37119-0001	train-other-500	he could not even see his white stick There was not a single star in the sky and it looked as though there would be rain again There was a smell of wet sand and sea It s to be hoped that the mountaineers won t attack us
4484-37119-0002	train-other-500	thought the deacon hearing the tap of the stick on the pavement and noticing how loud and lonely the taps sounded in the stillness of the night When he got out of town he began to see both the road and his stick
4484-37119-0003	train-other-500	Here and there in the black sky there were dark cloudy patches and soon a star peeped out and timidly blinked its one eye The deacon walked along the high rocky coast
4484-37119-0004	train-other-500	and did not see the sea it was slumbering below and its unseen waves broke languidly and heavily on the shore as though sighing Ouf and how slowly
4484-37119-0005	train-other-500	One wave broke the deacon had time to count eight steps then another broke and six steps later a third As before nothing could be seen
4484-37119-0006	train-other-500	and in the darkness one could hear the languid drowsy drone of the sea One could hear the infinitely faraway inconceivable time when God moved above chaos
4484-37119-0007	train-other-500	The deacon felt uncanny He hoped God would not punish him for keeping company with infidels and even going to look at their duels The duel would be nonsensical
4484-37119-0008	train-other-500	bloodless absurd but however that might be it was a heathen spectacle and it was altogether unseemly for an ecclesiastical person to be present at it He stopped and wondered
4484-37119-0009	train-other-500	should he go back But an intense restless curiosity triumphed over his doubts and he went on Though they are infidels they are good people and will be saved he assured himself
4484-37119-0010	train-other-500	They are sure to be saved he said aloud lighting a cigarette By what standard must one measure men s qualities to judge rightly of them
none	none	 The deacon remembered his enemy the inspector of the clerical school 
4484-37119-0011	train-other-500	who believed in God lived in chastity and did not fight duels but he used to feed the deacon on bread with sand in it and on one occasion almost pulled off the deacon s ear
4484-37119-0012	train-other-500	If human life was so artlessly constructed that every one respected this cruel and dishonest inspector who stole the Government flour and his health and salvation were prayed for in the schools
4484-37119-0013	train-other-500	was it just to shun such men as Von Koren and Laevsky simply because they were unbelievers The deacon was weighing this question but he recalled how absurd Samoylenko had looked yesterday
4484-37119-0014	train-other-500	and that broke the thread of his ideas What fun they would have next day The deacon imagined how he would sit under a bush and look on and when Von Koren began boasting next day at dinner
4484-37119-0015	train-other-500	he the deacon would begin laughing and telling him all the details of the duel How do you know all about it the zoologist would ask Well there you are
4484-37119-0016	train-other-500	I stayed at home but I know all about it It would be nice to write a comic description of the duel His father in law would read it and laugh A good story told or written
4484-37119-0017	train-other-500	was more than meat and drink to his father in law The valley of the Yellow River opened before him The stream was broader and fiercer for the rain and instead of murmuring as before it was raging
4484-37119-0018	train-other-500	It began to get light The grey dingy morning and the clouds racing towards the west to overtake the storm clouds the mountains girt with mist and the wet trees
4484-37119-0019	train-other-500	all struck the deacon as ugly and sinister He washed at the brook repeated his morning prayer and felt a longing for tea and hot rolls with sour cream
4484-37119-0020	train-other-500	which were served every morning at his father in law s He remembered his wife and the Days past Recall which she played on the piano What sort of woman was she
4484-37119-0021	train-other-500	His wife had been introduced betrothed and married to him all in one week he had lived with her less than a month when he was ordered here so that he had not had time to find out what she was like
4484-37119-0022	train-other-500	All the same he rather missed her I must write her a nice letter he thought The flag on the duhan hung limp soaked by the rain and the duhan itself
4484-37119-0023	train-other-500	with its wet roof seemed darker and lower than it had been before Near the door was standing a cart Kerbalay with two mountaineers and a young Tatar woman in trousers
4484-37119-0024	train-other-500	no doubt Kerbalay s wife or daughter were bringing sacks of something out of the duhan and putting them on maize straw in the cart Near the cart stood a pair of asses hanging their heads
none	none	 When they had put in all the sacks the mountaineers and the Tatar woman 
4484-37119-0025	train-other-500	began covering them over with straw while Kerbalay began hurriedly harnessing the asses Smuggling perhaps thought the deacon Here was the fallen tree with the dried pine needles
4484-37119-0026	train-other-500	here was the blackened patch from the fire He remembered the picnic and all its incidents the fire the singing of the mountaineers his sweet dreams of becoming a bishop and of the Church procession
4484-37119-0027	train-other-500	The Black River had grown blacker and broader with the rain The deacon walked cautiously over the narrow bridge which by now was reached by the topmost crests of the dirty water
4484-37119-0028	train-other-500	and went up through the little copse to the drying shed A splendid head he thought stretching himself on the straw and thinking of Von Koren A fine head God grant him health
4484-37119-0029	train-other-500	only there is cruelty in him Why did he hate Laevsky and Laevsky hate him Why were they going to fight a duel
4484-37119-0030	train-other-500	If from their childhood they had known poverty as the deacon had if they had been brought up among ignorant hard hearted grasping coarse and ill mannered people
4484-37119-0031	train-other-500	who grudged you a crust of bread who spat on the floor and hiccoughed at dinner and at prayers if they had not been spoilt from childhood by the pleasant surroundings and the select circle of friends they lived in
4484-37119-0032	train-other-500	how they would have rushed at each other how readily they would have overlooked each other s shortcomings and would have prized each other s strong points
none	none	 Why how few even outwardly decent people there were in the world 
4484-37119-0033	train-other-500	It was true that Laevsky was flighty dissipated queer but he did not steal did not spit loudly on the floor he did not abuse his wife and say
none	none	 You ll eat till you burst but you don t want to work 
4484-37119-0034	train-other-500	he would not beat a child with reins or give his servants stinking meat to eat surely this was reason enough to be indulgent to him Besides he was the chief sufferer from his failings
4484-37119-0035	train-other-500	like a sick man from his sores Instead of being led by boredom and some sort of misunderstanding to look for degeneracy extinction heredity and other such incomprehensible things in each other
4484-37119-0036	train-other-500	would they not do better to stoop a little lower and turn their hatred and anger where whole streets resounded with moanings from coarse ignorance greed scolding impurity swearing
4484-37119-0037	train-other-500	the shrieks of women The sound of a carriage interrupted the deacon s thoughts He glanced out of the door and saw a carriage and in it three persons Laevsky Sheshkovsky
4484-37119-0038	train-other-500	and the superintendent of the post office Stop said Sheshkovsky All three got out of the carriage and looked at one another They are not here yet said Sheshkovsky shaking the mud off Well
none	none	 Till the show begins let us go and find a suitable spot 
4484-37119-0039	train-other-500	there s not room to turn round here They went further up the river and soon vanished from sight The Tatar driver sat in the carriage with his head resting on his shoulder and fell asleep
4484-37119-0040	train-other-500	After waiting ten minutes the deacon came out of the drying shed and taking off his black hat that he might not be noticed he began threading his way among the bushes and strips of maize along the bank
4484-37119-0041	train-other-500	crouching and looking about him The grass and maize were wet and big drops fell on his head from the trees and bushes Disgraceful he muttered picking up his wet and muddy skirt
4484-37119-0042	train-other-500	Had I realised it I would not have come Soon he heard voices and caught sight of them Laevsky was walking rapidly to and fro in the small glade with bowed back
4484-37119-0043	train-other-500	and hands thrust in his sleeves his seconds were standing at the water s edge rolling cigarettes Strange thought the deacon not recognising Laevsky s walk
4484-37119-0044	train-other-500	he looks like an old man How rude it is of them said the superintendent of the post office looking at his watch It may be learned manners to be late but to my thinking it s hoggish
4484-37119-0045	train-other-500	Sheshkovsky a stout man with a black beard listened and said
none	none	 They re coming XIX It s the first time in my life I ve seen it How glorious said Von Koren pointing to the glade and stretching out his hands to the east Look green rays In the east behind the mountains rose two green streaks of light and it really was beautiful The sun was rising Good morning the zoologist went on nodding to Laevsky s seconds I m not late am I He was followed by his seconds Boyko and Govorovsky two very young officers of the same height wearing white tunics and Ustimovitch the thin unsociable doctor in one hand he had a bag of some sort and in the other hand as usual a cane which he held behind him Laying the bag on the ground and greeting no one he put the other hand too behind his back and began pacing up and down the glade Laevsky felt the exhaustion and awkwardness of a man who is soon perhaps to die and is for that reason an object of general attention He wanted to be killed as soon as possible or taken home He saw the sunrise now for the first time in his life the early morning the green rays of light the dampness and the men in wet boots seemed to him to have nothing to do with his life to be superfluous and embarrassing All this had no connection with the night he had been through with his thoughts and his feeling of guilt and so he would have gladly gone away without waiting for the duel Von Koren was noticeably excited and tried to conceal it pretending that he was more interested in the green light than anything The seconds were confused and looked at one another as though wondering why they were here and what they were to do I imagine gentlemen there is no need for us to go further said Sheshkovsky This place will do Yes of course Von Koren agreed A silence followed Ustimovitch pacing to and fro suddenly turned sharply to Laevsky and said in a low voice breathing into his face They have very likely not told you my terms yet Each side is to pay me fifteen roubles and in the case of the death of one party the survivor is to pay thirty Laevsky was already acquainted with the man but now for the first time he had a distinct view of his lustreless eyes his stiff moustaches and wasted consumptive neck he was a money grubber not a doctor his breath had an unpleasant smell of beef What people there are in the world thought Laevsky and answered Very good The doctor nodded and began pacing to and fro again and it was evident he did not need the money at all but simply asked for it from hatred Every one felt it was time to begin or to end what had been begun but instead of beginning or ending they stood about moved to and fro and smoked The young officers who were present at a duel for the first time in their lives and even now hardly believed in this civilian and to their thinking unnecessary duel looked critically at their tunics and stroked their sleeves Sheshkovsky went up to them and said softly Gentlemen we must use every effort to prevent this duel they ought to be reconciled He flushed crimson and added Kirilin was at my rooms last night complaining that Laevsky had found him with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and all that sort of thing Yes we know that too said Boyko Well you see then Laevsky s hands are trembling and all that sort of thing he can scarcely hold a pistol now To fight with him is as inhuman as to fight a man who is drunk or who has typhoid If a reconciliation cannot be arranged we ought to put off the duel gentlemen or something It s such a sickening business I can t bear to see it Talk to Von Koren I don t know the rules of duelling damnation take them and I don t want to either perhaps he ll imagine Laevsky funks it and has sent me to him but he can think what he likes I ll speak to him Sheshkovsky hesitatingly walked up to Von Koren with a slight limp as though his leg had gone to sleep and as he went towards him clearing his throat his whole figure was a picture of indolence There s something I must say to you sir he began carefully scrutinising the flowers on the zoologist s shirt It s confidential I don t know the rules of duelling damnation take them and I don t want to and I look on the matter not as a second and that sort of thing but as a man and that s all about it Yes Well When seconds suggest reconciliation they are usually not listened to it is looked upon as a formality Amour propre and all that But I humbly beg you to look carefully at Ivan Andreitch He s not in a normal state so to speak to day not in his right mind and a pitiable object He has had a misfortune I can t endure gossip Sheshkovsky flushed crimson and looked round But in view of the duel I think it necessary to inform you Laevsky found his madam last night at Muridov s with another gentleman How disgusting muttered the zoologist he turned pale frowned and spat loudly Tfoo His lower lip quivered he walked away from Sheshkovsky unwilling to hear more and as though he had accidentally tasted something bitter spat loudly again and for the first time that morning looked with hatred at Laevsky His excitement and awkwardness passed off he tossed his head and said aloud Gentlemen what are we waiting for I should like to know Why don t we begin Sheshkovsky glanced at the officers and shrugged his shoulders Gentlemen he said aloud addressing no one in particular Gentlemen we propose that you should be reconciled Let us make haste and get the formalities over said Von Koren Reconciliation has been discussed already What is the next formality Make haste gentlemen time won t wait for us But we insist on reconciliation all the same said Sheshkovsky in a guilty voice as a man compelled to interfere in another man s business he flushed laid his hand on his heart and went on Gentlemen we see no grounds for associating the offence with the duel There s nothing in common between duelling and offences against one another of which we are sometimes guilty through human weakness You are university men and men of culture and no doubt you see in the duel nothing but a foolish and out of date formality and all that sort of thing That s how we look at it ourselves or we shouldn t have come for we cannot allow that in our presence men should fire at one another and all that Sheshkovsky wiped the perspiration off his face and went on Make an end to your misunderstanding gentlemen shake hands and let us go home and drink to peace Upon my honour gentlemen Von Koren did not speak Laevsky seeing that they were looking at him said I have nothing against Nikolay Vassilitch if he considers I m to blame I m ready to apologise to him Von Koren was offended It is evident gentlemen he said you want mister Laevsky to return home a magnanimous and chivalrous figure but I cannot give you and him that satisfaction And there was no need to get up early and drive eight miles out of town simply to drink to peace to have breakfast and to explain to me that the duel is an out of date formality A duel is a duel and there is no need to make it more false and stupid than it is in reality I want to fight A silence followed Boyko took a pair of pistols out of a box one was given to Von Koren and one to Laevsky and then there followed a difficulty which afforded a brief amusement to the zoologist and the seconds It appeared that of all the people present not one had ever in his life been at a duel and no one knew precisely how they ought to stand and what the seconds ought to say and do But then Boyko remembered and began with a smile to explain Gentlemen who remembers the description in Lermontov asked Von Koren laughing In Turgenev too Bazarov had a duel with some one There s no need to remember said Ustimovitch impatiently Measure the distance that s all And he took three steps as though to show how to measure it Boyko counted out the steps while his companion drew his sabre and scratched the earth at the extreme points to mark the barrier In complete silence the opponents took their places Moles the deacon thought sitting in the bushes Sheshkovsky said something Boyko explained something again but Laevsky did not hear or rather heard but did not understand He cocked his pistol when the time came to do so and raised the cold heavy weapon with the barrel upwards He forgot to unbutton his overcoat and it felt very tight over his shoulder and under his arm and his arm rose as awkwardly as though the sleeve had been cut out of tin He remembered the hatred he had felt the night before for the swarthy brow and curly hair and felt that even yesterday at the moment of intense hatred and anger he could not have shot a man Fearing that the bullet might somehow hit Von Koren by accident he raised the pistol higher and higher and felt that this too obvious magnanimity was indelicate and anything but magnanimous but he did not know how else to do and could do nothing else Looking at the pale ironically smiling face of Von Koren who evidently had been convinced from the beginning that his opponent would fire in the air Laevsky thought that thank God everything would be over directly and all that he had to do was to press the trigger rather hard He felt a violent shock on the shoulder there was the sound of a shot and an answering echo in the mountains ping ting Von Koren cocked his pistol and looked at Ustimovitch who was pacing as before with his hands behind his back taking no notice of any one Doctor said the zoologist be so good as not to move to and fro like a pendulum You make me dizzy The doctor stood still Von Koren began to take aim at Laevsky It s all over thought Laevsky The barrel of the pistol aimed straight at his face the expression of hatred and contempt in Von Koren s attitude and whole figure and the murder just about to be committed by a decent man in broad daylight in the presence of decent men and the stillness and the unknown force that compelled Laevsky to stand still and not to run how mysterious it all was how incomprehensible and terrible The moment while Von Koren was taking aim seemed to Laevsky longer than a night he glanced imploringly at the seconds they were pale and did not stir Make haste and fire thought Laevsky and felt that his pale quivering and pitiful face must arouse even greater hatred in Von Koren I ll kill him directly thought Von Koren aiming at his forehead with his finger already on the catch Yes of course I ll kill him He ll kill him A despairing shout was suddenly heard somewhere very close at hand A shot rang out at once Seeing that Laevsky remained standing where he was and did not fall they all looked in the direction from which the shout had come and saw the deacon With pale face and wet hair sticking to his forehead and his cheeks wet through and muddy he was standing in the maize on the further bank smiling rather queerly and waving his wet hat Sheshkovsky laughed with joy burst into tears and moved away XX A little while afterwards Von Koren and the deacon met near the little bridge The deacon was excited he breathed hard and avoided looking in people s faces He felt ashamed both of his terror and his muddy wet garments I thought you meant to kill him he muttered How contrary to human nature it is How utterly unnatural it is But how did you come here asked the zoologist Don t ask said the deacon waving his hand The evil one tempted me saying Go go So I went and almost died of fright in the maize But now thank God thank God I am awfully pleased with you muttered the deacon Old Grandad Tarantula will be glad It s funny it s too funny Only I beg of you most earnestly don t tell anybody I was there or I may get into hot water with the authorities They will say The deacon was a second Gentlemen said Von Koren the deacon asks you not to tell any one you ve seen him here He might get into trouble How contrary to human nature it is sighed the deacon Excuse my saying so but your face was so dreadful that I thought you were going to kill him I was very much tempted to put an end to that scoundrel said Von Koren but you shouted close by and I missed my aim The whole procedure is revolting to any one who is not used to it and it has exhausted me deacon I feel awfully tired Come along No you must let me walk back I must get dry for I am wet and cold Well as you like said the zoologist in a weary tone feeling dispirited and getting into the carriage he closed his eyes As you like While they were moving about the carriages and taking their seats Kerbalay stood in the road and laying his hands on his stomach he bowed low showing his teeth he imagined that the gentry had come to enjoy the beauties of nature and drink tea and could not understand why they were getting into the carriages The party set off in complete silence and only the deacon was left by the duhan Come to the duhan drink tea he said to Kerbalay Me wants to eat Kerbalay spoke good Russian but the deacon imagined that the Tatar would understand him better if he talked to him in broken Russian Cook omelette give cheese Come come father said Kerbalay bowing I ll give you everything I ve cheese and wine Eat what you like What is God in Tatar asked the deacon going into the duhan Your God and my God are the same said Kerbalay not understanding him God is the same for all men only men are different Some are Russian some are Turks some are English there are many sorts of men but God is one Very good If all men worship the same God why do you Mohammedans look upon Christians as your everlasting enemies Why are you angry said Kerbalay laying both hands on his stomach You are a priest I am a Mussulman you say I want to eat I give it you Only the rich man distinguishes your God from my God for the poor man it is all the same If you please it is ready While this theological conversation was taking place at the duhan Laevsky was driving home thinking how dreadful it had been driving there at daybreak when the roads the rocks and the mountains were wet and dark and the uncertain future seemed like a terrible abyss of which one could not see the bottom while now the raindrops hanging on the grass and on the stones were sparkling in the sun like diamonds nature was smiling joyfully and the terrible future was left behind He looked at Sheshkovsky s sullen tear stained face and at the two carriages ahead of them in which Von Koren his seconds and the doctor were sitting and it seemed to him as though they were all coming back from a graveyard in which a wearisome insufferable man who was a burden to others had just been buried Everything is over he thought of his past cautiously touching his neck with his fingers On the right side of his neck was a small swelling of the length and breadth of his little finger and he felt a pain as though some one had passed a hot iron over his neck The bullet had bruised it Afterwards when he got home a strange long sweet day began for him misty as forgetfulness Like a man released from prison or from hospital he stared at the long familiar objects and wondered that the tables the windows the chairs the light and the sea stirred in him a keen childish delight such as he had not known for long long years Nadyezhda Fyodorovna pale and haggard could not understand his gentle voice and strange movements she made haste to tell him everything that had happened to her It seemed to her that very likely he scarcely heard and did not understand her and that if he did know everything he would curse her and kill her but he listened to her stroked her face and hair looked into her eyes and said I have nobody but you Then they sat a long while in the garden huddled close together saying nothing or dreaming aloud of their happy life in the future in brief broken sentences while it seemed to him that he had never spoken at such length or so eloquently XXI More than three months had passed The day came that Von Koren had fixed on for his departure A cold heavy rain had been falling from early morning a north east wind was blowing and the waves were high on the sea It was said that the steamer would hardly be able to come into the harbour in such weather By the time table it should have arrived at ten o clock in the morning but Von Koren who had gone on to the sea front at midday and again after dinner could see nothing through the field glass but grey waves and rain covering the horizon Towards the end of the day the rain ceased and the wind began to drop perceptibly Von Koren had already made up his mind that he would not be able to get off that day and had settled down to play chess with Samoylenko but after dark the orderly announced that there were lights on the sea and that a rocket had been seen Von Koren made haste He put his satchel over his shoulder and kissed Samoylenko and the deacon Though there was not the slightest necessity he went through the rooms again said good bye to the orderly and the cook and went out into the street feeling that he had left something behind either at the doctor s or his lodging In the street he walked beside Samoylenko behind them came the deacon with a box and last of all the orderly with two portmanteaus Only Samoylenko and the orderly could distinguish the dim lights on the sea The others gazed into the darkness and saw nothing The steamer had stopped a long way from the coast Make haste make haste Von Koren hurried them I am afraid it will set off As they passed the little house with three windows into which Laevsky had moved soon after the duel Von Koren could not resist peeping in at the window Laevsky was sitting writing bent over the table with his back to the window I wonder at him said the zoologist softly What a screw he has put on himself Yes one may well wonder said Samoylenko He sits from morning till night he s always at work He works to pay off his debts And he lives brother worse than a beggar Half a minute of silence followed The zoologist the doctor and the deacon stood at the window and went on looking at Laevsky So he didn t get away from here poor fellow said Samoylenko Do you remember how hard he tried Yes he has put a screw on himself Von Koren repeated His marriage the way he works all day long for his daily bread a new expression in his face and even in his walk it s all so extraordinary that I don t know what to call it The zoologist took Samoylenko s sleeve and went on with emotion in his voice You tell him and his wife that when I went away I was full of admiration for them and wished them all happiness and I beg him if he can not to remember evil against me He knows me He knows that if I could have foreseen this change then I might have become his best friend Go in and say good bye to him No that wouldn t do Why God knows perhaps you ll never see him again The zoologist reflected and said That s true Samoylenko tapped softly at the window Laevsky started and looked round Vanya Nikolay Vassilitch wants to say goodbye to you said Samoylenko He is just going away Laevsky got up from the table and went into the passage to open the door Samoylenko the zoologist and the deacon went into the house I can only come for one minute began the zoologist taking off his goloshes in the passage and already wishing he had not given way to his feelings and come in uninvited It is as though I were forcing myself on him he thought and that s stupid Forgive me for disturbing you he said as he went into the room with Laevsky but I m just going away and I had an impulse to see you God knows whether we shall ever meet again I am very glad to see you Please come in said Laevsky and he awkwardly set chairs for his visitors as though he wanted to bar their way and stood in the middle of the room rubbing his hands I should have done better to have left my audience in the street thought Von Koren and he said firmly Don t remember evil against me Ivan Andreitch To forget the past is of course impossible it is too painful and I ve not come here to apologise or to declare that I was not to blame I acted sincerely and I have not changed my convictions since then It is true that I see to my great delight that I was mistaken in regard to you but it s easy to make a false step even on a smooth road and in fact it s the natural human lot if one is not mistaken in the main one is mistaken in the details Nobody knows the real truth No no one knows the truth said Laevsky Well good bye God give you all happiness Von Koren gave Laevsky his hand the latter took it and bowed Don t remember evil against me said Von Koren Give my greetings to your wife and say I am very sorry not to say good bye to her She is at home Laevsky went to the door of the next room and said Nadya Nikolay Vassilitch wants to say goodbye to you Nadyezhda Fyodorovna came in she stopped near the doorway and looked shyly at the visitors There was a look of guilt and dismay on her face and she held her hands like a schoolgirl receiving a scolding I m just going away Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said Von Koren and have come to say good bye She held out her hand uncertainly while Laevsky bowed What pitiful figures they are though thought Von Koren The life they are living does not come easy to them I shall be in Moscow and Petersburg can I send you anything he asked Oh said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and she looked anxiously at her husband I don t think there s anything No nothing said Laevsky rubbing his hands Our greetings Von Koren did not know what he could or ought to say though as he went in he thought he would say a very great deal that would be warm and good and important He shook hands with Laevsky and his wife in silence and left them with a depressed feeling What people said the deacon in a low voice as he walked behind them My God what people Of a truth the right hand of God has planted this vine Lord Lord One man vanquishes thousands and another tens of thousands Nikolay Vassilitch he said ecstatically let me tell you that to day you have conquered the greatest of man s enemies pride Hush deacon Fine conquerors we are Conquerors ought to look like eagles while he s a pitiful figure timid crushed he bows like a Chinese idol and I I am sad They heard steps behind them It was Laevsky hurrying after them to see him off The orderly was standing on the quay with the two portmanteaus and at a little distance stood four boatmen There is a wind though Brrr said Samoylenko There must be a pretty stiff storm on the sea now You are not going off at a nice time Koyla I m not afraid of sea sickness That s not the point I only hope these rascals won t upset you You ought to have crossed in the agent s sloop Where s the agent s sloop he shouted to the boatmen It has gone Your Excellency And the Customs house boat That s gone too Why didn t you let us know said Samoylenko angrily You dolts It s all the same don t worry yourself said Von Koren Well good bye God keep you Samoylenko embraced Von Koren and made the sign of the cross over him three times Don t forget us Kolya Write We shall look out for you next spring Good bye deacon said Von Koren shaking hands with the deacon Thank you for your company and for your pleasant conversation Think about the expedition Oh Lord yes to the ends of the earth laughed the deacon I ve nothing against it Von Koren recognised Laevsky in the darkness and held out his hand without speaking The boatmen were by now below holding the boat which was beating against the piles though the breakwater screened it from the breakers Von Koren went down the ladder jumped into the boat and sat at the helm Write Samoylenko shouted to him Take care of yourself No one knows the real truth thought Laevsky turning up the collar of his coat and thrusting his hands into his sleeves The boat turned briskly out of the harbour into the open sea It vanished in the waves but at once from a deep hollow glided up onto a high breaker so that they could distinguish the men and even the oars The boat moved three yards forward and was sucked two yards back Write shouted Samoylenko it s devilish weather for you to go in Yes no one knows the real truth thought Laevsky looking wearily at the dark restless sea It flings the boat back he thought she makes two steps forward and one step back but the boatmen are stubborn they work the oars unceasingly and are not afraid of the high waves The boat goes on and on Now she is out of sight but in half an hour the boatmen will see the steamer lights distinctly and within an hour they will be by the steamer ladder So it is in life In the search for truth man makes two steps forward and one step back Suffering mistakes and weariness of life thrust them back but the thirst for truth and stubborn will drive them on and on And who knows Perhaps they will reach the real truth at last Go o od by e shouted Samoylenko There s no sight or sound of them said the deacon Good luck on the journey It began to spot with rain EXCELLENT PEOPLE ONCE upon a time there lived in Moscow a man called Vladimir Semyonitch Liadovsky He took his degree at the university in the faculty of law and had a post on the board of management of some railway but if you had asked him what his work was he would look candidly and openly at you with his large bright eyes through his gold pincenez and would answer in a soft velvety lisping baritone My work is literature After completing his course at the university Vladimir Semyonitch had had a paragraph of theatrical criticism accepted by a newspaper From this paragraph he passed on to reviewing and a year later he had advanced to writing a weekly article on literary matters for the same paper But it does not follow from these facts that he was an amateur that his literary work was of an ephemeral haphazard character Whenever I saw his neat spare figure his high forehead and long mane of hair when I listened to his speeches it always seemed to me that his writing quite apart from what and how he wrote was something organically part of him like the beating of his heart and that his whole literary programme must have been an integral part of his brain while he was a baby in his mother s womb Even in his walk his gestures his manner of shaking off the ash from his cigarette I could read this whole programme from A to Z with all its claptrap dulness and honourable sentiments He was a literary man all over when with an inspired face he laid a wreath on the coffin of some celebrity or with a grave and solemn face collected signatures for some address his passion for making the acquaintance of distinguished literary men his faculty for finding talent even where it was absent his perpetual enthusiasm his pulse that went at one hundred and twenty a minute his ignorance of life the genuinely feminine flutter with which he threw himself into concerts and literary evenings for the benefit of destitute students the way in which he gravitated towards the young all this would have created for him the reputation of a writer even if he had not written his articles He was one of those writers to whom phrases like We are but few or What would life be without strife Forward were pre eminently becoming though he never strove with any one and never did go forward It did not even sound mawkish when he fell to discoursing of ideals Every anniversary of the university on saint Tatiana s Day he got drunk chanted Gaudeamus out of tune and his beaming and perspiring countenance seemed to say See I m drunk I m keeping it up But even that suited him Vladimir Semyonitch had genuine faith in his literary vocation and his whole programme He had no doubts and was evidently very well pleased with himself Only one thing grieved him the paper for which he worked had a limited circulation and was not very influential But Vladimir Semyonitch believed that sooner or later he would succeed in getting on to a solid magazine where he would have scope and could display himself and what little distress he felt on this score was pale beside the brilliance of his hopes Visiting this charming man I made the acquaintance of his sister Vera Semyonovna a woman doctor At first sight what struck me about this woman was her look of exhaustion and extreme ill health She was young with a good figure and regular rather large features but in comparison with her agile elegant and talkative brother she seemed angular listless slovenly and sullen There was something strained cold apathetic in her movements smiles and words she was not liked and was thought proud and not very intelligent In reality I fancy she was resting My dear friend her brother would often say to me sighing and flinging back his hair in his picturesque literary way one must never judge by appearances Look at this book it has long ago been read It is warped tattered and lies in the dust uncared for but open it and it will make you weep and turn pale My sister is like that book Lift the cover and peep into her soul and you will be horror stricken Vera passed in some three months through experiences that would have been ample for a whole lifetime Vladimir Semyonitch looked round him took me by the sleeve and began to whisper You know after taking her degree she married for love an architect It s a complete tragedy They had hardly been married a month when whew her husband died of typhus But that was not all She caught typhus from him and when on her recovery she learnt that her Ivan was dead she took a good dose of morphia If it had not been for vigorous measures taken by her friends my Vera would have been by now in Paradise Tell me isn t it a tragedy And is not my sister like an ingenue who has played already all the five acts of her life The audience may stay for the farce but the ingenue must go home to rest After three months of misery Vera Semyonovna had come to live with her brother She was not fitted for the practice of medicine which exhausted her and did not satisfy her she did not give one the impression of knowing her subject and I never once heard her say anything referring to her medical studies She gave up medicine and silent and unoccupied as though she were a prisoner spent the remainder of her youth in colourless apathy with bowed head and hanging hands The only thing to which she was not completely indifferent and which brought some brightness into the twilight of her life was the presence of her brother whom she loved She loved him himself and his programme she was full of reverence for his articles and when she was asked what her brother was doing she would answer in a subdued voice as though afraid of waking or distracting him He is writing Usually when he was at his work she used to sit beside him her eyes fixed on his writing hand She used at such moments to look like a sick animal warming itself in the sun One winter evening Vladimir Semyonitch was sitting at his table writing a critical article for his newspaper Vera Semyonovna was sitting beside him staring as usual at his writing hand The critic wrote rapidly without erasures or corrections The pen scratched and squeaked On the table near the writing hand there lay open a freshly cut volume of a thick magazine containing a story of peasant life signed with two initials Vladimir Semyonitch was enthusiastic he thought the author was admirable in his handling of the subject suggested Turgenev in his descriptions of nature was truthful and had an excellent knowledge of the life of the peasantry The critic himself knew nothing of peasant life except from books and hearsay but his feelings and his inner convictions forced him to believe the story He foretold a brilliant future for the author assured him he should await the conclusion of the story with great impatience and so on Fine story he said flinging himself back in his chair and closing his eyes with pleasure The tone is extremely good Vera Semyonovna looked at him yawned aloud and suddenly asked an unexpected question In the evening she had a habit of yawning nervously and asking short abrupt questions not always relevant Volodya she asked what is the meaning of non resistance to evil Non resistance to evil repeated her brother opening his eyes Yes What do you understand by it You see my dear imagine that thieves or brigands attack you and you instead of No give me a logical definition A logical definition Um Well Vladimir Semyonitch pondered Non resistance to evil means an attitude of non interference with regard to all that in the sphere of mortality is called evil Saying this Vladimir Semyonitch bent over the table and took up a novel This novel written by a woman dealt with the painfulness of the irregular position of a society lady who was living under the same roof with her lover and her illegitimate child Vladimir Semyonitch was pleased with the excellent tendency of the story the plot and the presentation of it Making a brief summary of the novel he selected the best passages and added to them in his account How true to reality how living how picturesque The author is not merely an artist he is also a subtle psychologist who can see into the hearts of his characters Take for example this vivid description of the emotions of the heroine on meeting her husband and so on Volodya Vera Semyonovna interrupted his critical effusions I ve been haunted by a strange idea since yesterday I keep wondering where we should all be if human life were ordered on the basis of non resistance to evil In all probability nowhere Non resistance to evil would give the full rein to the criminal will and to say nothing of civilisation this would leave not one stone standing upon another anywhere on earth What would be left Bashi Bazouke and brothels In my next article I ll talk about that perhaps Thank you for reminding me And a week later my friend kept his promise That was just at the period in the eighties when people were beginning to talk and write of non resistance of the right to judge to punish to make war when some people in our set were beginning to do without servants to retire into the country to work on the land and to renounce animal food and carnal love After reading her brother s article Vera Semyonovna pondered and hardly perceptibly shrugged her shoulders Very nice she said But still there s a great deal I don t understand For instance in Leskov s story Belonging to the Cathedral there is a queer gardener who sows for the benefit of all for customers for beggars and any who care to steal Did he behave sensibly From his sister s tone and expression Vladimir Semyonitch saw that she did not like his article and almost for the first time in his life his vanity as an author sustained a shock With a shade of irritation he answered Theft is immoral To sow for thieves is to recognise the right of thieves to existence What would you think if I were to establish a newspaper and dividing it into sections provide for blackmailing as well as for liberal ideas Following the example of that gardener I ought logically to provide a section for blackmailers the intellectual scoundrels Yes Vera Semyonovna made no answer She got up from the table moved languidly to the sofa and lay down I don t know I know nothing about it she said musingly You are probably right but it seems to me I feel somehow that there s something false in our resistance to evil as though there were something concealed or unsaid God knows perhaps our methods of resisting evil belong to the category of prejudices which have become so deeply rooted in us that we are incapable of parting with them and therefore cannot form a correct judgment of them How do you mean I don t know how to explain to you Perhaps man is mistaken in thinking that he is obliged to resist evil and has a right to do so just as he is mistaken in thinking for instance that the heart looks like an ace of hearts It is very possible in resisting evil we ought not to use force but to use what is the very opposite of force if you for instance don t want this picture stolen from you you ought to give it away rather than lock it up That s clever very clever If I want to marry a rich vulgar woman she ought to prevent me from such a shabby action by hastening to make me an offer herself The brother and sister talked till midnight without understanding each other If any outsider had overheard them he would hardly have been able to make out what either of them was driving at They usually spent the evening at home There were no friends houses to which they could go and they felt no need for friends they only went to the theatre when there was a new play such was the custom in literary circles they did not go to concerts for they did not care for music You may think what you like Vera Semyonovna began again the next day but for me the question is to a great extent settled I am firmly convinced that I have no grounds for resisting evil directed against me personally If they want to kill me let them My defending myself will not make the murderer better All I have now to decide is the second half of the question how I ought to behave to evil directed against my neighbours Vera mind you don t become rabid said Vladimir Semyonitch laughing I see non resistance is becoming your idee fixe He wanted to turn off these tedious conversations with a jest but somehow it was beyond a jest his smile was artificial and sour His sister gave up sitting beside his table and gazing reverently at his writing hand and he felt every evening that behind him on the sofa lay a person who did not agree with him And his back grew stiff and numb and there was a chill in his soul An author s vanity is vindictive implacable incapable of forgiveness and his sister was the first and only person who had laid bare and disturbed that uneasy feeling which is like a big box of crockery easy to unpack but impossible to pack up again as it was before Weeks and months passed by and his sister clung to her ideas and did not sit down by the table One spring evening Vladimir Semyonitch was sitting at his table writing an article He was reviewing a novel which described how a village schoolmistress refused the man whom she loved and who loved her a man both wealthy and intellectual simply because marriage made her work as a schoolmistress impossible Vera Semyonovna lay on the sofa and brooded My God how slow it is she said stretching How insipid and empty life is I don t know what to do with myself and you are wasting your best years in goodness knows what Like some alchemist you are rummaging in old rubbish that nobody wants My God Vladimir Semyonitch dropped his pen and slowly looked round at his sister It s depressing to look at you said his sister Wagner in Faust dug up worms but he was looking for a treasure anyway and you are looking for worms for the sake of the worms That s vague Yes Volodya all these days I ve been thinking I ve been thinking painfully for a long time and I have come to the conclusion that you are hopelessly reactionary and conventional Come ask yourself what is the object of your zealous conscientious work Tell me what is it Why everything has long ago been extracted that can be extracted from that rubbish in which you are always rummaging You may pound water in a mortar and analyse it as long as you like you ll make nothing more of it than the chemists have made already Indeed drawled Vladimir Semyonitch getting up Yes all this is old rubbish because these ideas are eternal but what do you consider new then You undertake to work in the domain of thought it is for you to think of something new It s not for me to teach you Me an alchemist the critic cried in wonder and indignation screwing up his eyes ironically Art progress all that is alchemy You see Volodya it seems to me that if all you thinking people had set yourselves to solving great problems all these little questions that you fuss about now would solve themselves by the way If you go up in a balloon to see a town you will incidentally without any effort see the fields and the villages and the rivers as well When stearine is manufactured you get glycerine as a by product It seems to me that contemporary thought has settled on one spot and stuck to it It is prejudiced apathetic timid afraid to take a wide titanic flight just as you and I are afraid to climb on a high mountain it is conservative Such conversations could not but leave traces The relations of the brother and sister grew more and more strained every day The brother became unable to work in his sister s presence and grew irritable when he knew his sister was lying on the sofa looking at his back while the sister frowned nervously and stretched when trying to bring back the past he attempted to share his enthusiasms with her Every evening she complained of being bored and talked about independence of mind and those who are in the rut of tradition Carried away by her new ideas Vera Semyonovna proved that the work that her brother was so engrossed in was conventional that it was a vain effort of conservative minds to preserve what had already served its turn and was vanishing from the scene of action She made no end of comparisons She compared her brother at one time to an alchemist then to a musty old Believer who would sooner die than listen to reason By degrees there was a perceptible change in her manner of life too She was capable of lying on the sofa all day long doing nothing but think while her face wore a cold dry expression such as one sees in one sided people of strong faith She began to refuse the attentions of the servants swept and tidied her own room cleaned her own boots and brushed her own clothes Her brother could not help looking with irritation and even hatred at her cold face when she went about her menial work In that work which was always performed with a certain solemnity he saw something strained and false he saw something both pharisaical and affected And knowing he could not touch her by persuasion he carped at her and teased her like a schoolboy You won t resist evil but you resist my having servants he taunted her If servants are an evil why do you oppose it That s inconsistent He suffered was indignant and even ashamed He felt ashamed when his sister began doing odd things before strangers It s awful my dear fellow he said to me in private waving his hands in despair It seems that our ingenue has remained to play a part in the farce too She s become morbid to the marrow of her bones I ve washed my hands of her let her think as she likes but why does she talk why does she excite me She ought to think what it means for me to listen to her What I feel when in my presence she has the effrontery to support her errors by blasphemously quoting the teaching of Christ It chokes me It makes me hot all over to hear my sister propounding her doctrines and trying to distort the Gospel to suit her when she purposely refrains from mentioning how the moneychangers were driven out of the Temple That s my dear fellow what comes of being half educated undeveloped That s what comes of medical studies which provide no general culture One day on coming home from the office Vladimir Semyonitch found his sister crying She was sitting on the sofa with her head bowed wringing her hands and tears were flowing freely down her cheeks The critic s good heart throbbed with pain Tears fell from his eyes too and he longed to pet his sister to forgive her to beg her forgiveness and to live as they used to before He knelt down and kissed her head her hands her shoulders She smiled smiled bitterly unaccountably while he with a cry of joy jumped up seized the magazine from the table and said warmly Hurrah We ll live as we used to Verotchka With God s blessing And I ve such a surprise for you here Instead of celebrating the occasion with champagne let us read it together A splendid wonderful thing Oh no no cried Vera Semyonovna pushing away the book in alarm I ve read it already I don t want it I don t want it When did you read it A year two years ago I read it long ago and I know it I know it H m You re a fanatic her brother said coldly flinging the magazine on to the table No you are a fanatic not I You And Vera Semyonovna dissolved into tears again Her brother stood before her looked at her quivering shoulders and thought He thought not of the agonies of loneliness endured by any one who begins to think in a new way of their own not of the inevitable sufferings of a genuine spiritual revolution but of the outrage of his programme the outrage to his author s vanity From this time he treated his sister coldly with careless irony and he endured her presence in the room as one endures the presence of old women that are dependent on one For her part she left off disputing with him and met all his arguments jeers and attacks with a condescending silence which irritated him more than ever One summer morning Vera Semyonovna dressed for travelling with a satchel over her shoulder went in to her brother and coldly kissed him on the forehead Where are you going he asked with surprise To the province of N to do vaccination work Her brother went out into the street with her So that s what you ve decided upon you queer girl he muttered Don t you want some money No thank you Good bye The sister shook her brother s hand and set off Why don t you have a cab cried Vladimir Semyonitch She did not answer Her brother gazed after her watched her rusty looking waterproof the swaying of her figure as she slouched along forced himself to sigh but did not succeed in rousing a feeling of regret His sister had become a stranger to him And he was a stranger to her Anyway she did not once look round Going back to his room Vladimir Semyonitch at once sat down to the table and began to work at his article I never saw Vera Semyonovna again Where she is now I do not know And Vladimir Semyonitch went on writing his articles laying wreaths on coffins singing Gaudeamus busying himself over the Mutual Aid Society of Moscow Journalists He fell ill with inflammation of the lungs he was ill in bed for three months at first at home and afterwards in the Golitsyn Hospital An abscess developed in his knee People said he ought to be sent to the Crimea and began getting up a collection for him But he did not go to the Crimea he died We buried him in the Vagankovsky Cemetery on the left side where artists and literary men are buried One day we writers were sitting in the Tatars restaurant I mentioned that I had lately been in the Vagankovsky Cemetery and had seen Vladimir Semyonitch s grave there It was utterly neglected and almost indistinguishable from the rest of the ground the cross had fallen it was necessary to collect a few roubles to put it in order But they listened to what I said unconcernedly made no answer and I could not collect a farthing No one remembered Vladimir Semyonitch He was utterly forgotten MIRE I GRACEFULLY swaying in the saddle a young man wearing the snow white tunic of an officer rode into the great yard of the vodka distillery belonging to the heirs of M E Rothstein The sun smiled carelessly on the lieutenant s little stars on the white trunks of the birch trees on the heaps of broken glass scattered here and there in the yard The radiant vigorous beauty of a summer day lay over everything and nothing hindered the snappy young green leaves from dancing gaily and winking at the clear blue sky Even the dirty and soot begrimed appearance of the bricksheds and the stifling fumes of the distillery did not spoil the general good impression The lieutenant sprang gaily out of the saddle handed over his horse to a man who ran up and stroking with his finger his delicate black moustaches went in at the front door On the top step of the old but light and softly carpeted staircase he was met by a maidservant with a haughty not very youthful face The lieutenant gave her his card without speaking As she went through the rooms with the card the maid could see on it the name Alexandr Grigoryevitch Sokolsky A minute later she came back and told the lieutenant that her mistress could not see him as she was not feeling quite well Sokolsky looked at the ceiling and thrust out his lower lip How vexatious he said Listen my dear he said eagerly Go and tell Susanna Moiseyevna that it is very necessary for me to speak to her very I will only keep her one minute Ask her to excuse me The maid shrugged one shoulder and went off languidly to her mistress Very well she sighed returning after a brief interval Please walk in The lieutenant went with her through five or six large luxuriously furnished rooms and a corridor and finally found himself in a large and lofty square room in which from the first step he was impressed by the abundance of flowers and plants and the sweet almost revoltingly heavy fragrance of jasmine Flowers were trained to trellis work along the walls screening the windows hung from the ceiling and were wreathed over the corners so that the room was more like a greenhouse than a place to live in Tits canaries and goldfinches chirruped among the green leaves and fluttered against the window panes Forgive me for receiving you here the lieutenant heard in a mellow feminine voice with a burr on the letter r which was not without charm Yesterday I had a sick headache and I m trying to keep still to prevent its coming on again What do you want Exactly opposite the entrance he saw sitting in a big low chair such as old men use a woman in an expensive Chinese dressing gown with her head wrapped up leaning back on a pillow Nothing could be seen behind the woollen shawl in which she was muffled but a pale long pointed somewhat aquiline nose and one large dark eye Her ample dressing gown concealed her figure but judging from her beautiful hand from her voice her nose and her eye she might be twenty six or twenty eight Forgive me for being so persistent began the lieutenant clinking his spurs Allow me to introduce myself Sokolsky I come with a message from my cousin your neighbour Alexey Ivanovitch Kryukov who I know interposed Susanna Moiseyevna I know Kryukov Sit down I don t like anything big standing before me My cousin charges me to ask you a favour the lieutenant went on clinking his spurs once more and sitting down The fact is your late father made a purchase of oats from my cousin last winter and a small sum was left owing The payment only becomes due next week but my cousin begs you most particularly to pay him if possible to day As the lieutenant talked he stole side glances about him Surely I m not in her bedroom he thought In one corner of the room where the foliage was thickest and tallest under a pink awning like a funeral canopy stood a bed not yet made with the bedclothes still in disorder Close by on two arm chairs lay heaps of crumpled feminine garments Petticoats and sleeves with rumpled lace and flounces were trailing on the carpet on which here and there lay bits of white tape cigarette ends and the papers of caramels Under the bed the toes pointed and square of slippers of all kinds peeped out in a long row And it seemed to the lieutenant that the scent of the jasmine came not from the flowers but from the bed and the slippers And what is the sum owing asked Susanna Moiseyevna Two thousand three hundred Oho said the Jewess showing another large black eye And you call that a small sum However it s just the same paying it to day or paying it in a week but I ve had so many payments to make in the last two months since my father s death Such a lot of stupid business it makes my head go round A nice idea I want to go abroad and they keep forcing me to attend to these silly things Vodka oats she muttered half closing her eyes oats bills percentages or as my head clerk says percentage It s awful Yesterday I simply turned the excise officer out He pesters me with his Tralles I said to him Go to the devil with your Tralles I can t see any one He kissed my hand and went away I tell you what can t your cousin wait two or three months A cruel question laughed the lieutenant My cousin can wait a year but it s I who cannot wait You see it s on my own account I m acting I ought to tell you At all costs I must have money and by ill luck my cousin hasn t a rouble to spare I m forced to ride about and collect debts I ve just been to see a peasant our tenant here I m now calling on you from here I shall go on to somewhere else and keep on like that until I get together five thousand roubles I need money awfully Nonsense What does a young man want with money Whims mischief Why have you been going in for dissipation Or losing at cards Or are you getting married You ve guessed laughed the lieutenant and rising slightly from his seat he clinked his spurs I really am going to be married Susanna Moiseyevna looked intently at her visitor made a wry face and sighed I can t make out what possesses people to get married she said looking about her for her pocket handkerchief Life is so short one has so little freedom and they must put chains on themselves Every one has his own way of looking at things Yes yes of course every one has his own way of looking at things But I say are you really going to marry some one poor Are you passionately in love And why must you have five thousand Why won t four do or three What a tongue she has thought the lieutenant and answered The difficulty is that an officer is not allowed by law to marry till he is twenty eight if you choose to marry you have to leave the Service or else pay a deposit of five thousand Ah now I understand Listen You said just now that every one has his own way of looking at things Perhaps your fiancee is some one special and remarkable but but I am utterly unable to understand how any decent man can live with a woman I can t for the life of me understand it I have lived thank the Lord twenty seven years and I have never yet seen an endurable woman They re all affected minxes immoral liars The only ones I can put up with are cooks and housemaids but so called ladies I won t let come within shooting distance of me But thank God they hate me and don t force themselves on me If one of them wants money she sends her husband but nothing will induce her to come herself not from pride no but from cowardice she s afraid of my making a scene Oh I understand their hatred very well Rather I openly display what they do their very utmost to conceal from God and man How can they help hating me No doubt you ve heard bushels of scandal about me already I only arrived here so lately Tut tut tut I see from your eyes But your brother s wife surely she primed you for this expedition Think of letting a young man come to see such an awful woman without warning him how could she Ha ha But tell me how is your brother He s a fine fellow such a handsome man I ve seen him several times at mass Why do you look at me like that I very often go to church We all have the same God To an educated person externals matter less than the idea That s so isn t it Yes of course smiled the lieutenant Yes the idea But you are not a bit like your brother You are handsome too but your brother is a great deal better looking There s wonderfully little likeness That s quite natural he s not my brother but my cousin Ah to be sure So you must have the money to day Why to day My furlough is over in a few days Well what s to be done with you sighed Susanna Moiseyevna So be it I ll give you the money though I know you ll abuse me for it afterwards You ll quarrel with your wife after you are married and say If that mangy Jewess hadn t given me the money I should perhaps have been as free as a bird to day Is your fiancee pretty Oh yes H m Anyway better something if it s only beauty than nothing Though however beautiful a woman is it can never make up to her husband for her silliness That s original laughed the lieutenant You are a woman yourself and such a woman hater A woman smiled Susanna It s not my fault that God has cast me into this mould is it I m no more to blame for it than you are for having moustaches The violin is not responsible for the choice of its case I am very fond of myself but when any one reminds me that I am a woman I begin to hate myself Well you can go away and I ll dress Wait for me in the drawing room The lieutenant went out and the first thing he did was to draw a deep breath to get rid of the heavy scent of jasmine which had begun to irritate his throat and to make him feel giddy What a strange woman he thought looking about him She talks fluently but far too much and too freely She must be neurotic The drawing room in which he was standing now was richly furnished and had pretensions to luxury and style There were dark bronze dishes with patterns in relief views of Nice and the Rhine on the tables old fashioned sconces Japanese statuettes but all this striving after luxury and style only emphasised the lack of taste which was glaringly apparent in the gilt cornices the gaudy wall paper the bright velvet table cloths the common oleographs in heavy frames The bad taste of the general effect was the more complete from the lack of finish and the overcrowding of the room which gave one a feeling that something was lacking and that a great deal should have been thrown away It was evident that the furniture had not been bought all at once but had been picked up at auctions and other favourable opportunities Heaven knows what taste the lieutenant could boast of but even he noticed one characteristic peculiarity about the whole place which no luxury or style could efface a complete absence of all trace of womanly careful hands which as we all know give a warmth poetry and snugness to the furnishing of a room There was a chilliness about it such as one finds in waiting rooms at stations in clubs and foyers at the theatres There was scarcely anything in the room definitely Jewish except perhaps a big picture of the meeting of Jacob and Esau The lieutenant looked round about him and shrugging his shoulders thought of his strange new acquaintance of her free and easy manners and her way of talking But then the door opened and in the doorway appeared the lady herself in a long black dress so slim and tightly laced that her figure looked as though it had been turned in a lathe Now the lieutenant saw not only the nose and eyes but also a thin white face a head black and as curly as lamb s wool She did not attract him though she did not strike him as ugly He had a prejudice against un Russian faces in general and he considered too that the lady s white face the whiteness of which for some reason suggested the cloying scent of jasmine did not go well with her little black curls and thick eyebrows that her nose and ears were astoundingly white as though they belonged to a corpse or had been moulded out of transparent wax When she smiled she showed pale gums as well as her teeth and he did not like that either Anaemic debility he thought she s probably as nervous as a turkey Here I am Come along she said going on rapidly ahead of him and pulling off the yellow leaves from the plants as she passed I ll give you the money directly and if you like I ll give you some lunch Two thousand three hundred roubles After such a good stroke of business you ll have an appetite for your lunch Do you like my rooms The ladies about here declare that my rooms always smell of garlic With that culinary gibe their stock of wit is exhausted I hasten to assure you that I ve no garlic even in the cellar And one day when a doctor came to see me who smelt of garlic I asked him to take his hat and go and spread his fragrance elsewhere There is no smell of garlic here but the place does smell of drugs My father lay paralyzed for a year and a half and the whole house smelt of medicine A year and a half I was sorry to lose him but I m glad he s dead he suffered so She led the officer through two rooms similar to the drawing room through a large reception hall and came to a stop in her study where there was a lady s writing table covered with little knick knacks On the carpet near it several books lay strewn about opened and folded back Through a small door leading from the study he saw a table laid for lunch Still chatting Susanna took out of her pocket a bunch of little keys and unlocked an ingeniously made cupboard with a curved sloping lid When the lid was raised the cupboard emitted a plaintive note which made the lieutenant think of an AEolian harp Susanna picked out another key and clicked another lock I have underground passages here and secret doors she said taking out a small morocco portfolio It s a funny cupboard isn t it And in this portfolio I have a quarter of my fortune Look how podgy it is You won t strangle me will you Susanna raised her eyes to the lieutenant and laughed good naturedly The lieutenant laughed too She s rather jolly he thought watching the keys flashing between her fingers Here it is she said picking out the key of the portfolio Now mister Creditor trot out the IOU What a silly thing money is really How paltry it is and yet how women love it I am a Jewess you know to the marrow of my bones I am passionately fond of Shmuls and Yankels but how I loathe that passion for gain in our Semitic blood They hoard and they don t know what they are hoarding for One ought to live and enjoy oneself but they re afraid of spending an extra farthing In that way I am more like an hussar than a Shmul I don t like money to be kept long in one place And altogether I fancy I m not much like a Jewess Does my accent give me away much eh What shall I say mumbled the lieutenant You speak good Russian but you do roll your r s Susanna laughed and put the little key in the lock of the portfolio The lieutenant took out of his pocket a little roll of IOUs and laid them with a notebook on the table Nothing betrays a Jew as much as his accent Susanna went on looking gaily at the lieutenant However much he twists himself into a Russian or a Frenchman ask him to say feather and he will say fedder but I pronounce it correctly Feather feather feather Both laughed By Jove she s very jolly thought Sokolsky Susanna put the portfolio on a chair took a step towards the lieutenant and bringing her face close to his went on gaily Next to the Jews I love no people so much as the Russian and the French I did not do much at school and I know no history but it seems to me that the fate of the world lies in the hands of those two nations I lived a long time abroad I spent six months in Madrid I ve gazed my fill at the public and the conclusion I ve come to is that there are no decent peoples except the Russian and the French Take the languages for instance The German language is like the neighing of horses as for the English you can t imagine anything stupider Fight feet foot Italian is only pleasant when they speak it slowly If you listen to Italians gabbling you get the effect of the Jewish jargon And the Poles Mercy on us There s no language so disgusting Nie pieprz Pietrze pieprzem wieprza bo mozeoz przepieprzye wieprza pieprzem That means Don t pepper a sucking pig with pepper Pyotr or perhaps you ll over pepper the sucking pig with pepper Ha ha ha Susanna Moiseyevna rolled her eyes and broke into such a pleasant infectious laugh that the lieutenant looking at her went off into a loud and merry peal of laughter She took the visitor by the button and went on You don t like Jews of course they ve many faults like all nations I don t dispute that But are the Jews to blame for it No it s not the Jews who are to blame but the Jewish women They are narrow minded greedy there s no sort of poetry about them they re dull You have never lived with a Jewess so you don t know how charming it is Susanna Moiseyevna pronounced the last words with deliberate emphasis and with no eagerness or laughter She paused as though frightened at her own openness and her face was suddenly distorted in a strange unaccountable way Her eyes stared at the lieutenant without blinking her lips parted and showed clenched teeth Her whole face her throat and even her bosom seemed quivering with a spiteful catlike expression Still keeping her eyes fixed on her visitor she rapidly bent to one side and swiftly like a cat snatched something from the table All this was the work of a few seconds Watching her movements the lieutenant saw five fingers crumple up his IOUs and caught a glimpse of the white rustling paper as it disappeared in her clenched fist Such an extraordinary transition from good natured laughter to crime so appalled him that he turned pale and stepped back And she still keeping her frightened searching eyes upon him felt along her hip with her clenched fist for her pocket Her fist struggled convulsively for the pocket like a fish in the net and could not find the opening In another moment the IOUs would have vanished in the recesses of her feminine garments but at that point the lieutenant uttered a faint cry and moved more by instinct than reflection seized the Jewess by her arm above the clenched fist Showing her teeth more than ever she struggled with all her might and pulled her hand away Then Sokolsky put his right arm firmly round her waist and the other round her chest and a struggle followed Afraid of outraging her sex or hurting her he tried only to prevent her moving and to get hold of the fist with the IOUs but she wriggled like an eel in his arms with her supple flexible body struck him in the chest with her elbows and scratched him so that he could not help touching her all over and was forced to hurt her and disregard her modesty How unusual this is How strange he thought utterly amazed hardly able to believe his senses and feeling rather sick from the scent of jasmine In silence breathing heavily stumbling against the furniture they moved about the room Susanna was carried away by the struggle She flushed closed her eyes and forgetting herself once even pressed her face against the face of the lieutenant so that there was a sweetish taste left on his lips At last he caught hold of her clenched hand Forcing it open and not finding the papers in it he let go the Jewess With flushed faces and dishevelled hair they looked at one another breathing hard The spiteful catlike expression on the Jewess s face was gradually replaced by a good natured smile She burst out laughing and turning on one foot went towards the room where lunch was ready The lieutenant moved slowly after her She sat down to the table and still flushed and breathing hard tossed off half a glass of port Listen the lieutenant broke the silence I hope you are joking Not a bit of it she answered thrusting a piece of bread into her mouth H m How do you wish me to take all this As you choose Sit down and have lunch But it s dishonest Perhaps But don t trouble to give me a sermon I have my own way of looking at things Won t you give them back Of course not If you were a poor unfortunate man with nothing to eat then it would be a different matter But he wants to get married It s not my money you know it s my cousin s And what does your cousin want with money To get fashionable clothes for his wife But I really don t care whether your belle soeur has dresses or not The lieutenant had ceased to remember that he was in a strange house with an unknown lady and did not trouble himself with decorum He strode up and down the room scowled and nervously fingered his waistcoat The fact that the Jewess had lowered herself in his eyes by her dishonest action made him feel bolder and more free and easy The devil knows what to make of it he muttered Listen I shan t go away from here until I get the IOUs Ah so much the better laughed Susanna If you stay here for good it will make it livelier for me Excited by the struggle the lieutenant looked at Susanna s laughing insolent face at her munching mouth at her heaving bosom and grew bolder and more audacious Instead of thinking about the IOU he began for some reason recalling with a sort of relish his cousin s stories of the Jewess s romantic adventures of her free way of life and these reminiscences only provoked him to greater audacity Impulsively he sat down beside the Jewess and thinking no more of the IOUs began to eat Will you have vodka or wine Susanna asked with a laugh So you will stay till you get the IOUs Poor fellow How many days and nights you will have to spend with me waiting for those IOUs Won t your fiancee have something to say about it II Five hours had passed The lieutenant s cousin Alexey Ivanovitch Kryukov was walking about the rooms of his country house in his dressing gown and slippers and looking impatiently out of window He was a tall sturdy man with a large black beard and a manly face and as the Jewess had truly said he was handsome though he had reached the age when men are apt to grow too stout puffy and bald By mind and temperament he was one of those natures in which the Russian intellectual classes are so rich warm hearted good natured well bred having some knowledge of the arts and sciences some faith and the most chivalrous notions about honour but indolent and lacking in depth He was fond of good eating and drinking was an ideal whist player was a connoisseur in women and horses but in other things he was apathetic and sluggish as a seal and to rouse him from his lethargy something extraordinary and quite revolting was needed and then he would forget everything in the world and display intense activity he would fume and talk of a duel write a petition of seven pages to a Minister gallop at breakneck speed about the district call some one publicly a scoundrel would go to law and so on How is it our Sasha s not back yet he kept asking his wife glancing out of window Why it s dinner time After waiting for the lieutenant till six o clock they sat down to dinner When supper time came however Alexey Ivanovitch was listening to every footstep to every sound of the door and kept shrugging his shoulders Strange he said The rascally dandy must have stayed on at the tenant s As he went to bed after supper Kryukov made up his mind that the lieutenant was being entertained at the tenant s where after a festive evening he was staying the night Alexandr Grigoryevitch only returned next morning He looked extremely crumpled and confused I want to speak to you alone he said mysteriously to his cousin They went into the study The lieutenant shut the door and he paced for a long time up and down before he began to speak Something s happened my dear fellow he began that I don t know how to tell you about You wouldn t believe it And blushing faltering not looking at his cousin he told what had happened with the IOUs Kryukov standing with his feet wide apart and his head bent listened and frowned Are you joking he asked How the devil could I be joking It s no joking matter I don t understand muttered Kryukov turning crimson and flinging up his hands It s positively immoral on your part Before your very eyes a hussy is up to the devil knows what a serious crime plays a nasty trick and you go and kiss her But I can t understand myself how it happened whispered the lieutenant blinking guiltily Upon my honour I don t understand it It s the first time in my life I ve come across such a monster It s not her beauty that does for you not her mind but that you understand insolence cynicism Insolence cynicism it s unclean If you ve such a longing for insolence and cynicism you might have picked a sow out of the mire and have devoured her alive It would have been cheaper anyway Instead of two thousand three hundred You do express yourself elegantly said the lieutenant frowning I ll pay you back the two thousand three hundred I know you ll pay it back but it s not a question of money Damn the money What revolts me is your being such a limp rag such filthy feebleness And engaged With a fiancee Don t speak of it said the lieutenant blushing I loathe myself as it is I should like to sink into the earth It s sickening and vexatious that I shall have to bother my aunt for that five thousand Kryukov continued for some time longer expressing his indignation and grumbling then as he grew calmer he sat down on the sofa and began to jeer at his cousin You young officers he said with contemptuous irony Nice bridegrooms Suddenly he leapt up as though he had been stung stamped his foot and ran about the study No I m not going to leave it like that he said shaking his fist I will have those IOUs I will I ll give it her One doesn t beat women but I ll break every bone in her body I ll pound her to a jelly I m not a lieutenant You won t touch me with insolence or cynicism No o o damn her Mishka he shouted run and tell them to get the racing droshky out for me Kryukov dressed rapidly and without heeding the agitated lieutenant got into the droshky and with a wave of his hand resolutely raced off to Susanna Moiseyevna For a long time the lieutenant gazed out of window at the clouds of dust that rolled after his cousin s droshky stretched yawned and went to his own room A quarter of an hour later he was sound asleep At six o clock he was waked up and summoned to dinner How nice this is of Alexey his cousin s wife greeted him in the dining room He keeps us waiting for dinner Do you mean to say he s not come back yet yawned the lieutenant H m he s probably gone round to see the tenant But Alexey Ivanovitch was not back by supper either His wife and Sokolsky decided that he was playing cards at the tenant s and would most likely stay the night there What had happened was not what they had supposed however Kryukov returned next morning and without greeting any one without a word dashed into his study Well whispered the lieutenant gazing at him round eyed Kryukov waved his hand and gave a snort Why what s the matter What are you laughing at Kryukov flopped on the sofa thrust his head in the pillow and shook with suppressed laughter A minute later he got up and looking at the surprised lieutenant with his eyes full of tears from laughing said Close the door Well she is a fe e male I beg to inform you Did you get the IOUs Kryukov waved his hand and went off into a peal of laughter again Well she is a female he went on Merci for the acquaintance my boy She s a devil in petticoats I arrived I walked in like such an avenging Jove you know that I felt almost afraid of myself I frowned I scowled even clenched my fists to be more awe inspiring Jokes don t pay with me madam said I and more in that style And I threatened her with the law and with the Governor To begin with she burst into tears said she d been joking with you and even took me to the cupboard to give me the money Then she began arguing that the future of Europe lies in the hands of the French and the Russians swore at women Like you I listened fascinated ass that I was She kept singing the praises of my beauty patted me on the arm near the shoulder to see how strong I was and and as you see I ve only just got away from her Ha ha She s enthusiastic about you You re a nice fellow laughed the lieutenant A married man highly respected Well aren t you ashamed Disgusted Joking apart though old man you ve got your Queen Tamara in your own neighbourhood In my own neighbourhood Why you wouldn t find another such chameleon in the whole of Russia I ve never seen anything like it in my life though I know a good bit about women too I have known regular devils in my time but I never met anything like this It is as you say by insolence and cynicism she gets over you What is so attractive in her is the diabolical suddenness the quick transitions the swift shifting hues Brrr And the IOU phew Write it off for lost We are both great sinners we ll go halves in our sin I shall put down to you not two thousand three hundred but half of it Mind tell my wife I was at the tenant s Kryukov and the lieutenant buried their heads in the pillows and broke into laughter they raised their heads glanced at one another and again subsided into their pillows Engaged A lieutenant Kryukov jeered Married retorted Sokolsky Highly respected Father of a family At dinner they talked in veiled allusions winked at one another and to the surprise of the others were continually gushing with laughter into their dinner napkins After dinner still in the best of spirits they dressed up as Turks and running after one another with guns played at soldiers with the children In the evening they had a long argument The lieutenant maintained that it was mean and contemptible to accept a dowry with your wife even when there was passionate love on both sides Kryukov thumped the table with his fists and declared that this was absurd and that a husband who did not like his wife to have property of her own was an egoist and a despot Both shouted boiled over did not understand each other drank a good deal and in the end picking up the skirts of their dressing gowns went to their bedrooms They soon fell asleep and slept soundly Life went on as before even sluggish and free from sorrow The shadows lay on the earth thunder pealed from the clouds from time to time the wind moaned plaintively as though to prove that nature too could lament but nothing troubled the habitual tranquillity of these people Of Susanna Moiseyevna and the IOUs they said nothing Both of them felt somehow ashamed to speak of the incident aloud Yet they remembered it and thought of it with pleasure as of a curious farce which life had unexpectedly and casually played upon them and which it would be pleasant to recall in old age On the sixth or seventh day after his visit to the Jewess Kryukov was sitting in his study in the morning writing a congratulatory letter to his aunt Alexandr Grigoryevitch was walking to and fro near the table in silence The lieutenant had slept badly that night he woke up depressed and now he felt bored He paced up and down thinking of the end of his furlough of his fiancee who was expecting him of how people could live all their lives in the country without feeling bored Standing at the window for a long time he stared at the trees smoked three cigarettes one after another and suddenly turned to his cousin I have a favour to ask you Alyosha he said Let me have a saddle horse for the day Kryukov looked searchingly at him and continued his writing with a frown You will then asked the lieutenant Kryukov looked at him again then deliberately drew out a drawer in the table and taking out a thick roll of notes gave it to his cousin Here s five thousand he said Though it s not my money yet God bless you it s all the same I advise you to send for post horses at once and go away Yes really The lieutenant in his turn looked searchingly at Kryukov and laughed You ve guessed right Alyosha he said reddening It was to her I meant to ride Yesterday evening when the washerwoman gave me that damned tunic the one I was wearing then and it smelt of jasmine why I felt I must go You must go away Yes certainly And my furlough s just over I really will go to day Yes by Jove However long one stays one has to go in the end I m going The post horses were brought after dinner the same day the lieutenant said good bye to the Kryukovs and set off followed by their good wishes Another week passed It was a dull but hot and heavy day From early morning Kryukov walked aimlessly about the house looking out of window or turning over the leaves of albums though he was sick of the sight of them already When he came across his wife or children he began grumbling crossly It seemed to him for some reason that day that his children s manners were revolting that his wife did not know how to look after the servants that their expenditure was quite disproportionate to their income All this meant that the master was out of humour After dinner Kryukov feeling dissatisfied with the soup and the roast meat he had eaten ordered out his racing droshky He drove slowly out of the courtyard drove at a walking pace for a quarter of a mile and stopped Shall I drive to her that devil he thought looking at the leaden sky And Kryukov positively laughed as though it were the first time that day he had asked himself that question At once the load of boredom was lifted from his heart and there rose a gleam of pleasure in his lazy eyes He lashed the horse All the way his imagination was picturing how surprised the Jewess would be to see him how he would laugh and chat and come home feeling refreshed Once a month one needs something to brighten one up something out of the common round he thought something that would give the stagnant organism a good shaking up a reaction whether it s a drinking bout or Susanna One can t get on without it It was getting dark when he drove into the yard of the vodka distillery From the open windows of the owner s house came sounds of laughter and singing Brighter than lightning more burning than flame sang a powerful mellow bass voice Aha she has visitors thought Kryukov And he was annoyed that she had visitors Shall I go back he thought with his hand on the bell but he rang all the same and went up the familiar staircase From the entry he glanced into the reception hall There were about five men there all landowners and officials of his acquaintance one a tall thin gentleman was sitting at the piano singing and striking the keys with his long thin fingers The others were listening and grinning with enjoyment Kryukov looked himself up and down in the looking glass and was about to go into the hall when Susanna Moiseyevna herself darted into the entry in high spirits and wearing the same black dress Seeing Kryukov she was petrified for an instant then she uttered a little scream and beamed with delight Is it you she said clutching his hand What a surprise Here she is smiled Kryukov putting his arm round her waist Well Does the destiny of Europe still lie in the hands of the French and the Russians I m so glad laughed the Jewess cautiously removing his arm Come go into the hall they re all friends there I ll go and tell them to bring you some tea Your name s Alexey isn t it Well go in I ll come directly She blew him a kiss and ran out of the entry leaving behind her the same sickly smell of jasmine Kryukov raised his head and walked into the hall He was on terms of friendly intimacy with all the men in the room but scarcely nodded to them they too scarcely responded as though the places in which they met were not quite decent and as though they were in tacit agreement with one another that it was more suitable for them not to recognise one another From the hall Kryukov walked into the drawing room and from it into a second drawing room On the way he met three or four other guests also men whom he knew though they barely recognised him Their faces were flushed with drink and merriment Alexey Ivanovitch glanced furtively at them and marvelled that these men respectable heads of families who had known sorrow and privation could demean themselves to such pitiful cheap gaiety He shrugged his shoulders smiled and walked on There are places he reflected where a sober man feels sick and a drunken man rejoices I remember I never could go to the operetta or the gipsies when I was sober wine makes a man more good natured and reconciles him with vice Suddenly he stood still petrified and caught hold of the door post with both hands At the writing table in Susanna s study was sitting Lieutenant Alexandr Grigoryevitch He was discussing something in an undertone with a fat flabby looking Jew and seeing his cousin flushed crimson and looked down at an album The sense of decency was stirred in Kryukov and the blood rushed to his head Overwhelmed with amazement shame and anger he walked up to the table without a word Sokolsky s head sank lower than ever His face worked with an expression of agonising shame Ah it s you Alyosha he articulated making a desperate effort to raise his eyes and to smile I called here to say good bye and as you see But to morrow I am certainly going What can I say to him What thought Alexey Ivanovitch How can I judge him since I m here myself And clearing his throat without uttering a word he went out slowly Call her not heavenly and leave her on earth The bass was singing in the hall A little while after Kryukov s racing droshky was bumping along the dusty road NEIGHBOURS PYOTR MIHALITCH IVASHIN was very much out of humour his sister a young girl had gone away to live with Vlassitch a married man To shake off the despondency and depression which pursued him at home and in the fields he called to his aid his sense of justice his genuine and noble ideas he had always defended free love but this was of no avail and he always came back to the same conclusion as their foolish old nurse that his sister had acted wrongly and that Vlassitch had abducted his sister And that was distressing His mother did not leave her room all day long the old nurse kept sighing and speaking in whispers his aunt had been on the point of taking her departure every day and her trunks were continually being brought down to the hall and carried up again to her room In the house in the yard and in the garden it was as still as though there were some one dead in the house His aunt the servants and even the peasants so it seemed to Pyotr Mihalitch looked at him enigmatically and with perplexity as though they wanted to say Your sister has been seduced why are you doing nothing And he reproached himself for inactivity though he did not know precisely what action he ought to have taken So passed six days On the seventh it was Sunday afternoon a messenger on horseback brought a letter The address was in a familiar feminine handwriting Her Excy Anna Nikolaevna Ivashin Pyotr Mihalitch fancied that there was something defiant provocative in the handwriting and in the abbreviation Excy And advanced ideas in women are obstinate ruthless cruel She d rather die than make any concession to her unhappy mother or beg her forgiveness thought Pyotr Mihalitch as he went to his mother with the letter His mother was lying on her bed dressed Seeing her son she rose impulsively and straightening her grey hair which had fallen from under her cap asked quickly What is it What is it This has come said her son giving her the letter Zina s name and even the pronoun she was not uttered in the house Zina was spoken of impersonally this has come Gone away and so on The mother recognised her daughter s handwriting and her face grew ugly and unpleasant and her grey hair escaped again from her cap No she said with a motion of her hands as though the letter scorched her fingers No no never Nothing would induce me The mother broke into hysterical sobs of grief and shame she evidently longed to read the letter but her pride prevented her Pyotr Mihalitch realised that he ought to open the letter himself and read it aloud but he was overcome by anger such as he had never felt before he ran out into the yard and shouted to the messenger Say there will be no answer There will be no answer Tell them that you beast And he tore up the letter then tears came into his eyes and feeling that he was cruel miserable and to blame he went out into the fields He was only twenty seven but he was already stout He dressed like an old man in loose roomy clothes and suffered from asthma He already seemed to be developing the characteristics of an elderly country bachelor He never fell in love never thought of marriage and loved no one but his mother his sister his old nurse and the gardener Vassilitch He was fond of good fare of his nap after dinner and of talking about politics and exalted subjects He had in his day taken his degree at the university but he now looked upon his studies as though in them he had discharged a duty incumbent upon young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty five at any rate the ideas which now strayed every day through his mind had nothing in common with the university or the subjects he had studied there In the fields it was hot and still as though rain were coming It was steaming in the wood and there was a heavy fragrant scent from the pines and rotting leaves Pyotr Mihalitch stopped several times and wiped his wet brow He looked at his winter corn and his spring oats walked round the clover field and twice drove away a partridge with its chicks which had strayed in from the wood And all the while he was thinking that this insufferable state of things could not go on for ever and that he must end it one way or another End it stupidly madly but he must end it But how What can I do he asked himself and looked imploringly at the sky and at the trees as though begging for their help But the sky and the trees were mute His noble ideas were no help and his common sense whispered that the agonising question could have no solution but a stupid one and that to day s scene with the messenger was not the last one of its kind It was terrible to think what was in store for him As he returned home the sun was setting By now it seemed to him that the problem was incapable of solution He could not accept the accomplished fact and he could not refuse to accept it and there was no intermediate course When taking off his hat and fanning himself with his handkerchief he was walking along the road and had only another mile and a half to go before he would reach home he heard bells behind him It was a very choice and successful combination of bells which gave a clear crystal note No one had such bells on his horses but the police captain Medovsky formerly an officer in the hussars a man in broken down health who had been a great rake and spendthrift and was a distant relation of Pyotr Mihalitch He was like one of the family at the Ivashins and had a tender fatherly affection for Zina as well as a great admiration for her I was coming to see you he said overtaking Pyotr Mihalitch Get in I ll give you a lift He was smiling and looked cheerful Evidently he did not yet know that Zina had gone to live with Vlassitch perhaps he had been told of it already but did not believe it Pyotr Mihalitch felt in a difficult position You are very welcome he muttered blushing till the tears came into his eyes and not knowing how to lie or what to say I am delighted he went on trying to smile but Zina is away and mother is ill How annoying said the police captain looking pensively at Pyotr Mihalitch And I was meaning to spend the evening with you Where has Zinaida Mihalovna gone To the Sinitskys and I believe she meant to go from there to the monastery I don t quite know The police captain talked a little longer and then turned back Pyotr Mihalitch walked home and thought with horror what the police captain s feelings would be when he learned the truth And Pyotr Mihalitch imagined his feelings and actually experiencing them himself went into the house Lord help us he thought Lord help us At evening tea the only one at the table was his aunt As usual her face wore the expression that seemed to say that though she was a weak defenceless woman she would allow no one to insult her Pyotr Mihalitch sat down at the other end of the table he did not like his aunt and began drinking tea in silence Your mother has had no dinner again to day said his aunt You ought to do something about it Petrusha Starving oneself is no help in sorrow It struck Pyotr Mihalitch as absurd that his aunt should meddle in other people s business and should make her departure depend on Zina s having gone away He was tempted to say something rude to her but restrained himself And as he restrained himself he felt the time had come for action and that he could not bear it any longer Either he must act at once or fall on the ground and scream and bang his head upon the floor He pictured Vlassitch and Zina both of them progressive and self satisfied kissing each other somewhere under a maple tree and all the anger and bitterness that had been accumulating in him for the last seven days fastened upon Vlassitch One has seduced and abducted my sister he thought another will come and murder my mother a third will set fire to the house and sack the place And all this under the mask of friendship lofty ideas unhappiness No it shall not be Pyotr Mihalitch cried suddenly and he brought his fist down on the table He jumped up and ran out of the dining room In the stable the steward s horse was standing ready saddled He got on it and galloped off to Vlassitch There was a perfect tempest within him He felt a longing to do something extraordinary startling even if he had to repent of it all his life afterwards Should he call Vlassitch a blackguard slap him in the face and then challenge him to a duel But Vlassitch was not one of those men who do fight duels being called a blackguard and slapped in the face would only make him more unhappy and would make him shrink into himself more than ever These unhappy defenceless people are the most insufferable the most tiresome creatures in the world They can do anything with impunity When the luckless man responds to well deserved reproach by looking at you with eyes full of deep and guilty feeling and with a sickly smile bends his head submissively even justice itself could not lift its hand against him No matter I ll horsewhip him before her eyes and tell him what I think of him Pyotr Mihalitch decided He was riding through his wood and waste land and he imagined Zina would try to justify her conduct by talking about the rights of women and individual freedom and about there being no difference between legal marriage and free union Like a woman she would argue about what she did not understand And very likely at the end she would ask How do you come in What right have you to interfere No I have no right muttered Pyotr Mihalitch But so much the better The harsher I am the less right I have to interfere the better It was sultry Clouds of gnats hung over the ground and in the waste places the peewits called plaintively Everything betokened rain but he could not see a cloud in the sky Pyotr Mihalitch crossed the boundary of his estate and galloped over a smooth level field He often went along this road and knew every bush every hollow in it What now in the far distance looked in the dusk like a dark cliff was a red church he could picture it all down to the smallest detail even the plaster on the gate and the calves that were always grazing in the church enclosure Three quarters of a mile to the right of the church there was a copse like a dark blur it was Count Koltonovitch s And beyond the church Vlassitch s estate began From behind the church and the count s copse a huge black storm cloud was rising and there were ashes of white lightning Here it is thought Pyotr Mihalitch Lord help us Lord help us The horse was soon tired after its quick gallop and Pyotr Mihalitch was tired too The storm cloud looked at him angrily and seemed to advise him to go home He felt a little scared I will prove to them they are wrong he tried to reassure himself They will say that it is free love individual freedom but freedom means self control and not subjection to passion It s not liberty but license He reached the count s big pond it looked dark blue and frowning under the cloud and a smell of damp and slime rose from it Near the dam two willows one old and one young drooped tenderly towards one another Pyotr Mihalitch and Vlassitch had been walking near this very spot only a fortnight before humming a students song Youth is wasted life is nought when the heart is cold and loveless A wretched song It was thundering as Pyotr Mihalitch rode through the copse and the trees were bending and rustling in the wind He had to make haste It was only three quarters of a mile through a meadow from the copse to Vlassitch s house Here there were old birch trees on each side of the road They had the same melancholy and unhappy air as their owner Vlassitch and looked as tall and lanky as he Big drops of rain pattered on the birches and on the grass the wind had suddenly dropped and there was a smell of wet earth and poplars Before him he saw Vlassitch s fence with a row of yellow acacias which were tall and lanky too where the fence was broken he could see the neglected orchard Pyotr Mihalitch was not thinking now of the horsewhip or of a slap in the face and did not know what he would do at Vlassitch s He felt nervous He felt frightened on his own account and on his sister s and was terrified at the thought of seeing her How would she behave with her brother What would they both talk about And had he not better go back before it was too late As he made these reflections he galloped up the avenue of lime trees to the house rode round the big clumps of lilacs and suddenly saw Vlassitch Vlassitch wearing a cotton shirt and top boots bending forward with no hat on in the rain was coming from the corner of the house to the front door He was followed by a workman with a hammer and a box of nails They must have been mending a shutter which had been banging in the wind Seeing Pyotr Mihalitch Vlassitch stopped It s you he said smiling That s nice Yes I ve come as you see said Pyotr Mihalitch brushing the rain off himself with both hands Well that s capital I m very glad said Vlassitch but he did not hold out his hand evidently he did not venture but waited for Pyotr Mihalitch to hold out his It will do the oats good he said looking at the sky Yes They went into the house in silence To the right of the hall was a door leading to another hall and then to the drawing room and on the left was a little room which in winter was used by the steward Pyotr Mihalitch and Vlassitch went into this little room Where were you caught in the rain Not far off quite close to the house Pyotr Mihalitch sat down on the bed He was glad of the noise of the rain and the darkness of the room It was better it made it less dreadful and there was no need to see his companion s face There was no anger in his heart now nothing but fear and vexation with himself He felt he had made a bad beginning and that nothing would come of this visit Both were silent for some time and affected to be listening to the rain Thank you Petrusha Vlassitch began clearing his throat I am very grateful to you for coming It s generous and noble of you I understand it and believe me I appreciate it Believe me He looked out of the window and went on standing in the middle of the room Everything happened so secretly as though we were concealing it all from you The feeling that you might be wounded and angry has been a blot on our happiness all these days But let me justify myself We kept it secret not because we did not trust you To begin with it all happened suddenly by a kind of inspiration there was no time to discuss it Besides it s such a private delicate matter and it was awkward to bring a third person in even some one as intimate as you Above all in all this we reckoned on your generosity You are a very noble and generous person I am infinitely grateful to you If you ever need my life come and take it Vlassitch talked in a quiet hollow bass always on the same droning note he was evidently agitated Pyotr Mihalitch felt it was his turn to speak and that to listen and keep silent would really mean playing the part of a generous and noble simpleton and that had not been his idea in coming He got up quickly and said breathlessly in an undertone Listen Grigory You know I liked you and could have desired no better husband for my sister but what has happened is awful It s terrible to think of it Why is it terrible asked Vlassitch with a quiver in his voice It would be terrible if we had done wrong but that isn t so Listen Grigory You know I have no prejudices but excuse my frankness to my mind you have both acted selfishly Of course I shan t say so to my sister it will distress her but you ought to know mother is miserable beyond all description Yes that s sad sighed Vlassitch We foresaw that Petrusha but what could we have done Because one s actions hurt other people it doesn t prove that they are wrong What s to be done Every important step one takes is bound to distress somebody If you went to fight for freedom that would distress your mother too What s to be done Any one who puts the peace of his family before everything has to renounce the life of ideas completely There was a vivid flash of lightning at the window and the lightning seemed to change the course of Vlassitch s thoughts He sat down beside Pyotr Mihalitch and began saying what was utterly beside the point I have such a reverence for your sister Petrusha he said When I used to come and see you I felt as though I were going to a holy shrine and I really did worship Zina Now my reverence for her grows every day For me she is something higher than a wife yes higher Vlassitch waved his hands She is my holy of holies Since she is living with me I enter my house as though it were a temple She is an extraordinary rare most noble woman Well he s off now thought Pyotr Mihalitch he disliked the word woman Why shouldn t you be married properly he asked How much does your wife want for a divorce Seventy five thousand It s rather a lot But if we were to negotiate with her She won t take a farthing less She is an awful woman brother sighed Vlassitch I ve never talked to you about her before it was unpleasant to think of her but now that the subject has come up I ll tell you about her I married her on the impulse of the moment a fine honourable impulse An officer in command of a battalion of our regiment if you care to hear the details had an affair with a girl of eighteen that is to put it plainly he seduced her lived with her for two months and abandoned her She was in an awful position brother She was ashamed to go home to her parents besides they wouldn t have received her Her lover had abandoned her there was nothing left for her but to go to the barracks and sell herself The other officers in the regiment were indignant They were by no means saints themselves but the baseness of it was so striking Besides no one in the regiment could endure the man And to spite him you understand the indignant lieutenants and ensigns began getting up a subscription for the unfortunate girl And when we subalterns met together and began to subscribe five or ten roubles each I had a sudden inspiration I felt it was an opportunity to do something fine I hastened to the girl and warmly expressed my sympathy And while I was on my way to her and while I was talking to her I loved her fervently as a woman insulted and injured Yes Well a week later I made her an offer The colonel and my comrades thought my marriage out of keeping with the dignity of an officer That roused me more than ever I wrote a long letter do you know in which I proved that my action ought to be inscribed in the annals of the regiment in letters of gold and so on I sent the letter to my colonel and copies to my comrades Well I was excited and of course I could not avoid being rude I was asked to leave the regiment I have a rough copy of it put away somewhere I ll give it to you to read sometime It was written with great feeling You will see what lofty and noble sentiments I was experiencing I resigned my commission and came here with my wife My father had left a few debts I had no money and from the first day my wife began making acquaintances dressing herself smartly and playing cards and I was obliged to mortgage the estate She led a bad life you understand and you are the only one of the neighbours who hasn t been her lover After two years I gave her all I had to set me free and she went off to town Yes And now I pay her twelve hundred roubles a year She is an awful woman There is a fly brother which lays an egg in the back of a spider so that the spider can t shake it off the grub fastens upon the spider and drinks its heart s blood That was how this woman fastened upon me and sucks the blood of my heart She hates and despises me for being so stupid that is for marrying a woman like her My chivalry seems to her despicable A wise man cast me off she says and a fool picked me up To her thinking no one but a pitiful idiot could have behaved as I did And that is insufferably bitter to me brother Altogether I may say in parenthesis fate has been hard upon me very hard Pyotr Mihalitch listened to Vlassitch and wondered in perplexity what it was in this man that had so charmed his sister He was not young he was forty one lean and lanky narrow chested with a long nose and grey hairs in his beard He talked in a droning voice had a sickly smile and waved his hands awkwardly as he talked He had neither health nor pleasant manly manners nor savoir faire nor gaiety and in all his exterior there was something colourless and indefinite He dressed without taste his surroundings were depressing he did not care for poetry or painting because they have no answer to give to the questions of the day that is he did not understand them music did not touch him He was a poor farmer His estate was in a wretched condition and was mortgaged he was paying twelve percent on the second mortgage and owed ten thousand on personal securities as well When the time came to pay the interest on the mortgage or to send money to his wife he asked every one to lend him money with as much agitation as though his house were on fire and at the same time losing his head he would sell the whole of his winter store of fuel for five roubles and a stack of straw for three roubles and then have his garden fence or old cucumber frames chopped up to heat his stoves His meadows were ruined by pigs the peasants cattle strayed in the undergrowth in his woods and every year the old trees were fewer and fewer beehives and rusty pails lay about in his garden and kitchen garden He had neither talents nor abilities nor even ordinary capacity for living like other people In practical life he was a weak naive man easy to deceive and to cheat and the peasants with good reason called him simple He was a Liberal and in the district was regarded as a Red but even his progressiveness was a bore There was no originality nor moving power about his independent views he was revolted indignant and delighted always on the same note it was always spiritless and ineffective Even in moments of strong enthusiasm he never raised his head or stood upright But the most tiresome thing of all was that he managed to express even his best and finest ideas so that they seemed in him commonplace and out of date It reminded one of something old one had read long ago when slowly and with an air of profundity he would begin discoursing of his noble lofty moments of his best years or when he went into raptures over the younger generation which has always been and still is in advance of society or abused Russians for donning their dressing gowns at thirty and forgetting the principles of their alma mater If you stayed the night with him he would put Pissarev or Darwin on your bedroom table if you said you had read it he would go and bring Dobrolubov In the district this was called free thinking and many people looked upon this free thinking as an innocent and harmless eccentricity it made him profoundly unhappy however It was for him the maggot of which he had just been speaking it had fastened upon him and was sucking his life blood In his past there had been the strange marriage in the style of Dostoevsky long letters and copies written in a bad unintelligible hand writing but with great feeling endless misunderstandings explanations disappointments then debts a second mortgage the allowance to his wife the monthly borrowing of money and all this for no benefit to any one either himself or others And in the present as in the past he was still in a nervous flurry on the lookout for heroic actions and poking his nose into other people s affairs as before at every favourable opportunity there were long letters and copies wearisome stereotyped conversations about the village community or the revival of handicrafts or the establishment of cheese factories conversations as like one another as though he had prepared them not in his living brain but by some mechanical process And finally this scandal with Zina of which one could not see the end And meanwhile Zina was young she was only twenty two good looking elegant gay she was fond of laughing chatter argument a passionate musician she had good taste in dress in furniture in books and in her own home she would not have put up with a room like this smelling of boots and cheap vodka She too had advanced ideas but in her free thinking one felt the overflow of energy the vanity of a young strong spirited girl passionately eager to be better and more original than others How had it happened that she had fallen in love with Vlassitch He is a Quixote an obstinate fanatic a maniac thought Pyotr Mihalitch and she is as soft yielding and weak in character as I am She and I give in easily without resistance She loves him but then I too love him in spite of everything Pyotr Mihalitch considered Vlassitch a good straightforward man but narrow and one sided In his perturbations and his sufferings and in fact in his whole life he saw no lofty aims remote or immediate he saw nothing but boredom and incapacity for life His self sacrifice and all that Vlassitch himself called heroic actions or noble impulses seemed to him a useless waste of force unnecessary blank shots which consumed a great deal of powder And Vlassitch s fanatical belief in the extraordinary loftiness and faultlessness of his own way of thinking struck him as naive and even morbid and the fact that Vlassitch all his life had contrived to mix the trivial with the exalted that he had made a stupid marriage and looked upon it as an act of heroism and then had affairs with other women and regarded that as a triumph of some idea or other was simply incomprehensible Nevertheless Pyotr Mihalitch was fond of Vlassitch he was conscious of a sort of power in him and for some reason he had never had the heart to contradict him Vlassitch sat down quite close to him for a talk in the dark to the accompaniment of the rain and he had cleared his throat as a prelude to beginning on something lengthy such as the history of his marriage But it was intolerable for Pyotr Mihalitch to listen to him he was tormented by the thought that he would see his sister directly Yes you ve had bad luck he said gently but excuse me we ve been wandering from the point That s not what we are talking about Yes yes quite so Well let us come back to the point said Vlassitch and he stood up I tell you Petrusha our conscience is clear We are not married but there is no need for me to prove to you that our marriage is perfectly legitimate You are as free in your ideas as I am and happily there can be no disagreement between us on that point As for our future that ought not to alarm you I ll work in the sweat of my brow I ll work day and night in fact I will strain every nerve to make Zina happy Her life will be a splendid one You may ask am I able to do it I am brother When a man devotes every minute to one thought it s not difficult for him to attain his object But let us go to Zina it will be a joy to her to see you Pyotr Mihalitch s heart began to beat He got up and followed Vlassitch into the hall and from there into the drawing room There was nothing in the huge gloomy room but a piano and a long row of old chairs ornamented with bronze on which no one ever sat There was a candle alight on the piano From the drawing room they went in silence into the dining room This room too was large and comfortless in the middle of the room there was a round table with two leaves with six thick legs and only one candle A clock in a large mahogany case like an ikon stand pointed to half past two Vlassitch opened the door into the next room and said Zina here is Petrusha come to see us At once there was the sound of hurried footsteps and Zina came into the dining room She was tall plump and very pale and just as when he had seen her for the last time at home she was wearing a black skirt and a red blouse with a large buckle on her belt She flung one arm round her brother and kissed him on the temple What a storm she said Grigory went off somewhere and I was left quite alone in the house She was not embarrassed and looked at her brother as frankly and candidly as at home looking at her Pyotr Mihalitch too lost his embarrassment But you are not afraid of storms he said sitting down at the table No she said but here the rooms are so big the house is so old and when there is thunder it all rattles like a cupboard full of crockery It s a charming house altogether she went on sitting down opposite her brother There s some pleasant memory in every room In my room only fancy Grigory s grandfather shot himself In August we shall have the money to do up the lodge in the garden said Vlassitch For some reason when it thunders I think of that grandfather Zina went on And in this dining room somebody was flogged to death That s an actual fact said Vlassitch and he looked with wide open eyes at Pyotr Mihalitch Sometime in the forties this place was let to a Frenchman called Olivier The portrait of his daughter is lying in an attic now a very pretty girl This Olivier so my father told me despised Russians for their ignorance and treated them with cruel derision Thus for instance he insisted on the priest walking without his hat for half a mile round his house and on the church bells being rung when the Olivier family drove through the village The serfs and altogether the humble of this world of course he treated with even less ceremony Once there came along this road one of the simple hearted sons of wandering Russia somewhat after the style of Gogol s divinity student Homa Brut He asked for a night s lodging pleased the bailiffs and was given a job at the office of the estate There are many variations of the story Some say the divinity student stirred up the peasants others that Olivier s daughter fell in love with him I don t know which is true only one fine evening Olivier called him in here and cross examined him then ordered him to be beaten Do you know he sat here at this table drinking claret while the stable boys beat the man He must have tried to wring something out of him Towards morning the divinity student died of the torture and his body was hidden They say it was thrown into Koltovitch s pond There was an inquiry but the Frenchman paid some thousands to some one in authority and went away to Alsace His lease was up just then and so the matter ended What scoundrels said Zina shuddering My father remembered Olivier and his daughter well He used to say she was remarkably beautiful and eccentric I imagine the divinity student had done both stirred up the peasants and won the daughter s heart Perhaps he wasn t a divinity student at all but some one travelling incognito Zina grew thoughtful the story of the divinity student and the beautiful French girl had evidently carried her imagination far away It seemed to Pyotr Mihalitch that she had not changed in the least during the last week except that she was a little paler She looked calm and just as usual as though she had come with her brother to visit Vlassitch But Pyotr Mihalitch felt that some change had taken place in himself Before when she was living at home he could have spoken to her about anything and now he did not feel equal to asking her the simple question How do you like being here The question seemed awkward and unnecessary Probably the same change had taken place in her She was in no haste to turn the conversation to her mother to her home to her relations with Vlassitch she did not defend herself she did not say that free unions are better than marriages in the church she was not agitated and calmly brooded over the story of Olivier And why had they suddenly begun talking of Olivier You are both of you wet with the rain said Zina and she smiled joyfully she was touched by this point of resemblance between her brother and Vlassitch And Pyotr Mihalitch felt all the bitterness and horror of his position He thought of his deserted home the closed piano and Zina s bright little room into which no one went now he thought there were no prints of little feet on the garden paths and that before tea no one went off laughing gaily to bathe What he had clung to more and more from his childhood upwards what he had loved thinking about when he used to sit in the stuffy class room or the lecture theatre brightness purity and joy everything that filled the house with life and light had gone never to return had vanished and was mixed up with a coarse clumsy story of some battalion officer a chivalrous lieutenant a depraved woman and a grandfather who had shot himself And to begin to talk about his mother or to think that the past could ever return would mean not understanding what was clear Pyotr Mihalitch s eyes filled with tears and his hand began to tremble as it lay on the table Zina guessed what he was thinking about and her eyes too glistened and looked red Grigory come here she said to Vlassitch They walked away to the window and began talking of something in a whisper From the way that Vlassitch stooped down to her and the way she looked at him Pyotr Mihalitch realised again that everything was irreparably over and that it was no use to talk of anything Zina went out of the room Well brother Vlassitch began after a brief silence rubbing his hands and smiling I called our life happiness just now but that was so to speak poetical license In reality there has not been a sense of happiness so far Zina has been thinking all the time of you of her mother and has been worrying looking at her I too felt worried Hers is a bold free nature but you know it s difficult when you re not used to it and she is young too The servants call her Miss it seems a trifle but it upsets her There it is brother Zina brought in a plateful of strawberries She was followed by a little maidservant looking crushed and humble who set a jug of milk on the table and made a very low bow she had something about her that was in keeping with the old furniture something petrified and dreary The sound of the rain had ceased Pyotr Mihalitch ate strawberries while Vlassitch and Zina looked at him in silence The moment of the inevitable but useless conversation was approaching and all three felt the burden of it Pyotr Mihalitch s eyes filled with tears again he pushed away his plate and said that he must be going home or it would be getting late and perhaps it would rain again The time had come when common decency required Zina to speak of those at home and of her new life How are things at home she asked rapidly and her pale face quivered How is mother You know mother said Pyotr Mihalitch not looking at her Petrusha you ve thought a great deal about what has happened she said taking hold of her brother s sleeve and he knew how hard it was for her to speak You ve thought a great deal tell me can we reckon on mother s accepting Grigory and the whole position one day She stood close to her brother face to face with him and he was astonished that she was so beautiful and that he seemed not to have noticed it before And it seemed to him utterly absurd that his sister so like his mother pampered elegant should be living with Vlassitch and in Vlassitch s house with the petrified servant and the table with six legs in the house where a man had been flogged to death and that she was not going home with him but was staying here to sleep You know mother he said not answering her question I think you ought to have to do something to ask her forgiveness or something But to ask her forgiveness would mean pretending we had done wrong I m ready to tell a lie to comfort mother but it won t lead anywhere I know mother Well what will be must be said Zina growing more cheerful now that the most unpleasant had been said We ll wait for five years ten years and be patient and then God s will be done She took her brother s arm and when she walked through the dark hall she squeezed close to him They went out on the steps Pyotr Mihalitch said good bye got on his horse and set off at a walk Zina and Vlassitch walked a little way with him It was still and warm with a delicious smell of hay stars were twinkling brightly between the clouds Vlassitch s old garden which had seen so many gloomy stories in its time lay slumbering in the darkness and for some reason it was mournful riding through it Zina and I to day after dinner spent some really exalted moments said Vlassitch I read aloud to her an excellent article on the question of emigration You must read it brother You really must It s remarkable for its lofty tone I could not resist writing a letter to the editor to be forwarded to the author I wrote only a single line I thank you and warmly press your noble hand Pyotr Mihalitch was tempted to say Don t meddle in what does not concern you but he held his tongue Vlassitch walked by his right stirrup and Zina by the left both seemed to have forgotten that they had to go home It was damp and they had almost reached Koltovitch s copse Pyotr Mihalitch felt that they were expecting something from him though they hardly knew what it was and he felt unbearably sorry for them Now as they walked by the horse with submissive faces lost in thought he had a deep conviction that they were unhappy and could not be happy and their love seemed to him a melancholy irreparable mistake Pity and the sense that he could do nothing to help them reduced him to that state of spiritual softening when he was ready to make any sacrifice to get rid of the painful feeling of sympathy I ll come over sometimes for a night he said But it sounded as though he were making a concession and did not satisfy him When they stopped near Koltovitch s copse to say good bye he bent down to Zina touched her shoulder and said You are right Zina You have done well To avoid saying more and bursting into tears he lashed his horse and galloped into the wood As he rode into the darkness he looked round and saw Vlassitch and Zina walking home along the road he taking long strides while she walked with a hurried jerky step beside him talking eagerly about something I am an old woman thought Pyotr Mihalitch I went to solve the question and I have only made it more complicated there it is He was heavy at heart When he got out of the copse he rode at a walk and then stopped his horse near the pond He wanted to sit and think without moving The moon was rising and was reflected in a streak of red on the other side of the pond There were low rumbles of thunder in the distance Pyotr Mihalitch looked steadily at the water and imagined his sister s despair her martyr like pallor the tearless eyes with which she would conceal her humiliation from others He imagined her with child imagined the death of their mother her funeral Zina s horror The proud superstitious old woman would be sure to die of grief Terrible pictures of the future rose before him on the background of smooth dark water and among pale feminine figures he saw himself a weak cowardly man with a guilty face A hundred paces off on the right bank of the pond something dark was standing motionless was it a man or a tall post Pyotr Mihalitch thought of the divinity student who had been killed and thrown into the pond Olivier behaved inhumanly but one way or another he did settle the question while I have settled nothing and have only made it worse he thought gazing at the dark figure that looked like a ghost He said and did what he thought right while I say and do what I don t think right and I don t know really what I do think He rode up to the dark figure it was an old rotten post the relic of some shed From Koltovitch s copse and garden there came a strong fragrant scent of lilies of the valley and honey laden flowers Pyotr Mihalitch rode along the bank of the pond and looked mournfully into the water And thinking about his life he came to the conclusion he had never said or acted upon what he really thought and other people had repaid him in the same way And so the whole of life seemed to him as dark as this water in which the night sky was reflected and water weeds grew in a tangle And it seemed to him that nothing could ever set it right AT HOME I THE Don railway A quiet cheerless station white and solitary in the steppe with its walls baking in the sun without a speck of shade and it seems without a human being The train goes on after leaving one here the sound of it is scarcely audible and dies away at last Outside the station it is a desert and there are no horses but one s own One gets into the carriage which is so pleasant after the train and is borne along the road through the steppe and by degrees there are unfolded before one views such as one does not see near Moscow immense endless fascinating in their monotony The steppe the steppe and nothing more in the distance an ancient barrow or a windmill ox waggons laden with coal trail by Solitary birds fly low over the plain and a drowsy feeling comes with the monotonous beat of their wings It is hot Another hour or so passes and still the steppe the steppe and still in the distance the barrow The driver tells you something some long unnecessary tale pointing into the distance with his whip And tranquillity takes possession of the soul one is loth to think of the past A carriage with three horses had been sent to fetch Vera Ivanovna Kardin The driver put in her luggage and set the harness to rights Everything just as it always has been said Vera looking about her I was a little girl when I was here last ten years ago I remember old Boris came to fetch me then Is he still living I wonder The driver made no reply but like a Little Russian looked at her angrily and clambered on to the box It was a twenty mile drive from the station and Vera too abandoned herself to the charm of the steppe forgot the past and thought only of the wide expanse of the freedom Healthy clever beautiful and young she was only three and twenty she had hitherto lacked nothing in her life but just this space and freedom The steppe the steppe The horses trotted the sun rose higher and higher and it seemed to Vera that never in her childhood had the steppe been so rich so luxuriant in June the wild flowers were green yellow lilac white and a fragrance rose from them and from the warmed earth and there were strange blue birds along the roadside Vera had long got out of the habit of praying but now struggling with drowsiness she murmured Lord grant that I may be happy here And there was peace and sweetness in her soul and she felt as though she would have been glad to drive like that all her life looking at the steppe Suddenly there was a deep ravine overgrown with oak saplings and alder trees there was a moist feeling in the air there must have been a spring at the bottom On the near side on the very edge of the ravine a covey of partridges rose noisily Vera remembered that in old days they used to go for evening walks to this ravine so it must be near home And now she could actually see the poplars the barn black smoke rising on one side they were burning old straw And there was Auntie Dasha coming to meet her and waving her handkerchief grandfather was on the terrace Oh dear how happy she was My darling my darling cried her aunt shrieking as though she were in hysterics Our real mistress has come You must understand you are our mistress you are our queen Here everything is yours My darling my beauty I am not your aunt but your willing slave Vera had no relations but her aunt and her grandfather her mother had long been dead her father an engineer had died three months before at Kazan on his way from Siberia Her grandfather had a big grey beard He was stout red faced and asthmatic and walked leaning on a cane and sticking his stomach out Her aunt a lady of forty two drawn in tightly at the waist and fashionably dressed with sleeves high on the shoulder evidently tried to look young and was still anxious to be charming she walked with tiny steps with a wriggle of her spine Will you love us she said embracing Vera You are not proud At her grandfather s wish there was a thanksgiving service then they spent a long while over dinner and Vera s new life began She was given the best room All the rugs in the house had been put in it and a great many flowers and when at night she lay down in her snug wide very soft bed and covered herself with a silk quilt that smelt of old clothes long stored away she laughed with pleasure Auntie Dasha came in for a minute to wish her good night Here you are home again thank God she said sitting down on the bed As you see we get along very well and have everything we want There s only one thing your grandfather is in a poor way A terribly poor way He is short of breath and he has begun to lose his memory And you remember how strong how vigorous he used to be There was no doing anything with him In old days if the servants didn t please him or anything else went wrong he would jump up at once and shout Twenty five strokes The birch But now he has grown milder and you never hear him And besides times are changed my precious one mayn t beat them nowadays Of course they oughtn t to be beaten but they need looking after And are they beaten now auntie asked Vera The steward beats them sometimes but I never do bless their hearts And your grandfather sometimes lifts his stick from old habit but he never beats them Auntie Dasha yawned and crossed herself over her mouth and her right ear It s not dull here Vera inquired What shall I say There are no landowners living here now but there have been works built near darling and there are lots of engineers doctors and mine managers Of course we have theatricals and concerts but we play cards more than anything They come to us too doctor Neshtchapov from the works comes to see us such a handsome interesting man He fell in love with your photograph I made up my mind he is Verotchka s destiny I thought He s young handsome he has means a good match in fact And of course you re a match for any one You re of good family The place is mortgaged it s true but it s in good order and not neglected there is my share in it but it will all come to you I am your willing slave And my brother your father left you fifteen thousand roubles But I see you can t keep your eyes open Sleep my child Next day Vera spent a long time walking round the house The garden which was old and unattractive lying inconveniently upon the slope had no paths and was utterly neglected probably the care of it was regarded as an unnecessary item in the management There were numbers of grass snakes Hoopoes flew about under the trees calling Oo too toot as though they were trying to remind her of something At the bottom of the hill there was a river overgrown with tall reeds and half a mile beyond the river was the village From the garden Vera went out into the fields looking into the distance thinking of her new life in her own home she kept trying to grasp what was in store for her The space the lovely peace of the steppe told her that happiness was near at hand and perhaps was here already thousands of people in fact would have said What happiness to be young healthy well educated to be living on one s own estate And at the same time the endless plain all alike without one living soul frightened her and at moments it was clear to her that its peaceful green vastness would swallow up her life and reduce it to nothingness She was very young elegant fond of life she had finished her studies at an aristocratic boarding school had learnt three languages had read a great deal had travelled with her father and could all this have been meant to lead to nothing but settling down in a remote country house in the steppe and wandering day after day from the garden into the fields and from the fields into the garden to while away the time and then sitting at home listening to her grandfather s breathing But what could she do Where could she go She could find no answer and as she was returning home she doubted whether she would be happy here and thought that driving from the station was far more interesting than living here doctor Neshtchapov drove over from the works He was a doctor but three years previously he had taken a share in the works and had become one of the partners and now he no longer looked upon medicine as his chief vocation though he still practised In appearance he was a pale dark man in a white waistcoat with a good figure but to guess what there was in his heart and his brain was difficult He kissed Auntie Dasha s hand on greeting her and was continually leaping up to set a chair or give his seat to some one He was very silent and grave all the while and when he did speak it was for some reason impossible to hear and understand his first sentence though he spoke correctly and not in a low voice You play the piano he asked Vera and immediately leapt up as she had dropped her handkerchief He stayed from midday to midnight without speaking and Vera found him very unattractive She thought that a white waistcoat in the country was bad form and his elaborate politeness his manners and his pale serious face with dark eyebrows were mawkish and it seemed to her that he was perpetually silent probably because he was stupid When he had gone her aunt said enthusiastically Well Isn t he charming II Auntie Dasha looked after the estate Tightly laced with jingling bracelets on her wrists she went into the kitchen the granary the cattle yard tripping along with tiny steps wriggling her spine and whenever she talked to the steward or to the peasants she used for some reason to put on a pince nez Vera s grandfather always sat in the same place playing patience or dozing He ate a very great deal at dinner and supper they gave him the dinner cooked to day and what was left from yesterday and cold pie left from Sunday and salt meat from the servants dinner and he ate it all greedily And every dinner left on Vera such an impression that when she saw afterwards a flock of sheep driven by or flour being brought from the mill she thought Grandfather will eat that For the most part he was silent absorbed in eating or in patience but it sometimes happened at dinner that at the sight of Vera he would be touched and say tenderly My only grandchild Verotchka And tears would glisten in his eyes Or his face would turn suddenly crimson his neck would swell he would look with fury at the servants and ask tapping with his stick Why haven t you brought the horse radish In winter he led a perfectly inactive existence in summer he sometimes drove out into the fields to look at the oats and the hay and when he came back he would flourish his stick and declare that everything was neglected now that he was not there to look after it Your grandfather is out of humour Auntie Dasha would whisper But it s nothing now to what it used to be in the old days Twenty five strokes The birch Her aunt complained that every one had grown lazy that no one did anything and that the estate yielded no profit Indeed there was no systematic farming they ploughed and sowed a little simply from habit and in reality did nothing and lived in idleness Meanwhile there was a running to and fro reckoning and worrying all day long the bustle in the house began at five o clock in the morning there were continual sounds of Bring it Fetch it Make haste and by the evening the servants were utterly exhausted Auntie Dasha changed her cooks and her housemaids every week sometimes she discharged them for immorality sometimes they went of their own accord complaining that they were worked to death None of the village people would come to the house as servants Auntie Dasha had to hire them from a distance There was only one girl from the village living in the house Alyona and she stayed because her whole family old people and children were living upon her wages This Alyona a pale rather stupid little thing spent the whole day turning out the rooms waiting at table heating the stoves sewing washing but it always seemed as though she were only pottering about treading heavily with her boots and were nothing but a hindrance in the house In her terror that she might be dismissed and sent home she often dropped and broke the crockery and they stopped the value of it out of her wages and then her mother and grandmother would come and bow down at Auntie Dasha s feet Once a week or sometimes oftener visitors would arrive Her aunt would come to Vera and say You should sit a little with the visitors or else they ll think that you are stuck up Vera would go in to the visitors and play vint with them for hours together or play the piano for the visitors to dance her aunt in high spirits and breathless from dancing would come up and whisper to her Be nice to Marya Nikiforovna On the sixth of December saint Nikolay s Day a large party of about thirty arrived all at once they played vint until late at night and many of them stayed the night In the morning they sat down to cards again then they had dinner and when Vera went to her room after dinner to rest from conversation and tobacco smoke there were visitors there too and she almost wept in despair And when they began to get ready to go in the evening she was so pleased they were going at last that she said Do stay a little longer She felt exhausted by the visitors and constrained by their presence yet every day as soon as it began to grow dark something drew her out of the house and she went out to pay visits either at the works or at some neighbours and then there were cards dancing forfeits suppers The young people in the works or in the mines sometimes sang Little Russian songs and sang them very well It made one sad to hear them sing Or they all gathered together in one room and talked in the dusk of the mines of the treasures that had once been buried in the steppes of Saur s Grave Later on as they talked a shout of Help sometimes reached them It was a drunken man going home or some one was being robbed by the pit near by Or the wind howled in the chimneys the shutters banged then soon afterwards they would hear the uneasy church bell as the snow storm began At all the evening parties picnics and dinners Auntie Dasha was invariably the most interesting woman and the doctor the most interesting man There was very little reading either at the works or at the country houses they played only marches and polkas and the young people always argued hotly about things they did not understand and the effect was crude The discussions were loud and heated but strange to say Vera had nowhere else met people so indifferent and careless as these They seemed to have no fatherland no religion no public interests When they talked of literature or debated some abstract question it could be seen from doctor Neshtchapov s face that the question had no interest for him whatever and that for long long years he had read nothing and cared to read nothing Serious and expressionless like a badly painted portrait for ever in his white waistcoat he was silent and incomprehensible as before but the ladies young and old thought him interesting and were enthusiastic over his manners They envied Vera who appeared to attract him very much And Vera always came away from the visits with a feeling of vexation vowing inwardly to remain at home but the day passed the evening came and she hurried off to the works again and it was like that almost all the winter She ordered books and magazines and used to read them in her room And she read at night lying in bed When the clock in the corridor struck two or three and her temples were beginning to ache from reading she sat up in bed and thought What am I to do Where am I to go Accursed importunate question to which there were a number of ready made answers and in reality no answer at all Oh how noble how holy how picturesque it must be to serve the people to alleviate their sufferings to enlighten them But she Vera did not know the people And how could she go to them They were strange and uninteresting to her she could not endure the stuffy smell of the huts the pot house oaths the unwashed children the women s talk of illnesses To walk over the snow drifts to feel cold then to sit in a stifling hut to teach children she disliked no she would rather die And to teach the peasants children while Auntie Dasha made money out of the pot houses and fined the peasants it was too great a farce What a lot of talk there was of schools of village libraries of universal education but if all these engineers these mine owners and ladies of her acquaintance had not been hypocrites and really had believed that enlightenment was necessary they would not have paid the schoolmasters fifteen roubles a month as they did now and would not have let them go hungry And the schools and the talk about ignorance it was all only to stifle the voice of conscience because they were ashamed to own fifteen or thirty thousand acres and to be indifferent to the peasants lot Here the ladies said about doctor Neshtchapov that he was a kind man and had built a school at the works Yes he had built a school out of the old bricks at the works for some eight hundred roubles and they sang the prayer for long life to him when the building was opened but there was no chance of his giving up his shares and it certainly never entered his head that the peasants were human beings like himself and that they too needed university teaching and not merely lessons in these wretched schools And Vera felt full of anger against herself and every one else She took up a book again and tried to read it but soon afterwards sat down and thought again To become a doctor But to do that one must pass an examination in Latin besides she had an invincible repugnance to corpses and disease It would be nice to become a mechanic a judge a commander of a steamer a scientist to do something into which she could put all her powers physical and spiritual and to be tired out and sleep soundly at night to give up her life to something that would make her an interesting person able to attract interesting people to love to have a real family of her own But what was she to do How was she to begin One Sunday in Lent her aunt came into her room early in the morning to fetch her umbrella Vera was sitting up in bed clasping her head in her hands thinking You ought to go to church darling said her aunt or people will think you are not a believer Vera made no answer I see you are dull poor child said Auntie Dasha sinking on her knees by the bedside she adored Vera Tell me the truth are you bored Dreadfully My beauty my queen I am your willing slave I wish you nothing but good and happiness Tell me why don t you want to marry Nestchapov What more do you want my child You must forgive me darling you can t pick and choose like this we are not princes Time is passing you are not seventeen And I don t understand it He loves you idolises you Oh mercy said Vera with vexation How can I tell He sits dumb and never says a word He s shy darling He s afraid you ll refuse him And when her aunt had gone away Vera remained standing in the middle of her room uncertain whether to dress or to go back to bed The bed was hateful if one looked out of the window there were the bare trees the grey snow the hateful jackdaws the pigs that her grandfather would eat Yes after all perhaps I d better get married she thought III For two days Auntie Dasha went about with a tear stained and heavily powdered face and at dinner she kept sighing and looking towards the ikon And it was impossible to make out what was the matter with her But at last she made up her mind went in to Vera and said in a casual way The fact is child we have to pay interest on the bank loan and the tenant hasn t paid his rent Will you let me pay it out of the fifteen thousand your papa left you All day afterwards Auntie Dasha spent in making cherry jam in the garden Alyona with her cheeks flushed with the heat ran to and from the garden to the house and back again to the cellar When Auntie Dasha was making jam with a very serious face as though she were performing a religious rite and her short sleeves displayed her strong little despotic hands and arms and when the servants ran about incessantly bustling about the jam which they would never taste there was always a feeling of martyrdom in the air The garden smelt of hot cherries The sun had set the charcoal stove had been carried away but the pleasant sweetish smell still lingered in the air Vera sat on a bench in the garden and watched a new labourer a young soldier not of the neighbourhood who was by her express orders making new paths He was cutting the turf with a spade and heaping it up on a barrow Where were you serving Vera asked him At Berdyansk And where are you going now Home No answered the labourer I have no home But where were you born and brought up In the province of Oryol Till I went into the army I lived with my mother in my step father s house my mother was the head of the house and people looked up to her and while she lived I was cared for But while I was in the army I got a letter telling me my mother was dead And now I don t seem to care to go home It s not my own father so it s not like my own home Then your father is dead I don t know I am illegitimate At that moment Auntie Dasha appeared at the window and said Il ne faut pas parler aux gens Go into the kitchen my good man You can tell your story there she said to the soldier And then came as yesterday and every day supper reading a sleepless night and endless thinking about the same thing At three o clock the sun rose Alyona was already busy in the corridor and Vera was not asleep yet and was trying to read She heard the creak of the barrow it was the new labourer at work in the garden Vera sat at the open window with a book dozed and watched the soldier making the paths for her and that interested her The paths were as even and level as a leather strap and it was pleasant to imagine what they would be like when they were strewn with yellow sand She could see her aunt come out of the house soon after five o clock in a pink wrapper and curl papers She stood on the steps for three minutes without speaking and then said to the soldier Take your passport and go in peace I can t have any one illegitimate in my house An oppressive angry feeling sank like a stone on Vera s heart She was indignant with her aunt she hated her she was so sick of her aunt that her heart was full of misery and loathing But what was she to do To stop her mouth To be rude to her But what would be the use Suppose she struggled with her got rid of her made her harmless prevented her grandfather from flourishing his stick what would be the use of it It would be like killing one mouse or one snake in the boundless steppe The vast expanse the long winters the monotony and dreariness of life instil a sense of helplessness the position seems hopeless and one wants to do nothing everything is useless Alyona came in and bowing low to Vera began carrying out the arm chairs to beat the dust out of them You have chosen a time to clean up said Vera with annoyance Go away Alyona was overwhelmed and in her terror could not understand what was wanted of her She began hurriedly tidying up the dressing table Go out of the room I tell you Vera shouted turning cold she had never had such an oppressive feeling before Go away Alyona uttered a sort of moan like a bird and dropped Vera s gold watch on the carpet Go away Vera shrieked in a voice not her own leaping up and trembling all over Send her away she worries me to death she went on walking rapidly after Alyona down the passage stamping her feet Go away Birch her Beat her Then suddenly she came to herself and just as she was unwashed uncombed in her dressing gown and slippers she rushed out of the house She ran to the familiar ravine and hid herself there among the sloe trees so that she might see no one and be seen by no one Lying there motionless on the grass she did not weep she was not horror stricken but gazing at the sky open eyed she reflected coldly and clearly that something had happened which she could never forget and for which she could never forgive herself all her life No I can t go on like this she thought It s time to take myself in hand or there ll be no end to it I can t go on like this At midday doctor Neshtchapov drove by the ravine on his way to the house She saw him and made up her mind that she would begin a new life and that she would make herself begin it and this decision calmed her And following with her eyes the doctor s well built figure she said as though trying to soften the crudity of her decision He s a nice man We shall get through life somehow She returned home While she was dressing Auntie Dasha came into the room and said Alyona upset you darling I ve sent her home to the village Her mother s given her a good beating and has come here crying Auntie said Vera quickly I m going to marry doctor Neshtchapov Only talk to him yourself I can t And again she went out into the fields And wandering aimlessly about she made up her mind that when she was married she would look after the house doctor the peasants teach in the school that she would do all the things that other women of her circle did And this perpetual dissatisfaction with herself and every one else this series of crude mistakes which stand up like a mountain before one whenever one looks back upon one s past she would accept as her real life to which she was fated and she would expect nothing better Of course there was nothing better Beautiful nature dreams music told one story but reality another Evidently truth and happiness existed somewhere outside real life One must give up one s own life and merge oneself into this luxuriant steppe boundless and indifferent as eternity with its flowers its ancient barrows and its distant horizon and then it would be well with one A month later Vera was living at the works EXPENSIVE LESSONS FOR a cultivated man to be ignorant of foreign languages is a great inconvenience Vorotov became acutely conscious of it when after taking his degree he began upon a piece of research work It s awful he said breathing hard although he was only twenty six he was fat heavy and suffered from shortness of breath It s awful Without languages I m like a bird without wings I might just as well give up the work And he made up his mind at all costs to overcome his innate laziness and to learn French and German and began to look out for a teacher One winter noon as Vorotov was sitting in his study at work the servant told him that a young lady was inquiring for him Ask her in said Vorotov And a young lady elaborately dressed in the last fashion walked in She introduced herself as a teacher of French Alice Osipovna Enquete and told Vorotov that she had been sent to him by one of his friends Delighted Please sit down said Vorotov breathing hard and putting his hand over the collar of his nightshirt to breathe more freely he always wore a nightshirt at work instead of a stiff linen one with collar It was Pyotr Sergeitch sent you Yes yes I asked him about it Delighted As he talked to Mdlle Enquete he looked at her shyly and with curiosity She was a genuine Frenchwoman very elegant and still quite young Judging from her pale languid face her short curly hair and her unnaturally slim waist she might have been eighteen but looking at her broad well developed shoulders the elegant lines of her back and her severe eyes Vorotov thought that she was not less than three and twenty and might be twenty five but then again he began to think she was not more than eighteen Her face looked as cold and business like as the face of a person who has come to speak about money She did not once smile or frown and only once a look of perplexity flitted over her face when she learnt that she was not required to teach children but a stout grown up man So Alice Osipovna said Vorotov we ll have a lesson every evening from seven to eight As regards your terms a rouble a lesson I ve nothing to say against that By all means let it be a rouble And he asked her if she would not have some tea or coffee whether it was a fine day and with a good natured smile stroking the baize of the table he inquired in a friendly voice who she was where she had studied and what she lived on With a cold business like expression Alice Osipovna answered that she had completed her studies at a private school and had the diploma of a private teacher that her father had died lately of scarlet fever that her mother was alive and made artificial flowers that she Mdlle Enquete taught in a private school till dinnertime and after dinner was busy till evening giving lessons in different good families She went away leaving behind her the faint fragrance of a woman s clothes For a long time afterwards Vorotov could not settle to work but sitting at the table stroking its green baize surface he meditated It s very pleasant to see a girl working to earn her own living he thought On the other hand it s very unpleasant to think that poverty should not spare such elegant and pretty girls as Alice Osipovna and that she too should have to struggle for existence It s a sad thing Having never seen virtuous Frenchwomen before he reflected also that this elegantly dressed young lady with her well developed shoulders and exaggeratedly small waist in all probability followed another calling as well as giving French lessons The next evening when the clock pointed to five minutes to seven Mdlle Enquete appeared rosy from the frost She opened Margot which she had brought with her and without introduction began French grammar has twenty six letters The first letter is called A the second B Excuse me Vorotov interrupted smiling I must warn you mademoiselle that you must change your method a little in my case You see I know Russian Greek and Latin well I ve studied comparative philology and I think we might omit Margot and pass straight to reading some author And he explained to the French girl how grown up people learn languages A friend of mine he said wanting to learn modern languages laid before him the French German and Latin gospels and read them side by side carefully analysing each word and would you believe it he attained his object in less than a year Let us do the same We ll take some author and read him The French girl looked at him in perplexity Evidently the suggestion seemed to her very naive and ridiculous If this strange proposal had been made to her by a child she would certainly have been angry and have scolded it but as he was a grown up man and very stout and she could not scold him she only shrugged her shoulders hardly perceptibly and said As you please Vorotov rummaged in his bookcase and picked out a dog s eared French book Will this do It s all the same she said In that case let us begin and good luck to it Let s begin with the title Memoires Reminiscences Mdlle Enquete translated With a good natured smile breathing hard he spent a quarter of an hour over the word Memoires and as much over the word de and this wearied the young lady She answered his questions languidly grew confused and evidently did not understand her pupil well and did not attempt to understand him Vorotov asked her questions and at the same time kept looking at her fair hair and thinking Her hair isn t naturally curly she curls it It s a strange thing She works from morning to night and yet she has time to curl her hair At eight o clock precisely she got up and saying coldly and dryly Au revoir monsieur walked out of the study leaving behind her the same tender delicate disturbing fragrance For a long time again her pupil did nothing he sat at the table meditating During the days that followed he became convinced that his teacher was a charming conscientious and precise young lady but that she was very badly educated and incapable of teaching grown up people and he made up his mind not to waste his time to get rid of her and to engage another teacher When she came the seventh time he took out of his pocket an envelope with seven roubles in it and holding it in his hand became very confused and began Excuse me Alice Osipovna but I ought to tell you I m under painful necessity Seeing the envelope the French girl guessed what was meant and for the first time during their lessons her face quivered and her cold business like expression vanished She coloured a little and dropping her eyes began nervously fingering her slender gold chain And Vorotov seeing her perturbation realised how much a rouble meant to her and how bitter it would be to her to lose what she was earning I ought to tell you he muttered growing more and more confused and quavering inwardly he hurriedly stuffed the envelope into his pocket and went on Excuse me I I must leave you for ten minutes And trying to appear as though he had not in the least meant to get rid of her but only to ask her permission to leave her for a short time he went into the next room and sat there for ten minutes And then he returned more embarrassed than ever it struck him that she might have interpreted his brief absence in some way of her own and he felt awkward The lessons began again Yorotov felt no interest in them Realising that he would gain nothing from the lessons he gave the French girl liberty to do as she liked asking her nothing and not interrupting her She translated away as she pleased ten pages during a lesson and he did not listen breathed hard and having nothing better to do gazed at her curly head or her soft white hands or her neck and sniffed the fragrance of her clothes He caught himself thinking very unsuitable thoughts and felt ashamed or he was moved to tenderness and then he felt vexed and wounded that she was so cold and business like with him and treated him as a pupil never smiling and seeming afraid that he might accidentally touch her He kept wondering how to inspire her with confidence and get to know her better and to help her to make her understand how badly she taught poor thing One day Mdlle Enquete came to the lesson in a smart pink dress slightly decollete and surrounded by such a fragrance that she seemed to be wrapped in a cloud and if one blew upon her ready to fly away into the air or melt away like smoke She apologised and said she could stay only half an hour for the lesson as she was going straight from the lesson to a dance He looked at her throat and the back of her bare neck and thought he understood why Frenchwomen had the reputation of frivolous creatures easily seduced he was carried away by this cloud of fragrance beauty and bare flesh while she unconscious of his thoughts and probably not in the least interested in them rapidly turned over the pages and translated at full steam He was walking the street and meeting a gentleman his friend and saying Where are you striving to seeing your face so pale it makes me sad The Memoires had long been finished and now Alice was translating some other book One day she came an hour too early for the lesson apologizing and saying that she wanted to leave at seven and go to the Little Theatre Seeing her out after the lesson Vorotov dressed and went to the theatre himself He went and fancied that he was going simply for change and amusement and that he was not thinking about Alice at all He could not admit that a serious man preparing for a learned career lethargic in his habits could fling up his work and go to the theatre simply to meet there a girl he knew very little who was unintelligent and utterly unintellectual Yet for some reason his heart was beating during the intervals and without realizing what he was doing he raced about the corridors and foyer like a boy impatiently looking for some one and he was disappointed when the interval was over And when he saw the familiar pink dress and the handsome shoulders under the tulle his heart quivered as though with a foretaste of happiness he smiled joyfully and for the first time in his life experienced the sensation of jealousy Alice was walking with two unattractive looking students and an officer She was laughing talking loudly and obviously flirting Vorotov had never seen her like that She was evidently happy contented warm sincere What for Why Perhaps because these men were her friends and belonged to her own circle And Vorotov felt there was a terrible gulf between himself and that circle He bowed to his teacher but she gave him a chilly nod and walked quickly by she evidently did not care for her friends to know that she had pupils and that she had to give lessons to earn money After the meeting at the theatre Vorotov realised that he was in love During the subsequent lessons he feasted his eyes on his elegant teacher and without struggling with himself gave full rein to his imaginations pure and impure Mdlle Enquete s face did not cease to be cold precisely at eight o clock every evening she said coldly Au revoir monsieur and he felt she cared nothing about him and never would care anything about him and that his position was hopeless Sometimes in the middle of a lesson he would begin dreaming hoping making plans He inwardly composed declarations of love remembered that Frenchwomen were frivolous and easily won but it was enough for him to glance at the face of his teacher for his ideas to be extinguished as a candle is blown out when you bring it into the wind on the verandah Once overcome forgetting himself as though in delirium he could not restrain himself and barred her way as she was going from the study into the entry after the lesson and gasping for breath and stammering began to declare his love You are dear to me I I love you Allow me to speak And Alice turned pale probably from dismay reflecting that after this declaration she could not come here again and get a rouble a lesson With a frightened look in her eyes she said in a loud whisper Ach you mustn t Don t speak I entreat you You mustn t And Vorotov did not sleep all night afterwards he was tortured by shame he blamed himself and thought intensely It seemed to him that he had insulted the girl by his declaration that she would not come to him again He resolved to find out her address from the address bureau in the morning and to write her a letter of apology But Alice came without a letter For the first minute she felt uncomfortable then she opened a book and began briskly and rapidly translating as usual Oh young gentleman don t tear those flowers in my garden which I want to be giving to my ill daughter She still comes to this day Four books have already been translated but Vorotov knows no French but the word Memoires and when he is asked about his literary researches he waves his hand and without answering turns the conversation to the weather THE PRINCESS A CARRIAGE with four fine sleek horses drove in at the big so called Red Gate of the N Monastery While it was still at a distance the priests and monks who were standing in a group round the part of the hostel allotted to the gentry recognised by the coachman and horses that the lady in the carriage was Princess Vera Gavrilovna whom they knew very well An old man in livery jumped off the box and helped the princess to get out of the carriage She raised her dark veil and moved in a leisurely way up to the priests to receive their blessing then she nodded pleasantly to the rest of the monks and went into the hostel Well have you missed your princess she said to the monk who brought in her things It s a whole month since I ve been to see you But here I am behold your princess And where is the Father Superior My goodness I am burning with impatience Wonderful wonderful old man You must be proud of having such a Superior When the Father Superior came in the princess uttered a shriek of delight crossed her arms over her bosom and went up to receive his blessing No no let me kiss your hand she said snatching it and eagerly kissing it three times How glad I am to see you at last holy Father I m sure you ve forgotten your princess but my thoughts have been in your dear monastery every moment How delightful it is here This living for God far from the busy giddy world has a special charm of its own holy Father which I feel with my whole soul although I cannot express it The princess s cheeks glowed and tears came into her eyes She talked incessantly fervently while the Father Superior a grave plain shy old man of seventy remained mute or uttered abruptly like a soldier on duty phrases such as Certainly Your Excellency Quite so I understand Has Your Excellency come for a long stay he inquired I shall stay the night here and to morrow I m going on to Klavdia Nikolaevna s it s a long time since I ve seen her and the day after to morrow I ll come back to you and stay three or four days I want to rest my soul here among you holy Father The princess liked being at the monastery at N For the last two years it had been a favourite resort of hers she used to go there almost every month in the summer and stay two or three days even sometimes a week The shy novices the stillness the low ceilings the smell of cypress the modest fare the cheap curtains on the windows all this touched her softened her and disposed her to contemplation and good thoughts It was enough for her to be half an hour in the hostel for her to feel that she too was timid and modest and that she too smelt of cypress wood The past retreated into the background lost its significance and the princess began to imagine that in spite of her twenty nine years she was very much like the old Father Superior and that like him she was created not for wealth not for earthly grandeur and love but for a peaceful life secluded from the world a life in twilight like the hostel It happens that a ray of light gleams in the dark cell of the anchorite absorbed in prayer or a bird alights on the window and sings its song the stern anchorite will smile in spite of himself and a gentle sinless joy will pierce through the load of grief over his sins like water flowing from under a stone The princess fancied she brought from the outside world just such comfort as the ray of light or the bird Her gay friendly smile her gentle eyes her voice her jests her whole personality in fact her little graceful figure always dressed in simple black must arouse in simple austere people a feeling of tenderness and joy Every one looking at her must think God has sent us an angel And feeling that no one could help thinking this she smiled still more cordially and tried to look like a bird After drinking tea and resting she went for a walk The sun was already setting From the monastery garden came a moist fragrance of freshly watered mignonette and from the church floated the soft singing of men s voices which seemed very pleasant and mournful in the distance It was the evening service In the dark windows where the little lamps glowed gently in the shadows in the figure of the old monk sitting at the church door with a collecting box there was such unruffled peace that the princess felt moved to tears Outside the gate in the walk between the wall and the birch trees where there were benches it was quite evening The air grew rapidly darker and darker The princess went along the walk sat on a seat and sank into thought She thought how good it would be to settle down for her whole life in this monastery where life was as still and unruffled as a summer evening how good it would be to forget the ungrateful dissipated prince to forget her immense estates the creditors who worried her every day her misfortunes her maid Dasha who had looked at her impertinently that morning It would be nice to sit here on the bench all her life and watch through the trunks of the birch trees the evening mist gathering in wreaths in the valley below the rooks flying home in a black cloud like a veil far far away above the forest two novices one astride a piebald horse another on foot driving out the horses for the night and rejoicing in their freedom playing pranks like little children their youthful voices rang out musically in the still air and she could distinguish every word It is nice to sit and listen to the silence at one moment the wind blows and stirs the tops of the birch trees then a frog rustles in last year s leaves then the clock on the belfry strikes the quarter One might sit without moving listen and think and think An old woman passed by with a wallet on her back The princess thought that it would be nice to stop the old woman and to say something friendly and cordial to her to help her But the old woman turned the corner without once looking round Not long afterwards a tall man with a grey beard and a straw hat came along the walk When he came up to the princess he took off his hat and bowed From the bald patch on his head and his sharp hooked nose the princess recognised him as the doctor Mihail Ivanovitch who had been in her service at Dubovki She remembered that some one had told her that his wife had died the year before and she wanted to sympathise with him to console him Doctor I expect you don t recognise me she said with an affable smile Yes Princess I recognised you said the doctor taking off his hat again Oh thank you I was afraid that you too had forgotten your princess People only remember their enemies but they forget their friends Have you too come to pray I am the doctor here and I have to spend the night at the monastery every Saturday Well how are you said the princess sighing I hear that you have lost your wife What a calamity Yes Princess for me it is a great calamity There s nothing for it We must bear our troubles with resignation Not one hair of a man s head is lost without the Divine Will Yes Princess To the princess s friendly gentle smile and her sighs the doctor responded coldly and dryly Yes Princess And the expression of his face was cold and dry What else can I say to him she wondered How long it is since we met she said Five years How much water has flowed under the bridge how many changes in that time it quite frightens one to think of it You know I am married I am not a countess now but a princess And by now I am separated from my husband too Yes I heard so God has sent me many trials No doubt you have heard too that I am almost ruined My Dubovki Sofyino and Kiryakovo have all been sold for my unhappy husband s debts And I have only Baranovo and Mihaltsevo left It s terrible to look back how many changes and misfortunes of all kinds how many mistakes Yes Princess many mistakes The princess was a little disconcerted She knew her mistakes they were all of such a private character that no one but she could think or speak of them She could not resist asking What mistakes are you thinking about You referred to them so you know them answered the doctor and he smiled Why talk about them No tell me doctor I shall be very grateful to you And please don t stand on ceremony with me I love to hear the truth I am not your judge Princess Not my judge What a tone you take You must know something about me Tell me If you really wish it very well Only I regret to say I m not clever at talking and people can t always understand me The doctor thought a moment and began A lot of mistakes but the most important of them in my opinion was the general spirit that prevailed on all your estates You see I don t know how to express myself I mean chiefly the lack of love the aversion for people that was felt in absolutely everything Your whole system of life was built upon that aversion Aversion for the human voice for faces for heads steps in fact for everything that makes up a human being At all the doors and on the stairs there stand sleek rude and lazy grooms in livery to prevent badly dressed persons from entering the house in the hall there are chairs with high backs so that the footmen waiting there during balls and receptions may not soil the walls with their heads in every room there are thick carpets that no human step may be heard every one who comes in is infallibly warned to speak as softly and as little as possible and to say nothing that might have a disagreeable effect on the nerves or the imagination And in your room you don t shake hands with any one or ask him to sit down just as you didn t shake hands with me or ask me to sit down By all means if you like said the princess smiling and holding out her hand Really to be cross about such trifles But I am not cross laughed the doctor but at once he flushed took off his hat and waving it about began hotly To be candid I ve long wanted an opportunity to tell you all I think That is I want to tell you that you look upon the mass of mankind from the Napoleonic standpoint as food for the cannon But Napoleon had at least some idea you have nothing except aversion I have an aversion for people smiled the princess shrugging her shoulders in astonishment I have Yes you You want facts By all means In Mihaltsevo three former cooks of yours who have gone blind in your kitchens from the heat of the stove are living upon charity All the health and strength and good looks that is found on your hundreds of thousands of acres is taken by you and your parasites for your grooms your footmen and your coachmen All these two legged cattle are trained to be flunkeys overeat themselves grow coarse lose the image and likeness in fact Young doctors agricultural experts teachers intellectual workers generally think of it are torn away from their honest work and forced for a crust of bread to take part in all sorts of mummeries which make every decent man feel ashamed Some young men cannot be in your service for three years without becoming hypocrites toadies sneaks Is that a good thing Your Polish superintendents those abject spies all those Kazimers and Kaetans go hunting about on your hundreds of thousands of acres from morning to night and to please you try to get three skins off one ox Excuse me I speak disconnectedly but that doesn t matter You don t look upon the simple people as human beings And even the princes counts and bishops who used to come and see you you looked upon simply as decorative figures not as living beings But the worst of all the thing that most revolts me is having a fortune of over a million and doing nothing for other people nothing The princess sat amazed aghast offended not knowing what to say or how to behave She had never before been spoken to in such a tone The doctor s unpleasant angry voice and his clumsy faltering phrases made a harsh clattering noise in her ears and her head Then she began to feel as though the gesticulating doctor was hitting her on the head with his hat It s not true she articulated softly in an imploring voice I ve done a great deal of good for other people you know it yourself Nonsense cried the doctor Can you possibly go on thinking of your philanthropic work as something genuine and useful and not a mere mummery It was a farce from beginning to end it was playing at loving your neighbour the most open farce which even children and stupid peasant women saw through Take for instance your what was it called house for homeless old women without relations of which you made me something like a head doctor and of which you were the patroness Mercy on us What a charming institution it was A house was built with parquet floors and a weathercock on the roof a dozen old women were collected from the villages and made to sleep under blankets and sheets of Dutch linen and given toffee to eat The doctor gave a malignant chuckle into his hat and went on speaking rapidly and stammering It was a farce The attendants kept the sheets and the blankets under lock and key for fear the old women should soil them Let the old devil s pepper pots sleep on the floor The old women did not dare to sit down on the beds to put on their jackets to walk over the polished floors Everything was kept for show and hidden away from the old women as though they were thieves and the old women were clothed and fed on the sly by other people s charity and prayed to God night and day to be released from their prison and from the canting exhortations of the sleek rascals to whose care you committed them And what did the managers do It was simply charming About twice a week there would be thirty five thousand messages to say that the princess that is you were coming to the home next day That meant that next day I had to abandon my patients dress up and be on parade Very good I arrive The old women in everything clean and new are already drawn up in a row waiting Near them struts the old garrison rat the superintendent with his mawkish sneaking smile The old women yawn and exchange glances but are afraid to complain We wait The junior steward gallops up Half an hour later the senior steward then the superintendent of the accounts office then another and then another of them they keep arriving endlessly They all have mysterious solemn faces We wait and wait shift from one leg to another look at the clock all this in monumental silence because we all hate each other like poison One hour passes then a second and then at last the carriage is seen in the distance and and The doctor went off into a shrill laugh and brought out in a shrill voice You get out of the carriage and the old hags at the word of command from the old garrison rat begin chanting The Glory of our Lord in Zion the tongue of man cannot express A pretty scene wasn t it The doctor went off into a bass chuckle and waved his hand as though to signify that he could not utter another word for laughing He laughed heavily harshly with clenched teeth as ill natured people laugh and from his voice from his face from his glittering rather insolent eyes it could be seen that he had a profound contempt for the princess for the home and for the old women There was nothing amusing or laughable in all that he described so clumsily and coarsely but he laughed with satisfaction even with delight And the school he went on panting from laughter Do you remember how you wanted to teach peasant children yourself You must have taught them very well for very soon the children all ran away so that they had to be thrashed and bribed to come and be taught And you remember how you wanted to feed with your own hands the infants whose mothers were working in the fields You went about the village crying because the infants were not at your disposal as the mothers would take them to the fields with them Then the village foreman ordered the mothers by turns to leave their infants behind for your entertainment A strange thing They all ran away from your benevolence like mice from a cat And why was it It s very simple Not because our people are ignorant and ungrateful as you always explained it to yourself but because in all your fads if you ll excuse the word there wasn t a ha p orth of love and kindness There was nothing but the desire to amuse yourself with living puppets nothing else A person who does not feel the difference between a human being and a lap dog ought not to go in for philanthropy I assure you there s a great difference between human beings and lap dogs The princess s heart was beating dreadfully there was a thudding in her ears and she still felt as though the doctor were beating her on the head with his hat The doctor talked quickly excitedly and uncouthly stammering and gesticulating unnecessarily All she grasped was that she was spoken to by a coarse ill bred spiteful and ungrateful man but what he wanted of her and what he was talking about she could not understand Go away she said in a tearful voice putting up her hands to protect her head from the doctor s hat go away And how you treat your servants the doctor went on indignantly You treat them as the lowest scoundrels and don t look upon them as human beings For example allow me to ask why did you dismiss me For ten years I worked for your father and afterwards for you honestly without vacations or holidays I gained the love of all for more than seventy miles round and suddenly one fine day I am informed that I am no longer wanted What for I ve no idea to this day I a doctor of medicine a gentleman by birth a student of the Moscow University father of a family am such a petty insignificant insect that you can kick me out without explaining the reason Why stand on ceremony with me I heard afterwards that my wife went without my knowledge three times to intercede with you for me you wouldn t receive her I am told she cried in your hall And I shall never forgive her for it never The doctor paused and clenched his teeth making an intense effort to think of something more to say very unpleasant and vindictive He thought of something and his cold frowning face suddenly brightened Take your attitude to this monastery he said with avidity You ve never spared any one and the holier the place the more chance of its suffering from your loving kindness and angelic sweetness Why do you come here What do you want with the monks here allow me to ask you What is Hecuba to you or you to Hecuba It s another farce another amusement for you another sacrilege against human dignity and nothing more Why you don t believe in the monks God you ve a God of your own in your heart whom you ve evolved for yourself at spiritualist seances You look with condescension upon the ritual of the Church you don t go to mass or vespers you sleep till midday Why do you come here You come with a God of your own into a monastery you have nothing to do with and you imagine that the monks look upon it as a very great honour To be sure they do You d better ask by the way what your visits cost the monastery You were graciously pleased to arrive here this evening and a messenger from your estate arrived on horseback the day before yesterday to warn them of your coming They were the whole day yesterday getting the rooms ready and expecting you This morning your advance guard arrived an insolent maid who keeps running across the courtyard rustling her skirts pestering them with questions giving orders I can t endure it The monks have been on the lookout all day for if you were not met with due ceremony there would be trouble You d complain to the bishop The monks don t like me your holiness I don t know what I ve done to displease them It s true I m a great sinner but I m so unhappy Already one monastery has been in hot water over you The Father Superior is a busy learned man he hasn t a free moment and you keep sending for him to come to your rooms Not a trace of respect for age or for rank If at least you were a bountiful giver to the monastery one wouldn t resent it so much but all this time the monks have not received a hundred roubles from you Whenever people worried the princess misunderstood her or mortified her and when she did not know what to say or do she usually began to cry And on this occasion too she ended by hiding her face in her hands and crying aloud in a thin treble like a child The doctor suddenly stopped and looked at her His face darkened and grew stern Forgive me Princess he said in a hollow voice I ve given way to a malicious feeling and forgotten myself It was not right And coughing in an embarrassed way he walked away quickly without remembering to put his hat on Stars were already twinkling in the sky The moon must have been rising on the further side of the monastery for the sky was clear soft and transparent Bats were flitting noiselessly along the white monastery wall The clock slowly struck three quarters probably a quarter to nine The princess got up and walked slowly to the gate She felt wounded and was crying and she felt that the trees and the stars and even the bats were pitying her and that the clock struck musically only to express its sympathy with her She cried and thought how nice it would be to go into a monastery for the rest of her life On still summer evenings she would walk alone through the avenues insulted injured misunderstood by people and only God and the starry heavens would see the martyr s tears The evening service was still going on in the church The princess stopped and listened to the singing how beautiful the singing sounded in the still darkness How sweet to weep and suffer to the sound of that singing Going into her rooms she looked at her tear stained face in the glass and powdered it then she sat down to supper The monks knew that she liked pickled sturgeon little mushrooms Malaga and plain honey cakes that left a taste of cypress in the mouth and every time she came they gave her all these dishes As she ate the mushrooms and drank the Malaga the princess dreamed of how she would be finally ruined and deserted how all her stewards bailiffs clerks and maid servants for whom she had done so much would be false to her and begin to say rude things how people all the world over would set upon her speak ill of her jeer at her She would renounce her title would renounce society and luxury and would go into a convent without one word of reproach to any one she would pray for her enemies and then they would all understand her and come to beg her forgiveness but by that time it would be too late After supper she knelt down in the corner before the ikon and read two chapters of the Gospel Then her maid made her bed and she got into it Stretching herself under the white quilt she heaved a sweet deep sigh as one sighs after crying closed her eyes and began to fall asleep In the morning she waked up and glanced at her watch It was half past nine On the carpet near the bed was a bright narrow streak of sunlight from a ray which came in at the window and dimly lighted up the room Flies were buzzing behind the black curtain at the window It s early thought the princess and she closed her eyes Stretching and lying snug in her bed she recalled her meeting yesterday with the doctor and all the thoughts with which she had gone to sleep the night before she remembered she was unhappy Then she thought of her husband living in Petersburg her stewards doctors neighbours the officials of her acquaintance a long procession of familiar masculine faces passed before her imagination She smiled and thought if only these people could see into her heart and understand her they would all be at her feet At a quarter past eleven she called her maid Help me to dress Dasha she said languidly But go first and tell them to get out the horses I must set off for Klavdia Nikolaevna s Going out to get into the carriage she blinked at the glaring daylight and laughed with pleasure it was a wonderfully fine day As she scanned from her half closed eyes the monks who had gathered round the steps to see her off she nodded graciously and said Good bye my friends Till the day after tomorrow It was an agreeable surprise to her that the doctor was with the monks by the steps His face was pale and severe Princess he said with a guilty smile taking off his hat I ve been waiting here a long time to see you Forgive me for God s sake I was carried away yesterday by an evil vindictive feeling and I talked nonsense In short I beg your pardon The princess smiled graciously and held out her hand for him to kiss He kissed it turning red Trying to look like a bird the princess fluttered into the carriage and nodded in all directions There was a gay warm serene feeling in her heart and she felt herself that her smile was particularly soft and friendly As the carriage rolled towards the gates and afterwards along the dusty road past huts and gardens past long trains of waggons and strings of pilgrims on their way to the monastery she still screwed up her eyes and smiled softly She was thinking there was no higher bliss than to bring warmth light and joy wherever one went to forgive injuries to smile graciously on one s enemies The peasants she passed bowed to her the carriage rustled softly clouds of dust rose from under the wheels and floated over the golden rye and it seemed to the princess that her body was swaying not on carriage cushions but on clouds and that she herself was like a light transparent little cloud How happy I am she murmured shutting her eyes How happy I am THE CHEMIST S WIFE THE little town of B consisting of two or three crooked streets was sound asleep There was a complete stillness in the motionless air Nothing could be heard but far away outside the town no doubt the barking of a dog in a thin hoarse tenor It was close upon daybreak Everything had long been asleep The only person not asleep was the young wife of Tchernomordik a qualified dispenser who kept a chemist s shop at B She had gone to bed and got up again three times but could not sleep she did not know why She sat at the open window in her nightdress and looked into the street She felt bored depressed vexed so vexed that she felt quite inclined to cry again she did not know why There seemed to be a lump in her chest that kept rising into her throat A few paces behind her Tchernomordik lay curled up close to the wall snoring sweetly A greedy flea was stabbing the bridge of his nose but he did not feel it and was positively smiling for he was dreaming that every one in the town had a cough and was buying from him the King of Denmark s cough drops He could not have been wakened now by pinpricks or by cannon or by caresses The chemist s shop was almost at the extreme end of the town so that the chemist s wife could see far into the fields She could see the eastern horizon growing pale by degrees then turning crimson as though from a great fire A big broad faced moon peeped out unexpectedly from behind bushes in the distance It was red as a rule when the moon emerges from behind bushes it appears to be blushing Suddenly in the stillness of the night there came the sounds of footsteps and a jingle of spurs She could hear voices That must be the officers going home to the camp from the Police Captain s thought the chemist s wife Soon afterwards two figures wearing officers white tunics came into sight one big and tall the other thinner and shorter They slouched along by the fence dragging one leg after the other and talking loudly together As they passed the chemist s shop they walked more slowly than ever and glanced up at the windows It smells like a chemist s said the thin one And so it is Ah I remember I came here last week to buy some castor oil There s a chemist here with a sour face and the jawbone of an ass Such a jawbone my dear fellow It must have been a jawbone like that Samson killed the Philistines with M yes said the big one in a bass voice The pharmacist is asleep And his wife is asleep too She is a pretty woman Obtyosov I saw her I liked her very much Tell me doctor can she possibly love that jawbone of an ass Can she No most likely she does not love him sighed the doctor speaking as though he were sorry for the chemist The little woman is asleep behind the window Obtyosov what Tossing with the heat her little mouth half open and one little foot hanging out of bed I bet that fool the chemist doesn t realise what a lucky fellow he is No doubt he sees no difference between a woman and a bottle of carbolic I say doctor said the officer stopping Let us go into the shop and buy something Perhaps we shall see her What an idea in the night What of it They are obliged to serve one even at night My dear fellow let us go in If you like The chemist s wife hiding behind the curtain heard a muffled ring Looking round at her husband who was smiling and snoring sweetly as before she threw on her dress slid her bare feet into her slippers and ran to the shop On the other side of the glass door she could see two shadows The chemist s wife turned up the lamp and hurried to the door to open it and now she felt neither vexed nor bored nor inclined to cry though her heart was thumping The big doctor and the slender Obtyosov walked in Now she could get a view of them The doctor was corpulent and swarthy he wore a beard and was slow in his movements At the slightest motion his tunic seemed as though it would crack and perspiration came on to his face The officer was rosy clean shaven feminine looking and as supple as an English whip What may I give you asked the chemist s wife holding her dress across her bosom Give us er er four pennyworth of peppermint lozenges Without haste the chemist s wife took down a jar from a shelf and began weighing out lozenges The customers stared fixedly at her back the doctor screwed up his eyes like a well fed cat while the lieutenant was very grave It s the first time I ve seen a lady serving in a chemist s shop observed the doctor There s nothing out of the way in it replied the chemist s wife looking out of the corner of her eye at the rosy cheeked officer My husband has no assistant and I always help him To be sure You have a charming little shop What a number of different jars And you are not afraid of moving about among the poisons Brrr The chemist s wife sealed up the parcel and handed it to the doctor Obtyosov gave her the money Half a minute of silence followed The men exchanged glances took a step towards the door then looked at one another again Will you give me two pennyworth of soda said the doctor Again the chemist s wife slowly and languidly raised her hand to the shelf Haven t you in the shop anything such as muttered Obtyosov moving his fingers something so to say allegorical revivifying seltzer water for instance Have you any seltzer water Yes answered the chemist s wife Bravo You re a fairy not a woman Give us three bottles The chemist s wife hurriedly sealed up the soda and vanished through the door into the darkness A peach said the doctor with a wink You wouldn t find a pineapple like that in the island of Madeira Eh What do you say Do you hear the snoring though That s his worship the chemist enjoying sweet repose A minute later the chemist s wife came back and set five bottles on the counter She had just been in the cellar and so was flushed and rather excited Sh sh quietly said Obtyosov when after uncorking the bottles she dropped the corkscrew Don t make such a noise you ll wake your husband Well what if I do wake him He is sleeping so sweetly he must be dreaming of you To your health Besides boomed the doctor hiccupping after the seltzer water husbands are such a dull business that it would be very nice of them to be always asleep How good a drop of red wine would be in this water What an idea laughed the chemist s wife That would be splendid What a pity they don t sell spirits in chemist s shops Though you ought to sell wine as a medicine Have you any vinum gallicum rubrum Yes Well then give us some Bring it here damn it How much do you want Quantum satis Give us an ounce each in the water and afterwards we ll see Obtyosov what do you say First with water and afterwards per se The doctor and Obtyosov sat down to the counter took off their caps and began drinking the wine The wine one must admit is wretched stuff Vinum nastissimum Though in the presence of er it tastes like nectar You are enchanting madam In imagination I kiss your hand I would give a great deal to do so not in imagination said Obtyosov On my honour I d give my life That s enough said Madame Tchernomordik flushing and assuming a serious expression What a flirt you are though the doctor laughed softly looking slyly at her from under his brows Your eyes seem to be firing shot piff paff I congratulate you you ve conquered We are vanquished The chemist s wife looked at their ruddy faces listened to their chatter and soon she too grew quite lively Oh she felt so gay She entered into the conversation she laughed flirted and even after repeated requests from the customers drank two ounces of wine You officers ought to come in oftener from the camp she said it s awful how dreary it is here I m simply dying of it I should think so said the doctor indignantly Such a peach a miracle of nature thrown away in the wilds How well Griboyedov said Into the wilds to Saratov It s time for us to be off though Delighted to have made your acquaintance very How much do we owe you The chemist s wife raised her eyes to the ceiling and her lips moved for some time Twelve roubles forty eight kopecks she said Obtyosov took out of his pocket a fat pocket book and after fumbling for some time among the notes paid Your husband s sleeping sweetly he must be dreaming he muttered pressing her hand at parting I don t like to hear silly remarks What silly remarks On the contrary it s not silly at all even Shakespeare said Happy is he who in his youth is young Let go of my hand At last after much talk and after kissing the lady s hand at parting the customers went out of the shop irresolutely as though they were wondering whether they had not forgotten something She ran quickly into the bedroom and sat down in the same place She saw the doctor and the officer on coming out of the shop walk lazily away a distance of twenty paces then they stopped and began whispering together What about Her heart throbbed there was a pulsing in her temples and why she did not know Her heart beat violently as though those two whispering outside were deciding her fate Five minutes later the doctor parted from Obtyosov and walked on while Obtyosov came back He walked past the shop once and a second time He would stop near the door and then take a few steps again At last the bell tinkled discreetly What Who is there the chemist s wife heard her husband s voice suddenly There s a ring at the bell and you don t hear it he said severely Is that the way to do things He got up put on his dressing gown and staggering half asleep flopped in his slippers to the shop What is it he asked Obtyosov Give me give me four pennyworth of peppermint lozenges Sniffing continually yawning dropping asleep as he moved and knocking his knees against the counter the chemist went to the shelf and reached down the jar Two minutes later the chemist s wife saw Obtyosov go out of the shop and after he had gone some steps she saw him throw the packet of peppermints on the dusty road The doctor came from behind a corner to meet him They met and gesticulating vanished in the morning mist How unhappy I am said the chemist s wife looking angrily at her husband who was undressing quickly to get into bed again Oh how unhappy I am she repeated suddenly melting into bitter tears And nobody knows nobody knows I forgot fourpence on the counter muttered the chemist pulling the quilt over him Put it away in the till please And at once he fell asleep again END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DUEL AND
