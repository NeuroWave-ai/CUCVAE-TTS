Wilkie Collins BOOK THE FIRST AT SCHOOL CHAPTER I THE SMUGGLED SUPPER Outside the bedroom the night was black and still The small rain fell too softly to be heard in the garden not a leaf stirred in the airless calm the watch dog was asleep the cats were indoors far or near under the murky heaven not a sound was stirring Inside the bedroom the night was black and still Miss Ladd knew her business as a schoolmistress too well to allow night lights and Miss Ladd s young ladies were supposed to be fast asleep in accordance with the rules of the house Only at intervals the silence was faintly disturbed when the restless turning of one of the girls in her bed betrayed itself by a gentle rustling between the sheets In the long intervals of stillness not even the softly audible breathing of young creatures asleep was to be heard The first sound that told of life and movement revealed the mechanical movement of the clock Speaking from the lower regions the tongue of Father Time told the hour before midnight A soft voice rose wearily near the door of the room It counted the strokes of the clock and reminded one of the girls of the lapse of time Emily eleven o clock There was no reply After an interval the weary voice tried again in louder tones Emily A girl whose bed was at the inner end of the room sighed under the heavy heat of the night and said in peremptory tones Is that Cecilia Yes What do you want I m getting hungry Emily Is the new girl asleep The new girl answered promptly and spitefully No she isn t Having a private object of their own in view the five wise virgins of Miss Ladd s first class had waited an hour in wakeful anticipation of the falling asleep of the stranger and it had ended in this way A ripple of laughter ran round the room The new girl mortified and offended entered her protest in plain words You are treating me shamefully You all distrust me because I am a stranger Say we don t understand you Emily answered speaking for her schoolfellows and you will be nearer the truth Who expected you to understand me when I only came here to day I have told you already my name is Francine de Sor If want to know more I m nineteen years old and I come from the West Indies Emily still took the lead Why do you come here she asked Who ever heard of a girl joining a new school just before the holidays You are nineteen years old are you I m a year younger than you and I have finished my education The next big girl in the room is a year younger than me and she has finished her education What can you possibly have left to learn at your age Everything cried the stranger from the West Indies with an outburst of tears I m a poor ignorant creature Your education ought to have taught you to pity me instead of making fun of me I hate you all For shame for shame Some of the girls laughed One of them the hungry girl who had counted the strokes of the clock took Francine s part Never mind their laughing Miss de Sor You are quite right you have good reason to complain of us Miss de Sor dried her eyes Thank you whoever you are she answered briskly My name is Cecilia Wyvil the other proceeded It was not perhaps quite nice of you to say you hated us all At the same time we have forgotten our good breeding and the least we can do is to beg your pardon This expression of generous sentiment appeared to have an irritating effect on the peremptory young person who took the lead in the room Perhaps she disapproved of free trade in generous sentiment I can tell you one thing Cecilia she said you shan t beat ME in generosity Strike a light one of you and lay the blame on me if Miss Ladd finds us out I mean to shake hands with the new girl and how can I do it in the dark Miss de Sor my name s Brown and I m queen of the bedroom I not Cecilia offer our apologies if we have offended you Cecilia is my dearest friend but I don t allow her to take the lead in the room Oh what a lovely nightgown The sudden flow of candle light had revealed Francine sitting up in her bed and displaying such treasures of real lace over her bosom that the queen lost all sense of royal dignity in irrepressible admiration Seven and sixpence Emily remarked looking at her own night gown and despising it One after another the girls yielded to the attraction of the wonderful lace Slim and plump fair and dark they circled round the new pupil in their flowing white robes and arrived by common consent at one and the same conclusion How rich her father must be Favored by fortune in the matter of money was this enviable person possessed of beauty as well In the disposition of the beds Miss de Sor was placed between Cecilia on the right hand and Emily on the left If by some fantastic turn of events a man say in the interests of propriety a married doctor with Miss Ladd to look after him had been permitted to enter the room and had been asked what he thought of the girls when he came out he would not even have mentioned Francine Blind to the beauties of the expensive night gown he would have noticed her long upper lip her obstinate chin her sallow complexion her eyes placed too close together and would have turned his attention to her nearest neighbors On one side his languid interest would have been instantly roused by Cecilia s glowing auburn hair her exquisitely pure skin and her tender blue eyes On the other he would have discovered a bright little creature who would have fascinated and perplexed him at one and the same time If he had been questioned about her by a stranger he would have been at a loss to say positively whether she was dark or light he would have remembered how her eyes had held him but he would not have known of what color they were And yet she would have remained a vivid picture in his memory when other impressions derived at the same time had vanished There was one little witch among them who was worth all the rest put together and I can t tell you why They called her Emily If I wasn t a married man There he would have thought of his wife and would have sighed and said no more While the girls were still admiring Francine the clock struck the half hour past eleven Cecilia stole on tiptoe to the door looked out and listened closed the door again and addressed the meeting with the irresistible charm of her sweet voice and her persuasive smile Are none of you hungry yet she inquired The teachers are safe in their rooms we have set ourselves right with Francine Why keep the supper waiting under Emily s bed Such reasoning as this with such personal attractions to recommend it admitted of but one reply The queen waved her hand graciously and said Pull it out Is a lovely girl whose face possesses the crowning charm of expression whose slightest movement reveals the supple symmetry of her figure less lovely because she is blessed with a good appetite and is not ashamed to acknowledge it With a grace all her own Cecilia dived under the bed and produced a basket of jam tarts a basket of fruit and sweetmeats a basket of sparkling lemonade and a superb cake all paid for by general subscriptions and smuggled into the room by kind connivance of the servants On this occasion the feast was especially plentiful and expensive in commemoration not only of the arrival of the Midsummer holidays but of the coming freedom of Miss Ladd s two leading young ladies With widely different destinies before them Emily and Cecilia had completed their school life and were now to go out into the world The contrast in the characters of the two girls showed itself even in such a trifle as the preparations for supper Gentle Cecilia sitting on the floor surrounded by good things left it to the ingenuity of others to decide whether the baskets should be all emptied at once or handed round from bed to bed one at a time In the meanwhile her lovely blue eyes rested tenderly on the tarts Emily s commanding spirit seized on the reins of government and employed each of her schoolfellows in the occupation which she was fittest to undertake Miss de Sor let me look at your hand Ah I thought so You have got the thickest wrist among us you shall draw the corks If you let the lemonade pop not a drop of it goes down your throat Effie Annis Priscilla you are three notoriously lazy girls it s doing you a true kindness to set you to work Effie clear the toilet table for supper away with the combs the brushes and the looking glass Annis tear the leaves out of your book of exercises and set them out for plates No I ll unpack nobody touches the baskets but me Priscilla you have the prettiest ears in the room You shall act as sentinel my dear and listen at the door Cecilia when you have done devouring those tarts with your eyes take that pair of scissors Miss de Sor allow me to apologize for the mean manner in which this school is carried on the knives and forks are counted and locked up every night I say take that pair of scissors Cecilia and carve the cake and don t keep the largest bit for yourself Are we all ready Very well Now take example by me Talk as much as you like so long as you don t talk too loud There is one other thing before we begin The men always propose toasts on these occasions let s be like the men Can any of you make a speech Ah it falls on me as usual I propose the first toast Down with all schools and teachers especially the new teacher who came this half year Oh mercy how it stings The fixed gas in the lemonade took the orator at that moment by the throat and effectually checked the flow of her eloquence It made no difference to the girls Excepting the ease of feeble stomachs who cares for eloquence in the presence of a supper table There were no feeble stomachs in that bedroom With what inexhaustible energy Miss Ladd s young ladies ate and drank How merrily they enjoyed the delightful privilege of talking nonsense And alas alas how vainly they tried in after life to renew the once unalloyed enjoyment of tarts and lemonade In the unintelligible scheme of creation there appears to be no human happiness not even the happiness of schoolgirls which is ever complete Just as it was drawing to a close the enjoyment of the feast was interrupted by an alarm from the sentinel at the door Put out the candle Priscilla whispered Somebody on the stairs CHAPTER II BIOGRAPHY IN THE BEDROOM The candle was instantly extinguished In discreet silence the girls stole back to their beds and listened As an aid to the vigilance of the sentinel the door had been left ajar Through the narrow opening a creaking of the broad wooden stairs of the old house became audible In another moment there was silence An interval passed and the creaking was heard again This time the sound was distant and diminishing On a sudden it stopped The midnight silence was disturbed no more What did this mean Had one among the many persons in authority under Miss Ladd s roof heard the girls talking and ascended the stairs to surprise them in the act of violating one of the rules of the house So far such a proceeding was by no means uncommon But was it within the limits of probability that a teacher should alter her opinion of her own duty half way up the stairs and deliberately go back to her own room again The bare idea of such a thing was absurd on the face of it What more rational explanation could ingenuity discover on the spur of the moment Francine was the first to offer a suggestion She shook and shivered in her bed and said For heaven s sake light the candle again It s a Ghost Clear away the supper you fools before the ghost can report us to Miss Ladd With this excellent advice Emily checked the rising panic The door was closed the candle was lit all traces of the supper disappeared For five minutes more they listened again No sound came from the stairs no teacher or ghost of a teacher appeared at the door Having eaten her supper Cecilia s immediate anxieties were at an end she was at leisure to exert her intelligence for the benefit of her schoolfellows In her gentle ingratiating way she offered a composing suggestion When we heard the creaking I don t believe there was anybody on the stairs In these old houses there are always strange noises at night and they say the stairs here were made more than two hundred years since The girls looked at each other with a sense of relief but they waited to hear the opinion of the queen Emily as usual justified the confidence placed in her She discovered an ingenious method of putting Cecilia s suggestion to the test Let s go on talking she said If Cecilia is right the teachers are all asleep and we have nothing to fear from them If she s wrong we shall sooner or later see one of them at the door Don t be alarmed Miss de Sor Catching us talking at night in this school only means a reprimand Catching us with a light ends in punishment Blow out the candle Francine s belief in the ghost was too sincerely superstitious to be shaken she started up in bed Oh don t leave me in the dark I ll take the punishment if we are found out On your sacred word of honor Emily stipulated Yes yes The queen s sense of humor was tickled There s something funny she remarked addressing her subjects in a big girl like this coming to a new school and beginning with a punishment May I ask if you are a foreigner Miss de Sor My papa is a Spanish gentleman Francine answered with dignity And your mamma My mamma is English And you have always lived in the West Indies I have always lived in the Island of saint Domingo Emily checked off on her fingers the different points thus far discovered in the character of mister de Sor s daughter She s ignorant and superstitious and foreign and rich My dear forgive the familiarity you are an interesting girl and we must really know more of you Entertain the bedroom What have you been about all your life And what in the name of wonder brings you here Before you begin I insist on one condition in the name of all the young ladies in the room No useful information about the West Indies Francine disappointed her audience She was ready enough to make herself an object of interest to her companions but she was not possessed of the capacity to arrange events in their proper order necessary to the recital of the simplest narrative Emily was obliged to help her by means of questions In one respect the result justified the trouble taken to obtain it A sufficient reason was discovered for the extraordinary appearance of a new pupil on the day before the school closed for the holidays mister de Sor s elder brother had left him an estate in saint Domingo and a fortune in money as well on the one easy condition that he continued to reside in the island The question of expense being now beneath the notice of the family Francine had been sent to England especially recommended to Miss Ladd as a young lady with grand prospects sorely in need of a fashionable education The voyage had been so timed by the advice of the schoolmistress as to make the holidays a means of obtaining this object privately Francine was to be taken to Brighton where excellent masters could be obtained to assist Miss Ladd With six weeks before her she might in some degree make up for lost time and when the school opened again she would avoid the mortification of being put down in the lowest class along with the children The examination of Miss de Sor having produced these results was pursued no further Her character now appeared in a new and not very attractive light She audaciously took to herself the whole credit of telling her story I think it s my turn now she said to be interested and amused May I ask you to begin Miss Emily All I know of you at present is t hat your family name is Brown Emily held up her hand for silence Was the mysterious creaking on the stairs making itself heard once more No The sound that had caught Emily s quick ear came from the beds on the opposite side of the room occupied by the three lazy girls With no new alarm to disturb them Effie Annis and Priscilla had yielded to the composing influences of a good supper and a warm night They were fast asleep and the stoutest of the three softly as became a young lady was snoring The unblemished reputation of the bedroom was dear to Emily in her capacity of queen She felt herself humiliated in the presence of the new pupil If that fat girl ever gets a lover she said indignantly I shall consider it my duty to warn the poor man before he marries her Her ridiculous name is Euphemia I have christened her far more appropriately Boiled Veal No color in her hair no color in her eyes no color in her complexion In short no flavor in Euphemia You naturally object to snoring Pardon me if I turn my back on you I am going to throw my slipper at her The soft voice of Cecilia suspiciously drowsy in tone interposed in the interests of mercy She can t help it poor thing and she really isn t loud enough to disturb us She won t disturb you at any rate Rouse yourself Cecilia We are wide awake on this side of the room and Francine says it s our turn to amuse her A low murmur dying away gently in a sigh was the only answer Sweet Cecilia had yielded to the somnolent influences of the supper and the night The soft infection of repose seemed to be in some danger of communicating itself to Francine Her large mouth opened luxuriously in a long continued yawn Good night said Emily Miss de Sor became wide awake in an instant No she said positively you are quite mistaken if you think I am going to sleep Please exert yourself Miss Emily I am waiting to be interested Emily appeared to be unwilling to exert herself She preferred talking of the weather Isn t the wind rising she said There could be no doubt of it The leaves in the garden were beginning to rustle and the pattering of the rain sounded on the windows Francine as her straight chin proclaimed to all students of physiognomy was an obstinate girl Determined to carry her point she tried Emily s own system on Emily herself she put questions Have you been long at this school More than three years Have you got any brothers and sisters I am the only child Are your father and mother alive Emily suddenly raised herself in bed Wait a minute she said I think I hear it again The creaking on the stairs Yes Either she was mistaken or the change for the worse in the weather made it not easy to hear slight noises in the house The wind was still rising The passage of it through the great trees in the garden began to sound like the fall of waves on a distant beach It drove the rain a heavy downpour by this time rattling against the windows Almost a storm isn t it Emily said Francine s last question had not been answered yet She took the earliest opportunity of repeating it Never mind the weather she said Tell me about your father and mother Are they both alive Emily s reply only related to one of her parents My mother died before I was old enough to feel my loss And your father Emily referred to another relative her father s sister Since I have grown up she proceeded my good aunt has been a second mother to me My story is in one respect the reverse of yours You are unexpectedly rich and I am unexpectedly poor My aunt s fortune was to have been my fortune if I outlived her She has been ruined by the failure of a bank In her old age she must live on an income of two hundred a year and I must get my own living when I leave school Surely your father can help you Francine persisted His property is landed property Her voice faltered as she referred to him even in that indirect manner It is entailed his nearest male relative inherits it The delicacy which is easily discouraged was not one of the weaknesses in the nature of Francine Do I understand that your father is dead she asked Our thick skinned fellow creatures have the rest of us at their mercy only give them time and they carry their point in the end In sad subdued tones telling of deeply rooted reserves of feeling seldom revealed to strangers Emily yielded at last Yes she said my father is dead Long ago Some people might think it long ago I was very fond of my father It s nearly four years since he died and my heart still aches when I think of him I m not easily depressed by troubles Miss de Sor But his death was sudden he was in his grave when I first heard of it and Oh he was so good to me he was so good to me The gay high spirited little creature who took the lead among them all who was the life and soul of the school hid her face in her hands and burst out crying Startled and to do her justice ashamed Francine attempted to make excuses Emily s generous nature passed over the cruel persistency that had tortured her No no I have nothing to forgive It isn t your fault Other girls have not mothers and brothers and sisters and get reconciled to such a loss as mine Don t make excuses Yes but I want you to know that I feel for you Francine insisted without the slightest approach to sympathy in face voice or manner When my uncle died and left us all the money papa was much shocked He trusted to time to help him Time has been long about it with me Francine I am afraid there is something perverse in my nature the hope of meeting again in a better world seems so faint and so far away No more of it now Let us talk of that good creature who is asleep on the other side of you Did I tell you that I must earn my own bread when I leave school Well Cecilia has written home and found an employment for me Not a situation as governess something quite out of the common way You shall hear all about it In the brief interval that had passed the weather had begun to change again The wind was as high as ever but to judge by the lessening patter on the windows the rain was passing away Emily began She was too grateful to her friend and school fellow and too deeply interested in her story to notice the air of indifference with which Francine settled herself on her pillow to hear the praises of Cecilia The most beautiful girl in the school was not an object of interest to a young lady with an obstinate chin and unfortunately placed eyes Pouring warm from the speaker s heart the story ran smoothly on to the monotonous accompaniment of the moaning wind By fine degrees Francine s eyes closed opened and closed again Toward the latter part of the narrative Emily s memory became for the moment only confused between two events She stopped to consider noticed Francine s silence in an interval when she might have said a word of encouragement and looked closer at her Miss de Sor was asleep She might have told me she was tired Emily said to herself quietly Well the best thing I can do is to put out the light and follow her example As she took up the extinguisher the bedroom door was suddenly opened from the outer side A tall woman robed in a black dressing gown stood on the threshold looking at Emily CHAPTER III THE LATE mister BROWN The woman s lean long fingered hand pointed to the candle Don t put it out Saying those words she looked round the room and satisfied herself that the other girls were asleep Emily laid down the extinguisher You mean to report us of course she said I am the only one awake Miss Jethro lay the blame on me I have no intention of reporting you But I have something to say She paused and pushed her thick black hair already streaked with gray back from her temples Her eyes large and dark and dim rested on Emily with a sorrowful interest When your young friends wake to morrow morning she went on you can tell them that the new teacher whom nobody likes has left the school For once even quick witted Emily was bewildered Going away she said when you have only been here since Easter Miss Jethro advanced not noticing Emily s expression of surprise I am not very strong at the best of times she continued may I sit down on your bed Remarkable on other occasions for her cold composure her voice trembled as she made that request a strange request surely when there were chairs at her disposal Emily made room for her with the dazed look of a girl in a dream I beg your pardon Miss Jethro one of the things I can t endure is being puzzled If you don t mean to report us why did you come in and catch me with the light Miss Jethro s explanation was far from relieving the perplexity which her conduct had caused I have been mean enough she answered to listen at the door and I heard you talking of your father I want to hear more about him That is why I came in You knew my father Emily exclaimed I believe I knew him But his name is so common there are so many thousands of James Browns in England that I am in fear of making a mistake I heard you say that he died nearly four years since Can you mention any particulars which might help to enlighten me If you think I am taking a liberty Emily stopped her I would help you if I could she said But I was in poor health at the time and I was staying with friends far away in Scotland to try change of air The news of my father s death brought on a relapse Weeks passed before I was strong enough to travel weeks and weeks before I saw his grave I can only tell you what I know from my aunt He died of heart complaint Miss Jethro started Emily looked at her for the first time with eyes that betrayed a feeling of distrust What have I said to startle you she asked Nothing I am nervous in stormy weather don t notice me She went on abruptly with her inquiries Will you tell me the date of your father s death The date was the thirtieth of September nearly four years since She waited after that reply Miss Jethro was silent And this Emily continued is the thirtieth of June eighteen hundred and eighty one You can now judge for yourself Did you know my father Miss Jethro answered mechanically using the same words I did know your father Emily s feeling of distrust was not set at rest I never heard him speak of you she said In her younger days the teacher must have been a handsome woman Her grandly formed features still suggested the idea of imperial beauty perhaps Jewish in its origin When Emily said I never heard him speak of you the color flew into her pallid cheeks her dim eyes became alive again with a momentary light She left her seat on the bed and turning away mastered the emotion that shook her How hot the night is she said and sighed and resumed the subject with a steady countenance I am not surprised that your father never mentioned me to you She spoke quietly but her face was paler than ever She sat down again on the bed Is there anything I can do for you she asked before I go away Oh I only mean some trifling service that would lay you under no obligation and would not oblige you to keep up your acquaintance with me Her eyes the dim black eyes that must once have been irresistibly beautiful looked at Emily so sadly that the generous girl reproached herself for having doubted her father s friend Are you thinking of him she said gently when you ask if you can be of service to me Miss Jethro made no direct reply You were fond of your father she added in a whisper You told your schoolfellow that your heart still aches when you speak of him I only told her the truth Emily answered simply Miss Jethro shuddered on that hot night shuddered as if a chill had struck her Emily held out her hand the kind feeling that had been roused in her glittered prettily in her eyes I am afraid I have not done you justice she said Will you forgive me and shake hands Miss Jethro rose and drew back Look at the light she exclaimed The candle was all burned out Emily still offered her hand and still Miss Jethro refused to see it There is just light enough left she said to show me my way to the door Good night and good by Emily caught at her dress and stopped her Why won t you shake hands with me she asked The wick of the candle fell over in the socket and left them in the dark Emily resolutely held the teacher s dress With or without light she was still bent on making Miss Jethro explain herself They had throughout spoken in guarded tones fearing to disturb the sleeping girls The sudden darkness had its inevitable effect Their voices sank to whispers now My father s friend Emily pleaded is surely my friend Drop the subject Why You can never be my friend Why not Let me go Emily s sense of self respect forbade her to persist any longer I beg your pardon for having kept you here against your will she said and dropped her hold on the dress Miss Jethro instantly yielded on her side I am sorry to have been obstinate she answered If you do despise me it is after all no more than I have deserved Her hot breath beat on Emily s face the unhappy woman must have bent over the bed as she made her confession I am not a fit person for you to associate with I don t believe it Miss Jethro sighed bitterly Young and warm hearted I was once like you She controlled that outburst of despair Her next words were spoken in steadier tones You will have it you shall have it she said Some one in this house or out of it I don t know which has betrayed me to the mistress of the school A wretch in my situation suspects everybody and worse still does it without reason or excuse I heard you girls talking when you ought to have been asleep You all dislike me How did I know it mightn t be one of you Absurd to a person with a well balanced mind I went halfway up the stairs and felt ashamed of myself and went back to my room If I could only have got some rest Ah well it was not to be done My own vile suspicions kept me awake I left my bed again You know what I heard on the other side of that door and why I was interested in hearing it Your father never told me he had a daughter Miss Brown at this school was any Miss Brown to me I had no idea of who you really were until to night I m wandering What does all this matter to you Miss Ladd has been merciful she lets me go without exposing me You can guess what has happened No Not even yet Is it innocence or kindness that makes you so slow to understand My dear I have obtained admission to this respectable house by means of false references and I have been discovered Now you know why you must not be the friend of such a woman as I am Once more good night and good by Emily shrank from that miserable farewell Bid me good night she said but don t bid me good by Let me see you again Never The sound of the softly closed door was just audible in the darkness She had spoken she had gone never to be seen by Emily again Miserable interesting unfathomable creature the problem that night of Emily s waking thoughts the phantom of her dreams Bad or good she asked herself False for she listened at the door True for she told me the tale of her own disgrace A friend of my father and she never knew that he had a daughter Refined accomplished lady like and she stoops to use a false reference Who is to reconcile such contradictions as these Dawn looked in at the window dawn of the memorable day which was for Emily the beginning of a new life The years were before her and the years in their course reveal baffling mysteries of life and death CHAPTER IV MISS LADD S DRAWING MASTER Francine was awakened the next morning by one of the housemaids bringing up her breakfast on a tray Astonished at this concession to laziness in an institution devoted to the practice of all virtues she looked round The bedroom was deserted The other young ladies are as busy as bees miss the housemaid explained They were up and dressed two hours ago and the breakfast has been cleared away long since It s Miss Emily s fault She wouldn t allow them to wake you she said you could be of no possible use downstairs and you had better be treated like a visitor Miss Cecilia was so distressed at your missing your breakfast that she spoke to the housekeeper and I was sent up to you Please to excuse it if the tea s cold This is Grand Day and we are all topsy turvy in consequence Inquiring what Grand Day meant and why it produced this extraordinary result in a ladies school Francine discovered that the first day of the vacation was devoted to the distribution of prizes in the presence of parents guardians and friends An Entertainment was added comprising those merciless tests of human endurance called Recitations light refreshments and musical performances being distributed at intervals to encourage the exhausted audience The local newspaper sent a reporter to describe the proceedings and some of Miss Ladd s young ladies enjoyed the intoxicating luxury of seeing their names in print It begins at three o clock the housemaid went on and what with practicing and rehearsing and ornamenting the schoolroom there s a hubbub fit to make a person s head spin Besides which said the girl lowering her voice and approaching a little nearer to Francine we have all been taken by surprise The first thing in the morning Miss Jethro left us without saying good by to anybody Who is Miss Jethro The new teacher miss We none of us liked her and we all suspect there s something wrong Miss Ladd and the clergyman had a long talk together yesterday in private you know and they sent for Miss Jethro which looks bad doesn t it Is there anything more I can do for you miss It s a beautiful day after the rain If I was you I should go and enjoy myself in the garden Having finished her breakfast Francine decided on profiting by this sensible suggestion The servant who showed her the way to the garden was not favorably impressed by the new pupil Francine s temper asserted itself a little too plainly in her face To a girl possessing a high opinion of her own importance it was not very agreeable to feel herself excluded as an illiterate stranger from the one absorbing interest of her schoolfellows Will the time ever come she wondered bitterly when I shall win a prize and sing and play before all the company How I should enjoy making the girls envy me A broad lawn overshadowed at one end by fine old trees flower beds and shrubberies and winding paths prettily and invitingly laid out made the garden a welcome refuge on that fine summer morning The novelty of the scene after her experience in the West Indies the delicious breezes cooled by the rain of the night exerted their cheering influence even on the sullen disposition of Francine She smiled in spite of herself as she followed the pleasant paths and heard the birds singing their summer songs over her head Wandering among the trees which occupied a considerable extent of ground she passed into an open space beyond and discovered an old fish pond overgrown by aquatic plants Driblets of water trickled from a dilapidated fountain in the middle On the further side of the pond the ground sloped downward toward the south and revealed over a low paling a pretty view of a village and its church backed by fir woods mounting the heathy sides of a range of hills beyond A fanciful little wooden building imitating the form of a Swiss cottage was placed so as to command the prospect Near it in the shadow of the building stood a rustic chair and table with a color box on one and a portfolio on the other Fluttering over the grass at the mercy of the capricious breeze was a neglected sheet of drawing paper Francine ran round the pond and picked up the paper just as it was on the point of being tilted into the water It contained a sketch in water colors of the village and the woods and Francine had looked at the view itself with indifference the picture of the view interested her Ordinary visitors to Galleries of Art which admit students show the same strange perversity The work of the copyist commands their whole attention they take no interest in the original picture Looking up from the sketch Francine was startled She discovered a man at the window of the Swiss summer house watching her When you have done with that drawing he said quietly please let me have it back again He was tall and thin and dark His finely shaped intelligent face hidden as to the lower part of it by a curly black beard would have been absolutely handsome even in the eyes of a schoolgirl but for the deep furrows that marked it prematurely between the eyebrows and at the sides of the mouth In the same way an underlying mockery impaired the attraction of his otherwise refined and gentle manner Among his fellow creatures children and dogs were the only critics who appreciated his merits without discovering the defects which lessened the favorable appreciation of him by men and women He dressed neatly but his morning coat was badly made and his picturesque felt hat was too old In short there seemed to be no good quality about him which was not perversely associated with a drawback of some kind He was one of those harmless and luckless men possessed of excellent qualities who fail nevertheless to achieve popularity in their social sphere Francine handed his sketch to him through the window doubtful whether the words that he had addressed to her were spoken in jest or in earnest I only presumed to touch your drawing she said because it was in danger What danger he inquired Francine pointed to the pond If I had not been in time to pick it up it would have been blown into the water Do you think it was worth picking up Putting that question he looked first at the sketch then at the view which it represented then back again at the sketch The corners of his mouth turned upward with a humorous expression of scorn Madam Nature he said I beg your pardon With those words he composedly tore his work of art into small pieces and scattered them out of the window What a pity said Francine He joined her on the ground outside the cottage Why is it a pity he asked Such a nice drawing It isn t a nice drawing You re not very polite sir He looked at her and sighed as if he pitied so young a woman for having a temper so ready to take offense In his flattest contradictions he always preserved the character of a politely positive man Put it in plain words miss he replied I have offended the predominant sense in your nature your sense of self esteem You don t like to be told even indirectly that you know nothing of Art In these days everybody knows everything and thinks nothing worth knowing after all But beware how you presume on an appearance of indifference which is nothing but conceit in disguise The ruling passion of civilized humanity is Conceit You may try the regard of your dearest friend in any other way and be forgiven Ruffle the smooth surface of your friend s self esteem and there will be an acknowledged coolness between you which will last for life Excuse me for giving you the benefit of my trumpery experience This sort of smart talk is my form of conceit Can I be of use to you in some better way Are you looking for one of our young ladies Francine began to feel a certain reluctant interest in him when he spoke of our young ladies She asked if he belonged to the school The corners of his mouth turned up again I m one of the masters he said Are you going to belong to the school too Francine bent her head with a gravity and condescension intended to keep him at his proper distance Far from being discouraged he permitted his curiosity to take additional liberties Are you to have the misfortune of being one of my pupils he asked I don t know who you are You won t be much wiser when you do know My name is Alban Morris Francine corrected herself I mean I don t know what you teach Alban Morris pointed to the fragments of his sketch from Nature I am a bad artist he said Some bad artists become Royal Academicians Some take to drink Some get a pension And some I am one of them find refuge in schools Drawing is an Extra at this school Will you take my advice Spare your good father s pocket say you don t want to learn to draw He was so gravely in earnest that Francine burst out laughing You are a strange man she said Wrong again miss I am only an unhappy man The furrows in his face deepened the latent humor died out of his eyes He turned to the summer house window and took up a pipe and tobacco pouch left on the ledge I lost my only friend last year he said Since the death of my dog my pipe is the one companion I have left Naturally I am not allowed to enjoy the honest fellow s society in the presence of ladies They have their own taste in perfumes Their clothes and their letters reek with the foetid secretion of the musk deer The clean vegetable smell of tobacco is unendurable to them Allow me to retire and let me thank you for the trouble you took to save my drawing The tone of indifference in which he expressed his gratitude piqued Francine She resented it by drawing her own conclusion from what he had said of the ladies and the musk deer I was wrong in admiring your drawing she remarked and wrong again in thinking you a strange man Am I wrong for the third time in believing that you dislike women I am sorry to say you are right Alban Morris answered gravely Is there not even one exception The instant the words passed her lips she saw that there was some secretly sensitive feeling in him which she had hurt His black brows gathered into a frown his piercing eyes looked at her with angry surprise It was over in a moment He raised his shabby hat and made her a bow There is a sore place still left in me he said and you have innocently hit it Good morning Before she could speak again he had turned the corner of the summer house and was lost to view in a shrubbery on the westward side of the grounds CHAPTER V DISCOVERIES IN THE GARDEN Left by herself Miss de Sor turned back again by way of the trees So far her interview with the drawing master had helped to pass the time Some girls might have found it no easy task to arrive at a true view of the character of Alban Morris Francine s essentially superficial observation set him down as a little mad and left him there judged and dismissed to her own entire satisfaction Arriving at the lawn she discovered Emily pacing backward and forward with her head down and her hands behind her deep in thought Francine s high opinion of herself would have carried her past any of the other girls unless they had made special advances to her She stopped and looked at Emily It is the sad fate of little women in general to grow too fat and to be born with short legs Emily s slim finely strung figure spoke for itself as to the first of these misfortunes and asserted its happy freedom from the second if she only walked across a room Nature had built her from head to foot on a skeleton scaffolding in perfect proportion Tall or short matters little to the result in women who possess the first and foremost advantage of beginning well in their bones When they live to old age they often astonish thoughtless men who walk behind them in the street I give you my honor she was as easy and upright as a young girl and when you got in front of her and looked white hair and seventy years of age Francine approached Emily moved by a rare impulse in her nature the impulse to be sociable You look out of spirits she began Surely you don t regret leaving school In her present mood Emily took the opportunity in the popular phrase of snubbing Francine You have guessed wrong I do regret she answered I have found in Cecilia my dearest friend at school And school brought with it the change in my life which has helped me to bear the loss of my father If you must know what I was thinking of just now I was thinking or my aunt She has not answered my last letter and I m beginning to be afraid she is ill I m very sorry said Francine Why You don t know my aunt and you have only known me since yesterday afternoon Why are you sorry Francine remained silent Without realizing it she was beginning to feel the dominant influence that Emily exercised over the weaker natures that came in contact with her To find herself irresistibly attracted by a stranger at a new school an unfortunate little creature whose destiny was to earn her own living filled the narrow mind of Miss de Sor with perplexity Having waited in vain for a reply Emily turned away and resumed the train of thought which her schoolfellow had interrupted By an association of ideas of which she was not herself aware she now passed from thinking of her aunt to thinking of Miss Jethro The interview of the previous night had dwelt on her mind at intervals in the hours of the new day Acting on instinct rather than on reason she had kept that remarkable incident in her school life a secret from every one No discoveries had been made by other persons In speaking to her staff of teachers Miss Ladd had alluded to the affair in the most cautious terms Circumstances of a private nature have obliged the lady to retire from my school When we meet after the holidays another teacher will be in her place There Miss Ladd s explanation had begun and ended Inquiries addressed to the servants had led to no result Miss Jethro s luggage was to be forwarded to the London terminus of the railway and Miss Jethro herself had baffled investigation by leaving the school on foot Emily s interest in the lost teacher was not the transitory interest of curiosity her father s mysterious friend was a person whom she honestly desired to see again Perplexed by the difficulty of finding a means of tracing Miss Jethro she reached the shady limit of the trees and turned to walk back again Approaching the place at which she and Francine had met an idea occurred to her It was just possible that Miss Jethro might not be unknown to her aunt Still meditating on the cold reception that she had encountered and still feeling the influence which mastered her in spite of herself Francine interpreted Emily s return as an implied expression of regret She advanced with a constrained smile and spoke first How are the young ladies getting on in the schoolroom she asked by way of renewing the conversation Emily s face assumed a look of surprise which said plainly Can t you take a hint and leave me to myself Francine was constitutionally impenetrable to reproof of this sort her thick skin was not even tickled Why are you not helping them she went on you who have the clearest head among us and take the lead in everything It may be a humiliating confession to make yet it is surely true that we are all accessible to flattery Different tastes appreciate different methods of burning incense but the perfume is more or less agreeable to all varieties of noses Francine s method had its tranquilizing effect on Emily She answered indulgently Miss de Sor I have nothing to do with it Nothing to do with it No prizes to win before you leave school I won all the prizes years ago But there are recitations Surely you recite Harmless words in themselves pursuing the same smooth course of flattery as before but with what a different result Emily s face reddened with anger the moment they were spoken Having already irritated Alban Morris unlucky Francine by a second mischievous interposition of accident had succeeded in making Emily smart next Who has told you she burst out I insist on knowing Nobody has told me anything Francine declared piteously Nobody has told you how I have been insulted No indeed Oh Miss Brown who could insult you In a man the sense of injury does sometimes submit to the discipline of silence In a woman never Suddenly reminded of her past wrongs by the pardonable error of a polite schoolfellow Emily committed the startling inconsistency of appealing to the sympathies of Francine Would you believe it I have been forbidden to recite I the head girl of the school Oh not to day It happened a month ago when we were all in consultation making our arrangements Miss Ladd asked me if I had decided on a piece to recite I said I have not only decided I have learned the piece And what may it be The dagger scene in Macbeth There was a howl I can call it by no other name a howl of indignation A man s soliloquy and worse still a murdering man s soliloquy recited by one of Miss Ladd s young ladies before an audience of parents and guardians That was the tone they took with me I was as firm as a rock The dagger scene or nothing The result is nothing An insult to Shakespeare and an insult to Me I felt it I feel it still I was prepared for any sacrifice in the cause of the drama If Miss Ladd had met me in a proper spirit do you know what I would have done I would have played Macbeth in costume Just hear me and judge for yourself I begin with a dreadful vacancy in my eyes and a hollow moaning in my voice Is this a dagger that I see before me Reciting with her face toward the trees Emily started dropped the character of Macbeth and instantly became herself again herself with a rising color and an angry brightening of the eyes Excuse me I can t trust my memory I must get the play With that abrupt apology she walked away rapidly in the direction of the house In some surprise Francine turned and looked at the trees She discovered in full retreat on his side the eccentric drawing master Alban Morris Did he too admire the dagger scene And was he modestly desirous of hearing it recited without showing himself In that case why should Emily whose besetting weakness was certainly not want of confidence in her own resources leave the garden the moment she caught sight of him Francine consulted her instincts She had just arrived at a conclusion which expressed itself outwardly by a malicious smile when gentle Cecilia appeared on the lawn a lovable object in a broad straw hat and a white dress with a nosegay in her bosom smiling and fanning herself It s so hot in the schoolroom she said and some of the girls poor things are so ill tempered at rehearsal I have made my escape I hope you got your breakfast Miss de Sor What have you been doing here all by yourself I have been making an interesting discovery Francine replied An interesting discovery in our garden What can it be The drawing master my dear is in love with Emily Perhaps she doesn t care about him Or perhaps I have been an innocent obstacle in the way of an appointment between them Cecilia had breakfasted to her heart s content on her favorite dish buttered eggs She was in such good spirits that she was inclined to be coquettish even when there was no man present to fascinate We are not allowed to talk about love in this school she said and hid her face behind her fan Besides if it came to Miss Ladd s ears poor mister Morris might lose his situation But isn t it true asked Francine It may be true my dear but nobody knows Emily hasn t breathed a word about it to any of us And mister Morris keeps his own secret Now and then we catch him looking at her and we draw our own conclusions Did you meet Emily on your way here Yes and she passed without speaking to me Thinking perhaps of mister Morris Cecilia shook her head Thinking Francine of the new life before her and regretting I am afraid that she ever confided her hopes and wishes to me Did she tell you last night what her prospects are when she leaves school She told me you had been very kind in helping her I daresay I should have heard more if I had not fallen asleep What is she going to do To live in a dull house far away in the north Cecilia answered with only old people in it She will have to write and translate for a great scholar who is studying mysterious inscriptions hieroglyphics I think they are called found among the ruins of Central America It s really no laughing matter Francine Emily made a joke of it too I ll take anything but a situation as a governess she said the children who have Me to teach them would be to be pitied indeed She begged and prayed me to help her to get an honest living What could I do I could only write home to papa He is a member of Parliament and everybody who wants a place seems to think he is bound to find it for them As it happened he had heard from an old friend of his a certain Sir Jervis Redwood who was in search of a secretary Being in favor of letting the women compete for employment with the men Sir Jervis was willing to try what he calls a female Isn t that a horrid way of speaking of us and Miss Ladd says it s ungrammatical besides Papa had written back to say he knew of no lady whom he could recommend When he got my letter speaking of Emily he kindly wrote again In the interval Sir Jervis had received two applications for the vacant place They were both from old ladies and he declined to employ them Because they were old Francine suggested maliciously You shall hear him give his own reasons my dear Papa sent me an extract from his letter It made me rather angry and perhaps for that reason I think I can repeat it word for word We are four old people in this house and we don t want a fifth Let us have a young one to cheer us If your daughter s friend likes the terms and is not encumbered with a sweetheart I will send for her when the school breaks up at midsummer Coarse and selfish isn t it However Emily didn t agree with me when I showed her the extract She accepted the place very much to her aunt s surprise and regret when that excellent person heard of it Now that the time has come though Emily won t acknowledge it I believe she secretly shrinks poor dear from the prospect Very likely Francine agreed without even a pretense of sympathy But tell me who are the four old people First Sir Jervis himself seventy last birthday Next his unmarried sister nearly eighty Next his man servant mister Rook well past sixty And last his man servant s wife who considers herself young being only a little over forty That is the household missus Rook is coming to day to attend Emily on the journey to the North and I am not at all sure that Emily will like her A disagreeable woman I suppose No not exactly that Rather odd and flighty The fact is missus Rook has had her troubles and perhaps they have a little unsettled her She and her husband used to keep the village inn close to our park we know all about them at home I am sure I pity these poor people What are you looking at Francine Feeling no sort of interest in mister and missus Rook Francine was studying her schoolfellow s lovely face in search of defects She had already discovered that Cecilia s eyes were placed too widely apart and that her chin wanted size and character I was admiring your complexion dear she answered coolly Well and why do you pity the Rooks Simple Cecilia smiled and went on with her story They are obliged to go out to service in their old age through a misfortune for which they are in no way to blame Their customers deserted the inn and mister Rook became bankrupt The inn got what they call a bad name in a very dreadful way There was a murder committed in the house A murder cried Francine Oh this is exciting You provoking girl why didn t you tell me about it before I didn t think of it said Cecilia placidly Do go on Were you at home when it happened I w as here at school You saw the newspapers I suppose Miss Ladd doesn t allow us to read newspapers I did hear of it however in letters from home Not that there was much in the letters They said it was too horrible to be described The poor murdered gentleman Francine was unaffectedly shocked A gentleman she exclaimed How dreadful The poor man was a stranger in our part of the country Cecilia resumed and the police were puzzled about the motive for a murder His pocketbook was missing but his watch and his rings were found on the body I remember the initials on his linen because they were the same as my mother s initial before she was married J B Really Francine that s all I know about it Surely you know whether the murderer was discovered Oh yes of course I know that The government offered a reward and clever people were sent from London to help the county police Nothing came of it The murderer has never been discovered from that time to this When did it happen It happened in the autumn The autumn of last year No no Nearly four years since CHAPTER VI ON THE WAY TO THE VILLAGE Alban Morris discovered by Emily in concealment among the trees was not content with retiring to another part of the grounds He pursued his retreat careless in what direction it might take him to a footpath across the fields which led to the highroad and the railway station Miss Ladd s drawing master was in that state of nervous irritability which seeks relief in rapidity of motion Public opinion in the neighborhood especially public opinion among the women had long since decided that his manners were offensive and his temper incurably bad The men who happened to pass him on the footpath said Good morning grudgingly The women took no notice of him with one exception She was young and saucy and seeing him walking at the top of his speed on the way to the railway station she called after him Don t be in a hurry sir You re in plenty of time for the London train To her astonishment he suddenly stopped His reputation for rudeness was so well established that she moved away to a safe distance before she ventured to look at him again He took no notice of her he seemed to be considering with himself The frolicsome young woman had done him a service she had suggested an idea Suppose I go to London he thought Why not the school is breaking up for the holidays and she is going away like the rest of them He looked round in the direction of the schoolhouse If I go back to wish her good by she will keep out of my way and part with me at the last moment like a stranger After my experience of women to be in love again in love with a girl who is young enough to be my daughter what a fool what a driveling degraded fool I must be Hot tears rose in his eyes He dashed them away savagely and went on again faster than ever resolved to pack up at once at his lodgings in the village and to take his departure by the next train At the point where the footpath led into the road he came to a standstill for the second time The cause was once more a person of the sex associated in his mind with a bitter sense of injury On this occasion the person was only a miserable little child crying over the fragments of a broken jug Alban Morris looked at her with his grimly humorous smile So you ve broken a jug he remarked And spilt father s beer the child answered Her frail little body shook with terror Mother ll beat me when I go home she said What does mother do when you bring the jug back safe and sound Alban asked Gives me bren butter Very well Now listen to me Mother shall give you bread and butter again this time The child stared at him with the tears suspended in her eyes He went on talking to her as seriously as ever You understand what I have just said to you Yes sir Have you got a pocket handkerchief No sir Then dry your eyes with mine He tossed his handkerchief to her with one hand and picked up a fragment of the broken jug with the other This will do for a pattern he said to himself The child stared at the handkerchief stared at Alban took courage and rubbed vigorously at her eyes The instinct which is worth all the reason that ever pretended to enlighten mankind the instinct that never deceives told this little ignorant creature that she had found a friend She returned the handkerchief in grave silence Alban took her up in his arms Your eyes are dry and your face is fit to be seen he said Will you give me a kiss The child gave him a resolute kiss with a smack in it Now come and get another jug he said as he put her down Her red round eyes opened wide in alarm Have you got money enough she asked Alban slapped his pocket Yes I have he answered That s a good thing said the child come along They went together hand in hand to the village and bought the new jug and had it filled at the beer shop The thirsty father was at the upper end of the fields where they were making a drain Alban carried the jug until they were within sight of the laborer You haven t far to go he said Mind you don t drop it again What s the matter now I m frightened Why Oh give me the jug She almost snatched it out of his hand If she let the precious minutes slip away there might be another beating in store for her at the drain her father was not of an indulgent disposition when his children were late in bringing his beer On the point of hurrying away without a word of farewell she remembered the laws of politeness as taught at the infant school and dropped her little curtsey and said Thank you sir That bitter sense of injury was still in Alban s mind as he looked after her What a pity she should grow up to be a woman he said to himself The adventure of the broken jug had delayed his return to his lodgings by more than half an hour When he reached the road once more the cheap up train from the North had stopped at the station He heard the ringing of the bell as it resumed the journey to London One of the passengers judging by the handbag that she carried had not stopped at the village As she advanced toward him along the road he remarked that she was a small wiry active woman dressed in bright colors combined with a deplorable want of taste Her aquiline nose seemed to be her most striking feature as she came nearer It might have been fairly proportioned to the rest of her face in her younger days before her cheeks had lost flesh and roundness Being probably near sighted she kept her eyes half closed there were cunning little wrinkles at the corners of them In spite of appearances she was unwilling to present any outward acknowledgment of the march of time Her hair was palpably dyed her hat was jauntily set on her head and ornamented with a gay feather She walked with a light tripping step swinging her bag and holding her head up smartly Her manner like her dress said as plainly as words could speak No matter how long I may have lived I mean to be young and charming to the end of my days To Alban s surprise she stopped and addressed him Oh I beg your pardon Could you tell me if I am in the right road to Miss Ladd s school She spoke with nervous rapidity of articulation and with a singularly unpleasant smile It parted her thin lips just widely enough to show her suspiciously beautiful teeth and it opened her keen gray eyes in the strangest manner The higher lid rose so as to disclose for a moment the upper part of the eyeball and to give her the appearance not of a woman bent on making herself agreeable but of a woman staring in a panic of terror Careless to conceal the unfavorable impression that she had produced on him Alban answered roughly Straight on and tried to pass her She stopped him with a peremptory gesture I have treated you politely she said and how do you treat me in return Well I am not surprised Men are all brutes by nature and you are a man Straight on she repeated contemptuously I should like to know how far that helps a person in a strange place Perhaps you know no more where Miss Ladd s school is than I do or perhaps you don t care to take the trouble of addressing me Just what I should have expected from a person of your sex Good morning Alban felt the reproof she had appealed to his most readily impressible sense his sense of humor He rather enjoyed seeing his own prejudice against women grotesquely reflected in this flighty stranger s prejudice against men As the best excuse for himself that he could make he gave her all the information that she could possibly want then tried again to pass on and again in vain He had recovered his place in her estimation she had not done with him yet You know all about the way there she said I wonder whether you know anything about the school No change in her voice no change in her manner betrayed any special motive for putting this question Alban was on the point of suggesting that she should go on to the school and make her inquiries there when he happened to notice her eyes She had hitherto looked him straight in the face She now looked down on the road It was a trifling change in all probability it meant nothing and yet merely because it was a change it roused his curiosity I ought to know something about the school he answered I am one of the masters Then you re just the man I want May I ask your name Alban Morris Thank you I am missus Rook I presume you have heard of Sir Jervis Redwood No Bless my soul You are a scholar of course and you have never heard of one of your own trade Very extraordinary You see I am Sir Jervis s housekeeper and I am sent here to take one of your young ladies back with me to our place Don t interrupt me Don t be a brute again Sir Jervis is not of a communicative disposition At least not to me A man that explains it a man He is always poring over his books and writings and Miss Redwood at her great age is in bed half the day Not a thing do I know about this new inmate of ours except that I am to take her back with me You would feel some curiosity yourself in my place wouldn t you Now do tell me What sort of girl is Miss Emily Brown The name that he was perpetually thinking of on this woman s lips Alban looked at her Well said missus Rook am I to have no answer Ah you want leading So like a man again Is she pretty Still examining the housekeeper with mingled feelings of interest and distrust Alban answered ungraciously Yes Good tempered Alban again said Yes So much about herself missus Rook remarked About her family now She shifted her bag restlessly from one hand to another Perhaps you can tell me if Miss Emily s father she suddenly corrected herself if Miss Emily s parents are living I don t know You mean you won t tell me I mean exactly what I have said Oh it doesn t matter missus Rook rejoined I shall find out at the school The first turning to the left I think you said across the fields He was too deeply interested in Emily to let the housekeeper go without putting a question on his side Is Sir Jervis Redwood one of Miss Emily s old friends he asked He What put that into your head He has never even seen Miss Emily She s going to our house ah the women are getting the upper hand now and serve the men right I say she s going to our house to be Sir Jervis s secretary You would like to have the place yourself wouldn t you You would like to keep a poor girl from getting her own living Oh you may look as fierce as you please the time s gone by when a man could frighten me I like her Christian name I call Emily a nice name enough But Brown Good morning mister Morris you and I are not cursed with such a contemptibly common name as that Brown Oh Lord She tossed her head scornfully and walked away humming a tune Alban stood rooted to the spot The effort of his later life had been to conceal the hopeless passion which had mastered him in spite of himself Knowing nothing from Emily who at once pitied and avoided him of her family circumstances or of her future plans he had shrunk from making inquiries of others in the fear that they too might find out his secret and that their contempt might be added to the contempt which he felt for himself In this position and with these obstacles in his way the announcement of Emily s proposed journey under the care of a stranger to fill an employment in the house of a stranger not only took him by surprise but inspired him with a strong feeling of distrust He looked after Sir Jervis Redwood s flighty housekeeper completely forgetting the purpose which had brought him thus far on the way to his lodgings Before missus Rook was out of sight Alban Morris was following her back to the school CHAPTER VII COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE Miss De Sor and Miss Wyvil were still sitting together under the trees talking of the murder at the inn And is that really all you can tell me said Francine That is all Cecilia answered Is there no love in it None that I know of It s the most uninteresting murder that ever was committed What shall we do with ourselves I m tired of being here in the garden When do the performances in the schoolroom begin Not for two hours yet Francine yawned And what part do you take in it she asked No part my dear I tried once only to sing a simple little song When I found myself standing before all the company and saw rows of ladies and gentlemen waiting for me to begin I was so frightened that Miss Ladd had to make an apology for me I didn t get over it for the rest of the day For the first time in my life I had no appetite for my dinner Horrible said Cecilia shuddering over the remembrance of it I do assure you I thought I was going to die Perfectly unimpressed by this harrowing narrative Francine turned her head lazily toward the house The door was thrown open at the same moment A lithe little person rapidly descended the steps that led to the lawn It s Emily come back again said Francine And she seems to be rather in a hurry Cecilia remarked Francine s satirical smile showed itself for a moment Did this appearance of hurry in Emily s movements denote impatience to resume the recital of the dagger scene She had no book in her hand she never even looked toward Francine Sorrow became plainly visible in her face as she approached the two girls Cecilia rose in alarm She had been the first person to whom Emily had confided her domestic anxieties Bad news from your aunt she asked No my dear no news at all Emily put her arms tenderly round her friend s neck The time has come Cecilia she said We must wish each other good by Is missus Rook here already It s you dear who are going Emily answered sadly They have sent the governess to fetch you Miss Ladd is too busy in the schoolroom to see her and she has told me all about it Don t be alarmed There is no bad news from home Your plans are altered that s all Altered Cecilia repeated In what way In a very agreeable way you are going to travel Your father wishes you to be in London in time for the evening mail to France Cecilia guessed what had happened My sister is not getting well she said and the doctors are sending her to the Continent To the baths at saint Moritz Emily added There is only one difficulty in the way and you can remove it Your sister has the good old governess to take care of her and the courier to relieve her of all trouble on the journey They were to have started yesterday You know how fond Julia is of you At the last moment she won t hear of going away unless you go too The rooms are waiting at saint Moritz and your father is annoyed the governess says by the delay that has taken place already She paused Cecilia was silent Surely you don t hesitate Emily said I am too happy to go wherever Julia go es Cecilia answered warmly I was thinking of you dear Her tender nature shrinking from the hard necessities of life shrank from the cruelly close prospect of parting I thought we were to have had some hours together yet she said Why are we hurried in this way There is no second train to London from our station till late in the afternoon There is the express Emily reminded her and there is time to catch it if you drive at once to the town She took Cecilia s hand and pressed it to her bosom Thank you again and again dear for all you have done for me Whether we meet again or not as long as I live I shall love you Don t cry She made a faint attempt to resume her customary gayety for Cecilia s sake Try to be as hard hearted as I am Think of your sister don t think of me Only kiss me Cecilia s tears fell fast Oh my love I am so anxious about you I am so afraid that you will not be happy with that selfish old man in that dreary house Give it up Emily I have got plenty of money for both of us come abroad with me Why not You always got on well with Julia when you came to see us in the holidays Oh my darling my darling What shall I do without you All that longed for love in Emily s nature had clung round her school friend since her father s death Turning deadly pale under the struggle to control herself she made the effort and bore the pain of it without letting a cry or a tear escape her Our ways in life lie far apart she said gently There is the hope of meeting again dear if there is nothing more The clasp of Cecilia s arm tightened round her She tried to release herself but her resolution had reached its limits Her hands dropped trembling She could still try to speak cheerfully and that was all There is not the least reason Cecilia to be anxious about my prospects I mean to be Sir Jervis Redwood s favorite before I have been a week in his service She stopped and pointed to the house The governess was approaching them One more kiss darling We shall not forget the happy hours we have spent together we shall constantly write to each other She broke down at last Oh Cecilia Cecilia leave me for God s sake I can t bear it any longer The governess parted them Emily dropped into the chair that her friend had left Even her hopeful nature sank under the burden of life at that moment A hard voice speaking close at her side startled her Would you rather be Me the voice asked without a creature to care for you Emily raised her head Francine the unnoticed witness of the parting interview was standing by her idly picking the leaves from a rose which had dropped out of Cecilia s nosegay Had she felt her own isolated position She had felt it resentfully Emily looked at her with a heart softened by sorrow There was no answering kindness in the eyes of Miss de Sor there was only a dogged endurance sad to see in a creature so young You and Cecilia are going to write to each other she said I suppose there is some comfort in that When I left the island they were glad to get rid of me They said Telegraph when you are safe at Miss Ladd s school You see we are so rich the expense of telegraphing to the West Indies is nothing to us Besides a telegram has an advantage over a letter it doesn t take long to read I daresay I shall write home But they are in no hurry and I am in no hurry The school s breaking up you are going your way and I am going mine and who cares what becomes of me Only an ugly old schoolmistress who is paid for caring I wonder why I am saying all this Because I like you I don t know that I like you any better than you like me When I wanted to be friends with you you treated me coolly I don t want to force myself on you I don t particularly care about you May I write to you from Brighton Under all this bitterness the first exhibition of Francine s temper at its worst which had taken place since she joined the school Emily saw or thought she saw distress that was too proud or too shy to show itself How can you ask the question she answered cordially Francine was incapable of meeting the sympathy offered to her even half way Never mind how she said Yes or no is all I want from you Oh Francine Francine what are you made of Flesh and blood or stone and iron Write to me of course and I will write back again Thank you Are you going to stay here under the trees Yes All by yourself All by myself With nothing to do I can think of Cecilia Francine eyed her with steady attention for a moment Didn t you tell me last night that you were very poor she asked I did So poor that you are obliged to earn your own living Yes Francine looked at her again I daresay you won t believe me she said I wish I was you She turned away irritably and walked back to the house Were there really longings for kindness and love under the surface of this girl s perverse nature Or was there nothing to be hoped from a better knowledge of her In place of tender remembrances of Cecilia these were the perplexing and unwelcome thoughts which the more potent personality of Francine forced upon Emily s mind She rose impatiently and looked at her watch When would it be her turn to leave the school and begin the new life Still undecided what to do next her interest was excited by the appearance of one of the servants on the lawn The woman approached her and presented a visiting card bearing on it the name of Sir Jervis Redwood Beneath the name there was a line written in pencil missus Rook to wait on Miss Emily Brown The way to the new life was open before her at last Looking again at the commonplace announcement contained in the line of writing she was not quite satisfied Was it claiming a deference toward herself to which she was not entitled to expect a letter either from Sir Jervis or from Miss Redwood giving her some information as to the journey which she was about to undertake and expressing with some little politeness the wish to make her comfortable in her future home At any rate her employer had done her one service he had reminded her that her station in life was not what it had been in the days when her father was living and when her aunt was in affluent circumstances She looked up from the card The servant had gone Alban Morris was waiting at a little distance waiting silently until she noticed him CHAPTER VIII MASTER AND PUPIL Emily s impulse was to avoid the drawing master for the second time The moment afterward a kinder feeling prevailed The farewell interview with Cecilia had left influences which pleaded for Alban Morris It was the day of parting good wishes and general separations he had only perhaps come to say good by She advanced to offer her hand when he stopped her by pointing to Sir Jervis Redwood s card May I say a word Miss Emily about that woman he asked Do you mean missus Rook Yes You know of course why she comes here She comes here by appointment to take me to Sir Jervis Redwood s house Are you acquainted with her She is a perfect stranger to me I met her by accident on her way here If missus Rook had been content with asking me to direct her to the school I should not be troubling you at this moment But she forced her conversation on me And she said something which I think you ought to know Have you heard of Sir Jervis Redwood s housekeeper before to day I have only heard what my friend Miss Cecilia Wyvil has told me Did Miss Cecilia tell you that missus Rook was acquainted with your father or with any members of your family Certainly not Alban reflected It was natural enough he resumed that missus Rook should feel some curiosity about You What reason had she for putting a question to me about your father and putting it in a very strange manner Emily s interest was instantly excited She led the way back to the seats in the shade Tell me mister Morris exactly what the woman said As she spoke she signed to him to be seated Alban observed the natural grace of her action when she set him the example of taking a chair and the little heightening of her color caused by anxiety to hear what he had still to tell her Forgetting the restraint that he had hitherto imposed on himself he enjoyed the luxury of silently admiring her Her manner betrayed none of the conscious confusion which would have shown itself if her heart had been secretly inclined toward him She saw the man looking at her In simple perplexity she looked at the man Are you hesitating on my account she asked Did missus Rook say something of my father which I mustn t hear No no nothing of the sort You seem to be confused Her innocent indifference tried his patience sorely His memory went back to the past time recalled the ill placed passion of his youth and the cruel injury inflicted on him his pride was roused Was he making himself ridiculous The vehement throbbing of his heart almost suffocated him And there she sat wondering at his odd behavior Even this girl is as cold blooded as the rest of her sex That angry thought gave him back his self control He made his excuses with the easy politeness of a man of the world I beg your pardon Miss Emily I was considering how to put what I have to say in the fewest and plainest words Let me try if I can do it If missus Rook had merely asked me whether your father and mother were living I should have attributed the question to the commonplace curiosity of a gossiping woman and have thought no more of it What she actually did say was this Perhaps you can tell me if Miss Emily s father There she checked herself and suddenly altered the question in this way If Miss Emily s parents are living I may be making mountains out of molehills but I thought at the time and think still that she had some special interest in inquiring after your father and not wishing me to notice it for reasons of her own changed the form of the question so as to include your mother Does this strike you as a far fetched conclusion Whatever it may be Emily said it is my conclusion too How did you answer her Quite easily I could give her no information and I said so Let me offer you the information mister Morris before we say anything more I have lost both my parents Alban s momentary outbreak of irritability was at an end He was earnest and yet gentle again he forgave her for not understanding how dear and how delightful to him she was Will it distress you he said if I ask how long it is since your father died Nearly four years she replied He was the most generous of men missus Rook s interest in him may surely have been a grateful interest He may have been kind to her in past years and she may remember him thankfully Don t you think so Alban was unable to agree with her If missus Rook s interest in your father was the harmless interest that you have suggested he said why should she have checked herself in that unaccountable manner when she first asked me if he was living The more I think of it now the less sure I feel that she knows anything at all of your family history It may help me to decide if you will tell me at what time the death of your mother took place So long ago Emily replied that I can t even remember her death I was an infant at the time And yet missus Rook asked me if your parents were living One of two things Alban concluded Either there is some mystery in this matter which we cannot hope to penetrate at present or missus Rook may have been speaking at random on the chance of discovering whether you are related to some mister Brown whom she once knew Besides Emily added it s only fair to remember what a common family name mine is and how easily people may make mistakes I should like to know if my dear lost father was really in her mind when she spoke to you Do you think I could find it out If missus Rook has any reasons for concealment I believe you would have no chance of finding it out unless indeed you could take her by surprise In what way mister Morris Only one way occurs to me just now he said Do you happen to have a miniature or a photograph of your father Emily held out a handsome locket with a monogram in diamonds attached to her watch chain I have his photograph here she rejoined given to me by my dear old aunt in the days of her prosperity Shall I show it to missus Rook Yes if she happens by good luck to offer you an opportunity Impatient to try the experiment Emily rose as he spoke I mustn t keep missus Rook waiting she said Alban stopped her on the point of leaving him The confusion and hesitation which she had already noticed began to show themselves in his manner once more Miss Emily may I ask you a favor before you go I am only one of the masters employed in the school but I don t think let me say I hope I am not guilty of presumption if I offer to be of some small service to one of my pupils There his embarrassment mastered him He despised himself not only for yielding to his own weakness but for faltering like a fool in the expression of a simple request The next words died away on his lips This time Emily understood him The subtle penetration which had long since led her to the discovery of his secret overpowered thus far by the absorbing interest of the moment now recovered its activity In an instant she remembered that Alban s motive for cautioning her in her coming intercourse with missus Rook was not the merely friendly motive which might have actuated him in the case of one of the other girls At the same time her quickness of apprehension warned her not to risk encouraging this persistent lover by betraying any embarrassment on her side He was evidently anxious to be present in her interests at the interview with missus Rook Why not Could he reproach her with raising false hope if she accepted his services under circumstances of doubt and difficulty which he had himself been the first to point out He could do nothing of the sort Without waiting until he had recovered himself she answered him to all appearances as composedly as if he had spoken to her in the plainest terms After all that you have told me she said I shall indeed feel obliged if you will be present when I see missus Rook The eager brightening of his eyes the flush of happiness that made him look young on a sudden were signs not to be mistaken The sooner they were in the presence of a third person Emily privately concluded the better it might be for both of them She led the way rapidly to the house CHAPTER IX missus ROOK AND THE LOCKET As mistress of a prosperous school bearing a widely extended reputation Miss Ladd prided herself on the liberality of her household arrangements At breakfast and dinner not only the solid comforts but the elegant luxuries of the table were set before the young ladies Other schools may and no doubt do offer to pupils the affectionate care to which they have been accustomed under the parents roof Miss Ladd used to say At my school that care extends to their meals and provides them with a cuisine which I flatter myself equals the most successful efforts of the cooks at home Fathers mothers and friends when they paid visits to this excellent lady brought away with them the most gratifying recollections of her hospitality The men in particular seldom failed to recognize in their hostess the rarest virtue that a single lady can possess the virtue of putting wine on the table which may be gratefully remembered by her guests the next morning An agreeable surprise awaited missus Rook when she entered the house of bountiful Miss Ladd Luncheon was ready for Sir Jervis Redwood s confidential emissary in the waiting room Detained at the final rehearsals of music and recitation Miss Ladd was worthily represented by cold chicken and ham a fruit tart and a pint decanter of generous sherry Your mistress is a perfect lady missus Rook said to the servant with a burst of enthusiasm I can carve for myself thank you and I don t care how long Miss Emily keeps me waiting As they ascended the steps leading into the house Alban asked Emily if he might look again at her locket Shall I open it for you she suggested No I only want to look at the outside of it He examined the side on which the monogram appeared inlaid with diamonds An inscription was engraved beneath May I read it he said Certainly The inscription ran thus In loving memory of my father Died thirtieth September eighteen seventy seven Can you arrange the locket Alban asked so that the side on which the diamonds appear hangs outward She understood him The diamonds might attract missus Rook s notice and in that case she might ask to see the locket of her own accord You are beginning to be of use to me already Emily said as they turned into the corridor which led to the waiting room They found Sir Jervis s housekeeper luxuriously recumbent in the easiest chair in the room Of the eatable part of the lunch some relics were yet left In the pint decanter of sherry not a drop remained The genial influence of the wine hastened by the hot weather was visible in missus Rook s flushed face and in a special development of her ugly smile Her widening lips stretched to new lengths and the white upper line of her eyeballs were more freely and horribly visible than ever And this is the dear young lady she said lifting her hands in over acted admiration At the first greetings Alban perceived that the impression produced was in Emily s case as in his case instantly unfavorable The servant came in to clear the table Emily stepped aside for a minute to give some directions about her luggage In that interval missus Rook s cunning little eyes turned on Alban with an expression of malicious scrutiny You were walking the other way she whispered when I met you She stopped and glanced over her shoulder at Emily I see what attraction has brought you back to the school Steal your way into that poor little fool s heart and then make her miserable for the rest of her life No need miss to hurry she said shifting the polite side of her toward Emily who returned at the moment The visits of the trains to your station here are like the visits of the angels described by the poet few and far between Please excuse the quotation You wouldn t think it to look at me I m a great reader Is it a long journey to Sir Jervis Redwood s house Emily asked at a loss what else to say to a woman who was already becoming unendurable to her missus Rook looked at the journey from an oppressively cheerful point of view Oh Miss Emily you shan t feel the time hang heavy in my company I can converse on a variety of topics and if there is one thing more than another that I like it s amusing a pretty young lady You think me a strange creature don t you It s only my high spirits Nothing strange about me unless it s my queer Christian name You look a little dull my dear Shall I begin amusing you before we are on the railway Shall I tell you how I came by my queer name Thus far Alban had controlled himself This last specimen of the housekeeper s audacious familiarity reached the limits of his endurance We don t care to know how you came by your name he said Rude missus Rook remarked composedly But nothing surprises me coming from a man She turned to Emily My father and mother were a wicked married couple she continued before I was born They got religion as the saying is at a Methodist meeting in a field When I came into the world I don t know how you feel miss I protest against being brought into the world without asking my leave first my mother was determined to dedicate me to piety before I was out of my long clothes What name do you suppose she had me christened by She chose it or made it herself the name of Righteous Righteous Rook Was there ever a poor baby degraded by such a ridiculous name before It s needless to say when I write letters I sign R Rook and leave people to think it s Rosamond or Rosabelle or something sweetly pretty of that kind You should have seen my husband s face when he first heard that his sweetheart s name was Righteous He was on the point of kissing me and he stopped I daresay he felt sick Perfectly natural under the circumstances Alban tried to stop her again What time does the train go he asked Emily entreated him to restrain himself by a look missus Rook was still too inveterately amiable to take offense She opened her traveling bag briskly and placed a railway guide in Alban s hands I ve heard that the women do the men s work in foreign parts she said But this is England and I am an Englishwoman Find out when the train goes my dear sir for yourself Alban at once consulted the guide If there proved to be no immediate need of starting for the station he was determined that Emily should not be condemned to pass the interval in the housekeeper s company In the meantime missus Rook was as eager as ever to show her dear young lady what an amusing companion she could be Talking of husbands she resumed don t make the mistake my dear that I committed Beware of letting anybody persuade you to marry an old man mister Rook is old enough to be my father I bear with him Of course I bear with him At the same time I have not as the poet says passed through the ordeal unscathed My spirit I have long since ceased to believe in anything of the sort I only use the word for want of a better my spirit I say has become embittered I was once a pious young woman I do assure you I was nearly as good as my name Don t let me shock you I have lost faith and hope I have become what s the last new name for a free thinker Oh I keep up with the times thanks to old Miss Redwood She takes in the newspapers and makes me read them to her What is the new name Something ending in ic Bombastic No Agnostic that s it I have become an Agnostic The inevitable result of marrying an old man if there s any blame it rests on my husband There s more than an hour yet before the train starts Alban interposed I am sure Miss Emily you would find it pleasanter to wait in the garden Not at all a bad notion missus Rook declared Here s a man who can make himself useful for once Let s go into the garden She rose and led the way to the door Alban seized the opportunity of whispering to Emily Did you notice the empty decanter when we first came in That horrid woman is drunk Emily pointed significantly to the locket Don t let her go The garden will distract her attention keep her near me here missus Rook gayly opened the door Take me to the flower beds she said I believe in nothing but I adore flowers missus Rook waited at the door with her eye on Emily What do you say miss I think we shall be more comfortable if we stay where we are Whatever pleases you my dear pleases me With this reply the compliant housekeeper as amiable as ever on the surface returned to her chair Would she notice the locket as she sat down Emily turned toward the window so as to let the light fall on the diamonds No missus Rook was absorbed at the moment in her own reflections Miss Emily having prevented her from seeing the garden she was maliciously bent on disappointing Miss Emily in return Sir Jervis s secretary being young took a hopeful view no doubt of her future prospects missus Rook decided on darkening that view in a mischievously suggestive manner peculiar to herself You will naturally feel some curiosity about your new home she began and I haven t said a word about it yet How very thoughtless of me Inside and out dear Miss Emily our house is just a little dull I say our house and why not when the management of it is all thrown on me We are built of stone and we are much too long and are not half high enough Our situation is on the coldest side of the county away in the west We are close to the Cheviot hills and if you fancy there is anything to see when you look out of window except sheep you will find yourself woefully mistaken As for walks if you go out on one side of the house you may or may not be gored by cattle On the other side if the darkness overtakes you you may or may not tumble down a deserted lead mine But the company inside the house makes amends for it all missus Rook proceeded enjoying the expression of dismay which was beginning to show itself on Emily s face Plenty of excitement for you my dear in our small family Sir Jervis will introduce you to plaster casts of hideous Indian idols he will keep you writing for him without mercy from morning to night and when he does let you go old Miss Redwood will find she can t sleep and will send for the pretty young lady secretary to read to her My husband I am sure you will like He is a respectable man and bears the highest character Next to the idols he s the most hideous object in the house If you are good enough to encourage him I don t say that he won t amuse you he will tell you for instance he never in his life hated any human being as he hates his wife By the way I must not forget in the interests of truth you know to mention one drawback that does exist in our domestic circle One of these days we shall have our brains blown out or our throats cut Sir Jervis s mother left him ten thousand pounds worth of precious stones all contained in a little cabinet with drawers He won t let the banker take care of his jewels he won t sell them he won t even wear one of the rings on his finger or one of the pins at his breast He keeps his cabinet on his dressing room table and he says I like to gloat over my jewels every night before I go to bed Ten thousand pounds worth of diamonds rubies emeralds sapphires and what not at the mercy of the first robber who happens to hear of them Oh my dear he would have no choice I do assure you but to use his pistols We shouldn t quietly submit to be robbed Sir Jervis inherits the spirit of his ancestors My husband has the temper of a game cock I myself in defense of the property of my employers am capable of becoming a perfect fiend And we none of us understand the use of firearms While she was in full enjoyment of this last aggravation of the horrors of the prospect Emily tried another change of position and this time with success Greedy admiration suddenly opened missus Rook s little eyes to their utmost width My heart alive miss what do I see at your watch chain How they sparkle Might I ask for a closer view Emily s fingers trembled but she succeeded in detaching the locket from the chain Alban handed it to missus Rook She began by admiring the diamonds with a certain reserve Nothing like so large as Sir Jervis s diamonds but choice specimens no doubt Might I ask what the value She stopped The inscription had attracted her notice she began to read it aloud In loving memory of my father Died Her face instantly became rigid The next words were suspended on her lips Alban seized the chance of making her betray herself under pretense of helping her Perhaps you find the figures not easy to read he said The date is thirtieth September eighteen hundred and seventy seven nearly four years since Not a word not a movement escaped missus Rook She held the locket before her as she had held it from the first Alban looked at Emily Her eyes were riveted on the housekeeper she was barely capable of preserving the appearance of composure Seeing the necessity of acting for her he at once said the words which she was unable to say for herself Perhaps missus Rook you would like to look at the portrait he suggested Shall I open the locket for you Without speaking without looking up she handed the locket to Alban He opened it and offered it to her She neither accepted nor refused it her hands remained hanging over the arms of the chair He put the locket on her lap The portrait produced no marked effect on missus Rook Had the date prepared her to see it She sat looking at it still without moving still without saying a word Alban had no mercy on her That is the portrait of Miss Emily s father he said Does it represent the same mister Brown whom you had in your mind when you asked me if Miss Emily s father was still living That question roused her She looked up on the instant she answered loudly and insolently No And yet Alban persisted you broke down in reading the inscription and considering what talkative woman you are the portrait has had a strange effect on you to say the least of it She eyed him steadily while he was speaking and turned to Emily when he had done You mentioned the heat just now miss The heat has overcome me I shall soon get right again The insolent futility of that excuse irritated Emily into answering her You will get right again perhaps all the sooner she said if we trouble you with no more questions and leave you to recover by yourself The first change of expression which relaxed the iron tensity of the housekeeper s face showed itself when she heard that reply At last there was a feeling in missus Rook which openly declared itself a feeling of impatience to see Alban and Emily leave the room They left her without a word more CHAPTER X GUESSES AT THE TRUTH What are we to do next Oh mister Morris you must have seen all sorts of people in your time you know human nature and I don t Help me with a word of advice Emily forgot that he was in love with her forgot everything but the effect produced by the locket on missus Rook and the vaguely alarming conclusion to which it pointed In the fervor of her anxiety she took Alban s arm as familiarly as if he had been her brother He was gentle he was considerate he tried earnestly to compose her We can do nothing to any good purpose he said unless we begin by thinking quietly Pardon me for saying so you are needlessly exciting yourself There was a reason for her excitement of which he was necessarily ignorant Her memory of the night interview with Miss Jethro had inevitably intensified the suspicion inspired by the conduct of missus Rook In less than twenty four hours Emily had seen two women shrinking from secret remembrances of her father which might well be guilty remembrances innocently excited by herself How had they injured him Of what infamy on their parts did his beloved and stainless memory remind them Who could fathom the mystery of it What does it mean she cried looking wildly in Alban s compassionate face You must have formed some idea of your own What does it mean Come and sit down Miss Emily We will try if we can find out what it means together They returned to the shady solitude under the trees Away in front of the house the distant grating of carriage wheels told of the arrival of Miss Ladd s guests and of the speedy beginning of the ceremonies of the day We must help each other Alban resumed When we first spoke of missus Rook you mentioned Miss Cecilia Wyvil as a person who knew something about her Have you any objection to tell me what you may have heard in that way In complying with his request Emily necessarily repeated what Cecilia had told Francine when the two girls had met that morning in the garden Alban now knew how Emily had obtained employment as Sir Jervis s secretary how mister and missus Rook had been previously known to Cecilia s father as respectable people keeping an inn in his own neighborhood and finally how they had been obliged to begin life again in domestic service because the terrible event of a murder had given the inn a bad name and had driven away the customers on whose encouragement their business depended Listening in silence Alban remained silent when Emily s narrative had come to an end Have you nothing to say to me she asked I am thinking over what I have just heard he answered Emily noticed a certain formality in his tone and manner which disagreeably surprised her He seemed to have made his reply as a mere concession to politeness while he was thinking of something else which really interested him Have I disappointed you in any way she asked On the contrary you have interested me I want to be quite sure that I remember exactly what you have said You mentioned I think that your friendship with Miss Cecilia Wyvil began here at the school Yes And in speaking of the murder at the village inn you told me that the crime was committed I have forgotten how long ago His manner still suggested that he was idly talking about what she had told him while some more important subject for reflection was in possession of his mind I don t know that I said anything about the time that had passed since the crime was committed she answered sharply What does the murder matter to us I think Cecilia told me it happened about four years since Excuse me for noticing it mister Morris you seem to have some interests of your own to occupy your attention Why couldn t you say so plainly when we came out here I should not have asked you to help me in that case Since my poor father s death I have been used to fight through my troubles by myself She rose and looked at him proudly The next moment her eyes filled with tears In spite of her resistance Alban took her hand Dear Miss Emily he said you distress me you have not done me justice Your interests only are in my mind Answering her in those terms he had not spoken as frankly as usual He had only told her a part of the truth Hearing that the woman whom they had just left had been landlady of an inn and that a murder had been committed under her roof he was led to ask himself if any explanation might be found in these circumstances of the otherwise incomprehensible effect produced on missus Rook by the inscription on the locket In the pursuit of this inquiry there had arisen in his mind a monstrous suspicion which pointed to missus Rook It impelled him to ascertain the date at which the murder had been committed and if the discovery encouraged further investigation to find out next the manner in which mister Brown had died Thus far what progress had he made He had discovered that the date of mister Brown s death inscribed on the locket and the date of the crime committed at the inn approached each other nearly enough to justify further investigation In the meantime had he succeeded in keeping his object concealed from Emily He had perfectly succeeded Hearing him declare that her interests only had occupied his mind the poor girl innocently entreated him to forgive her little outbreak of temper If you have any more questions to ask me mister Morris pray go on I promise never to think unjustly of you again He went on with an uneasy conscience for it seemed cruel to deceive her even in the interests of truth but still he went on Suppose we assume that this woman had injured your father in some way he said Am I right in believing that it was in his character to forgive injuries Entirely right In that case his death may have left missus Rook in a position to be called to account by those who owe a duty to his memory I mean the surviving members of his family There are but two of us mister Morris My aunt and myself There are his executors My aunt is his only executor Your father s sister I presume Yes He may have left instructions with her which might be of the greatest use to us I will write to day and find out Emily replied I had already planned to consult my aunt she added thinking again of Miss Jethro If your aunt has not received any positive instructions Alban continued she may remember some allusion to missus Rook on your father s part at the time of his last illness Emily stopped him You don t know how my dear father died she said He was struck down apparently in perfect health by disease of the heart Struck down in his own house Yes in his own house Those words closed Alban s lips The investigation so carefully and so delicately conducted had failed to serve any useful purpose He had now ascertained the manner of mister Brown s death and the place of mister Brown s death and he was as far from confirming his suspicions of missus Rook as ever CHAPTER XI THE DRAWING MASTER S CONFESSION Is there nothing else you can suggest Emily asked Nothing at present If my aunt fails us have we no other hope I have hope in missus Rook Alban answered I see I surprise you but I really mean what I say Sir Jervis s housekeeper is an excitable woman and she is fond of wine There is always a weak side in the character of such a person as that If we wait for our chance and turn it to the right use when it comes we may yet succeed in making her betray herself Emily listened to him in bewilderment You talk as if I was sure of your help in the future she said Have you forgotten that I leave school to day never to return In half an hour more I shall be condemned to a long journey in the company of that horrible creature with a life to look forward to in the same house with her among strangers A miserable prospect and a hard trial of a girl s courage is it not mister Morris You will at least have one person Miss Emily who will try with all his heart and soul to encourage you What do you mean I mean said Alban quietly that the Midsummer vacation begins to day and that the drawing master is going to spend his holidays in the North Emily jumped up from her chair You she exclaimed You are going to Northumberland With me Why not Alban asked The railway is open to all travelers alike if they have money enough to buy a ticket mister Morris what can you be thinking of Indeed indeed I am not ungrateful I know you mean kindly you are a good generous man But do remember how completely a girl in my position is at the mercy of appearances You traveling in the same carriage with me and that woman putting her own vile interpretation on it and degrading me in Sir Jervis Redwood s estimation on the day when I enter his house Oh it s worse than thoughtless it s madness downright madness You are quite right Alban gravely agreed it is madness I lost whatever little reason I once possessed Miss Emily on the day when I first met you out walking with the young ladies of the school Emily turned away in significant silence Alban followed her You promised just now he said never to think unjustly of me again I respect and admire you far too sincerely to take a base advantage of this occasion the only occasion on which I have been permitted to speak with you alone Wait a little before you condemn a man whom you don t understand I will say nothing to annoy you I only ask leave to explain myself Will you take your chair again She returned unwillingly to her seat It can only end she thought sadly in my disappointing him I have had the worst possible opinion of women for years past Alban resumed and the only reason I can give for it condemns me out of my own mouth I have been infamously treated by one woman and my wounded self esteem has meanly revenged itself by reviling the whole sex Wait a little Miss Emily My fault has received its fit punishment I have been thoroughly humiliated and you have done it mister Morris Take no offense pray where no offense is meant Some few years since it was the great misfortune of my life to meet with a Jilt You know what I mean Yes She was my equal by birth I am a younger son of a country squire and my superior in rank I can honestly tell you that I was fool enough to love her with all my heart and soul She never allowed me to doubt I may say this without conceit remembering the miserable end of it that my feeling for her was returned Her father and mother excellent people approved of the contemplated marriage She accepted my presents she allowed all the customary preparations for a wedding to proceed to completion she had not even mercy en ough or shame enough to prevent me from publicly degrading myself by waiting for her at the altar in the presence of a large congregation The minutes passed and no bride appeared The clergyman waiting like me was requested to return to the vestry I was invited to follow him You foresee the end of the story of course She had run away with another man But can you guess who the man was Her groom Emily s face reddened with indignation She suffered for it Oh mister Morris surely she suffered for it Not at all She had money enough to reward the groom for marrying her and she let herself down easily to her husband s level It was a suitable marriage in every respect When I last heard of them they were regularly in the habit of getting drunk together I am afraid I have disgusted you We will drop the subject and resume my precious autobiography at a later date One showery day in the autumn of last year you young ladies went out with Miss Ladd for a walk When you were all trotting back again under your umbrellas did you in particular notice an ill tempered fellow standing in the road and getting a good look at you on the high footpath above him Emily smiled in spite of herself I don t remember it she said You wore a brown jacket which fitted you as if you had been born in it and you had the smartest little straw hat I ever saw on a woman s head It was the first time I ever noticed such things I think I could paint a portrait of the boots you wore mud included from memory alone That was the impression you produced on me After believing honestly believing that love was one of the lost illusions of my life after feeling honestly feeling that I would as soon look at the devil as look at a woman there was the state of mind to which retribution had reduced me using for his instrument Miss Emily Brown Oh don t be afraid of what I may say next In your presence and out of your presence I am man enough to be ashamed of my own folly I am resisting your influence over me at this moment with the strongest of all resolutions the resolution of despair Let s look at the humorous side of the story again What do you think I did when the regiment of young ladies had passed by me Emily declined to guess I followed you back to the school and on pretense of having a daughter to educate I got one of Miss Ladd s prospectuses from the porter at the lodge gate I was in your neighborhood you must know on a sketching tour I went back to my inn and seriously considered what had happened to me The result of my cogitations was that I went abroad Only for a change not at all because I was trying to weaken the impression you had produced on me After a while I returned to England Only because I was tired of traveling not at all because your influence drew me back Another interval passed and luck turned my way for a wonder The drawing master s place became vacant here Miss Ladd advertised I produced my testimonials and took the situation Only because the salary was a welcome certainty to a poor man not at all because the new position brought me into personal association with Miss Emily Brown Do you begin to see why I have troubled you with all this talk about myself Apply the contemptible system of self delusion which my confession has revealed to that holiday arrangement for a tour in the north which has astonished and annoyed you I am going to travel this afternoon by your train Only because I feel an intelligent longing to see the northernmost county of England not at all because I won t let you trust yourself alone with missus Rook Not at all because I won t leave you to enter Sir Jervis Redwood s service without a friend within reach in case you want him Mad Oh yes perfectly mad But tell me this What do all sensible people do when they find themselves in the company of a lunatic They humor him Let me take your ticket and see your luggage labeled I only ask leave to be your traveling servant If you are proud I shall like you all the better if you are pay me wages and keep me in my proper place in that way Some girls addressed with this reckless intermingling of jest and earnest would have felt confused and some would have felt flattered With a good tempered resolution which never passed the limits of modesty and refinement Emily met Alban Morris on his own ground You have said you respect me she began I am going to prove that I believe you The least I can do is not to misinterpret you on my side Am I to understand mister Morris you won t think the worse of me I hope if I speak plainly am I to understand that you are in love with me Yes Miss Emily if you please He had answered with the quaint gravity which was peculiar to him but he was already conscious of a sense of discouragement Her composure was a bad sign from his point of view My time will come I daresay she proceeded At present I know nothing of love by experience I only know what some of my schoolfellows talk about in secret Judging by what they tell me a girl blushes when her lover pleads with her to favor his addresses Am I blushing Must I speak plainly too Alban asked If you have no objection she answered as composedly as if she had been addressing her grandfather Then Miss Emily I must say you are not blushing She went on Another token of love as I am informed is to tremble Am I trembling No Am I too confused to look at you No Do I walk away with dignity and then stop and steal a timid glance at my lover over my shoulder I wish you did A plain answer mister Morris Yes or No No of course In one last word do I give you any sort of encouragement to try again In one last word I have made a fool of myself and you have taken the kindest possible way of telling me so This time she made no attempt to reply in his own tone The good humored gayety of her manner disappeared She was in earnest truly sadly in earnest when she said her next words Is it not best in your own interests that we should bid each other good by she asked In the time to come when you only remember how kind you once were to me we may look forward to meeting again After all that you have suffered so bitterly and so undeservedly don t pray don t make me feel that another woman has behaved cruelly to you and that I so grieved to distress you am that heartless creature Never in her life had she been so irresistibly charming as she was at that moment Her sweet nature showed all its innocent pity for him in her face He saw it he felt it he was not unworthy of it In silence he lifted her hand to his lips He turned pale as he kissed it Say that you agree with me she pleaded I obey you As he answered he pointed to the lawn at their feet Look he said at that dead leaf which the air is wafting over the grass Is it possible that such sympathy as you feel for Me such love as I feel for You can waste wither and fall to the ground like that leaf I leave you Emily with the firm conviction that there is a time of fulfillment to come in our two lives Happen what may in the interval I trust the future The words had barely passed his lips when the voice of one of the servants reached them from the house Miss Emily are you in the garden Emily stepped out into the sunshine The servant hurried to meet her and placed a telegram in her hand She looked at it with a sudden misgiving In her small experience a telegram was associated with the communication of bad news She conquered her hesitation opened it read it The color left her face she shuddered The telegram dropped on the grass Read it she said faintly as Alban picked it up He read these words Come to London directly Miss Letitia is dangerously ill Your aunt he asked Yes my aunt BOOK THE SECOND IN LONDON CHAPTER XII missus ELLMOTHER The metropolis of Great Britain is in certain respects like no other metropolis on the face of the earth In the population that throngs the streets the extremes of Wealth and the extremes of Poverty meet as they meet nowhere else In the streets themselves the glory and the shame of architecture the mansion and the hovel are neighbors in situation as they are neighbors nowhere else London in its social aspect is the city of contrasts Toward the close of evening Emily left the railway terminus for the place of residence in which loss of fortune had compelled her aunt to take refuge As she approached her destination the cab passed by merely crossing a road from a spacious and beautiful Park with its surrounding houses topped by statues and cupolas to a row of cottages hard by a stinking ditch miscalled a canal The city of contrasts north and south east and west the city of social contrasts Emily stopped the cab before the garden gate of a cottage at the further end of the row The bell was answered by the one servant now in her aunt s employ Miss Letitia s maid Personally this good creature was one of the ill fated women whose appearance suggests that Nature intended to make men of them and altered her mind at the last moment Miss Letitia s maid was tall and gaunt and awkward The first impression produced by her face was an impression of bones They rose high on her forehead they projected on her cheeks and they reached their boldest development in her jaws In the cavernous eyes of this unfortunate person rigid obstinacy and rigid goodness looked out together with equal severity on all her fellow creatures alike Her mistress whom she had served for a quarter of a century and more called her Bony She accepted this cruelly appropriate nick name as a mark of affectionate familiarity which honored a servant No other person was allowed to take liberties with her to every one but her mistress she was known as missus Ellmother How is my aunt Emily asked Bad Why have I not heard of her illness before Because she s too fond of you to let you be distressed about her Don t tell Emily those were her orders as long as she kept her senses Kept her senses Good heavens what do you mean Fever that s what I mean I must see her directly I am not afraid of infection There s no infection to be afraid of But you mustn t see her for all that I insist on seeing her Miss Emily I am disappointing you for your own good Don t you know me well enough to trust me by this time I do trust you Then leave my mistress to me and go and make yourself comfortable in your own room Emily s answer was a positive refusal missus Ellmother driven to her last resources raised a new obstacle It s not to be done I tell you How can you see Miss Letitia when she can t bear the light in her room Do you know what color her eyes are Red poor soul red as a boiled lobster With every word the woman uttered Emily s perplexity and distress increased You told me my aunt s illness was fever she said and now you speak of some complaint in her eyes Stand out of the way if you please and let me go to her missus Ellmother still keeping her place looked through the open door Here s the doctor she announced It seems I can t satisfy you ask him what s the matter Come in doctor She threw open the door of the parlor and introduced Emily This is the mistress s niece sir Please try if you can keep her quiet I can t She placed chairs with the hospitable politeness of the old school and returned to her post at Miss Letitia s bedside Doctor Allday was an elderly man with a cool manner and a ruddy complexion thoroughly acclimatized to the atmosphere of pain and grief in which it was his destiny to live He spoke to Emily without any undue familiarity as if he had been accustomed to see her for the greater part of her life That s a curious woman he said when missus Ellmother closed the door the most headstrong person I think I ever met with But devoted to her mistress and making allowance for her awkwardness not a bad nurse I am afraid I can t give you an encouraging report of your aunt The rheumatic fever aggravated by the situation of this house built on clay you know and close to stagnant water has been latterly complicated by delirium Is that a bad sign sir The worst possible sign it shows that the disease has affected the heart Yes she is suffering from inflammation of the eyes but that is an unimportant symptom We can keep the pain under by means of cooling lotions and a dark room I ve often heard her speak of you especially since the illness assumed a serious character What did you say Will she know you when you go into her room This is about the time when the delirium usually sets in I ll see if there s a quiet interval He opened the door and came back again By the way he resumed I ought perhaps to explain how it was that I took the liberty of sending you that telegram missus Ellmother refused to inform you of her mistress s serious illness That circumstance according to my view of it laid the responsibility on the doctor s shoulders The form taken by your aunt s delirium I mean the apparent tendency of the words that escape her in that state seems to excite some incomprehensible feeling in the mind of her crabbed servant She wouldn t even let me go into the bedroom if she could possibly help it Did missus Ellmother give you a warm welcome when you came here Far from it My arrival seemed to annoy her Ah just what I expected These faithful old servants always end by presuming on their fidelity Did you ever hear what a witty poet I forget his name he lived to be ninety said of the man who had been his valet for more than half a century For thirty years he was the best of servants and for thirty years he has been the hardest of masters Quite true I might say the same of my housekeeper Rather a good story isn t it The story was completely thrown away on Emily but one subject interested her now My poor aunt has always been fond of me she said Perhaps she might know me when she recognizes nobody else Not very likely the doctor answered But there s no laying down any rule in cases of this kind I have sometimes observed that circumstances which have produced a strong impression on patients when they are in a state of health give a certain direction to the wandering of their minds when they are in a state of fever You will say I am not a circumstance I don t see how this encourages me to hope and you will be quite right Instead of talking of my medical experience I shall do better to look at Miss Letitia and let you know the result You have got other relations I suppose No Very distressing very distressing Who has not suffered as Emily suffered when she was left alone Are there not moments if we dare to confess the truth when poor humanity loses its hold on the consolations of religion and the hope of immortality and feels the cruelty of creation that bids us live on the condition that we die and leads the first warm beginnings of love with merciless certainty to the cold conclusion of the grave She s quiet for the time being doctor Allday announced on his return Remember please that she can t see you in the inflamed state of her eyes and don t disturb the bed curtains The sooner you go to her the better perhaps if you have anything to say which depends on her recognizing your voice I ll call to morrow morning Very distressing he repeated taking his hat and making his bow Very distressing Emily crossed the narrow little passage which separated the two rooms and opened the bed chamber door missus Ellmother met her on the threshold No said the obstinate old servant you can t come in The faint voice of Miss Letitia made itself heard calling missus Ellmother by her familiar nick name Bony who is it Never mind Who is it Miss Emily if you must know Oh poor dear why does she come here Who told her I was ill The doctor told her Don t come in Emily It will only distress you and it will do me no good God bless you my love Don t come in There said missus Ellmother Do you hear that Go back to the sitting room Thus far the hard necessity of controlling herself had kept Emily silent She was now able to speak without tears Remember the old times aunt she pleaded gently Don t keep me out of your room when I have come here to nurse you I m her nurse Go back to the sitting room missus Ellmother repeated True love lasts while life lasts The dying woman relented Bony Bony I can t be unkind to Emily Let her in missus Ellmother still insisted on having her way You re contradicting your own orders she said to her mistress You don t know how soon you may begin wandering in your mind again Think Miss Letitia think This remonstrance was received in silence missus Ellmother s great gaunt figure still blocked up the doorway If you force me to it Emily said quietly I must go to the doctor and ask him to interfere Do you mean that missus Ellmother said quietly on her side I do mean it was the answer The old servant suddenly submitted with a look which took Emily by surprise She had expected to see anger the face that now confronted her was a face subdued by sorrow and fear I wash my hands of it missus Ellmother said Go in and take the consequences CHAPTER XIII MISS LETITIA Emily entered the room The door was immediately closed on her from the outer side missus Ellmother s heavy steps were heard retreating along the passage Then the banging of the door that led into the kitchen shook the flimsily built cottage Then there was silence The dim light of a lamp hidden away in a corner and screened by a dingy green shade just revealed the closely curtained bed and the table near it bearing medicine bottles and glasses The only objects on the chimney piece were a clock that had been stopped in mercy to the sufferer s irritable nerves and an open case containing a machine for pouring drops into the eyes The smell of fumigating pastilles hung heavily on the air To Emily s excited imagination the silence was like the silence of death She approached the bed trembling Won t you speak to me aunt Is that you Emily Who let you come in You said I might come in dear Are you thirsty I see some lemonade on the table Shall I give it to you No If you open the bed curtains you let in the light My poor eyes Why are you here my dear Why are you not at the school It s holiday time aunt Besides I have left school for good Left school Miss Letitia s memory made an effort as she repeated those words You were going somewhere when you left school she said and Cecilia Wyvil had something to do with it Oh my love how cruel of you to go away to a stranger when you might live here with me She paused her sense of what she had herself just said began to grow confused What stranger she asked abruptly Was it a man What name Oh my mind Has death got hold of my mind before my body Hush hush I ll tell you the name Sir Jervis Redwood I don t know him I don t want to know him Do you think he means to send for you Perhaps he has sent for you I won t allow it You shan t go Don t excite yourself dear I have refused to go I mean to stay here with you The fevered brain held to its last idea Has he sent for you she said again louder than before Emily replied once more in terms carefully chosen with the one purpose of pacifying her The attempt proved to be useless and worse it seemed to make her suspicious I won t be deceived she said I mean to know all about it He did send for you Whom did he send His housekeeper What name The tone in which she put the question told of excitement that was rising to its climax Don t you know that I m curious about names she burst out Why do you provoke me Who is it Nobody you know or need care about dear aunt missus Rook Instantly on the utterance of that name there followed an unexpected result Silence ensued Emily waited hesitated advanced to part the curtains and look in at her aunt She was stopped by a dreadful sound of laughter the cheerless laughter that is heard among the mad It suddenly ended in a dreary sigh Afraid to look in she spoke hardly knowing what she said Is there anything you wish for Shall I call Miss Letitia s voice interrupted her Dull low rapidly muttering it was unlike shockingly unlike the familiar voice of her aunt It said strange words missus Rook What does missus Rook matter Or her husband either Bony Bony you re frightened about nothing Where s the danger of those two people turning up Do you know how many miles away the village is Oh you fool a hundred miles and more Never mind the coroner the coroner must keep in his own district and the jury too A risky deception I call it a pious fraud And I have a tender conscience and a cultivated mind The newspaper How is our newspaper to find its way to her I should like to know You poor old Bony Upon my word you do me good you make me laugh The cheerless laughter broke out again and died away again drearily in a sigh Accustomed to decide rapidly in the ordinary emergencies of her life Emily felt herself painfully embarrassed by the position in which she was now placed After what she had already heard could she reconcile it to her sense of duty to her aunt to remain any longer in the room In the hopeless self betrayal of delirium Miss Letitia had revealed some act of concealment committed in her past life and confided to her faithful old servant Under these circumstances had Emily made any discoveries which convicted her of taking a base advantage of her position at the bedside Most assuredly not The nature of the act of concealment the causes that had led to it the person or persons affected by it these were mysteries which left her entirely in the dark She had found out that her aunt was acquainted with missus Rook and that was literally all she knew Blameless so far in the line of conduct that she had pursued might she still remain in the bed chamber on this distinct understanding with herself that she would instantly return to the sitting room if she heard anything which could suggest a doubt of Miss Letitia s claim to her affection and respect After some hesitation she decided on leaving it to her conscience to answer that question Does conscience ever say No when inclination says Yes Emily s conscience sided with her reluctance to leave her aunt Throughout the time occupied by these reflections the silence had remained unbroken Emily began to feel uneasy She timidly put her hand through the curtains and took Miss Letitia s hand The contact with the burning skin startled her She turned away to the door to call the servant when the sound of her aunt s voice hurried her back to the bed Are you there Bony the voice asked Was her mind getting clear again Emily tried the experiment of making a plain reply Your niece is with you she said Shall I call the servant Miss Letitia s mind was still far away from Emily and from the present time The servant she repeated All the servants but you Bony have been sent away London s the place for us No gossiping servants and no curious neighbors in London Bury the horrid truth in London Ah you may well say I look anxious and wretched I hate deception and yet it must be done Why do you waste time in talking Why don t you find out where the vile woman lives Only let me get at her and I ll make Sara ashamed of herself Emily s heart beat fast when she heard the woman s name Sara as she and her school fellows knew was the baptismal name of Miss Jethro Had her aunt alluded to the disgraced teacher or to some other woman She waited eagerly to hear more There was nothing to be heard At this most interesting moment the silence remained undisturbed In the fervor of her anxiety to set her doubts at rest Emily s faith in her own good resolutions began to waver The temptation to say something which might set her aunt talking again was too strong to be resisted if she remained at the bedside Despairing of herself she rose and turned to the door In the moment that passed while she crossed the room the very words occurred to her that would suit her purpose Her cheeks were hot with shame she hesitated she looked back at the bed the words passed her lips Sara is only one of the woman s names she said Do you like her other name The rapidly muttering tones broke out again instantly but not in answer to Emily The sound of a voice had encouraged Miss Letitia to pursue her own confused train of thought and had stimulated the fast failing capacity of speech to exert itself once more No no He s too cunning for you and too cunning for me He doesn t leave letters about he destroys them all Did I say he was too cunning for us It s false We are too cunning for him Who found the morsels of his letter in the basket Who stuck them together Ah we know Don t read it Bony Dear Miss Jethro don t read it again Miss Jethro in his letter and Sara when he talks to himself in the garden Oh who would have believed it of him if we hadn t seen and heard it ourselves There was no more doubt now But who was the man so bitterly and so regretfully alluded to No this time Emily held firmly by the resolution which bound her to respect the helpless position of her aunt The speediest way of summoning missus Ellmother would be to ring the bell As she touched the handle a faint cry of suffering from the bed called her back Oh so thirsty murmured the failing voice so thirsty She parted the curtains The shrouded lamplight just showed her the green shade over Miss Letitia s eyes the hollow cheeks below it the arms laid helplessly on the bed clothes Oh aunt don t you know my voice Don t you know Emily Let me kiss you dear Useless to plead with her useless to kiss her she only reiterated the words So thirsty so thirsty Emily raised the poor tortured body with a patient caution which spared it pain and put the glass to her aunt s lips She drank the lemonade to the last drop Refreshed for the moment she spoke again spoke to the visionary servant of her delirious fancy while she rested in Emily s arms For God s sake take care how you answer if she questions you If she knew what we know Are men ever ashamed Ha the vile woman the vile woman Her voice sinking gradually dropped to a whisper The next few words that escaped her were muttered inarticulately Little by little the false energy of fever was wearing itself out She lay silent and still To look at her now was to look at the image of death Once more Emily kissed her closed the curtains and rang the bell missus Ellmother failed to appear Emily left the room to call her Arrived at the top of the kitchen stairs she noted a slight change The door below which she had heard banged on first entering her aunt s room now stood open She called to missus Ellmother A strange voice answered her Its accent was soft and courteous presenting the strongest imaginable contrast to the harsh tones of Miss Letitia s crabbed old maid Is there anything I can do for you miss The person making this polite inquiry appeared at the foot of the stairs a plump and comely woman of middle age She looked up at the young lady with a pleasant smile I beg your pardon Emily said I had no intention of disturbing you I called to missus Ellmother The stranger advanced a little way up the stairs and answered missus Ellmother is not here Do you expect her back soon Excuse me miss I don t expect her back at all Do you mean to say that she has left the house Yes miss She has left the house CHAPTER XIV missus MOSEY Emily s first act after the discovery of missus Ellmother s incomprehensible disappearance was to invite the new servant to follow her into the sitting room Can you explain this she began No miss May I ask if you have come here by missus Ellmother s invitation By missus Ellmother s request miss Can you tell me how she came to make the request With pleasure miss Perhaps as you find me here a stranger to yourself in place of the customary servant I ought to begin by giving you a reference And perhaps if you will be so kind by mentioning your name Emily added Thank you for reminding me miss My name is Elizabeth Mosey I am well known to the gentleman who attends Miss Letitia doctor Allday will speak to my character and also to my experience as a nurse If it would be in any way satisfactory to give you a second reference Quite needless missus Mosey Permit me to thank you again miss I was at home this evening when missus Ellmother called at my lodgings Says she I have come here Elizabeth to ask a favor of you for old friendship s sake Says I My dear pray command me whatever it may be If this seems rather a hasty answer to make before I knew what the favor was might I ask you to bear in mind that missus Ellmother put it to me for old friendship s sake alluding to my late husband and to the business which we carried on at that time Through no fault of ours we got into difficulties Persons whom we had trusted proved unworthy Not to trouble you further I may say at once we should have been ruined if our old friend missus Ellmother had not come forward and trusted us with the savings of her lifetime The money was all paid back again before my husband s death But I don t consider and I think you won t consider that the obligation was paid back too Prudent or not prudent there is nothing missus Ellmother can ask of me that I am not willing to do If I have put myself in an awkward situation and I don t deny that it looks so this is the only excuse miss that I can make for my conduct missus Mosey was too fluent and too fond of hearing the sound of her own eminently persuasive voice Making allowance for these little drawbacks the impression that she produced was decidedly favorable and however rashly she might have acted her motive was beyond reproach Having said some kind words to this effect Emily led her back to the main interest of her narrative Did missus Ellmother give no reason for leaving my aunt at such a time as this she asked The very words I said to her miss And what did she say by way of reply She burst out crying a thing I have never known her to do before in an experience of twenty years And she really asked you to take her place here at a moment s notice That was just what she did missus Mosey answered I had no need to tell her I was astonished my lips spoke for me no doubt She s a hard woman in speech and manner I admit But there s more feeling in her than you would suppose If you are the good friend I take you for she says don t ask me for reasons I am doing what is forced on me and doing it with a heavy heart In my place miss would you have insisted on her explaining herself after that The one thing I naturally wanted to know was if I could speak to some lady in the position of mistress here before I ventured to intrude missus Ellmother understood that it was her duty to help me in this particular Your poor aunt being out of the question she mentioned you How did she speak of me In an angry way No indeed quite the contrary She says You will find Miss Emily at the cottage She is Miss Letitia s niece Everybody likes her and everybody is right She really said that Those were her words And what is more she gave me a message for you at parting If Miss Emily is surprised that was how she put it give her my duty and good wishes and tell her to remember what I said when she took my place at her aunt s bedside I don t presume to inquire what this means said missus Mosey respectfully ready to hear what it meant if Emily would only be so good as to tell her I deliver the message miss as it was delivered to me After which missus Ellmother went her way and I went mine Do you know where she went No miss Have you nothing more to tell me Nothing more except that she gave me my directions of course about the nursing I took them down in writing and you will find them in their proper place with the prescriptions and the medicines Acting at once on this hint Emily led the way to her aunt s room Miss Letitia was silent when the new nurse softly parted the curtains looked in and drew them together again Consulting her watch missus Mosey compared her written directions with the medicine bottles on the table and set one apart to be used at the appointed time Nothing so far to alarm us she whispered You look sadly pale and tired miss Might I advise you to rest a little If there is any change missus Mosey either for the better or the worse of course you will let me know Certainly miss Emily returned to the sitting room not to rest after all that she had heard but to think Amid much that was unintelligible certain plain conclusions presented themselves to her mind After what the doctor had already said to Emily on the subject of delirium generally missus Ellmother s proceedings became intelligible they proved that she knew by experience the perilous course taken by her mistress s wandering thoughts when they expressed themselves in words This explained the concealment of Miss Letitia s illness from her niece as well as the reiterated efforts of the old servant to prevent Emily from entering the bedroom But the event which had just happened that is to say missus Ellmother s sudden departure from the cottage was not only of serious importance in itself but pointed to a startling conclusion The faithful maid had left the mistress whom she had loved and served sinking under a fatal illness and had put another woman in her place careless of what that woman might discover by listening at the bedside rather than confront Emily after she had been within hearing of her aunt while the brain of the suffering woman was deranged by fever There was the state of the case in plain words In what frame of mind had missus Ellmother adopted this desperate course of action To use her own expression she had deserted Miss Letitia with a heavy heart To judge by her own language addressed to missus Mosey she had left Emily to the mercy of a stranger animated nevertheless by sincere feelings of attachment and respect That her fears had taken for granted suspicion which Emily had not felt and discoveries which Emily had as yet not made in no way modified the serious nature of the inference which her conduct justified The disclosure which this woman dreaded who could doubt it now directly threatened Emily s peace of mind There was no disguising it the innocent niece was associated with an act of deception which had been until that day the undetected secret of the aunt and the aunt s maid In this conclusion and in this only was to be found the rational explanation of missus Ellmother s choice placed between the alternatives of submitting to discovery by Emily or of leaving the house Poor Miss Letitia s writing table stood near the window of the sitting room Shrinking from the further pursuit of thoughts which might end in disposing her mind to distrust of her dying aunt Emily looked round in search of some employment sufficiently interesting to absorb her attention The writing table reminded her that she owed a letter to Cecilia That helpful friend had surely the first claim to know why she had failed to keep her engagement with Sir Jervis Redwood After mentioning the telegram which had followed missus Rook s arrival at the school Emily s letter proceeded in these terms As soon as I had in some degree recovered myself I informed missus Rook of my aunt s serious illness Although she carefully confined herself to commonplace expressions of sympathy I could see that it was equally a relief to both of us to feel that we were prevented from being traveling companions Don t suppose that I have taken a capricious dislike to missus Rook or that you are in any way to blame for the unfavorable impression which she has produced on me I will make this plain when we meet In the meanwhile I need only tell you that I gave her a letter of explanation to present to Sir Jervis Redwood I also informed him of my address in London adding a request that he would forward your letter in case you have written to me before you receive these lines Kind mister Alban Morris accompanied me to the railway station and arranged with the guard to take special care of me on the journey to London We used to think him rather a heartless man We were quite wrong I don t know what his plans are for spending the summer holidays Go where he may I remember his kindness my best wishes go with him My dear I must not sadden your enjoyment of your pleasant visit to the Engadine by writing at any length of the sorrow that I am suffering You know how I love my aunt and how gratefully I have always felt her motherly goodness to me The doctor does not conceal the truth At her age there is no hope my father s last left relation my one dearest friend is dying No I must not forget that I have another friend I must find some comfort in thinking of you I do so long in my solitude for a letter from my dear Cecilia Nobody comes to see me when I most want sympathy I am a stranger in this vast city The members of my mother s family are settled in Australia they have not even written to me in all the long years that have passed since her death You remember how cheerfully I used to look forward to my new life on leaving school Good by my darling While I can see your sweet face in my thoughts I don t despair dark as it looks now of the future that is before me Emily had closed and addressed her letter and was just rising from her chair when she heard the voice of the new nurse at the door CHAPTER XV EMILY May I say a word missus Mosey inquired She entered the room pale and trembling Seeing that ominous change 
5077-38099-0001	train-other-500	Emily dropped back into her chair Dead she said faintly missus Mosey looked at her in vacant surprise
none	none	 I wish to say miss 
5077-38099-0002	train-other-500	that your aunt has frightened me Even that vague allusion was enough for Emily You need say no more she replied
none	none	 I know but too well how my aunt s mind is affected by the fever 
5077-38099-0003	train-other-500	Confused and frightened as she was missus Mosey still found relief in her customary flow of words Many and many a person have I nursed in fever she announced
none	none	 Many and many a person have I heard say strange things Never yet miss in all my experience Don t tell me of it 
5077-38099-0004	train-other-500	Emily interposed Oh but I must tell you In your own interests Miss Emily in your own interests I won t be inhuman enough to leave you alone in the house to night
5077-38099-0005	train-other-500	but if this delirium goes on I must ask you to get another nurse Shocking suspicions are lying in wait for me in that bedroom as it were
5077-38099-0006	train-other-500	I can t resist them as I ought if I go back again and hear your aunt saying what she has been saying for the last half hour and more
none	none	 missus Ellmother has expected impossibilities of me and missus Ellmother must take the consequences I don t say she didn t 
5077-38099-0007	train-other-500	warn me speaking you will please to understand in the strictest confidence Elizabeth she says you know how wildly people talk in Miss Letitia s present condition
none	none	 Pay no heed to it she says Let it go in at one ear and out at the other she says 
5077-38099-0008	train-other-500	If Miss Emily asks questions you know nothing about it If she s frightened you know nothing about it
none	none	 If she bursts into fits of crying that are dreadful to see pity her poor thing 
5077-38099-0009	train-other-500	but take no notice All very well and sounds like speaking out doesn t it Nothing of the sort missus Ellmother warns me to expect this that and the other But there is one
5077-38099-0010	train-other-500	horrid thing which I heard mind over and over again at your aunt s bedside that she does not prepare me for
none	none	 and that horrid thing is Murder At that last word missus Mosey dropped her voice to a whisper 
5077-38099-0011	train-other-500	and waited to see what effect she had produced Sorely tried already by the cruel perplexities of her position Emily s courage failed to resist the first sensation of horror
5077-38099-0012	train-other-500	aroused in her by the climax of the nurse s hysterical narrative Encouraged by her silence missus Mosey went on She lifted one hand with theatrical solemnity
5077-38099-0013	train-other-500	and luxuriously terrified herself with her own horrors An inn Miss Emily a lonely inn somewhere in the country and a comfortless room at the inn
5077-38099-0014	train-other-500	with a makeshift bed at one end of it and a makeshift bed at the other I give you my word of honor that was how your aunt put it She spoke of
none	none	 two men next two men asleep you understand 
5077-38099-0015	train-other-500	in the two beds I think she called them gentlemen but I can t be sure and I wouldn t deceive you you know I wouldn t deceive you for the world
5077-38099-0016	train-other-500	Miss Letitia muttered and mumbled poor soul I own I was getting tired of listening when she burst out plain again in that one horrid word
5077-38099-0017	train-other-500	Oh miss don t be impatient don t interrupt me Emily did interrupt nevertheless In some degree at least she had recovered herself No more of it she said
none	none	 I won t hear a word more But missus Mosey 
5077-38099-0018	train-other-500	was too resolutely bent on asserting her own importance by making the most of the alarm that she had suffered to be repressed by any ordinary method of remonstrance Without paying the slightest attention to what Emily had said
none	none	 she went on again more loudly and more excitably than ever 
5077-38099-0019	train-other-500	Listen miss listen The dreadful part of it is to come you haven t heard about the two gentlemen yet
none	none	 One of them was murdered 
5077-38099-0020	train-other-500	what do you think of that and the other I heard your aunt say it
none	none	 in so many words committed the crime 
5077-38099-0021	train-other-500	Did Miss Letitia fancy she was addressing a lot of people when you were nursing her She called out like a person making public proclamation when I was in her room Whoever you are good people
5077-38099-0022	train-other-500	she says a hundred pounds reward if you find the runaway murderer
none	none	 Search everywhere for a poor weak womanish creature with rings on his little white hands There s nothing about him like a man except his voice a fine round voice You ll know him 
5077-38099-0023	train-other-500	my friends the wretch the monster
none	none	 you ll know him by his voice That was how she put it I tell you again 
5077-38099-0024	train-other-500	that was how she put it Did you hear her scream Ah my dear young lady so much the better for you
none	none	 O the horrid murder she says hush it up 
5077-38099-0025	train-other-500	I ll take my Bible oath before the magistrate cried missus Mosey starting out of her chair your aunt said Hush it up Emily crossed the room
5077-38099-0026	train-other-500	The energy of her character was roused at last She seized the foolish woman by the shoulders forced her back in the chair and looked her straight in the face without uttering a word For the moment
5077-38099-0027	train-other-500	missus Mosey was petrified She had fully expected having reached the end of her terrible story to find Emily at her feet entreating her not to carry out her intention of leaving the cottage
none	none	 the next morning and she had determined after her sense of her own importance had been sufficiently flattered

dying aunt CHAPTER XVI MISS JETHRO A fortnight after the disappearance of missus Ellmother and the dismissal of missus Mosey Doctor Allday entered his consulting room punctual to the hour at which he was accustomed to receive patients An occasional wrinkling of his eyebrows accompanied by an intermittent restlessness in his movements appeared to indicate some disturbance of this worthy man s professional composure His mind was indeed not at ease Even the inexcitable old doctor had felt the attraction which had already conquered three such dissimilar people as Alban Morris Cecilia Wyvil and Francine de Sor He was thinking of Emily A ring at the door bell announced the arrival of the first patient The servant introduced a tall lady dressed simply and elegantly in dark apparel Noticeable features of a Jewish cast worn and haggard but still preserving their grandeur of form were visible through her veil She moved with grace and dignity and she stated her object in consulting Doctor Allday with the ease of a well bred woman I come to ask your opinion sir on the state of my heart she said and I am recommended by a patient who has consulted you with advantage to herself She placed a card on the doctor s writing desk and added I have become acquainted with the lady by being one of the lodgers in her house The doctor recognized the name and the usual proceedings ensued After careful examination he arrived at a favorable conclusion I may tell you at once he said there is no reason to be alarmed about the state of your heart I have never felt any alarm about myself she answered quietly A sudden death is an easy death If one s affairs are settled it seems on that account to be the death to prefer My object was to settle my affairs such as they are if you had considered my life to be in danger Is there nothing the matter with me I don t say that the doctor replied The action of your heart is very feeble Take the medicine that I shall prescribe pay a little more attention to eating and drinking than ladies usually do don t run upstairs and don t fatigue yourself by violent exercise and I see no reason why you shouldn t live to be an old woman God forbid the lady said to herself She turned away and looked out of the window with a bitter smile Doctor Allday wrote his prescription Are you likely to make a long stay in London he asked I am here for a little while only Do you wish to see me again I should like to see you once more before you go away if you can make it convenient What name shall I put on the prescription Miss Jethro A remarkable name the doctor said in his matter of fact way Miss Jethro s bitter smile showed itself again Without otherwise noticing what Doctor Allday had said she laid the consultation fee on the table At the same moment the footman appeared with a letter From Miss Emily Brown he said No answer required He held the door open as he delivered the message seeing that Miss Jethro was about to leave the room She dismissed him by a gesture and returning to the table pointed to the letter Was your correspondent lately a pupil at Miss Ladd s school she inquired My correspondent has just left Miss Ladd the doctor answered Are you a friend of hers I am acquainted with her You would be doing the poor child a kindness if you would go and see her She has no friends in London Pardon me she has an aunt Her aunt died a week since Are there no other relations None A melancholy state of things isn t it She would have been absolutely alone in the house if I had not sent one of my women servants to stay with her for the present Did you know her father Miss Jethro passed over the question as if she had not heard it Has the young lady dismissed her aunt s servants she asked Her aunt kept but one servant ma am The woman has spared Miss Emily the trouble of dismissing her He briefly alluded to missus Ellmother s desertion of her mistress I can t explain it he said when he had done Can you What makes you think sir that I can help you I have never even heard of the servant and the mistress was a stranger to me At Doctor Allday s age a man is not easily discouraged by reproof even when it is administered by a handsome woman I thought you might have known Miss Emily s father he persisted Miss Jethro rose and wished him good morning I must not occupy any more of your valuable time she said Suppose you wait a minute the doctor suggested Impenetrable as ever he rang the bell Any patients in the waiting room he inquired You see I have time to spare he resumed when the man had replied in the negative I take an interest in this poor girl and I thought If you think that I take an interest in her too Miss Jethro interposed you are perfectly right I knew her father she added abruptly the allusion to Emily having apparently reminded her of the question which she had hitherto declined to notice In that case Doctor Allday proceeded I want a word of advice Won t you sit down She took a chair in silence An irregular movement in the lower part of her veil seemed to indicate that she was breathing with difficulty The doctor observed her with close attention Let me see my prescription again he said Having added an ingredient he handed it back with a word of explanation Your nerves are more out of order than I supposed The hardest disease to cure that I know of is worry The hint could hardly have been plainer but it was lost on Miss Jethro Whatever her troubles might be her medical adviser was not made acquainted with them Quietly folding up the prescription she reminded him that he had proposed to ask her advice In what way can I be of service to you she inquired I am afraid I must try your patience the doctor acknowledged if I am to answer that question plainly With these prefatory words he described the events that had followed missus Mosey s appearance at the cottage I am only doing justice to this foolish woman he continued when I tell you that she came here after she had left Miss Emily and did her best to set matters right I went to the poor girl directly and I felt it my duty after looking at her aunt not to leave her alone for that night When I got home the next morning whom do you think I found waiting for me missus Ellmother He stopped in the expectation that Miss Jethro would express some surprise Not a word passed her lips missus Ellmother s object was to ask how her mistress was going on the doctor proceeded Every day while Miss Letitia still lived she came here to make the same inquiry without a word of explanation On the day of the funeral there she was at the church dressed in deep mourning and as I can personally testify crying bitterly When the ceremony was over can you believe it she slipped away before Miss Emily or I could speak to her We have seen nothing more of her and heard nothing more from that time to this He stopped again the silent lady still listening without making any remark Have you no opinion to express the doctor asked bluntly I am waiting Miss Jethro answered Waiting for what I haven t heard yet why you want my advice Doctor Allday s observation of humanity had hitherto reckoned want of caution among the deficient moral qualities in the natures of women He set down Miss Jethro as a remarkable exception to a general rule I want you to advise me as to the right course to take with Miss Emily he said She has assured me she attaches no serious importance to her aunt s wanderings when the poor old lady s fever was at its worst I don t doubt that she speaks the truth but I have my own reasons for being afraid that she is deceiving herself Will you bear this in mind Yes if it s necessary In plain words Miss Jethro you think I am still wandering from the point I have got to the point Yesterday Miss Emily told me that she hoped to be soon composed enough to examine the papers left by her aunt Miss Jethro suddenly turned in her chair and looked at Doctor Allday Are you beginning to feel interested the doctor asked mischievously She neither acknowledged nor denied it Go on was all she said I don t know how you feel he proceeded I am afraid of the discoveries which she may make and I am strongly tempted to advise her to leave the proposed examination to her aunt s lawyer Is there anything in your knowledge of Miss Emily s late father which tells you that I am right Before I reply said Miss Jethro it may not be amiss to let the young lady speak for herself How is she to do that the doctor asked Miss Jethro pointed to the writing table Look there she said You have not yet opened Miss Emily s letter CHAPTER XVII DOCTOR ALLDAY Absorbed in the effort to overcome his patient s reserve the doctor had forgotten Emily s letter He opened it immediately After reading the first sentence he looked up with an expression of annoyance She has begun the examination of the papers already he said Then I can be of no further use to you Miss Jethro rejoined She made a second attempt to leave the room Doctor Allday turned to the next page of the letter Stop he cried She has found something and here it is He held up a small printed Handbill which had been placed between the first and second pages Suppose you look at it he said Whether I am interested in it or not Miss Jethro asked You may be interested in what Miss Emily says about it in her letter Do you propose to show me her letter I propose to read it to you Miss Jethro took the Handbill without further objection It was expressed in these words MURDER one hundred POUNDS REWARD Whereas a murder was committed on the thirtieth September eighteen seventy seven at the Hand in Hand Inn in the village of Zeeland Hampshire the above reward will be paid to any person or persons whose exertions shall lead to the arrest and conviction of the suspected murderer Name not known Supposed age between twenty and thirty years A well made man of small stature Fair complexion delicate features clear blue eye s Hair light and cut rather short Clean shaven with the exception of narrow half whiskers Small white well shaped hands Wore valuable rings on the two last fingers of the left hand Dressed neatly in a dark gray tourist suit Carried a knapsack as if on a pedestrian excursion Remarkably good voice smooth full and persuasive Ingratiating manners Apply to the Chief Inspector Metropolitan Police Office London Miss Jethro laid aside the Handbill without any visible appearance of agitation The doctor took up Emily s letter and read as follows You will be as much relieved as I was my kind friend when you look at the paper inclosed I found it loose in a blank book with cuttings from newspapers and odd announcements of lost property and other curious things all huddled together between the leaves which my aunt no doubt intended to set in order and fix in their proper places She must have been thinking of her book poor soul in her last illness Here is the origin of those terrible words which frightened stupid missus Mosey Is it not encouraging to have discovered such a confirmation of my opinion as this I feel a new interest in looking over the papers that still remain to be examined Before he could get to the end of the sentence Miss Jethro s agitation broke through her reserve Do what you proposed to do she burst out vehemently Stop her at once from carrying her examination any further If she hesitates insist on it At last Doctor Allday had triumphed It has been a long time coming he remarked in his cool way and it s all the more welcome on that account You dread the discoveries she may make Miss Jethro as I do And you know what those discoveries may be What I do know or don t know is of no importance she answered sharply Excuse me it is of very serious importance I have no authority over this poor girl I am not even an old friend You tell me to insist Help me to declare honestly that I know of circumstances which justify me and I may insist to some purpose Miss Jethro lifted her veil for the first time and eyed him searchingly I believe I can trust you she said Now listen The one consideration on which I consent to open my lips is consideration for Miss Emily s tranquillity Promise me absolute secrecy on your word of honor He gave the promise I want to know one thing first Miss Jethro proceeded Did she tell you as she once told me that her father had died of heart complaint Yes Did you put any questions to her I asked how long ago it was And she told you She told me You wish to know Doctor Allday what discoveries Miss Emily may yet make among her aunt s papers Judge for yourself when I tell you that she has been deceived about her father s death Do you mean that he is still living I mean that she has been deceived purposely deceived about the manner of his death Who was the wretch who did it You are wronging the dead sir The truth can only have been concealed out of the purest motives of love and pity I don t desire to disguise the conclusion at which I have arrived after what I have heard from yourself The person responsible must be Miss Emily s aunt and the old servant must have been in her confidence Remember You are bound in honor not to repeat to any living creature what I have just said The doctor followed Miss Jethro to the door You have not yet told me he said how her father died I have no more to tell you With those words she left him He rang for his servant To wait until the hour at which he was accustomed to go out might be to leave Emily s peace of mind at the mercy of an accident I am going to the cottage he said If anybody wants me I shall be back in a quarter of an hour On the point of leaving the house he remembered that Emily would probably expect him to return the Handbill As he took it up the first lines caught his eye he read the date at which the murder had been committed for the second time On a sudden the ruddy color left his face Good God he cried her father was murdered and that woman was concerned in it Following the impulse that urged him he secured the Handbill in his pocketbook snatched up the card which his patient had presented as her introduction and instantly left the house He called the first cab that passed him and drove to Miss Jethro s lodgings Gone was the servant s answer when he inquired for her He insisted on speaking to the landlady Hardly ten minutes have passed he said since she left my house Hardly ten minutes have passed the landlady replied since that message was brought here by a boy The message had been evidently written in great haste I am unexpectedly obliged to leave London A bank note is inclosed in payment of my debt to you I will send for my luggage The doctor withdrew Unexpectedly obliged to leave London he repeated as he got into the cab again Her flight condemns her not a doubt of it now As fast as you can he shouted to the man directing him to drive to Emily s cottage CHAPTER XVIII MISS LADD Arriving at the cottage Doctor Allday discovered a gentleman who was just closing the garden gate behind him Has Miss Emily had a visitor he inquired when the servant admitted him The gentleman left a letter for Miss Emily sir Did he ask to see her He asked after Miss Letitia s health When he heard that she was dead he seemed to be startled and went away immediately Did he give his name No sir The doctor found Emily absorbed over her letter His anxiety to forestall any possible discovery of the deception which had concealed the terrible story of her father s death kept Doctor Allday s vigilance on the watch He doubted the gentleman who had abstained from giving his name he even distrusted the other unknown person who had written to Emily She looked up Her face relieved him of his misgivings before she could speak At last I have heard from my dearest friend she said You remember what I told you about Cecilia Here is a letter a long delightful letter from the Engadine left at the door by some gentleman unknown I was questioning the servant when you rang the bell You may question me if you prefer it I arrived just as the gentleman was shutting your garden gate Oh tell me what was he like Tall and thin and dark Wore a vile republican looking felt hat Had nasty ill tempered wrinkles between his eyebrows The sort of man I distrust by instinct Why Because he doesn t shave Do you mean that he wore a beard Yes a curly black beard Emily clasped her hands in amazement Can it be Alban Morris she exclaimed The doctor looked at her with a sardonic smile he thought it likely that he had discovered her sweetheart Who is mister Alban Morris he asked The drawing master at Miss Ladd s school Doctor Allday dropped the subject masters at ladies schools were not persons who interested him He returned to the purpose which had brought him to the cottage and produced the Handbill that had been sent to him in Emily s letter I suppose you want to have it back again he said She took it from him and looked at it with interest Isn t it strange she suggested that the murderer should have escaped with such a careful description of him as this circulated all over England She read the description to the doctor Name not known Supposed age between twenty five and thirty years A well made man of small stature Fair complexion delicate features clear blue eyes Hair light and cut rather short Clean shaven with the exception of narrow half whiskers Small white well shaped hands Wore valuable rings on the two last fingers of the left hand Dressed neatly That part of the description is useless the doctor remarked he would change his clothes But could he change his voice Emily objected Listen to this Remarkably good voice smooth full and persuasive And here again Ingratiating manners Perhaps you will say he could put on an appearance of rudeness I will say this my dear He would be able to disguise himself so effectually that ninety nine people out of a hundred would fail to identify him either by his voice or his manner How Look back at the description Hair cut rather short clean shaven with the exception of narrow half whiskers The wretch was safe from pursuit he had ample time at his disposal don t you see how he could completely alter the appearance of his head and face No more my dear of this disagreeable subject Let us get to something interesting Have you found anything else among your aunt s papers I have met with a great disappointment Emily replied Did I tell you how I discovered the Handbill No I found it with the scrap book and the newspaper cuttings under a collection of empty boxes and bottles in a drawer of the washhand stand And I naturally expected to make far more interesting discoveries in this room My search was over in five minutes Nothing in the cabinet there in the corner but a few books and some china Nothing in the writing desk on that side table but a packet of note paper and some sealing wax Nothing here in the drawers but tradesmen s receipts materials for knitting and old photographs She must have destroyed all her papers poor dear before her last illness and the Handbill and the other things can only have escaped because they were left in a place which she never thought of examining Isn t it provoking With a mind inexpressibly relieved good Doctor Allday asked permission to return to his patients leaving Emily to devote herself to her friend s letter On his way out he noticed that the door of the bed chamber on the opposite side of the passage stood open Since Miss Letitia s death the room had not been used Well within view stood the washhand stand to which Emily had alluded The doctor advanced to the house door reflected hesitated and looked toward the empty room It had struck him that there might be a second drawer which Emily had overlooked Would he be justified in setting this doubt at rest If he passed over ordinary scruples it would not be without excuse Miss Letitia had spoken to him of her affairs and had asked him to act in Emily s interest as company executor with her lawyer The rapid progress of the illness had made it impossible for her to execute the necessary codicil But the doctor had been morally if not legally taken into her confidence and for that reason he decided that he had a right in this serious matter to satisfy his own mind A glance was enough to show him that no second drawer had been overlooked There was no other discovery to detain the doctor The wardrobe only contained the poor old lady s clothes the one cupboard was open and empty On the point of leaving the room he went back to the washhand stand While he had the opportunity it might not be amiss to make sure that Emily had thoroughly examined those old boxes and bottles which she had alluded to with some little contempt The drawer was of considerable length When he tried to pull it completely out from the grooves in which it ran it resisted him In his present frame of mind this was a suspicious circumstance in itself He cleared away the litter so as to make room for the introduction of his hand and arm into the drawer In another moment his fingers touched a piece of paper jammed between the inner end of the drawer and the bottom of the flat surface of the washhand stand With a little care he succeeded in extricating the paper Only pausing to satisfy himself that there was nothing else to be found and to close the drawer after replacing its contents he left the cottage The cab was waiting for him On the drive back to his own house he opened the crumpled paper It proved to be a letter addressed to Miss Letitia and it was signed by no less a person than Emily s schoolmistress Looking back from the end to the beginning Doctor Allday discovered in the first sentence the name of Miss Jethro But for the interview of that morning with his patient he might have doubted the propriety of making himself further acquainted with the letter As things were he read it without hesitation DEAR MADAM I cannot but regard it as providential circumstance that your niece in writing to you from my house should have mentioned among other events of her school life the arrival of my new teacher Miss Jethro To say that I was surprised is to express very inadequately what I felt when I read your letter informing me confidentially that I had employed a woman who was unworthy to associate with the young persons placed under my care It is impossible for me to suppose that a lady in your position and possessed of your high principles would make such a serious accusation as this without unanswerable reasons for doing so At the same time I cannot consistently with my duty as a Christian suffer my opinion of Miss Jethro to be in any way modified until proofs are laid before me which it is impossible to dispute Placing the same confidence in your discretion which you have placed in mine I now inclose the references and testimonials which Miss Jethro submitted to me when she presented herself to fill the vacant situation in my school I earnestly request you to lose no time in instituting the confidential inquiries which you have volunteered to make Whatever the result may be pray return to me the inclosures which I have trusted to your care and believe me dear madam in much suspense and anxiety sincerely yours AMELIA LADD It is needless to describe at any length the impression which these lines produced on the doctor If he had heard what Emily had heard at the time of her aunt s last illness he would have called to mind Miss Letitia s betrayal of her interest in some man unknown whom she believed to have been beguiled by Miss Jethro and he would have perceived that the vindictive hatred thus produced must have inspired the letter of denunciation which the schoolmistress had acknowledged He would also have inferred that Miss Letitia s inquiries had proved her accusation to be well founded if he had known of the new teacher s sudden dismissal from the school As things were he was merely confirmed in his bad opinion of Miss Jethro and he was induced on reflection to keep his discovery to himself If poor Miss Emily saw the old lady exhibited in the character of an informer he thought what a blow would be struck at her innocent respect for the memory of her aunt CHAPTER XIX SIR JERVIS REDWOOD In the meantime Emily left by herself had her own correspondence to occupy her attention Besides the letter from Cecilia directed to the care of Sir Jervis Redwood she had received some lines addressed to her by Sir Jervis himself The two inclosures had been secured in a sealed envelope directed to the cottage If Alban Morris had been indeed the person trusted as messenger by Sir Jervis the conclusion that followed filled Emily with overpowering emotions of curiosity and surprise Having no longer the motive of serving and protecting her Alban must nevertheless have taken the journey to Northumberland He must have gained Sir Jervis Redwood s favor and confidence and he might even have been a guest at the baronet s country seat when Cecilia s letter arrived What did it mean Emily looked back at her experience of her last day at school and recalled her consultation with Alban on the subject of missus Rook Was he still bent on clearing up his suspicions of Sir Jervis s housekeeper And with that end in view had he followed the woman on her return to her master s place of abode Suddenly almost irritably Emily snatched up Sir Jervis s letter Before the doctor had come in she had glanced at it and had thrown it aside in her impatience to read what Cecilia had written In her present altered frame of mind she was inclined to think that Sir Jervis might be the more interesting correspondent of the two On returning to his letter she was disappointed at the outset In the first place his handwriting was so abominably bad that she was obliged to guess at his meaning In the second place he never hinted at the circumstances under which Cecilia s letter had been confided to the gentleman who had left it at her door She would once more have treated the baronet s communication with contempt but for the discovery that it contained an offer of employment in London addressed to herself Sir Jervis had necessarily been obliged to engage another secretary in Emily s absence But he was still in want of a person to serve his literary interests in London He had reason to believe that discoveries made by modern travelers in Central America had been reported from time to time by the English press and he wished copies to be taken of any notices of this sort which might be found on referring to the files of newspapers kept in the reading room of the British Museum If Emily considered herself capable of contributing in this way to the completeness of his great work on the ruined cities she had only to apply to his bookseller in London who would pay her the customary remuneration and give her every assistance of which she might stand in need The bookseller s name and address followed with nothing legible but the two words Bond Street and there was an end of Sir Jervis s proposal Emily laid it aside deferring her answer until she had read Cecilia s letter CHAPTER XX THE REVEREND MILES MIRABEL I am making a little excursion from the Engadine my dearest of all dear friends Two charming fellow travelers take care of me and we may perhaps get as far as the Lake of Como My sister already much improved in health remains at saint Moritz with the old governess The moment I know what exact course we are going to take I shall write to Julia to forward any letters which arrive in my absence My life in this earthly paradise will be only complete when I hear from my darling Emily In the meantime we are staying for the night at some interesting place the name of which I have unaccountably forgotten and here I am in my room writing to you at last dying to know if Sir Jervis has yet thrown himself at your feet and offered to make you Lady Redwood with magnificent settlements But you are waiting to hear who my new friends are My dear one of them is next to yourself the most delightful creature in existence Society knows her as Lady Janeaway I love her already by her Christian name she is my friend Doris And she reciprocates my sentiments You will now understand that union of sympathies made us acquainted with each other If there is anything in me to be proud of I think it must be my admirable appetite And if I have a passion the name of it is Pastry Here again Lady Doris reciprocates my sentiments We sit next to each other at the table d hote Good heavens I have forgotten her husband They have been married rather more than a month Did I tell you that she is just two years older than I am I declare I am forgetting him again He is Lord Janeaway Such a quiet modest man and so easily amused He carries with him everywhere a dirty little tin case with air holes in the cover He goes softly poking about among bushes and brambles and under rocks and behind old wooden houses When he has caught some hideous insect that makes one shudder he blushes with pleasure and looks at his wife and me and says with the prettiest lisp This is what I call enjoying the day To see the manner in which he obeys Her is between ourselves to feel proud of being a woman Where was I Oh at the table d hote Never Emily I say it with a solemn sense of the claims of truth never have I eaten such an infamous abominable maddeningly bad dinner as the dinner they gave us on our first day at the hotel I ask you if I am not patient I appeal to your own recollection of occasions when I have exhibited extraordinary self control My dear I held out until they brought the pastry round I took one bite and committed the most shocking offense against good manners at table that you can imagine My handkerchief my poor innocent handkerchief received the horrid please suppose the rest My hair stands on end when I think of it Our neighbors at the table saw me The coarse men laughed The sweet young bride sincerely feeling for me said Will you allow me to shake hands I did exactly what you have done the day before yesterday Such was the beginning of my friendship with Lady Doris Janeaway We are two resolute women I mean that she is resolute and that I follow her and we have asserted our right of dining to our own satisfaction by means of an interview with the chief cook This interesting person is an ex Zouave in the French army Instead of making excuses he confessed that the barbarous tastes of the English and American visitors had so discouraged him that he had lost all pride and pleasure in the exercise of his art As an example of what he meant he mentioned his experience of two young Englishmen who could speak no foreign language The waiters reported that they objected to their breakfasts and especially to the eggs Thereupon to translate the Frenchman s own way of putting it he exhausted himself in exquisite preparations of eggs Eggs a la tripe au gratin a l Aurore a la Dauphine a la Poulette a la Tartare a la Venitienne a la Bordelaise and so on and so on Still the two young gentlemen were not satisfied The ex Zouave infuriated wounded in his honor disgraced as a professor insisted on an explanation What in heaven s name did they want for breakfast They wanted boiled eggs and a fish which they called a Bloaterre It was impossible he said to express his contempt for the English idea of a breakfast in the presence of ladies You know how a cat expresses herself in the presence of a dog and you will understand the allusion Oh Emily what dinners we have had in our own room since we spoke to that noble cook Have I any more news to send you Are you interested my dear in eloquent young clergymen On our first appearance at the public table we noticed a remarkable air of depression among the ladies Had some adventurous gentleman tried to climb a mountain and failed Had disastrous political news arrived from England a defeat of the Conservatives for instance Had a revolution in the fashions broken out in Paris and had all our best dresses become of no earthly value to us I applied for information to the only lady present who shone on the company with a cheerful face my friend Doris of course What day was yesterday she asked Sunday I answered Of all melancholy Sundays she continued the most melancholy in the calendar mister Miles Mirabel preached his farewell sermon in our temporary chapel upstairs And you have not recovered it yet We are all heart broken Miss Wyvil This naturally interested me I asked what sort of sermons mister Mirabel preached Lady Janeaway said Come up to our room after dinner The subject is too distressing to be discussed in public She began by making me personally acquainted with the reverend gentleman that is to say she showed me the photographic portraits of him They were two in number One only presented his face The other exhibited him at full length adorned in his surplice Every lady in the congregation had received the two photographs as a farewell present My portraits Lady Doris remarked are the only complete specimens The others have been irretrievably ruined by tears You will now expect a personal description of this fascinating man What the photographs failed to tell me my friend was so kind as to complete from the resources of her own experience Here is the result presented to the best of my ability He is young not yet thirty years of age His complexion is fair his features are delicate his eyes are clear blue He has pretty hands and rings prettier still And such a voice and such manners You will say there are plenty of pet parsons who answer to this description Wait a little I have kept his chief distinction till the last His beautiful light hair flows in profusion over his shoulders and his glossy beard waves at apostolic length down to the lower buttons of his waistcoat What do you think of the Reverend Miles Mirabel now The life and adventures of our charming young clergyman bear eloquent testimony to the saintly patience of his disposition under trials which would have overwhelmed an ordinary man Lady Doris please notice quotes in this place the language of his admirers and I report Lady Doris He has been clerk in a lawyer s office unjustly dismissed He has given readings from Shakespeare infamously neglected He has been secretary to a promenade concert company deceived by a penniless manager He has been employed in negotiations for making foreign railways repudiated by an unprincipled Government He has been translator to a publishing house declared incapable by envious newspapers and reviews He has taken refuge in dramatic criticism dismissed by a corrupt editor Through all these means of purification for the priestly career he passed at last into the one sphere that was worthy of him he entered the Church under the protection of influential friends Oh happy change From that moment his labors have been blessed Twice already he has been presented with silver tea pots filled with sovereigns Go where he may precious sympathies environ him and domestic affection places his knife and fork at innumerable family tables After a continental career which will leave undying recollections he is now recalled to England at the suggestion of a

among simple breeders of sheep May the shepherd prove worthy of the flock Here again my dear I must give the merit where the merit is due This memoir of mister Mirabel is not of my writing It formed part of his farewell sermon preserved in the memory of Lady Doris and it shows once more in the language of his admirers that the truest humility may be found in the character of the most gifted man Let me only add that you will have opportunities of seeing and hearing this popular preacher when circumstances permit him to address congregations in the large towns I am at the end of my news and I begin to feel after this long long letter that it is time to go to bed Need I say that I have often spoken of you to Doris and that she entreats you to be her friend as well as mine when we meet again

5077-38105-0003	train-other-500	accustomed to frequent the London parks can hardly have failed to notice the number of solitary strangers sadly endeavoring to vary their lives by taking a walk They linger about the flower beds
5077-38105-0004	train-other-500	they sit for hours on the benches they look with patient curiosity at other people who have companions they notice ladies on horseback and children at play with submissive interest some of the men

5077-38105-0006	train-other-500	perhaps they are shame faced or proud or sullen perhaps they despair of others being accustomed to despair of themselves perhaps they have their reasons
5077-38105-0007	train-other-500	for never venturing to encounter curiosity or their vices which dread detection or their virtues which suffer hardship with the resignation that is sufficient for itself The one thing certain is
5077-38105-0008	train-other-500	that these unfortunate people resist discovery We know that they are strangers in London and we know no more And Emily was one of them Among the other forlorn wanderers in the Parks
5077-38105-0009	train-other-500	there appeared latterly a trim little figure in black with the face protected from notice behind a crape veil which was beginning to be familiar day after day to nursemaids and children
5077-38105-0010	train-other-500	and to rouse curiosity among harmless solitaries meditating on benches and idle vagabonds strolling over the grass The woman servant whom the considerate doctor had provided

5077-38105-0012	train-other-500	Let us go out for a walk She had communicated the news of her aunt s death to Miss Ladd at Brighton and had heard from Francine The worthy schoolmistress had written to her with the truest kindness
5077-38105-0013	train-other-500	Choose your own time my poor child and come and stay with me at Brighton the sooner the better Emily shrank
none	none	 not from accepting the invitation 
5077-38105-0014	train-other-500	but from encountering Francine The hard West Indian heiress looked harder than ever with a pen in her hand Her letter announced that she was getting on wretchedly with her studies which she hated
5077-38105-0015	train-other-500	she found the masters appointed to instruct her ugly and disagreeable and loathed the sight of them she had taken a dislike to Miss Ladd and time only confirmed that unfavorable impression
5077-38105-0016	train-other-500	Brighton was always the same the sea was always the same the drives were always the same Francine felt a presentiment that she should do something desperate unless Emily joined her and made Brighton endurable
5077-38105-0017	train-other-500	behind the horrid schoolmistress s back Solitude in London was a privilege and a pleasure viewed as the alternative to such companionship as this Emily wrote gratefully to Miss Ladd
none	none	 and asked to be excused 
5077-38105-0018	train-other-500	Other days had passed drearily since that time but the one day that had brought with it Cecilia s letter set past happiness and present sorrow together
none	none	 so vividly and so cruelly 
5077-38105-0019	train-other-500	that Emily s courage sank She had forced back the tears in her lonely home she had gone out to seek consolation and encouragement under the sunny sky
5077-38105-0020	train-other-500	to find comfort for her sore heart in the radiant summer beauty of flowers and grass in the sweet breathing of the air
none	none	 in the happy heavenward soaring of the birds 
5077-38105-0021	train-other-500	No Mother Nature is stepmother to the sick at heart Soon too soon she could hardly see where she went Again and again she resolutely cleared her eyes under the shelter of her veil
5077-38105-0022	train-other-500	when passing strangers noticed her and again and again the tears found their way back Oh if the girls at the school were to see her now the girls who used to say in their moments of sadness
5077-38105-0023	train-other-500	Let us go to Emily and be cheered would they know her again She sat down to rest and recover herself on the nearest bench It was unoccupied No passing footsteps were audible on the remote path
5077-38105-0024	train-other-500	to which she had strayed Solitude at home Solitude in the Park
none	none	 Where was Cecilia at that moment In Italy among the lake s and mountains 
5077-38105-0025	train-other-500	happy in the company of her light hearted friend The lonely interval passed and persons came near Two sisters girls like herself stopped to rest on the bench
5077-38105-0026	train-other-500	They were full of their own interests
none	none	 they hardly looked at the stranger in mourning garments The younger sister was to be married 
5077-38105-0027	train-other-500	and the elder was to be bridesmaid They talked of their dresses and their presents they compared the dashing bridegroom of one with the timid lover of the other
none	none	 they laughed over their own small sallies of wit 
5077-38105-0028	train-other-500	over their joyous dreams of the future
none	none	 over their opinions of the guests invited to the wedding 
5077-38105-0029	train-other-500	Too joyfully restless to remain inactive any longer they jumped up again from the seat One of them said Polly I m too happy and danced as she walked away The other cried Sally for shame
5077-38105-0030	train-other-500	and laughed as if she had hit on the most irresistible joke that ever was made Emily rose and went home By some mysterious influence which she was unable to trace
5077-38105-0031	train-other-500	the boisterous merriment of the two girls had roused in her a sense of revolt against the life that she was leading Change speedy change to some occupation that would force her to exert herself
5077-38105-0032	train-other-500	presented the one promise of brighter days that she could see To feel this was to be inevitably reminded of Sir Jervis Redwood Here was a man who had never seen her
5077-38105-0033	train-other-500	transformed by the incomprehensible operation of Chance into the friend of whom she stood in need the friend who pointed the way to a new world of action the busy world of readers in the library of the Museum
5077-38105-0034	train-other-500	Early in the new week Emily had accepted Sir Jervis s proposal and had so interested the bookseller to whom she had been directed to apply that he took it on himself
5077-38105-0035	train-other-500	to modify the arbitrary instructions of his employer The old gentleman has no mercy on himself and no mercy on others he explained where his literary labors are concerned
5077-38105-0036	train-other-500	You must spare yourself Miss Emily It is not only absurd it s cruel to expect you to ransack old newspapers for discoveries in Yucatan
5077-38105-0037	train-other-500	from the time when Stephens published his Travels in Central America nearly forty years since Begin with back numbers published within a few years
none	none	 say 
5077-38105-0038	train-other-500	five years from the present date and let us see what your search over that interval will bring forth Accepting this friendly advice Emily began with the newspaper volume dating from New Year s Day
5077-38105-0039	train-other-500	eighteen seventy six The first hour of her search strengthened the sincere sense of gratitude with which she remembered the bookseller s kindness To keep her attention steadily fixed
5077-38105-0040	train-other-500	on the one subject that interested her employer and to resist the temptation to read those miscellaneous items of news which especially interest women put her patience and resolution to a merciless test
5077-38105-0041	train-other-500	Happily for herself her neighbors on either side were no idlers To see them so absorbed over their work
none	none	 that they never once looked at her after the first moment when she took her place between them 
5077-38105-0042	train-other-500	was to find exactly the example of which she stood most in need As the hours wore on she pursued her weary way down one column and up another resigned at least if not quite reconciled yet
5077-38105-0043	train-other-500	to her task Her labors ended for the day with such encouragement as she might derive from the conviction of having thus far honestly pursued a useless search News was waiting for her when she reached home
5077-38105-0044	train-other-500	which raised her sinking spirits On leaving the cottage that morning she had given certain instructions relating to the modest stranger who had taken charge of her correspondence in case of his paying a second visit
5077-38105-0045	train-other-500	during her absence at the Museum The first words spoken by the servant on opening the door informed her that the unknown gentleman had called again This time he had boldly left his card
5077-38105-0046	train-other-500	There was the welcome name that she had expected to see
none	none	 Alban Morris CHAPTER XXII ALBAN MORRIS Having looked at the card Emily put her first question to the servant Did you tell mister Morris what your orders were she asked Yes miss I said I was to have shown him in if you had been at home Perhaps I did wrong I told him what you told me when you went out this morning I said you had gone to read at the Museum What makes you think you did wrong Well miss he didn t say anything but he looked upset Do you mean that he looked angry The servant shook her head Not exactly angry puzzled and put out Did he leave any message He said he would call later if you would be so good as to receive him In half an hour more Alban and Emily were together again The light fell full on her face as she rose to receive him Oh how you have suffered The words escaped him before he could restrain himself He looked at her with the tender sympathy so precious to women which she had not seen in the face of any human creature since the loss of her aunt Even the good doctor s efforts to console her had been efforts of professional routine the inevitable result of his life long familiarity with sorrow and death While Alban s eyes rested on her Emily felt her tears rising In the fear that he might misinterpret her reception of him she made an effort to speak with some appearance of composure I lead a lonely life she said and I can well understand that my face shows it You are one of my very few friends mister Morris the tears rose again it discouraged her to see him standing irresolute with his hat in his hand fearful of intruding on her Indeed indeed you are welcome she said very earnestly In those sad days her heart was easily touched She gave him her hand for the second time He held it gently for a moment Every day since they had parted she had been in his thoughts she had become dearer to him than ever He was too deeply affected to trust himself to answer That silence pleaded for him as nothing had pleaded for him yet In her secret self she remembered with wonder how she had received his confession in the school garden It was a little hard on him surely to have forbidden him even to hope Conscious of her own weakness even while giving way to it she felt the necessity of turning his attention from herself In some confusion she pointed to a chair at her side and spoke of his first visit when he had left her letters at the door Having confided to him all that she had discovered and all that she had guessed on that occasion it was by an easy transition that she alluded next to the motive for his journey to the North I thought it might be suspicion of missus Rook she said Was I mistaken No you were right They were serious suspicions I suppose Certainly I should not otherwise have devoted my holiday time to clearing them up May I know what they were I am sorry to disappoint you he began But you would rather not answer my question she interposed I would rather hear you tell me if you have made any other guess One more mister Morris I guessed that you had become acquainted with Sir Jervis Redwood For the second time Miss Emily you have arrived at a sound conclusion My one hope of finding opportunities for observing Sir Jervis s housekeeper depended on my chance of gaining admission to Sir Jervis s house How did you succeed Perhaps you provided yourself with a letter of introduction I knew nobody who could introduce me Alban replied As the event proved a letter would have been needless Sir Jervis introduced himself and more wonderful still he invited me to his house at our first interview Sir Jervis introduced himself Emily repeated in amazement From Cecilia s description of him I should have thought he was the last person in the world to do that Alban smiled And you would like to know how it happened he suggested The very favor I was going to ask of you she replied Instead of at once complying with her wishes he paused hesitated and made a strange request Will you forgive my rudeness if I ask leave to walk up and down the room while I talk I am a restless man Walking up and down helps me to express myself freely Her f ace brightened for the first time How like You that is she exclaimed Alban looked at her with surprise and delight She had betrayed an interest in studying his character which he appreciated at its full value I should never have dared to hope he said that you knew me so well already You are forgetting your story she reminded him He moved to the opposite side of the room where there were fewer impediments in the shape of furniture With his head down and his hands crossed behind him he paced to and fro Habit made him express himself in his usual quaint way but he became embarrassed as he went on Was he disturbed by his recollections or by the fear of taking Emily into his confidence too freely Different people have different ways of telling a story he said Mine is the methodical way I begin at the beginning We will start if you please in the railway we will proceed in a one horse chaise and we will stop at a village situated in a hole It was the nearest place to Sir Jervis s house and it was therefore my destination I picked out the biggest of the cottages I mean the huts and asked the woman at the door if she had a bed to let She evidently thought me either mad or drunk I wasted no time in persuasion the right person to plead my cause was asleep in her arms I began by admiring the baby and I ended by taking the baby s portrait From that moment I became a member of the family the member who had his own way Besides the room occupied by the husband and wife there was a sort of kennel in which the husband s brother slept He was dismissed with five shillings of mine to comfort him to find shelter somewhere else and I was promoted to the vacant place It is my misfortune to be tall When I went to bed I slept with my head on the pillow and my feet out of the window Very cool and pleasant in summer weather The next morning I set my trap for Sir Jervis Your trap Emily repeated wondering what he meant I went out to sketch from Nature Alban continued Can anybody with or without a title I don t care living in a lonely country house see a stranger hard at work with a color box and brushes and not stop to look at what he is doing Three days passed and nothing happened I was quite patient the grand open country all round me offered lessons of inestimable value in what we call aerial perspective On the fourth day I was absorbed over the hardest of all hard tasks in landscape art studying the clouds straight from Nature The magnificent moorland silence was suddenly profaned by a man s voice speaking or rather croaking behind me The worst curse of human life the voice said is the detestable necessity of taking exercise I hate losing my time I hate fine scenery I hate fresh air I hate a pony Go on you brute Being too deeply engaged with the clouds to look round I had supposed this pretty speech to be addressed to some second person Nothing of the sort the croaking voice had a habit of speaking to itself In a minute more there came within my range of view a solitary old man mounted on a rough pony Was it Sir Jervis Alban hesitated It looked more like the popular notion of the devil he said Oh mister Morris I give you my first impression Miss Emily for what it is worth He had his high peaked hat in his hand to keep his head cool His wiry iron gray hair looked like hair standing on end his bushy eyebrows curled upward toward his narrow temples his horrid old globular eyes stared with a wicked brightness his pointed beard hid his chin he was covered from his throat to his ankles in a loose black garment something between a coat and a cloak and to complete him he had a club foot I don t doubt that Sir Jervis Redwood is the earthly alias which he finds convenient but I stick to that first impression which appeared to surprise you Ha an artist you seem to be the sort of man I want In those terms he introduced himself Observe if you please that my trap caught him the moment he came my way Who wouldn t be an artist Did he take a liking to you Emily inquired Not he I don t believe he ever took a liking to anybody in his life Then how did you get your invitation to his house That s the amusing part of it Miss Emily Give me a little breathing time and you shall hear CHAPTER XXIII MISS REDWOOD I got invited to Sir Jervis s house Alban resumed by treating the old savage as unceremoniously as he had treated me That s an idle trade of yours he said looking at my sketch Other ignorant people have made the same remark I answered He rode away as if he was not used to be spoken to in that manner and then thought better of it and came back Do you understand wood engraving he asked Yes And etching I have practiced etching myself Are you a Royal Academician I m a drawing master at a ladies school Whose school Miss Ladd s Damn it you know the girl who ought to have been my secretary I am not quite sure whether you will take it as a compliment Sir Jervis appeared to view you in the light of a reference to my respectability At any rate he went on with his questions How long do you stop in these parts I haven t made up my mind Look here I want to consult you are you listening No I m sketching He burst into a horrid scream I asked if he felt himself taken ill Ill he said I m laughing It was a diabolical laugh in one syllable not ha ha ha only ha and it made him look wonderfully like that eminent person whom I persist in thinking he resembles You re an impudent dog he said where are you living He was so delighted when he heard of my uncomfortable position in the kennel bedroom that he offered his hospitality on the spot I can t go to you in such a pigstye as that he said you must come to me What s your name Alban Morris what s yours Jervis Redwood Pack up your traps when you ve done your job and come and try my kennel There it is in a corner of your drawing and devilish like too I packed up my traps and I tried his kennel And now you have had enough of Sir Jervis Redwood Not half enough Emily answered Your story leaves off just at the interesting moment I want you to take me to Sir Jervis s house And I want you Miss Emily to take me to the British Museum Don t let me startle you When I called here earlier in the day I was told that you had gone to the reading room Is your reading a secret His manner when he made that reply suggested to Emily that there was some foregone conclusion in his mind which he was putting to the test She answered without alluding to the impression which he had produced on her My reading is no secret I am only consulting old newspapers He repeated the last words to himself Old newspapers he said as if he was not quite sure of having rightly understood her She tried to help him by a more definite reply I am looking through old newspapers she resumed beginning with the year eighteen hundred and seventy six And going back from that time he asked eagerly to earlier dates still No just the contrary advancing from seventy six to the present time He suddenly turned pale and tried to hide his face from her by looking out of the window For a moment his agitation deprived him of his presence of mind In that moment she saw that she had alarmed him What have I said to frighten you she asked He tried to assume a tone of commonplace gallantry There are limits even to your power over me he replied Whatever else you may do you can never frighten me Are you searching those old newspapers with any particular object in view Yes May I know what it is May I know why I frightened you He began to walk up and down the room again then checked himself abruptly and appealed to her mercy Don t be hard on me he pleaded I am so fond of you oh forgive me I only mean that it distresses me to have any concealments from you If I could open my whole heart at this moment I should be a happier man She understood him and believed him My curiosity shall never embarrass you again she answered warmly I won t even remember that I wanted to hear how you got on in Sir Jervis s house His gratitude seized the opportunity of taking her harmlessly into his confidence As Sir Jervis s guest he said my experience is at your service Only tell me how I can interest you She replied with some hesitation I should like to know what happened when you first saw missus Rook To her surprise and relief he at once complied with her wishes We met he said on the evening when I first entered the house Sir Jervis took me into the dining room and there sat Miss Redwood with a large black cat on her lap Older than her brother taller than her brother leaner than her brother with strange stony eyes and a skin like parchment she looked if I may speak in contradictions like a living corpse I was presented and the corpse revived The last lingering relics of former good breeding showed themselves faintly in her brow and in her smile You will hear more of Miss Redwood presently In the meanwhile Sir Jervis made me reward his hospitality by professional advice He wished me to decide whether the artists whom he had employed to illustrate his wonderful book had cheated him by overcharges and bad work and missus Rook was sent to fetch the engravings from his study upstairs You remember her petrified appearance when she first read the inscription on your locket The same result followed when she found herself face to face with me I saluted her civilly she was deaf and blind to my politeness Her master snatched the illustrations out of her hand and told her to leave the room She stood stockstill staring helplessly Sir Jervis looked round at his sister and I followed his example Miss Redwood was observing the housekeeper too attentively to notice anything else her brother was obliged to speak to her Try Rook with the bell he said Miss Redwood took a fine old bronze hand bell from the table at her side and rang it At the shrill silvery sound of the bell missus Rook put her hand to her head as if the ringing had hurt her turned instantly and left us Nobody can manage Rook but my sister Sir Jervis explained Rook is crazy Miss Redwood differed with him No she said Only one word but there were volumes of contradiction in it Sir Jervis looked at me slyly meaning perhaps that he thought his sister crazy too The dinner was brought in at the same moment and my attention was diverted to missus Rook s husband What was he like Emily asked I really can t tell you he was one of those essentially commonplace persons whom one never looks at a second time His dress was shabby his head was bald and his hands shook when he waited on us at table and that is all I remember Sir Jervis and I feasted on salt fish mutton and beer Miss Redwood had cold broth with a wine glass full of rum poured into it by mister Rook She s got no stomach her brother informed me hot things come up again ten minutes after they have gone down her throat she lives on that beastly mixture and calls it broth grog Miss Redwood sipped her elixir of life and occasionally looked at me with an appearance of interest which I was at a loss to understand Dinner being over she rang her antique bell The shabby old man servant answered her call Where s your wife she inquired Ill miss She took mister Rook s arm to go out and stopped as she passed me Come to my room if you please sir to morrow at two o clock she said Sir Jervis explained again She s all to pieces in the morning he invariably called his sister She and gets patched up toward the middle of the day Death has forgotten her that s about the truth of it He lighted his pipe and pondered over the hieroglyphics found among the ruined cities of Yucatan I lighted my pipe and read the only book I could find in the dining room a dreadful record of shipwrecks and disasters at sea When the room was full of tobacco smoke we fell asleep in our chairs and when we awoke again we got up and went to bed There is the true story of my first evening at Redwood Hall Emily begged him to go on You have interested me in Miss Redwood she said You kept your appointment of course I kept my appointment in no very pleasant humor Encouraged by my favorable report of the illustrations which he had submitted to my judgment Sir Jervis proposed to make me useful to him in a new capacity You have nothing particular to do he said suppose you clean my pictures I gave him one of my black looks and made no other reply My interview with his sister tried my powers of self command in another way Miss Redwood declared her purpose in sending for me the moment I entered the room Without any preliminary remarks speaking slowly and emphatically in a wonderfully strong voice for a woman of her age she said I have a favor to ask of you sir I want you to tell me what missus Rook has done I was so staggered that I stared at her like a fool She went on I suspected missus Rook sir of having guilty remembrances on her conscience before she had been a week in our service Can you imagine my astonishment when I heard that Miss Redwood s view of missus Rook was my view Finding that I still said nothing the old lady entered into details We arranged sir she persisted in calling me sir with the formal politeness of the old school we arranged sir that missus Rook and her husband should occupy the bedroom next to mine so that I might have her near me in case of my being taken ill in the night She looked at the door between the two rooms suspicious She asked if there was any objection to her changing to another room suspicious suspicious Pray take a seat sir and tell me which missus Rook is guilty of theft or murder What a dreadful old woman Emily exclaimed How did you answer her I told her with perfect truth that I knew nothing of missus Rook s secrets Miss Redwood s humor took a satirical turn Allow me to ask sir whether your eyes were shut when our housekeeper found herself unexpectedly in your presence I referred the old lady to her brother s opinion Sir Jervis believes missus Rook to be crazy I reminded her Do you refuse to trust me sir I have no information to give you madam She waved her skinny old hand in the direction of the door I made my bow and retired She called me back Old women used to be prophets sir in the bygone time she said I will venture on a prediction You will be the means of depriving us of the services of mister and missus Rook If you will be so good as to stay here a day or two longer you will hear that those two people have given us notice to quit It will be her doing mind he is a mere cypher I wish you good morning Will you believe me when I tell you that the prophecy was fulfilled Do you mean that they actually left the house They would certainly have left the house Alban answered if Sir Jervis had not insisted on receiving the customary month s warning He asserted his resolution by locking up the old husband in the pantry His sister s suspicions never entered his head the housekeeper s conduct he said simply proved that she was what he had always considered her to be crazy A capital servant in spite of that drawback he remarked and you will see I shall bring her to her senses The impression produced on me was naturally of a very different kind While I was still uncertain how to entrap missus Rook into confirming my suspicions she herself had saved me the trouble She had placed her own guilty interpretation on my appearance in the house I had driven her away Emily remained true to her resolution not to let her curiosity embarrass Alban again But the unexpressed question was in her thoughts Of what guilt does he suspect missus Rook And when he first felt his suspicions was my father in his mind Alban proceeded I had only to consider next whether I could hope to make any further discoveries if I continued to be Sir Jervis s guest The object of my journey had been gained and I had no desire to be employed as picture cleaner Miss Redwood assisted me in arriving at a decision I was sent for to speak to her again The success of her prophecy had raised her spirits She asked with ironical humility if I proposed to honor them by still remaining their guest after the disturbance that I had provoked I answered that I proposed to leave by the first train the next morning Will it be convenient for you to travel to some place at a good distance from this part of the world she asked I had my own reasons for going to London and said so Will you mention that to my brother this evening just before we sit down to dinner she continued And will you tell him plainly that you have no intention of returning to the North I shall make use of missus Rook s arm as usual to help me downstairs and I will take care that she hears what you say Without venturing on another prophecy I will only hint to you that I have my own idea of what will happen and I should like you to see for yourself sir whether my anticipations are realized Need I tell you that this strange old woman proved to be right once more mister Rook was released missus Rook made humble apologies and laid the whole blame on her husband s temper and Sir Jervis bade me remark that his method had succeeded in bringing the housekeeper to her senses Such were the results produced by the announcement of my departure for London purposely made in missus Rook s hearing Do you agree with me that my journey to Northumberland has not been taken in vain Once more Emily felt the necessity of controlling herself Alban had said that he had reasons of his own for going to London Could she venture to ask him what those reasons were She could only persist in restraining her curiosity and conclude that he would have mentioned his motive if it had been as she had at one time supposed connected with herself It was a wise decision No earthly consideration would have induced Alban to answer her if she had put the question to him All doubt of the correctness of his own first impression was now at an end he was convinced that missus Rook had been an accomplice in the crime committed in eighteen seventy seven at the village inn His object in traveling to London was to consult the newspaper narrative of the murder He too had been one of the readers at the Museum had examined the back numbers of the newspaper and had arrived at the conclusion that Emily s father had been the victim of the crime Unless he found means to prevent it her course of reading would take her from the year eighteen seventy six to the year eighteen seventy seven and under that date she would see the fatal report heading the top of a column and printed in conspicuous type In the meanwhile Emily had broken the silence before it could lead to embarrassing results by asking if Alban had seen missus Rook again on the morning when he left Sir Jervis s house There was nothing to be gained by seeing her Alban replied Now that she and her husband had decided to remain at Redwood Hall I knew where to find her in case of necessity As it happened I saw nobody on the morning of my departure but Sir Jervis himself He still held to his idea of having his pictures cleaned for nothing If you can t do it yourself he said couldn t you teach my secretary He described the lady whom he had engaged in your place as a nasty middle aged woman with a perpetual cold in her head At the same time he remarked he was a friend to the women because he got them cheap I declined to teach the unfortunate secretary the art of picture cleaning Finding me determined Sir Jervis was quite ready to say good by But he made use of me to the last He employed me as postman and saved a stamp The letter addressed to you arrived at breakfast time Sir Jervis said You are going to London suppose you take it with you Did he tell you that there was a letter of his own inclosed in the envelope No When he gave me the envelope it was already sealed Emily at once handed to him Sir Jervis s letter That will tell you who employs me at the Museum and what my work is she said He looked through the letter and at once offered eagerly offered to help her I have been a student in the reading room at intervals for years past he said Let me assist you and I shall have something to do in my holiday time He was so anxious to be of use that he interrupted her before she could thank him Let us take alternate years he suggested Did you not tell me you were searching the newspapers published in eighteen hundred and seventy six Yes Very well I will take the next year You will take the year after And so on You are very kind she answered but I should like to propose an improvement on your plan What improvement he asked rather sharply If you will leave the five years from seventy six to eighty one entirely to me she resumed and take the next five years reckoning backward from seventy six you will help me to better purpose Sir Jervis expects me to look for reports of Central American Explorations through the newspapers of the last forty years and I have taken the liberty of limiting the heavy task imposed on me When I report my progress to my employer I should like to say that I have got through ten years of the examination instead of five Do you see any objection to the arrangement I propose He proved to be obstinate incomprehensibly obstinate Let us try my plan to begin with he insisted While you are looking through seventy six let me be at work on seventy seven If you still prefer your own arrangement after that I will follow your suggestion with pleasure Is it agreed Her acute perception enlightened by his tone as wall as by his words detected something under the surface already It isn t agreed until I understand you a little better she quietly replied I fancy you have some object of your own in view She spoke with her usual directness of look and manner He was evidently disconcerted What makes you think so he asked My own experience of myself makes me think so she answered If I had some object to gain I should persist in carrying it out like you Does that mean Miss Emily that you refuse to give way No mister Morris I have made myself disagreeable but I know when to stop I trust you and submit If he had been less deeply interested in the accomplishment of his merciful design he might have viewed Emily s sudden submission with some distrust As it was his eagerness to prevent her from discovering the narrative of the murder hurried him into an act of indiscretion He made an excuse to leave her immediately in the fear that she might change her mind I have inexcusably prolonged my visit he said If I presume on your kindness in this way how can I hope that you will receive me again We meet to morrow in the reading room He hastened away as if he was afraid to let her say a word in reply Emily reflected Is there something he doesn t want me to see in the news of the year seventy seven The one explanation which suggested itself to her mind assumed that form of expression and the one method of satisfying her curiosity that seemed likely to succeed was to search the volume which Alban had reserved for his own reading For two days they pursued their task together seated at opposite desks On the third day Emily was absent Was she ill She was at the library in the City consulting the file of The Times for the year eighteen seventy seven CHAPTER XXIV mister ROOK 
5077-38108-0000	train-other-500	Emily s first day in the City library proved to be a day wasted She began reading the back numbers of the newspaper at haphazard without any definite idea of what she was looking for
5077-38108-0001	train-other-500	Conscious of the error into which her own impatience had led her she was at a loss how to retrace the false step that she had taken But two alternatives presented themselves either to abandon the hope of making any discovery
5077-38108-0002	train-other-500	or to attempt to penetrate Alban s motives by means of pure guesswork pursued in the dark How was the problem to be solved This serious question troubled her all through the evening and kept her awake when she went to bed
5077-38108-0003	train-other-500	In despair of her capacity to remove the obstacle that stood in her way she decided on resuming her regular work at the Museum turned her pillow to get at the cool side of it and made up her mind to go asleep
5077-38108-0004	train-other-500	In the case of the wiser animals the Person submits to Sleep It is only the superior human being who tries the hopeless experiment of making Sleep submit to the Person Wakeful on the warm side of the pillow
5077-38108-0005	train-other-500	Emily remained wakeful on the cool side thinking again and again of the interview with Alban which had ended so strangely Little by little her mind passed the limits which had restrained it thus far
5077-38108-0006	train-other-500	Alban s conduct in keeping his secret in the matter of the newspapers now began to associate itself with Alban s conduct in keeping that other secret which concealed from her his suspicions of missus Rook
none	none	 She started up in bed as the next possibility occurred to her 
5077-38108-0007	train-other-500	In speaking of the disaster which had compelled mister and missus Rook to close the inn Cecilia had alluded to an inquest held on the body of the murdered man Had the inquest been mentioned in the newspapers at the time
5077-38108-0008	train-other-500	And had Alban seen something in the report which concerned missus Rook Led by the new light that had fallen on her Emily returned to the library the next morning with a definite idea of what she had to look for
5077-38108-0009	train-other-500	Incapable of giving exact dates Cecilia had informed her that the crime was committed in the autumn The month to choose in beginning her examination was therefore the month of August No discovery rewarded her
5077-38108-0010	train-other-500	She tried September next with the same unsatisfactory results On Monday the first of October she met with some encouragement at last At the top of a column appeared a telegraphic summary of all that was then known of the crime
5077-38108-0011	train-other-500	In the number for the Wednesday following she found a full report of the proceedings at the inquest Passing over the preliminary remarks Emily read the evidence with the closest attention The jury having viewed the body
5077-38108-0012	train-other-500	and having visited an outhouse in which the murder had been committed the first witness called was mister Benjamin Rook landlord of the Hand in Hand inn On the evening of Sunday September thirtieth eighteen seventy seven
5077-38108-0013	train-other-500	two gentlemen presented themselves at mister Rook s house under circumstances which especially excited his attention The youngest of the two was short and of fair complexion He carried a knapsack
5077-38108-0014	train-other-500	like a gentleman on a pedestrian excursion his manners were pleasant and he was decidedly good looking His companion older taller and darker and a finer man altogether leaned on his arm
5077-38108-0015	train-other-500	and seemed to be exhausted In every respect they were singularly unlike each other The younger stranger excepting little half whiskers was clean shaved The elder wore his whole beard
5077-38108-0016	train-other-500	Not knowing their names the landlord distinguished them at the coroner s suggestion as the fair gentleman and the dark gentleman It was raining when the two arrived at the inn There were signs in the heavens of a stormy night
5077-38108-0017	train-other-500	On accosting the landlord the fair gentleman volunteered the following statement Approaching the village he had been startled by seeing the dark gentleman a total stranger to him stretched prostrate on the grass at the roadside
5077-38108-0018	train-other-500	so far as he could judge in a swoon Having a flask with brandy in it he revived the fainting man and led him to the inn This statement was confirmed by a laborer who was on his way to the village at the time
5077-38108-0019	train-other-500	The dark gentleman endeavored to explain what had happened to him He had as he supposed allowed too long a time to pass after an early breakfast that morning without taking food
5077-38108-0020	train-other-500	he could only attribute the fainting fit to that cause He was not liable to fainting fits What purpose if any had brought him into the neighborhood of Zeeland he did not state He had no intention of remaining at the inn
5077-38108-0021	train-other-500	except for refreshment and he asked for a carriage to take him to the railway station The fair gentleman seeing the signs of bad weather desired to remain in mister Rook s house for the night
5077-38108-0022	train-other-500	and proposed to resume his walking tour the next day Excepting the case of supper which could be easily provided the landlord had no choice but to disappoint both his guests In his small way of business
none	none	 none of his customers wanted to hire a carriage even if he could have afforded to keep one 
5077-38108-0023	train-other-500	As for beds the few rooms which the inn contained were all engaged including even the room occupied by himself and his wife An exhibition of agricultural implements had been opened in the neighborhood
5077-38108-0024	train-other-500	only two days since and a public competition between rival machines was to be decided on the coming Monday Not only was the Hand in Hand inn crowded but even the accommodation offered
5077-38108-0025	train-other-500	by the nearest town had proved barely sufficient to meet the public demand The gentlemen looked at each other and agreed that there was no help for it but to hurry the supper and walk to the railway station
5077-38108-0026	train-other-500	a distance of between five and six miles in time to catch the last train While the meal was being prepared the rain held off for a while The dark man asked his way to the post office
5077-38108-0027	train-other-500	and went out by himself He came back in about ten minutes and sat down afterward to supper with his companion Neither the landlord nor any other person in the public room noticed any change in him on his return
5077-38108-0028	train-other-500	He was a grave quiet sort of person and unlike the other one not much of a talker As the darkness came on the rain fell again heavily and the heavens were black A flash of lightning startled the gentlemen
5077-38108-0029	train-other-500	when they went to the window to look out the thunderstorm began It was simply impossible that two strangers to the neighborhood could find their way to the station through storm and darkness in time to catch the train With or without bedrooms
5077-38108-0030	train-other-500	they must remain at the inn for the night Having already given up their own room to their lodgers the landlord and landlady had no other place to sleep in than the kitchen Next to the kitchen and communicating with it by a door was an outhouse
5077-38108-0031	train-other-500	used partly as a scullery partly as a lumber room There was an old truckle bed among the lumber on which one of the gentlemen might rest A mattress on the floor could be provided for the other
5077-38108-0032	train-other-500	After adding a table and a basin for the purposes of the toilet the accommodation which mister Rook was able to offer came to an end The travelers agreed to occupy this makeshift bed chamber The thunderstorm passed away
5077-38108-0033	train-other-500	but the rain continued to fall heavily Soon after eleven the guests at the inn retired for the night There was some little discussion between the two travelers as to which of them should take possession of the truckle bed It was put an end to
5077-38108-0034	train-other-500	by the fair gentleman in his own pleasant way He proposed to toss up for it and he lost The dark gentleman went to bed first the fair gentleman followed after waiting a while
5077-38108-0035	train-other-500	mister Rook took his knapsack into the outhouse and arranged on the table his appliances for the toilet contained in a leather roll and including a razor
none	none	 ready for use in the morning Having previously barred the second door of the outhouse which led into the yard 
5077-38108-0036	train-other-500	mister Rook fastened the other door the lock and bolts of which were on the side of the kitchen He then secured the house door and the shutters over the lower windows
5077-38108-0037	train-other-500	Returning to the kitchen he noticed that the time was ten minutes short of midnight Soon afterward he and his wife went to bed Nothing happened to disturb mister and missus Rook during the night
5077-38108-0038	train-other-500	At a quarter to seven the next morning he got up his wife being still asleep
none	none	 He had been instructed to wake the gentlemen early and he knocked at their door 
5077-38108-0039	train-other-500	Receiving no answer after repeatedly knocking he opened the door and stepped into the outhouse At this point in his evidence the witness s recollections appeared to overpower him
5077-38108-0040	train-other-500	Give me a moment gentlemen he said to the jury I have had a dreadful fright and I don t believe I shall get over it for the rest of my life The coroner helped him by a question
5077-38108-0041	train-other-500	What did you see when you opened the door mister Rook answered I saw the dark man stretched out on his bed dead with a frightful wound in his throat I saw an open razor
5077-38108-0042	train-other-500	stained with smears of blood at his side Did you notice the door leading into the yard It was wide open sir When I was able to look round me the other traveler
none	none	 I mean the man with the fair complexion who carried the knapsack was nowhere to be seen 
5077-38108-0043	train-other-500	What did you do after making these discoveries I closed the yard door Then I locked the other door
none	none	 and put the key in my pocket 
5077-38108-0044	train-other-500	After that I roused the servant and sent him to the constable who lived near to us while I ran for the doctor whose house was at the other end of our village The doctor sent his groom on horseback to the police office in the town
5077-38108-0045	train-other-500	When I returned to the inn the constable was there and he and the police took the matter into their own hands You have nothing more to tell us
none	none	 Nothing more CHAPTER XXV J B mister Rook having completed his evidence the police authorities were the next witnesses examined They had not found the slightest trace of any attempt to break into the house in the night The murdered man s gold watch and chain were discovered under his pillow On examining his clothes the money was found in his purse and the gold studs and sleeve buttons were left in his shirt But his pocketbook seen by witnesses who had not yet been examined was missing The search for visiting cards and letters had proved to be fruitless Only the initials J B were marked on his linen He had brought no luggage with him to the inn Nothing could be found which led to the discovery of his name or of the purpose which had taken him into that part of the country The police examined the outhouse next in search of circumstantial evidence against the missing man He must have carried away his knapsack when he took to flight but he had been probably in too great a hurry to look for his razor or perhaps too terrified to touch it if it had attracted his notice The leather roll and the other articles used for his toilet had been taken away mister Rook identified the blood stained razor He had noticed overnight the name of the Belgian city Liege engraved on it The yard was the next place inspected Foot steps were found on the muddy earth up to the wall But the road on the other side had been recently mended with stones and the trace of the fugitive was lost Casts had been taken of the footsteps and no other means of discovery had been left untried The authorities in London had also been communicated with by telegraph The doctor being called described a personal peculiarity which he had noticed at the post mortem examination and which might lead to the identification of the murdered man As to the cause of death the witness said it could be stated in two words The internal jugular vein had been cut through with such violence judging by the appearances that the wound could not have been inflicted in the act of suicide by the hand of the deceased person No other injuries and no sign of disease was found on the body The one cause of death had been Hemorrhage and the one peculiarity which called for notice had been discovered in the mouth Two of the front teeth in the upper jaw were false They had been so admirably made to resemble the natural teeth on either side of them in form and color that the witness had only hit on the discovery by accidentally touching the inner side of the gum with one of his fingers The landlady was examined when the doctor had retired missus Rook was able in answering questions put to her to give important information in reference to the missing pocketbook Before retiring to rest the two gentlemen had paid the bill intending to leave the inn the first thing in the morning The traveler with the knapsack paid his share in money The other unfortunate gentleman looked into his purse and found only a shilling and a sixpence in it He asked missus Rook if she could change a bank note She told him it could be done provided the note was for no considerable sum of money Upon that he opened his pocketbook which the witness described minutely and turned out the contents on the table After searching among many Bank of England notes some in one pocket of the book and some in another he found a note of the value of five pounds He thereupon settled his bill and received the change from missus Rook her husband being in another part of the room attending to the guests She noticed a letter in an envelope and a few cards which looked to her judgment like visiting cards among the bank notes which he had turned out on the table When she returned to him with the change he had just put them back and was closing the pocketbook She saw him place it in one of the breast pockets of his coat The fellow traveler who had accompanied him to the inn was present all the time sitting on the opposite side of the table He made a remark when he saw the notes produced He said Put all that money back don t tempt a poor man like me It was said laughing as if by way of a joke missus Rook had observed nothing more that night had slept as soundly as usual and had been awakened when her husband knocked at the outhouse door according to instructions received from the gentlemen overnight Three of the guests in the public room corroborated missus Rook s evidence They were respectable persons well and widely known in that part of Hampshire Besides these there were two strangers staying in the house They referred the coroner to their employers eminent manufacturers at Sheffield and Wolverhampton whose testimony spoke for itself The last witness called was a grocer in the village who kept the post office On the evening of the thirtieth a dark gentleman wearing his beard knocked at the door and asked for a letter addressed to J B Post office Zeeland The letter had arrived by that morning s post but being Sunday evening the grocer requested that application might be made for it the next morning The stranger said the letter contained news which it was of importance to him to receive without delay Upon this the grocer made an exception to customary rules and gave him the letter He read it by the light of the lamp in the passage It must have been short for the reading was done in a moment He seemed to think over it for a while and then he turned round to go out There was nothing to notice in his look or in his manner The witness offered a remark on the weather and the gentleman said Yes it looks like a bad night and so went away The postmaster s evidence was of importance in one respect it suggested the motive which had brought the deceased to Zeeland The letter addressed to J B was in all probability the letter seen by missus Rook among the contents of the pocketbook spread out on the table The inquiry being so far at an end the inquest was adjourned on the chance of obtaining additional evidence when the reported proceedings were read by the public Consulting a later number of the newspaper Emily discovered that the deceased person had been identified by a witness from London Henry Forth gentleman s valet being examined made the following statement He had read the medical evidence contained in the report of the inquest and believing that he could identify the deceased had been sent by his present master to assist the object of the inquiry Ten days since being then out of place he had answered an advertisement The next day he was instructed to call at Tracey s Hotel London at six o clock in the evening and to ask for mister James Brown Arriving at the hotel he saw the gentleman for a few minutes only mister Brown had a friend with him After glancing over the valet s references he said I haven t time enough to speak to you this evening Call here to morrow morning at nine o clock The gentleman who was present laughed and said You won t be up mister Brown answered That won t matter the man can come to my bedroom and let me see how he understands his duties on trial At nine the next morning mister Brown was reported to be still in bed and the witness was informed of the number of the room He knocked at the door A drowsy voice inside said something which he interpreted as meaning Come in He went in The toilet table was on his left hand and the bed with the lower curtain drawn was on his right He saw on the table a tumbler with a little water in it and with two false teeth in the water mister Brown started up in bed looked at him furiously abused him for daring to enter the room and shouted to him to get out The witness not accustomed to be treated in that way felt naturally indignant and at once withdrew but not before he had plainly seen the vacant place which the false teeth had been made to fill Perhaps mister Brown had forgotten that he had left his teeth on the table Or perhaps he the valet had misunderstood what had been said to him when he knocked at the door Either way it seemed to be plain enough that the gentleman resented the discovery of his false teeth by a stranger Having concluded his statement the witness proceeded to identify the remains of the deceased He at once recognized the gentleman named James Brown whom he had twice seen once in the evening and again the next morning at Tracey s Hotel In answer to further inquiries he declared that he knew nothing of the family or of the place of residence of the deceased He complained to the proprietor of the hotel of the rude treatment that he had received and asked if mister Tracey knew anything of mister James Brown mister Tracey knew nothing of him On consulting the hotel book it was found that he had given notice to leave that afternoon Before returning to London the witness produced references which gave him an excellent character He also left the address of the master who had engaged him three days since The last precaution adopted was to have the face of the corpse photographed before the coffin was closed On the same day the jury agreed on their verdict Willful murder against some person unknown Two days later Emily found a last allusion to the crime extracted from the columns of the South Hampshire Gazette A relative of the deceased seeing the report of the adjourned inquest had appeared accompanied by a medical gentleman had seen the photograph and had declared the identification by Henry Forth to be correct Among other particulars now communicated for the first time it was stated that the late mister James Brown had been unreasonably sensitive on the subject of his false teeth and that the one member of his family who knew of his wearing them was the relative who now claimed his remains The claim having been established to the satisfaction of the authorities the corpse was removed by railroad the same day No further light had been thrown on the murder The Handbill offering the reward and describing the suspected man had failed to prove of any assistance to the investigations of the police From that date no further notice of the crime committed at the Hand in Hand inn appeared in the public journals Emily closed the volume which she had been consulting and thankfully acknowledged the services of the librarian The new reader had excited this gentleman s interest Noticing how carefully she examined the numbers of the old newspaper he looked at her from time to time wondering whether it was good news or bad of which she was in search She read steadily and continuously but she never rewarded his curiosity by any outward sign of the impression that had been produced on her When she left the room there was nothing to remark in her manner she looked quietly thoughtful and that was all The librarian smiled amused by his own folly Because a stranger s appearance had attracted him he had taken it for granted that circumstances of romantic interest must be connected with her visit to the library Far from misleading him as he supposed his fancy might have been employed to better purpose if it had taken a higher flight still and had associated Emily with the fateful gloom of tragedy in place of the brighter interest of romance There among the ordinary readers of the day was a dutiful and affectionate daughter following the dreadful story of the death of her father by murder and believing it to be the story of a stranger because she loved and trusted the person whose short sighted mercy had deceived her That very discovery the dread of which had shaken the good doctor s firm nerves had forced Alban to exclude from his confidence the woman whom he loved and had driven the faithful old servant from the bedside of her dying mistress that very discovery Emily had now made with a face which never changed color and a heart which beat at ease Was the deception that had won this cruel victory over truth destined still to triumph in the days which were to come Yes if the life of earth is a foretaste of the life of hell No if a lie is a lie be the merciful motive for the falsehood what it may No if all deceit contains in it the seed of retribution to be ripened inexorably in the lapse of time CHAPTER XXVI MOTHER EVE The servant received Emily on her return from the library with a sly smile Here he is again miss waiting to see you She opened the parlor door and revealed Alban Morris as restless as ever walking up and down the room When I missed you at the Museum I was afraid you might be ill he said Ought I to have gone away when my anxiety was relieved Shall I go away now You must take a chair mister Morris and hear what I have to say for myself When you left me after your last visit I suppose I felt the force of example At any rate I like you had my suspicions I have been trying to confirm them and I have failed He paused with the chair in his hand Suspicions of Me he asked Certainly Can you guess how I have been employed for the last two days No not even your ingenuity can do that I have been hard at work in another reading room consulting the same back numbers of the same newspaper which you have been examining at the British Museum There is my confession and now we will have some tea She moved to the fireplace to ring the bell and failed to see the effect produced on Alban by those lightly uttered words The common phrase is the only phrase that can describe it He was thunderstruck Yes she resumed I have read the report of the inquest If I know nothing else I know that the murder at Zeeland can t be the discovery which you are bent on keeping from me Don t be alarmed for the preservation of your secret I am too much discouraged to try again The servant interrupted them by answering the bell Alban once more escaped detection Emily gave her orders with an approach to the old gayety of her school days Tea as soon as possible and let us have the new cake Are you too much of a man mister Morris to like cake In this state of agitation he was unreasonably irritated by that playful question There is one thing I like better than cake he said and that one thing is a plain explanation His tone puzzled her Have I said anything to offend you she asked Surely you can make allowance for a girl s curiosity Oh you shall have your explanation and what is more you shall have it without reserve She was as good as her word What she had thought and what she had planned when he left her after his last visit was frankly and fully told If you wonder how I discovered the library she went on I must refer you to my aunt s lawyer He lives in the City and I wrote to him to help me I don t consider that my time has been wasted mister M orris we owe an apology to missus Rook Alban s astonishment when he heard this forced its way to expression in words What can you possibly mean he asked The tea was brought in before Emily could reply She filled the cups and sighed as she looked at the cake If Cecilia was here how she would enjoy it With that complimentary tribute to her friend she handed a slice to Alban He never even noticed it We have both of us behaved most unkindly to missus Rook she resumed I can excuse your not seeing it for I should not have seen it either but for the newspaper While I was reading I had an opportunity of thinking over what we said and did when the poor woman s behavior so needlessly offended us I was too excited to think at the time and besides I had been upset only the night before by what Miss Jethro said to me Alban started What has Miss Jethro to do with it he asked Nothing at all Emily answered She spoke to me of her own private affairs A long story and you wouldn t be interested in it Let me finish what I had to say missus Rook was naturally reminded of the murder when she heard that my name was Brown and she must certainly have been struck as I was by the coincidence of my father s death taking place at the same time when his unfortunate namesake was killed Doesn t this sufficiently account for her agitation when she looked at the locket We first took her by surprise and then we suspected her of Heaven knows what because the poor creature didn t happen to have her wits about her and to remember at the right moment what a very common name James Brown is Don t you see it as I do I see that you have arrived at a remarkable change of opinion since we spoke of the subject in the garden at school In my place you would have changed your opinion too I shall write to missus Rook by tomorrow s post Alban heard her with dismay Pray be guided by my advice he said earnestly Pray don t write that letter Why not It was too late to recall the words which he had rashly allowed to escape him How could he reply To own that he had not only read what Emily had read but had carefully copied the whole narrative and considered it at his leisure appeared to be simply impossible after what he had now heard Her peace of mind depended absolutely on his discretion In this serious emergency silence was a mercy and silence was a lie If he remained silent might the mercy be trusted to atone for the lie He was too fond of Emily to decide that question fairly on its own merits In other words he shrank from the terrible responsibility of telling her the truth Isn t the imprudence of writing to such a person as missus Rook plain enough to speak for itself he suggested cautiously Not to me She made that reply rather obstinately Alban seemed in her view to be trying to prevent her from atoning for an act of injustice Besides he despised her cake I want to know why you object she said taking back the neglected slice and eating it herself I object Alban answered because missus Rook is a coarse presuming woman She may pervert your letter to some use of her own which you may have reason to regret Is that all Isn t it enough It may be enough for you When I have done a person an injury and wish to make an apology I don t think it necessary to inquire whether the person s manners happen to be vulgar or not Alban s patience was still equal to any demands that she could make on it I can only offer you advice which is honestly intended for your own good he gently replied You would have more influence over me mister Morris if you were a little readier to take me into your confidence I daresay I am wrong but I don t like following advice which is given to me in the dark It was impossible to offend him Very naturally he said I don t blame you Her color deepened and her voice rose Alban s patient adherence to his own view so courteously and considerately urged was beginning to try her temper In plain words she rejoined I am to believe that you can t be mistaken in your judgment of another person There was a ring at the door of the cottage while she was speaking But she was too warmly interested in confuting Alban to notice it He was quite willing to be confuted Even when she lost her temper she was still interesting to him I don t expect you to think me infallible he said Perhaps you will remember that I have had some experience I am unfortunately older than you are Oh if wisdom comes with age she smartly reminded him your friend Miss Redwood is old enough to be your mother and she suspected missus Rook of murder because the poor woman looked at a door and disliked being in the next room to a fidgety old maid Alban s manner changed he shrank from that chance allusion to doubts and fears which he dare not acknowledge Let us talk of something else he said She looked at him with a saucy smile Have I driven you into a corner at last And is that your way of getting out of it Even his endurance failed Are you trying to provoke me he asked Are you no better than other women I wouldn t have believed it of you Emily Emily She repeated the name in a tone of surprise which reminded him that he had addressed her with familiarity at a most inappropriate time the time when they were on the point of a quarrel He felt the implied reproach too keenly to be able to answer her with composure I think of Emily I love Emily my one hope is that Emily may love me Oh my dear is there no excuse if I forget to call you Miss when you distress me All that was tender and true in her nature secretly took his part She would have followed that better impulse if he had only been calm enough to understand her momentary silence and to give her time But the temper of a gentle and generous man once roused is slow to subside Alban abruptly left his chair I had better go he said As you please she answered Whether you go mister Morris or whether you stay I shall write to missus Rook The ring at the bell was followed by the appearance of a visitor Doctor Allday opened the door just in time to hear Emily s last words Her vehemence seemed to amuse him Who is missus Rook he asked A most respectable person Emily answered indignantly housekeeper to Sir Jervis Redwood You needn t sneer at her Doctor Allday She has not always been in service she was landlady of the inn at Zeeland The doctor about to put his hat on a chair paused The inn at Zeeland reminded him of the Handbill and of the visit of Miss Jethro Why are you so hot over it he inquired Because I detest prejudice With this assertion of liberal feeling she pointed to Alban standing quietly apart at the further end of the room There is the most prejudiced man living he hates missus Rook Would you like to be introduced to him You re a philosopher you may do him some good Doctor Allday mister Alban Morris The doctor recognized the man with the felt hat and the objectionable beard whose personal appearance had not impressed him favorably Although they may hesitate to acknowledge it there are respectable Englishmen still left who regard a felt hat and a beard as symbols of republican disaffection to the altar and the throne Doctor Allday s manner might have expressed this curious form of patriotic feeling but for the associations which Emily had revived In his present frame of mind he was outwardly courteous because he was inwardly suspicious missus Rook had been described to him as formerly landlady of the inn at Zeeland Were there reasons for mister Morris s hostile feeling toward this woman which might be referable to the crime committed in her house that might threaten Emily s tranquillity if they were made known It would not be amiss to see a little more of mister Morris on the first convenient occasion I am glad to make your acquaintance sir You are very kind Doctor Allday The exchange of polite conventionalities having been accomplished Alban approached Emily to take his leave with mingled feelings of regret and anxiety regret for having allowed himself to speak harshly anxiety to part with her in kindness Will you forgive me for differing from you It was all he could venture to say in the presence of a stranger Oh yes she said quietly Will you think again before you decide Certainly mister Morris But it won t alter my opinion if I do The doctor hearing what passed between them frowned On what subject had they been differing And what opinion did Emily decline to alter Alban gave it up He took her hand gently Shall I see you at the Museum to morrow he asked She was politely indifferent to the last Yes unless something happens to keep me at home The doctor s eyebrows still expressed disapproval For what object was the meeting proposed And why at a museum Good afternoon Doctor Allday Good afternoon sir For a moment after Alban s departure the doctor stood irresolute Arriving suddenly at a decision he snatched up his hat and turned to Emily in a hurry I bring you news my dear which will surprise you Who do you think has just left my house missus Ellmother Don t interrupt me She has made up her mind to go out to service again Tired of leading an idle life that s her own account of it and asks me to act as her reference Did you consent Consent If I act as her reference I shall be asked how she came to leave her last place A nice dilemma Either I must own that she deserted her mistress on her deathbed or tell a lie When I put it to her in that way she walked out of the house in dead silence If she applies to you next receive her as I did or decline to see her which would be better still Why am I to decline to see her In consequence of her behavior to your aunt to be sure No I have said all I wanted to say and I have no time to spare for answering idle questions Good by Socially speaking doctors try the patience of their nearest and dearest friends in this respect they are almost always in a hurry Doctor Allday s precipitate departure did not tend to soothe Emily s irritated nerves She began to find excuses for missus Ellmother in a spirit of pure contradiction The old servant s behavior might admit of justification a friendly welcome might persuade her to explain herself If she applies to me Emily determined I shall certainly receive her Having arrived at this resolution her mind reverted to Alban Some of the sharp things she had said to him subjected to after reflection in solitude failed to justify themselves Her better sense began to reproach her She tried to silence that unwelcome monitor by laying the blame on Alban Why had he been so patient and so good What harm was there in his calling her Emily If he had told her to call him by his Christian name she might have done it How noble he looked when he got up to go away he was actually handsome Women may say what they please and write what they please their natural instinct is to find their master in a man especially when they like him Sinking lower and lower in her own estimation Emily tried to turn the current of her thoughts in another direction She took up a book opened it looked into it threw it across the room If Alban had returned at that moment resolved on a reconciliation if he had said My dear I want to see you like yourself again will you give me a kiss and make it up would he have left her crying when he went away She was crying now CHAPTER XXVII MENTOR AND TELEMACHUS If Emily s eyes could have followed Alban as her thoughts were following him she would have seen him stop before he reached the end of the road in which the cottage stood His heart was full of tenderness and sorrow the longing to return to her was more than he could resist It would be easy to wait within view of the gate until the doctor s visit came to an end He had just decided to go back and keep watch when he heard rapid footsteps approaching There devil take him was the doctor himself I have something to say to you mister Morris Which way are you walking Any way Alban answered not very graciously Then let us take the turning that leads to my house It s not customary for strangers especially when they happen to be Englishmen to place confidence in each other Let me set the example of violating that rule I want to speak to you about Miss Emily May I take your arm Thank you At my age girls in general unless they are my patients are not objects of interest to me But that girl at the cottage I daresay I am in my dotage I tell you sir she has bewitched me Upon my soul I could hardly be more anxious about her if I was her father And mind I am not an affectionate man by nature Are you anxious about her too Yes In what way In what way are you anxious Doctor Allday The doctor smiled grimly You don t trust me Well I have promised to set the example Keep your mask on sir mine is off come what may of it But observe if you repeat what I am going to say Alban would hear no more Whatever you may say Doctor Allday is trusted to my honor If you doubt my honor be so good as to let go my arm I am not walking your way The doctor s hand tightened its grasp That little flourish of temper my dear sir is all I want to set me at my ease I feel I have got hold of the right man Now answer me this Have you ever heard of a person named Miss Jethro Alban suddenly came to a standstill All right said the doctor I couldn t have wished for a more satisfactory reply Wait a minute Alban interposed I know Miss Jethro as a teacher at Miss Ladd s school who left her situation suddenly and I know no more The doctor s peculiar smile made its appearance again Speaking in the vulgar tone he said you seem to be in a hurry to wash your hands of Miss Jethro I have no reason to feel any interest in her Alban replied Don t be too sure of that my friend I have something to tell you which may alter your opinion That ex teacher at the school sir knows how the late mister Brown met his death and how his daughter has been deceived about it Alban listened with surprise and with some little doubt which he thought it wise not to acknowledge The report of the inquest alludes to a relative who claimed the body he said Was that relative the person who deceived Miss Emily And was the person her aunt I must leave you to take your own view Doctor Allday replied A promise binds me not to repeat the information that I have received Setting that aside we have the same object in view and we must take care not to get in each other s way Here is my house Let us go in and make a clean breast of it on both sides Established in the safe seclusion of his study the doctor set the example of confession in these plain terms We only differ in opinion on one point he said We both think it likely from our experience of the women that the suspected murderer had an accomplice I say the guilty person is Miss Jethro You say missus Rook When you have read my copy of the report Alban answered I think you will arrive at my conclusion missus Rook might have entered the outhouse in which the two men slept at any time during the night while her husband was asleep The jury believed her when she declared that she never woke till the morning I don t I am open to conviction mister Morris Now about the future Do you mean to go on with your inquiries Even if I had no other motive than mere curiosity Alban answered I think I should go on But I have a more urgent purpose in view All that I have done thus far has been done in Emily s interests My object from the first has been to preserve her from any association in the past or in the future with the woman whom I believe to have been concerned in her father s death As I have already told you she is innocently doing all she can poor thing to put obstacles in my way Yes yes said the doctor she means to write to missus Rook and you have nearly quarreled about it Trust me to take that matter in hand I don t regard it as serious But I am mortally afraid of what you are doing in Emily s interests I wish you would give it up Why Because I see a danger I don t deny that Emily is as innocent of suspicion as ever But the chances next time may be against us How do you know to what lengths your curiosity may lead you Or on what shocking discoveries you may not blunder with the best intentions Some unforeseen accident may open her eyes to the truth before you can prevent it I seem to surprise you You do indeed surprise me In the old story my dear sir Mentor sometimes surprised Telemachus I am Mentor without being I hope quite so long winded as that respectable philosopher Let me put it in two words Emily s happiness is precious to you Take care you are not made the means of wrecking it Will you consent to a sacrifice for her sake I will do anything for her sake Will you give up your inquiries From this moment I have done with them mister Morris you are the best friend she has The next best friend to you doctor In that fond persuasion they now parted too eagerly devoted to Emily to look at the prospect before them in its least hopeful aspect Both clever men neither one nor the other asked himself if any human resistance has ever yet obstructed the progress of truth when truth has once begun to force its way to the light For the second time Alban stopped on his way home The longing to be reconciled with Emily was not to be resisted He returned to the cottage only to find disappointment waiting for him The servant reported that her young mistress had gone to bed with a bad headache Alban waited a day in the hope that Emily might write to him No letter arrived He repeated his visit the next morning Fortune was still against him On this occasion Emily was engaged Engaged with a visitor he asked Yes sir A young lady named Miss de Sor Where had he heard that name before He remembered immediately that he had heard it at the school Miss de Sor was the unattractive new pupil whom the girls called Francine Alban looked at the parlor window as he left the cottage It was of serious importance that he should set himself right with Emily And mere gossip he thought contemptuously stands in my way If he had been less absorbed in his own interests he might have remembered that mere gossip is not always to be despised It has worked fatal mischief in its time CHAPTER XXVIII FRANCINE You re surprised to see me of course Saluting Emily in those terms Francine looked round the parlor with an air of satirical curiosity Dear me what a little place to live in What brings you to London Emily inquired You ought to know my dear without asking Why did I try to make friends with you at school And why have I been trying ever since Because I hate you I mean because I can t resist you no I mean because I hate myself for liking you Oh never mind my reasons I insisted on going to London with Miss Ladd when that horrid woman announced that she had an appointment with her lawyer I said I want to see Emily Emily doesn t like you I don t care whether she likes me or not I want to see her That s the way we snap at each other and that s how I always carry my point Here I am till my duenna finishes her business and fetches me What a prospect for You Have you got any cold meat in the house I m not a glutton like Cecilia but I m afraid I shall want some lunch Don t talk in that way Francine Do you mean to say you re glad to see me If you were only a little less hard and bitter I should always be glad to see you You darling excuse my impetuosity What are you looking at My new dress Do you envy me No I admire the color that s all Francine rose and shook out her dress and showed it from every point of view See how it s made Paris of course Money my dear money will do anything except making one learn one s lessons Are you not getting on any better Francine Worse my sweet friend worse One of the masters I am happy to say has flatly refused to teach me any longer Pupils without brains I am accustomed to he said in his broken English but a pupil with no heart is beyond my endurance Ha ha the mouldy old refugee has an eye for character though No heart there I am described in two words And proud of it Emily remarked Yes proud of it Stop let me do myself justice You consider tears a sign that one has some heart don t you I was very near crying last Sunday A popular preacher did it no less a person that mister Mirabel you look as if you had heard of him I have heard of him from Cecilia Is she at Brighton Then there s one fool more in a fashionable watering place Oh she s in Switzerland is she I don t care where she is I only care about mister Mirabel We all heard he was at Brighton for his health and was going to preach Didn t we cram the church As to describing him I give it up He is the only little man I ever admired hair as long as mine and the sort of beard you see in pictures I wish I had his fair complexion and his white hands We were all in love with him or with his voice which was it when he began to read the commandments I wish I could imitate him when he came to the fifth commandment He began in his deepest bass voice Honor thy father He stopped and looked up to heaven as if he saw the rest of it there He went on with a tremendous emphasis on the next word And thy mother he said as if that was quite a different thing in a tearful fluty quivering voice which was a compliment to mothers in itself We all felt it mothers or not But the great sensation was when he got into the pulpit The manner in which he dropped on his knees and hid his face in his hands and showed his beautiful rings was as a young lady said behind me simply seraphic We understood his celebrity from that moment I wonder whether I can remember the sermon You needn t attempt it on my account Emily said My dear don t be obstinate Wait till you hear him I am quite content to wait Ah you re just in the right state of mind to be converted you re in a fair way to become one of his greatest admirers They say he is so agreeable in private life I am dying to know him Do I hear a ring at the bell Is somebody else coming to see you The servant brought in a card and a message The person will call again miss Emily looked at the name written on the card missus Ellmother she exclaimed What an extraordinary name cried Francine Who is she My aunt s old servant Does she want a situation Emily looked at some lines of writing at the back of the card Doctor Allday had rightly foreseen events Rejected by the doctor missus Ellmother had no alternative but to ask Emily to help her If she is out of place Francine went on she may be just the sort of person I am looking for You Emily asked in astonishment Francine refused to explain until she got an answer to her question Tell me first she said is missus Ellmother engaged No she wants an engagement and she asks me to be her reference Is she sober honest middle aged clean steady good tempered industrious Francine rattled on Has she all the virtues and none of the vices Is she not too good looking and has she no male followers In one terrible word will she satisfy Miss Ladd What has Miss Ladd to do with it How stupid you are Emily Do put the woman s card down on the table and listen to me Haven t I told you that one of my masters has declined to have anything more to do with me Doesn t that help you to understand how I get on with the rest of them I am no longer Miss Ladd s pupil my dear Thanks to my laziness and my temper I am to be raised to the dignity of a parlor boarder In other words I am to be a young lady who patronizes the school with a room of my own and a servant of my own All provided for by a private arrangement between my father and Miss Ladd before I left the West Indies My mother was at the bottom of it I have not the least doubt You don t appear to understand me I don t indeed Francine considered a little Perhaps they were fond of you at home she suggested Say they loved me Francine and I loved them Ah my position is just the reverse of yours Now they have got rid of me they don t want me back again at home I know as well what my mother said to my father as if I had heard her Francine will never get on at school at her age Try her by all means but make some other arrangement with Miss Ladd in case of a failure or she will be returned on our hands like a bad shilling There is my mother my anxious affectionate mother hit off to a T She is your mother Francine don t forget that Oh no I won t forget it My cat is my kitten s mother there there I won t shock your sensibilities Let us get back to matter of fact When I begin my new life Miss Ladd makes one condition My maid is to be a model of discretion an elderly woman not a skittish young person who will only encourage me I must submit to the elderly woman or I shall be sent back to the West Indies after all How long did missus Ellmother live with your aunt Twenty five years and more Good heavens it s a lifetime Why isn t this amazing creature living with you now your aunt is dead Did you send her away Certainly not Then why did she go I don t know Do you mean that she went away without a word of explanation Yes that is exactly what I mean When did she go As soon as your aunt was dead That doesn t matter Francine In plain English you won t tell me I am all on fire with curiosity and that s how you put me out My dear if you have the slightest regard for me let us have the woman in here when she comes back for her answer Somebody must satisfy me I mean to make missus Ellmother explain herself I don t think you will succeed Francine Wait a little and you will see By the by it is understood that my new position at the school gives me the privilege of accepting invitations Do you know any nice people to whom you can introduce me I am the last person in the world who has a chance of helping you Emily answered Excepting good Doctor Allday On the point of adding the name of Alban Morris she checked herself without knowing why and substituted the name of her school friend And not forgetting Cecilia she resumed I know nobody Cecilia s a fool Francine remarked gravely but now I think of it she may be worth cultivating Her father is a member of Parliament and didn t I hear that he has a fine place in the country You see Emily I may expect to be married with my money if I can only get into good society Don t suppose I am dependent on my father my marriage portion is provided for in my uncle s will Cecilia may really be of some use to me Why shouldn t I make a friend of her and get introduced to her father in the autumn you know when the house is full of company Have you any idea when she is coming back No Do you think of writing to her Of course Give her my kind love and say I hope she enjoys Switzerland Francine you are positively shameless After calling my dearest friend a fool and a glutton you send her your love for your own selfish ends and you expect me to help you in deceiving her I won t do it Keep your temper my child We are all selfish you little goose The only difference is some of us own it and some of us don t I shall find my own way to Cecilia s good graces quite easily the way is through her mouth You mentioned a certain Doctor Allday Does he give parties And do the right sort of men go to them Hush I think I hear the bell again Go to the door and see who it is Emily waited without taking any notice of this suggestion The servant announced that the person had called again to know if there was any answer Show her in here Emily said The servant withdrew and came back again The person doesn t wish to intrude miss it will be quite sufficient if you will send a message by me Emily crossed the room to the door Come in missus Ellmother she said You have been too long away already Pray come in CHAPTER XXIX BONY missus Ellmother reluctantly entered the room Since Emily had seen her last her personal appearance doubly justified the nickname by which her late mistress had distinguished her The old servant was worn and wasted her gown hung loose on her angular body the big bones of her face stood out more prominently than ever She took Emily s offered hand doubtingly I hope I see you well miss she said with hardly a vestige left of her former firmness of voice and manner I am afraid you have been suffering from illness Emily answered gently It s the life I m leading that wears me down I want work and change Making that reply she looked round and discovered Francine observing her with undisguised curiosity You have got company with you she said to Emily I had better go away and come back another time Francine stopped her before she could open the door You mustn t go away I wish to speak to you About what miss The eyes of the two women met one near the end of her life concealing under a rugged surface a nature sensitively affectionate and incorruptibly true the other young in years with out the virtues of youth hard in manner and hard at heart In silence on either side they stood face to face strangers brought together by the force of circumstances working inexorably toward their hidden end Emily introduced missus Ellmother to Francine It may be worth your while she hinted to hear what this young lady has to say missus Ellmother listened with little appearance of interest in anything that a stranger might have to say her eyes rested on the card which contained her written request to Emily Francine watching her closely understood what was passing in her mind It might be worth while to conciliate the old woman by a little act of attention Turning to Emily Francine pointed to the card lying on the table You have not attended yet to mister Ellmother s request she said Emily at once assured missus Ellmother that the request was granted But is it wise she asked to go out to service again at your age I have been used to service all my life Miss Emily that s one reason And service may help me to get rid of my own thoughts that s another If you can find me a situation somewhere you will be doing me a good turn Is it useless to suggest that you might come back and live with me Emily ventured to say missus Ellmother s head sank on her breast Thank you kindly miss it is useless Why is it useless Francine asked missus Ellmother was silent Miss de Sor is speaking to you Emily reminded her Am I to answer Miss de Sor Attentively observing what passed and placing her own construction on looks and tones it suddenly struck Francine that Emily herself might be in missus Ellmother s confidence and that she might have reasons of her own for assuming ignorance when awkward questions were asked For the moment at least Francine decided on keeping her suspicions to herself I may perhaps offer you the employment you want she said to missus Ellmother I am staying at Brighton for the present with the lady who was Miss Emily s schoolmistress and I am in need of a maid Would you be willing to consider it if I proposed to engage you Yes miss In that case you can hardly object to the customary inquiry Why did you leave your last place missus Ellmother appealed to Emily Did you tell this young lady how long I remained in my last place Melancholy remembrances had been revived in Emily by the turn which the talk had now taken Francine s cat like patience stealthily feeling its way to its end jarred on her nerves Yes she said in justice to you I have mentioned your long term of service missus Ellmother addressed Francine You know miss that I served my late mistress for over twenty five years Will you please remember that and let it be a reason for not asking me why I left my place Francine smiled compassionately My good creature you have mentioned the very reason why I should ask You live five and twenty years with your mistress and then suddenly leave her and you expect me to pass over this extraordinary proceeding without inquiry Take a little time to think I want no time to think What I had in my mind when I left Miss Letitia is something which I refuse to explain miss to you or to anybody She recovered some of her old firmness when she made that reply Francine saw the necessity of yielding for the time at least Emily remained silent oppressed by remembrance of the doubts and fears which had darkened the last miserable days of her aunt s illness She began already to regret having made Francine and missus Ellmother known to each other I won t dwell on what appears to be a painful subject Francine graciously resumed I meant no offense You are not angry I hope Sorry miss I might have been angry at one time That time is over It was said sadly and resignedly Emily heard the answer Her heart ached as she looked at the old servant and thought of the contrast between past and present With what a hearty welcome this broken woman had been used to receive her in the bygone holiday time Her eyes moistened She felt the merciless persistency of Francine as if it had been an insult offered to herself Give it up she said sharply Leave me my dear to manage my own business Francine replied About your qualifications she continued turning coolly to missus Ellmother Can you dress hair Yes I ought to tell you Francine insisted that I am very particular about my hair My mistress was very particular about her hair missus Ellmother answered Are you a good needlewoman As good as ever I was with the help of my spectacles Francine turned to Emily See how well we get on together We are beginning to understand each other already I am an odd creature missus Ellmother Sometimes I take sudden likings to persons I have taken a liking to you Do you begin to think a little better of me than you did I hope you will produce the right impression on Miss Ladd you shall have every assistance that I can give I will beg Miss Ladd as a favor to me not to ask you that one forbidden question Poor missus Ellmother puzzled by the sudden appearance of Francine in the character of an eccentric young lady the creature of genial impulse thought it right to express her gratitude for the promised interference in her favor That s kind of you miss she said No no only just I ought to tell you there s one thing Miss Ladd is strict about sweethearts Are you quite sure Francine inquired jocosely that you can answer for yourself in that particular This effort of humor produced its intended effect missus Ellmother thrown off her guard actually smiled Lord miss what will you say next My good soul I will say something next that is more to the purpose If Miss Ladd asks me why you have so unaccountably refused to be a servant again in this house I shall take care to say that it is certainly not out of dislike to Miss Emily You need say nothing of the sort Emily quietly remarked And still less Francine proceeded without noticing the interruption still less through any disagreeable remembrances of Miss Emily s aunt missus Ellmother saw the trap that had been set for her It won t do miss she said What won t do Trying to pump me Francine burst out laughing Emily noticed an artificial ring in her gayety which suggested that she was exasperated rather than amused by the repulse which had baffled her curiosity once more missus Ellmother reminded the merry young lady that the proposed arrangement between them had not been concluded yet Am I to understand miss that you will keep a place open for me in your service You are to understand Francine replied sharply that I must have Miss Ladd s approval before I can engage you Suppose you come to Brighton I will pay your fare of course Never mind my fare miss Will you give up pumping Make your mind easy It s quite useless to attempt pumping you When will you come missus Ellmother pleaded for a little delay I m altering my gowns she said I get thinner and thinner don t I Miss Emily My work won t be done before Thursday Let us say Friday then Francine proposed Friday missus Ellmother exclaimed You forget that Friday is an unlucky day I forgot that certainly How can you be so absurdly superstitious You may call it what you like miss I have good reason to think as I do I was married on a Friday and a bitter bad marriage it turned out to be Superstitious indeed You don t know what my experience has been My only sister was one of a party of thirteen at dinner and she died within the year If we are to get on together nicely I ll take that journey on Saturday if you please Anything to satisfy you Francine agreed there is the address Come in the middle of the day and we will give you your dinner No fear of our being thirteen in number What will you do if you have the misfortune to spill the salt Take a pinch between my finger and thumb and throw it over my left shoulder missus Ellmother answered gravely Good day miss Good day Emily followed the departing visitor out to the hall She had seen and heard enough to decide her on trying to break off the proposed negotiation with the one kind purpose of protecting missus Ellmother against the pitiless curiosity of Francine Do you think you and that young lady are likely to get on well together she asked I have told you already Miss Emily I want to get away from my own home and my own thoughts I don t care where I go so long as I do that Having answered in those words missus Ellmother opened the door and waited a while thinking I wonder whether the dead know what is going on in the world they have left she said looking at Emily If they do there s one among them knows my thoughts and feels for me Good by miss and don t think worse of me than I deserve Emily went back to the parlor The only resource left was to plead with Francine for mercy to missus Ellmother Do you really mean to give it up she asked To give up what Pumping as that obstinate old creature calls it Emily persisted Don t worry the poor old soul However strangely she may have left my aunt and me her motives are kind and good I am sure of that Will you let her keep her harmless little secret Oh of course I don t believe you Francine Don t you I am like Cecilia I am getting hungry Shall we have some lunch You hard hearted creature Does that mean no luncheon until I have owned the truth Suppose you own the truth I won t tell missus Ellmother that you have betrayed her For the last time Francine I know no more of it than you do If you persist in taking your own view you as good as tell me I lie and you will oblige me to leave the room Even Francine s obstinacy was compelled to give way so far as appearances went Still possessed by the delusion that Emily was deceiving her she was now animated by a stronger motive than mere curiosity Her sense of her own importance imperatively urged her to prove that she was not a person who could be deceived with impunity I beg your pardon she said with humility But I must positively have it out with missus Ellmother She has been more than a match for me my turn next I mean to get the better of her and I shall succeed I have already told you Francine you will fail My dear I am a dunce and I don t deny it But let me tell you one thing I haven t lived all my life in the West Indies among black servants without learning something What do you mean More my clever friend than you are likely to guess In the meantime don t forget the duties of hospitality Ring the bell for luncheon CHAPTER XXX LADY DORIS The arrival of Miss Ladd some time before she had been expected interrupted the two girls at a critical moment She had hurried over her business in London eager to pass the rest of the day with her favorite pupil Emily s affectionate welcome was in some degree at least inspired by a sensation of relief To feel herself in the embrace of the warm hearted schoolmistress was like finding a refuge from Francine When the hour of departure arrived Miss Ladd invited Emily to Brighton for the second time On the last occasion my dear you wrote me an excuse I won t be treated in that way again If you can t return with us now come to morrow She added in a whisper Otherwise I shall think you include me in your dislike of Francine There was no resisting this It was arranged that Emily should go to Brighton on the next day Left by herself her thoughts might have reverted to missus Ellmother s doubtful prospects and to Francine s strange allusion to her life in the West Indies but for the arrival of two letters by the afternoon post The handwriting on one of them was unknown to her She opened that one first It was an answer to the letter of apology which she had persisted in writing to missus Rook Happily for herself Alban s influence had not been without its effect after his departure She had written kindly but she had written briefly at the same time missus Rook s reply presented a nicely compounded mixture of gratitude and grief The gratitude was addressed to Emily as a matter of course The grief related to her excellent master Sir Jervis s strength had suddenly failed His medical attendant being summoned had expressed no surprise My patient is over seventy years of age the doctor remarked He will sit up late at night writing his book and he refuses to take exercise till headache and giddiness force him to try the fresh air As the necessary result he has broken down at last It may end in paralysis or it may end in death Reporting this expression of medical opinion missus Rook s letter glided imperceptibly from respectful sympathy to modest regard for her own interests in the future It might be the sad fate of her husband and herself to be thrown on the world again If necessity brought them to London would kind Miss Emily grant her the honor of an interview and favor a poor unlucky woman with a word of advice She may pervert your letter to some use of her own which you may have reason to regret Did Emily remember Alban s warning words No she accepted missus Rook s reply as a gratifying tribute to the justice of her own opinions Having proposed to write to Alban feeling penitently that she had been in the wrong she was now readier than ever to send him a letter feeling compassionately that she had been in the right Besides it was due to the faithful friend who was still working for her in the reading room that he should be informed of Sir Jervis s illness Whether the old man lived or whether he died his literary labors were fatally interrupted in either case and one of the consequences would be the termination of her employment at the Museum Although the second of the two letters which she had received was addressed to her in Cecilia s handwriting Emily waited to read it until she had first written to Alban He will come to morrow she thought and we shall both make apologies I shall regret that I was angry with him and he will regret that he was mistaken in his judgment of missus Rook We shall be as good friends again as ever In this happy frame of mind she opened Cecilia s letter It was full of good news from first to last The invalid sister had made such rapid progress toward recovery that the travelers had arranged to set forth on their journey back to England in a fortnight My one regret Cecilia added is the parting with Lady Doris She and her husband are going to Genoa where they will embark in Lord Janeaway s yacht for a cruise in the Mediterranean When we have said that miserable word good by oh Emily what a hurry I shall be in to get back to you Those allusions to your lonely life are so dreadful my dear that I have destroyed your letter it is enough to break one s heart only to look at it When once I get to London there shall be no more solitude for my poor afflicted friend Papa will be free from his parliamentary duties in August and he has promised to have the house full of delightful people to meet you Who do you think will be one of our guests He is illustrious he is fascinating he deserves a line all to himself thus The Reverend Miles Mirabel Lady Doris has discovered that the country parsonage in which this brilliant clergyman submits to exile is only twelve miles away from our house She has written to mister Mirabel to introduce me and to mention the date of my return We will have some fun with the popular preacher we will both fall in love with him together Is there anybody to whom you would like me to send an invitation Shall we have mister Alban Morris Now I know how kindly he took care of you at the railway station your good opinion of him is my opinion Your letter also mentions a doctor Is he nice and do you think he will let me eat pastry if we have him too I am so overflowing with hospitality all for your sake that I am ready to invite anybody and everybody to cheer you and make you happy Would you like to meet Miss Ladd and the whole school As to our amusements make your mind easy I have come to a distinct understanding with Papa that we are to have dances every evening except when we try a little concert as a change Private theatricals are to follow when we want another change after the dancing and the music No early rising no fixed hour for breakfast everything that is most exquisitely delicious at dinner and to crown all your room next to mine for delightful midnight gossipings when we ought to be in bed What do you say darling to the programme A last piece of news and I have done I have actually had a proposal of marriage from a young gentleman who sits opposite me at the table d hote When I tell you that he has white eyelashes and red hands and such enormous front teeth that he can t shut his mouth you will not need to be told that I refused him This vindictive person has abused me ever since in the most shameful manner I heard him last night under my window trying to set one of his friends against me Keep clear of her my dear fellow she s the most heartless creature living The friend took my part he said I don t agree with you the young lady is a person of great sensibility Nonsense says my amiable lover she eats too much her sensibility is all stomach There s a wretch for you What a shameful advantage to take of sitting opposite to me at dinner Good by my love till we meet soon and are as happy together as the day is long Emily kissed the signature At that moment of all others Cecilia was such a refreshing contrast to Francine Before putting the letter away she looked again at that part of it which mentioned Lady Doris s introduction of Cecilia to mister Mirabel I don t feel the slightest interest in mister Mirabel she thought smiling as the idea occurred to her and I need never have known him but for Lady Doris who is a perfect stranger to me She had just placed the letter in her desk when a visitor was announced Doctor Allday presented himself in a hurry as usual Another patient waiting Emily asked mischievously No time to spare again Not a moment the old gentleman answered Have you heard from missus Ellmother Yes You don t mean to say you have answered her I have done better than that doctor I have seen her this morning And consented to be her reference of course How well you know me Doctor Allday was a philosopher he kept his temper Just what I might have expected he said Eve and the apple Only forbid a woman to do anything and she does it directly be cause you have forbidden her I ll try the other way with you now Miss Emily There was something else that I meant to have forbidden What was it May I make a special request Certainly Oh my dear write to missus Rook I beg and entreat of you write to missus Rook Emily s playful manner suddenly disappeared Ignoring the doctor s little outbreak of humor she waited in grave surprise until it was his pleasure to explain himself Doctor Allday on his side ignored the ominous change in Emily he went on as pleasantly as ever mister Morris and I have had a long talk about you my dear mister Morris is a capital fellow I recommend him as a sweetheart I also back him in the matter of missus Rook What s the matter now You re as red as a rose Temper again eh Hatred of meanness Emily answered indignantly I despise a man who plots behind my back to get another man to help him Oh how I have been mistaken in Alban Morris Oh how little you know of the best friend you have cried the doctor imitating her Girls are all alike the only man they can understand is the man who flatters them Will you oblige me by writing to missus Rook Emily made an attempt to match the doctor with his own weapons Your little joke comes too late she said satirically There is missus Rook s answer Read it and she checked herself even in her anger she was incapable of speaking ungenerously to the old man who had so warmly befriended her I won t say to you she resumed what I might have said to another person Shall I say it for you asked the incorrigible doctor Read it and be ashamed of yourself That was what you had in your mind isn t it Anything to please you my dear He put on his spectacles read the letter and handed it back to Emily with an impenetrable countenance What do you think of my new spectacles he asked as he took the glasses off his nose In the experience of thirty years I have had three grateful patients He put the spectacles back in the case This comes from the third Very gratifying very gratifying Emily s sense of humor was not the uppermost sense in her at that moment She pointed with a peremptory forefinger to missus Rook s letter Have you nothing to say about this The doctor had so little to say about it that he was able to express himself in one word Humbug He took his hat nodded kindly to Emily and hurried away to feverish pulses waiting to be felt and to furred tongues that were ashamed to show themselves CHAPTER XXXI MOIRA When Alban presented himself the next morning the hours of the night had exercised their tranquilizing influence over Emily She remembered sorrowfully how Doctor Allday had disturbed her belief in the man who loved her no feeling of irritation remained Alban noticed that her manner was unusually subdued she received him with her customary grace but not with her customary smile Are you not well he asked I am a little out of spirits she replied A disappointment that is all He waited a moment apparently in the expectation that she might tell him what the disappointment was She remained silent and she looked away from him Was he in any way answerable for the depression of spirits to which she alluded The doubt occurred to him but he said nothing I suppose you have received my letter she resumed I have come here to thank you for your letter It was my duty to tell you of Sir Jervis s illness I deserve no thanks You have written to me so kindly Alban reminded her you have referred to our difference of opinion the last time I was here so gently and so forgivingly If I had written a little later she interposed the tone of my letter might have been less agreeable to you I happened to send it to the post before I received a visit from a friend of yours a friend who had something to say to me after consulting with you Do you mean Doctor Allday Yes What did he say What you wished him to say He did his best he was as obstinate and unfeeling as you could possibly wish him to be but he was too late I have written to missus Rook and I have received a reply She spoke sadly not angrily and pointed to the letter lying on her desk Alban understood he looked at her in despair Is that wretched woman doomed to set us at variance every time we meet he exclaimed Emily silently held out the letter He refused to take it The wrong you have done me is not to be set right in that way he said You believe the doctor s visit was arranged between us I never knew that he intended to call on you I had no interest in sending him here and I must not interfere again between you and missus Rook I don t understand you You will understand me when I tell you how my conversation with Doctor Allday ended I have done with interference I have done with advice Whatever my doubts may be all further effort on my part to justify them all further inquiries no matter in what direction are at an end I made the sacrifice for your sake No I must repeat what you said to me just now I deserve no thanks What I have done has been done in deference to Doctor Allday against my own convictions in spite of my own fears Ridiculous convictions ridiculous fears Men with morbid minds are their own tormentors It doesn t matter how I suffer so long as you are at ease I shall never thwart you or vex you again Have you a better opinion of me now She made the best of all answers she gave him her hand May I kiss it he asked as timidly as if he had been a boy addressing his first sweetheart She was half inclined to laugh and half inclined to cry Yes if you like she said softly Will you let me come and see you again Gladly when I return to London You are going away I am going to Brighton this afternoon to stay with Miss Ladd It was hard to lose her on the happy day when they understood each other at last An expression of disappointment passed over his face He rose and walked restlessly to the window Miss Ladd he repeated turning to Emily as if an idea had struck him Did I hear at the school that Miss de Sor was to spend the holidays under the care of Miss Ladd Yes The same young lady he went on who paid you a visit yesterday morning The same That haunting distrust of the future which he had first betrayed and then affected to ridicule exercised its depressing influence over his better sense He was unreasonable enough to feel doubtful of Francine simply because she was a stranger Miss de Sor is a new friend of yours he said Do you like her It was not an easy question to answer without entering into particulars which Emily s delicacy of feeling warned her to avoid I must know a little more of Miss de Sor she said before I can decide Alban s misgivings were naturally encouraged by this evasive reply He began to regret having left the cottage on the previous day when he had heard that Emily was engaged He might have sent in his card and might have been admitted It was an opportunity lost of observing Francine On the morning of her first day at school when they had accidentally met at the summer house she had left a disagreeable impression on his mind Ought he to allow his opinion to be influenced by this circumstance or ought he to follow Emily s prudent example and suspend judgment until he knew a little more of Francine Is any day fixed for your return to London he asked Not yet she said I hardly know how long my visit will be In little more than a fortnight he continued I shall return to my classes they will be dreary classes without you Miss de Sor goes back to the school with Miss Ladd I suppose Emily was at a loss to account for the depression in his looks and tones while he was making these unimportant inquiries She tried to rouse him by speaking lightly in reply Miss de Sor returns in quite a new character she is to be a guest instead of a pupil Do you wish to be better acquainted with her Yes he said grave ly now I know that she is a friend of yours He returned to his place near her A pleasant visit makes the days pass quickly he resumed You may remain at Brighton longer than you anticipate and we may not meet again for some time to come If anything happens Do you mean anything serious she asked No no I only mean if I can be of any service In that case will you write to me You know I will She looked at him anxiously He had completely failed to hide from her the uneasy state of his mind a man less capable of concealment of feeling never lived You are anxious and out of spirits she said gently Is it my fault Your fault oh don t think that I have my dull days and my bright days and just now my barometer is down at dull His voice faltered in spite of his efforts to control it he gave up the struggle and took his hat to go Do you remember Emily what I once said to you in the garden at the school I still believe there is a time of fulfillment to come in our lives He suddenly checked himself as if there had been something more in his mind to which he hesitated to give expression and held out his hand to bid her good by My memory of what you said in the garden is better than yours she reminded him You said Happen what may in the interval I trust the future Do you feel the same trust still He sighed drew her to him gently and kissed her on the forehead Was that his own reply She was not calm enough to ask him the question it remained in her thoughts for some time after he had gone On the same day Emily was at Brighton Francine happened to be alone in the drawing room Her first proceeding when Emily was shown in was to stop the servant Have you taken my letter to the post Yes miss It doesn t matter She dismissed the servant by a gesture and burst into such effusive hospitality that she actually insisted on kissing Emily Do you know what I have been doing she said I have been writing to Cecilia directing to the care of her father at the House of Commons I stupidly forgot that you would be able to give me the right address in Switzerland You don t object I hope to my making myself agreeable to our dear beautiful greedy girl It is of such importance to me to surround myself with influential friends and of course I have given her your love Don t look disgusted Come and see your room Oh never mind Miss Ladd You will see her when she wakes Ill Is that sort of old woman ever ill She s only taking her nap after bathing Bathing in the sea at her age How she must frighten the fishes Having seen her own bed chamber Emily was next introduced to the room occupied by Francine One object that she noticed in it caused her some little surprise not unmingled with disgust She discovered on the toilet table a coarsely caricatured portrait of missus Ellmother It was a sketch in pencil wretchedly drawn but spitefully successful as a likeness I didn t know you were an artist Emily remarked with an ironical emphasis on the last word Francine laughed scornfully crumpled the drawing up in her hand and threw it into the waste paper basket You satirical creature she burst out gayly If you had lived a dull life at saint Domingo you would have taken to spoiling paper too I might really have turned out an artist if I had been clever and industrious like you As it was I learned a little drawing and got tired of it I tried modeling in wax and got tired of it Who do you think was my teacher One of our slaves A slave Emily exclaimed Yes a mulatto if you wish me to be particular the daughter of an English father and a negro mother In her young time at least she said so herself she was quite a beauty in her particular style Her master s favorite he educated her himself Besides drawing and painting and modeling in wax she could sing and play all the accomplishments thrown away on a slave When her owner died my uncle bought her at the sale of the property A word of natural compassion escaped Emily to Francine s surprise Oh my dear you needn t pity her Sappho that was her name fetched a high price even when she was no longer young She came to us by inheritance with the estates and the rest of it and took a fancy to me when she found out I didn t get on well with my father and mother I owe it to my father and mother she used to say that I am a slave When I see affectionate daughters it wrings my heart Sappho was a strange compound A woman with a white side to her character and a black side For weeks together she would be a civilized being Then she used to relapse and become as complete a negress as her mother At the risk of her life she stole away on those occasions into the interior of the island and looked on in hiding at the horrid witchcrafts and idolatries of the blacks they would have murdered a half blood prying into their ceremonies if they had discovered her I followed her once so far as I dared The frightful yellings and drummings in the darkness of the forests frightened me The blacks suspected her and it came to my ears I gave her the warning that saved her life I don t know what I should have done without Sappho to amuse me and from that time I do believe the curious creature loved me You see I can speak generously even of a slave I wonder you didn t bring her with you to England Emily said In the first place Francine answered she was my father s property not mine In the second place she s dead Poisoned as the other half bloods supposed by some enemy among the blacks She said herself she was under a spell What did she mean Francine was not interested enough in the subject to explain Stupid superstition my dear The negro side of Sappho was uppermost when she was dying there is the explanation Be off with you I hear the old woman on the stairs Meet her before she can come in here My bedroom is my only refuge from Miss Ladd On the morning of the last day in the week Emily had a little talk in private with her old schoolmistress Miss Ladd listened to what she had to say of missus Ellmother and did her best to relieve Emily s anxieties I think you are mistaken my child in supposing that Francine is in earnest It is her great fault that she is hardly ever in earnest You can trust to my discretion leave the rest to your aunt s old servant and to me missus Ellmother arrived punctual to the appointed time She was shown into Miss Ladd s own room Francine ostentatiously resolved to take no personal part in the affair went for a walk Emily waited to hear the result After a long interval Miss Ladd returned to the drawing room and announced that she had sanctioned the engagement of missus Ellmother I have considered your wishes in this respect she said It is arranged that a week s notice on either side shall end the term of service after the first month I cannot feel justified in doing more than that missus Ellmother is such a respectable woman she is so well known to you and she was so long in your aunt s service that I am bound to consider the importance of securing a person who is exactly fitted to attend on such a girl as Francine In one word I can trust missus Ellmother When does she enter on her service Emily inquired On the day after we return to the school Miss Ladd replied You will be glad to see her I am sure I will send her here One word more before you go Emily said Did you ask her why she left my aunt My dear child a woman who has been five and twenty years in one place is entitled to keep her own secrets I understand that she had her reasons and that she doesn t think it necessary to mention them to anybody Never trust people by halves especially when they are people like missus Ellmother It was too late now to raise any objections Emily felt relieved rather than disappointed on discovering that missus Ellmother was in a hurry to get back to London by the next train Sh e had found an opportunity of letting her lodgings and she was eager to conclude the bargain You see I couldn t say Yes she explained till I knew whether I was to get this new place or not and the person wants to go in tonight Emily stopped her at the door Promise to write and tell me how you get on with Miss de Sor You say that miss as if you didn t feel hopeful about me I say it because I feel interested about you Promise to write missus Ellmother promised and hastened away Emily looked after her from the window as long as she was in view I wish I could feel sure of Francine she said to herself In what way asked the hard voice of Francine speaking at the door It was not in Emily s nature to shrink from a plain reply She completed her half formed thought without a moment s hesitation I wish I could feel sure she answered that you will be kind to missus Ellmother Are you afraid I shall make her life one scene of torment Francine inquired How can I answer for myself I can t look into the future For once in your life can you be in earnest Emily said For once in your life can you take a joke Francine replied Emily said no more She privately resolved to shorten her visit to Brighton BOOK THE THIRD NETHERWOODS CHAPTER XXXII IN THE GRAY ROOM The house inhabited by Miss Ladd and her pupils had been built in the early part of the present century by a wealthy merchant proud of his money and eager to distinguish himself as the owner of the largest country seat in the neighborhood After his death Miss Ladd had taken Netherwoods as the place was called finding her own house insufficient for the accommodation of the increasing number of her pupils A lease was granted to her on moderate terms Netherwoods failed to attract persons of distinction in search of a country residence The grounds were beautiful but no landed property not even a park was attached to the house Excepting the few acres on which the building stood the surrounding land belonged to a retired naval officer of old family who resented the attempt of a merchant of low birth to assume the position of a gentleman No matter what proposals might be made to the admiral he refused them all The privilege of shooting was not one of the attractions offered to tenants the country presented no facilities for hunting and the only stream in the neighborhood was not preserved In consequence of these drawbacks the merchant s representatives had to choose between a proposal to use Netherwoods as a lunatic asylum or to accept as tenant the respectable mistress of a fashionable and prosperous school They decided in favor of Miss Ladd The contemplated change in Francine s position was accomplished in that vast house without inconvenience There were rooms unoccupied even when the limit assigned to the number of pupils had been reached On the re opening of the school Francine was offered her choice between two rooms on one of the upper stories and two rooms on the ground floor She chose these last Her sitting room and bedroom situated at the back of the house communicated with each other The sitting room ornamented with a pretty paper of delicate gray and furnished with curtains of the same color had been accordingly named The Gray Room It had a French window which opened on the terrace overlooking the garden and the grounds Some fine old engravings from the grand landscapes of Claude part of a collection of prints possessed by Miss Ladd s father hung on the walls The carpet was in harmony with the curtains and the furniture was of light colored wood which helped the general effect of subdued brightness that made the charm of the room If you are not happy here Miss Ladd said I despair of you And Francine answered Yes it s very pretty but I wish it was not so small On the twelfth of August the regular routine of the school was resumed Alban Morris found two strangers in his class to fill the vacancies left by Emily and Cecilia missus Ellmother was duly established in her new place She produced an unfavorable impression in the servants hall not as the handsome chief housemaid explained because she was ugly and old but because she was a person who didn t talk The prejudice against habitual silence among the lower order of the people is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair In the evening on that first day of renewed studies while the girls were in the grounds after tea Francine had at last completed the arrangement of her rooms and had dismissed missus Ellmother kept hard at work since the morning to take a little rest Standing alone at her window the West Indian heiress wondered what she had better do next She glanced at the girls on the lawn and decided that they were unworthy of serious notice on the part of a person so specially favored as herself She turned sidewise and looked along the length of the terrace At the far end a tall man was slowly pacing to and fro with his head down and his hands in his pockets Francine recognized the rude drawing master who had torn up his view of the village after she had saved it from being blown into the pond She stepped out on the terrace and called to him He stopped and looked up Do you want me he called back Of course I do She advanced a little to meet him and offered encouragement under the form of a hard smile Although his manners might be unpleasant he had claims on the indulgence of a young lady who was at a loss how to employ her idle time In the first place he was a man In the second place he was not as old as the music master or as ugly as the dancing master In the third place he was an admirer of Emily and the opportunity of trying to shake his allegiance by means of a flirtation in Emily s absence was too good an opportunity to be lost Do you remember how rude you were to me on the day when you were sketching in the summer house Francine asked with snappish playfulness I expect you to make yourself agreeable this time I am going to pay you a compliment He waited with exasperating composure to hear what the proposed compliment might be The furrow between his eyebrows looked deeper than ever There were signs of secret trouble in that dark face so grimly and so resolutely composed The school without Emily presented the severest trial of endurance that he had encountered since the day when he had been deserted and disgraced by his affianced wife You are an artist Francine proceeded and therefore a person of taste I want to have your opinion of my sitting room Criticism is invited pray come in He seemed to be unwilling to accept the invitation then altered his mind and followed Francine She had visited Emily she was perhaps in a fair way to become Emily s friend He remembered that he had already lost an opportunity of studying her character and if he saw the necessity of warning Emily not to encourage the advances of Miss de Sor Very pretty he remarked looking round the room without appearing to care for anything in it except the prints Francine was bent on fascinating him She raised her eyebrows and lifted her hands in playful remonstrance Do remember it s my room she said and take some little interest in it for my sake What do you want me to say he asked Come and sit down by me She made room for him on the sofa Her one favorite aspiration the longing to excite envy in others expressed itself in her next words Say something pretty she answered say you would like to have such a room as this I should like to have your prints he remarked Will that do It wouldn t do from anybody else Ah mister Morris I know why you are not as nice as you might be You are not happy The school has lost its one attraction in losing our dear Emily You feel it I know you feel it She assisted this expression of sympathy to produce the right effect by a sigh What would I not give to inspire such devotion as yours I don t envy Emily I only wish She paused in confusion and opened her fan Isn t it pretty she said with an ostentatious appearance of changing the subject Alban behaved like a monster he began to talk of the weather I think this is the hottest day we have had he said no wonder you want your fan Netherwoods is an airless place at this season of the year She controlled her temper I do indeed feel the heat she admitted with a resignation which gently reproved him it is so heavy and oppressive here after Brighton Perhaps my sad life far away from home and friends makes me sensitive to trifles Do you think so mister Morris The merciless man said he thought it was the situation of the house Miss Ladd took the place in the spring he continued and only discovered the one objection to it some months afterward We are in the highest part of the valley here but you see it s a valley surrounded by hills and on three sides the hills are near us All very well in winter but in summer I have heard of girls in this school so out of health in the relaxing atmosphere that they have been sent home again Francine suddenly showed an interest in what he was saying If he had cared to observe her closely he might have noticed it Do you mean that the girls were really ill she asked No They slept badly lost appetite started at trifling noises In short their nerves were out of order Did they get well again at home in another air Not a doubt of it he answered beginning to get weary of the subject May I look at your books Francine s interest in the influence of different atmospheres on health was not exhausted yet Do you know where the girls lived when they were at home she inquired I know where one of them lived She was the best pupil I ever had and I remember she lived in Yorkshire He was so weary of the idle curiosity as it appeared to him which persisted in asking trifling questions that he left his seat and crossed the room May I look at your books he repeated Oh yes The conversation was suspended for a while The lady thought I should like to box his ears The gentleman thought She s only an inquisitive fool after all His examination of her books confirmed him in the delusion that there was really nothing in Francine s character which rendered it necessary to caution Emily against the advances of her new friend Turning away from the book case he made the first excuse that occurred to him for putting an end to the interview I must beg you to let me return to my duties Miss de Sor I have to correct the young ladies drawings before they begin again to morrow Francine s wounded vanity made a last expiring attempt to steal the heart of Emily s lover You remind me that I have a favor to ask she said I don t attend the other classes but I should so like to join your class May I She looked up at him with a languishing appearance of entreaty which sorely tried Alban s capacity to keep his face in serious order He acknowledged the compliment paid to him in studiously commonplace terms and got a little nearer to the open window Francine s obstinacy was not conquered yet My education has been sadly neglected she continued but I have had some little instruction in drawing You will not find me so ignorant as some of the other girls She waited a little anticipating a few complimentary words Alban waited also in silence I shall look forward with pleasure to my lessons under such an artist as yourself she went on and waited again and was disappointed again Perhaps she resumed I may become your favorite pupil Who knows Who indeed It was not much to say when he spoke at last but it was enough to encourage Francine She called him dear mister Morris she pleaded for permission to take her first lesson immediately she clasped her hands Please say Yes I can t say Yes till you have complied with the rules Are they your rules Her eyes expressed the readiest submission in that case He entirely failed to see it he said they were Miss Ladd s rules and wished her good evening She watched him walking away down the terrace How was he paid Did he receive a yearly salary or did he get a little extra money for each new pupil who took drawing lessons In this last case Francine saw her opportunity of being even with him You brute Catch me attending your class CHAPTER XXXIII RECOLLECTIONS OF saint DOMINGO The night was oppressively hot Finding it impossible to sleep Francine lay quietly in her bed thinking The subject of her reflections was a person who occupied the humble position of her new servant missus Ellmother looked wretchedly ill missus Ellmother had told Emily that her object in returning to domestic service was to try if change would relieve her from the oppression of her own thoughts missus Ellmother believed in vulgar superstitions which declared Friday to be an unlucky day and which recommended throwing a pinch over your left shoulder if you happened to spill the salt In themselves these were trifling recollections But they assumed a certain importance derived from the associations which they called forth They reminded Francine by some mental process which she was at a loss to trace of Sappho the slave and of her life at saint Domingo She struck a light and unlocked her writing desk From one of the drawers she took out an old household account book The first page contained some entries relating to domestic expenses in her own handwriting They recalled one of her efforts to occupy her idle time by relieving her mother of the cares of housekeeping For a day or two she had persevered and then she had ceased to feel any interest in her new employment The remainder of the book was completely filled up in a beautifully clear handwriting beginning on the second page A title had been found for the manuscript by Francine She had written at the top of the page Sappho s Nonsense After reading the first few sentences she rapidly turned over the leaves and stopped at a blank space near the end of the book Here again she had added a title This time it implied a compliment to the writer the page was headed Sappho s Sense She read this latter part of the manuscript with the closest attention I entreat my kind and dear young mistress not to suppose that I believe in witchcraft after such an education as I have received When I wrote down at your biding all that I had told you by word of mouth I cannot imagine what delusion possessed me You say I have a negro side to my character which I inherit from my mother Did you mean this dear mistress as a joke I am almost afraid it is sometimes not far off from the truth Let me be careful however to avoid leading you into a mistake It is really true that the man slave I spoke of did pine and die after the spell had been cast on him by my witch mother s image of wax But I ought also to have told you that circumstances favored the working of the spell the fatal end was not brought about by supernatural means The poor wretch was not in good health at the time and our owner had occasion to employ him in the valley of the island far inland I have been told and can well believe that the climate there is different from the climate on the coast in which the unfortunate slave had been accustomed to live The overseer wouldn t believe him when he said the valley air would be his death and the negroes who might otherwise have helped him all avoided a man whom they knew to be under a spell This you see accounts for what might appear incredible to civilized persons If you will do me a favor you will burn this little book as soon as you have read what I have written here If my request is not granted I can only implore you to let no eyes but your own see these pages My life might be in danger if the blacks knew what I have now told you in the interests of truth Francine closed the book and locked it up again in her desk Now I know she said to herself what reminded me of saint Domingo When Francine rang her bell the next morning so long a time elapsed without producing an answer that she began to think of sending one of the house servants to make inquiries Before she could decide missus Ellmother presented herself and offered her apologies It s the first time I have overslept myself miss since I was a girl Please to excuse me it shan t happen again Do you find that the air here makes you drowsy Francine asked missus Ellmother shook her head I didn t get to sleep she said till morning and so I was too heavy to be up in time But air has got nothing to do with it Gentlefolks may have their whims and fancies All air is the same to people like me You enjoy good health missus Ellmother Why not miss I have never had a doctor Oh That s your opinion of doctors is it I won t have anything to do with them if that s what you mean by my opinion missus Ellmother answered doggedly How will you have your hair done The same as yesterday Have you seen anything of Miss Emily She went back to London the day after you left us I haven t been in London I m thankful to say my lodgings are let to a good tenant Then where have you lived while you were waiting to come here I had only one place to go to miss I went to the village where I was born A friend found a corner for me Ah dear heart it s a pleasant place there A place like this Lord help you As little like this as chalk is to cheese A fine big moor miss in Cumberland without a tree in sight look where you may Something like a wind I can tell you when it takes to blowing there Have you never been in this part of the country Not I When I left the North my new mistress took me to Canada Talk about air If there was anything in it the people in that air ought to live to be a hundred I liked Canada And who was your next mistress Thus far missus Ellmother had been ready enough to talk Had she failed to hear what Francine had just said to her or had she some reason for feeling reluctant to answer In any case a spirit of taciturnity took sudden possession of her she was silent Francine as usual persisted Was your next place in service with Miss Emily s aunt Yes Did the old lady always live in London No What part of the country did she live in Kent Among the hop gardens No In what other part then Isle of Thanet Near the sea coast Yes Even Francine could insist no longer missus Ellmother s reserve had beaten her for that day at least Go into the hall she said and see if there are any letters for me in the rack There was a letter bearing the Swiss postmark Simple Cecilia was flattered and delighted by the charming manner in which Francine had written to her She looked forward with impatience to the time when their present acquaintance might ripen into friendship Would Dear Miss de Sor waive all ceremony and consent to be a guest later in the autumn at her father s house Circumstances connected with her sister s health would delay their return to England for a little while By the end of the month she hoped to be at home again and to hear if Francine was disengaged Her address in England was Monksmoor Park Hants Having read the letter Francine drew a moral from it There is great use in a fool when one knows how to manage her Having little appetite for her breakfast she tried the experiment of a walk on the terrace Alban Morris was right the air at Netherwoods in the summer time was relaxing The morning mist still hung over the lowest part of the valley between the village and the hills beyond A little exercise produced a feeling of fatigue Francine returned to her room and trifled with her tea and toast Her next proceeding was to open her writing desk and look into the old account book once more While it lay open on her lap she recalled what had passed that morning between missus Ellmother and herself The old woman had been born and bred in the North on an open moor She had been removed to the keen air of Canada when she left her birthplace She had been in service after that on the breezy eastward coast of Kent Would the change to the climate of Netherwoods produce any effect on missus Ellmother At her age and with her seasoned constitution would she feel it as those school girls had felt it especially that one among them who lived in the bracing air of the North the air of Yorkshire Weary of solitary thinking on one subject Francine returned to the terrace with a vague idea of finding something to amuse her that is to say something she could turn into ridicule if she joined the girls The next morning missus Ellmother answered her mistress s bell without delay You have slept better this time Francine said No miss When I did get to sleep I was troubled by dreams Another bad night and no mistake I suspect your mind is not quite at ease Francine suggested Why do you suspect that if you please You talked when I met you at Miss Emily s of wanting to get away from your own thoughts Has the change to this place helped you It hasn t helped me as I expected Some people s thoughts stick fast Remorseful thoughts Francine inquired missus Ellmother held up her forefinger and shook it with a gesture of reproof I thought we agreed miss that there was to be no pumping The business of the toilet proceeded in silence A week passed During an interval in the labors of the school Miss Ladd knocked at the door of Francine s room I want to speak to you my dear about missus Ellmother Have you noticed that she doesn t seem to be in good health She looks rather pale Miss Ladd It s more serious than that Francine The servants tell me that she has hardly any appetite She herself acknowledges that she sleeps badly I noticed her yesterday evening in the garden under the schoolroom window One of the girls dropped a dictionary She started at that slight noise as if it terrified her Her nerves are seriously out of order Can you prevail upon her to see the doctor Francine hesitated and made an excuse I think she would be much more likely Miss Ladd to listen to you Do you mind speaking to her Certainly not missus Ellmother was immediately sent for What is your pleasure miss she said to Francine Miss Ladd interposed It is I who wish to speak to you missus Ellmother For some days past I have been sorry to see you looking ill I never was ill in my life ma am Miss Ladd gently persisted I hear that you have lost your appetite I never was a great eater ma am It was evidently useless to risk any further allusion to missus Ellmother s symptoms Miss Ladd tried another method of persuasion I daresay I may be mistaken she said but I do really feel anxious about you To set my mind at rest will you see the doctor The doctor Do you think I m going to begin taking physic at my time of life Lord ma am you amuse me you do indeed She burst into a sudden fit of laughter the hysterical laughter which is on the verge of tears With a desperate effort she controlled herself Please don t make a fool of me again she said and left the room What do you think now Miss Ladd asked Francine appeared to be still on her guard I don t know what to think she said evasively Miss Ladd looked at her in silent surprise and withdrew Left by herself Francine sat with her elbows on the table and her face in her hands absorbed in thought After a long interval she opened her desk and hesitated She took a sheet of note paper and paused as if still in doubt She snatched up her pen with a sudden recovery of resolution and addressed these lines to the wife of her father s agent in London When I was placed under your care on the night of my arrival from the West Indies you kindly said I might ask you for any little service which might be within your power I shall be greatly obliged if you can obtain for me and send to this place a supply of artists modeling wax sufficient for the product ion of a small image CHAPTER XXXIV IN THE DARK A week later Alban Morris happened to be in Miss Ladd s study with a report to make on the subject of his drawing class missus Ellmother interrupted them for a moment She entered the room to return a book which Francine had borrowed that morning Has Miss de Sor done with it already Miss Ladd asked She won t read it ma am She says the leaves smell of tobacco smoke Miss Ladd turned to Alban and shook her head with an air of good humored reproof I know who has been reading that book last she said Alban pleaded guilty by a look He was the only master in the school who smoked As missus Ellmother passed him on her way out he noticed the signs of suffering in her wasted face That woman is surely in a bad state of health he said Has she seen the doctor She flatly refuses to consult the doctor Miss Ladd replied If she was a stranger I should meet the difficulty by telling Miss de Sor whose servant she is that missus Ellmother must be sent home But I cannot act in that peremptory manner toward a person in whom Emily is interested From that moment missus Ellmother became a person in whom Alban was interested Later in the day he met her in one of the lower corridors of the house and spoke to her I am afraid the air of this place doesn t agree with you he said missus Ellmother s irritable objection to being told even indirectly that she looked ill expressed itself roughly in reply I daresay you mean well sir but I don t see how it matters to you whether the place agrees with me or not Wait a minute Alban answered good humoredly I am not quite a stranger to you How do you make that out if you please I know a young lady who has a sincere regard for you You don t mean Miss Emily Yes I do I respect and admire Miss Emily and I have tried in my poor way to be of some little service to her missus Ellmother s haggard face instantly softened Please to forgive me sir for forgetting my manners she said simply I have had my health since the day I was born and I don t like to be told in my old age that a new place doesn t agree with me Alban accepted this apology in a manner which at once won the heart of the North countrywoman He shook hands with her You re one of the right sort she said there are not many of them in this house Was she alluding to Francine Alban tried to make the discovery Polite circumlocution would be evidently thrown away on missus Ellmother Is your new mistress one of the right sort he asked bluntly The old servant s answer was expressed by a frowning look followed by a plain question Do you say that sir because you like my new mistress No Please to shake hands again She said it took his hand with a sudden grip that spoke for itself and walked away Here was an exhibition of character which Alban was just the man to appreciate If I had been an old woman he thought in his dryly humorous way I believe I should have been like missus Ellmother We might have talked of Emily if she had not left me in such a hurry When shall I see her again He was destined to see her again that night under circumstances which he remembered to the end of his life The rules of Netherwoods in summer time recalled the young ladies from their evening s recreation in the grounds at nine o clock After that hour Alban was free to smoke his pipe and to linger among trees and flower beds before he returned to his hot little rooms in the village As a relief to the drudgery of teaching the young ladies he had been using his pencil when the day s lessons were over for his own amusement It was past ten o clock before he lighted his pipe and began walking slowly to and fro on the path which led to the summer house at the southern limit of the grounds In the perfect stillness of the night the clock of the village church was distinctly audible striking the hours and the quarters The moon had not risen but the mysterious glimmer of starlight trembled on the large open space between the trees and the house Alban paused admiring with an artist s eye the effect of light so faintly and delicately beautiful on the broad expanse of the lawn Does the man live who could paint that he asked himself His memory recalled the works of the greatest of all landscape painters the English artists of fifty years since While recollections of many a noble picture were still passing through his mind he was startled by the sudden appearance of a bareheaded woman on the terrace steps She hurried down to the lawn staggering as she ran stopped and looked back at the house hastened onward toward the trees stopped again looking backward and forward uncertain which way to turn next and then advanced once more He could now hear her heavily gasping for breath As she came nearer the starlight showed a panic stricken face the face of missus Ellmother Alban ran to meet her She dropped on the grass before he could cross the short distance which separated them As he raised her in his arms she looked at him wildly and murmured and muttered in the vain attempt to speak Look at me again he said Don t you remember the man who had some talk with you to day She still stared at him vacantly he tried again Don t you remember Miss Emily s friend As the name passed his lips her mind in some degree recovered its balance Yes she said Emily s friend I m glad I have met with Emily s friend She caught at Alban s arm starting as if her own words had alarmed her What am I talking about Did I say Emily A servant ought to say Miss Emily My head swims Am I going mad Alban led her to one of the garden chairs You re only a little frightened he said Rest and compose yourself She looked over her shoulder toward the house Not here I ve run away from a she devil I want to be out of sight Further away Mister I don t know your name Tell me your name I won t trust you unless you tell me your name Hush hush Call me Alban I never heard of such a name I won t trust you You won t trust your friend and Emily s friend You don t mean that I m sure Call me by my other name call me Morris Morris she repeated Ah I ve heard of people called Morris Look back Your eyes are young do you see her on the terrace There isn t a living soul to be seen anywhere With one hand he raised her as he spoke and with the other he took up the chair In a minute more they were out of sight of the house He seated her so that she could rest her head against the trunk of a tree What a good fellow the poor old creature said admiring him he knows how my head pains me Don t stand up You re a tall man She might see you She can see nothing Look at the trees behind us Even the starlight doesn t get through them missus Ellmother was not satisfied yet You take it coolly she said Do you know who saw us together in the passage to day You good Morris she saw us she did Wretch Cruel cunning shameless wretch In the shadows that were round them Alban could just see that she was shaking her clinched fists in the air He made another attempt to control her Don t excite yourself If she comes into the garden she might hear you The appeal to her fears had its effect That s true she said in lowered tones A sudden distrust of him seized her the next moment Who told me I was excited she burst out It s you who are excited Deny it if you dare I begin to suspect you mister Morris I don t like your conduct What has become of your pipe I saw you put your pipe in your coat pocket You did it when you set me down among the trees where she could see me You are in league with her she is coming to meet you here you know she does not like tobacco smoke Are you two going to put me in the madhouse She started to her feet It occurred to Alban that the speediest way of pacifying her might be by means of the pipe Mere words would exercise no persuasive influence over that bewildered mind Instant action of some kind would be far more likely to have the right effect He put his pipe and his tobacco pouch into her hands and so mastered her attention before he spoke Do you know how to fill a man s pipe for him he asked Haven t I filled my husband s pipe hundreds of times she answered sharply Very well Now do it for me She took her chair again instantly and filled the pipe He lighted it and seated himself on the grass quietly smoking Do you think I m in league with her now he asked purposely adopting the rough tone of a man in her own rank of life She answered him as she might have answered her husband in the days of her unhappy marriage Oh don t gird at me there s a good man If I ve been off my head for a minute or two please not to notice me It s cool and quiet here the poor woman said gratefully Bless God for the darkness there s something comforting in the darkness along with a good man like you Give me a word of advice You are my friend in need What am I to do I daren t go back to the house She was quiet enough now to suggest the hope that she might be able to give Alban some information Were you with Miss de Sor he asked before you came out here What did she do to frighten you There was no answer missus Ellmother had abruptly risen once more Hush she whispered Don t I hear somebody near us Alban at once went back along the winding path which they had followed No creature was visible in the gardens or on the terrace On returning he found it impossible to use his eyes to any good purpose in the obscurity among the trees He waited a while listening intently No sound was audible there was not even air enough to stir the leaves As he returned to the place that he had left the silence was broken by the chimes of the distant church clock striking the three quarters past ten Even that familiar sound jarred on missus Ellmother s shattered nerves In her state of mind and body she was evidently at the mercy of any false alarm which might be raised by her own fears Relieved of the feeling of distrust which had thus far troubled him Alban sat down by her again opened his match box to relight his pipe and changed his mind missus Ellmother had unconsciously warned him to be cautious For the first time he thought it likely that the heat in the house might induce some of the inmates to try the cooler atmosphere in the grounds If this happened and if he continued to smoke curiosity might tempt them to follow the scent of tobacco hanging on the stagnant air Is there nobody near us missus Ellmother asked Are you sure Quite sure Now tell me did you really mean it when you said just now that you wanted my advice Need you ask that sir Who else have I got to help me I am ready and willing to help you but I can t do it unless I know first what has passed between you and Miss de Sor Will you trust me I will May I depend on you Try me CHAPTER XXXV THE TREACHERY OF THE PIPE Alban took missus Ellmother at her word I am going to venture on a guess he said You have been with Miss de Sor to night Quite true mister Morris I am going to guess again Did Miss de Sor ask you to stay with her when you went into her room That s it She rang for me to see how I was getting on with my needlework and she was what I call hearty for the first time since I have been in her service I didn t think badly of her when she first talked of engaging me and I ve had reason to repent of my opinion ever since Oh she showed the cloven foot to night Sit down she says I ve nothing to read and I hate work let s have a little chat She s got a glib tongue of her own All I could do was to say a word now and then to keep her going She talked and talked till it was time to light the lamp She was particular in telling me to put the shade over it We were half in the dark and half in the light She trapped me Lord knows how into talking about foreign parts I mean the place she lived in before they sent her to England Have you heard that she comes from the West Indies Yes I have heard that Go on Wait a bit sir There s something by your leave that I want to know Do you believe in Witchcraft I know nothing about it Did Miss de Sor put that question to you She did And how did you answer Neither in one way nor the other I m in two minds about that matter of Witchcraft When I was a girl there was an old woman in our village who was a sort of show People came to see her from all the country round gentlefolks among them It was her great age that made her famous More than a hundred years old sir One of our neighbors didn t believe in her age and she heard of it She cast a spell on his flock I tell you she sent a plague on his sheep the plague of the Bots The whole flock died I remember it well Some said the sheep would have had the Bots anyhow Some said it was the spell Which of them was right How am I to settle it Did you mention this to Miss de Sor I was obliged to mention it Didn t I tell you just now that I can t make up my mind about Witchcraft You don t seem to know whether you believe or disbelieve she says It made me look like a fool I told her I had my reasons and then I was obliged to give them And what did she do then She said I ve got a better story of Witchcraft than yours And she opened a little book with a lot of writing in it and began to read Her story made my flesh creep It turns me cold sir when I think of it now He heard her moaning and shuddering Strongly as his interest was excited there was a compassionate reluctance in him to ask her to go on His merciful scruples proved to be needless The fascination of beauty it is possible to resist The fascination of horror fastens its fearful hold on us struggle against it as we may missus Ellmother repeated what she had heard in spite of herself It happened in the West Indies she said and the writing of a woman slave was the writing in the little book The slave wrote about her mother Her mother was a black a Witch in her own country There was a forest in her own country The devil taught her Witchcraft in the forest The serpents and the wild beasts were afraid to touch her She lived without eating She was sold for a slave and sent to the island an island in the West Indies An old man lived there the wickedest man of them all He filled the black Witch with devilish knowledge She learned to make the image of wax The image of wax casts spells You put pins in the image of wax At every pin you put the person under the spell gets nearer and nearer to death There was a poor black in the island He offended the Witch She made his image in wax she cast spells on him He couldn t sleep he couldn t eat he was such a coward that common noises frightened him Like Me Oh God like me Wait a little Alban interposed You are exciting yourself again wait You re wrong sir You think it ended when she finished her story and shut up her book there s worse to come than anything you ve heard yet I don t know what I did to offend her She looked at me and spoke to me as if I was the dirt under her feet If you re too stupid to understand what I have been reading she says get up and go to the glass Look at yourself and remember what happened to the slave who was under the spell You re getting paler and paler and thinner and thinner you re pining away just as he did Shall I tell you why She snatched off the shade from the lamp and put her hand under the table and brought out an image of wax My image She pointed to three pins in it One she says for no sleep One for no appetite One for broken nerves I asked her what I had done to make such a bitter enemy of her She says Remember what I asked of you when we talked of your being my servant Choose which you will do Die by inches I swear she said it as I hope to be saved die by inches or tell me There in the full frenzy of the agitation that possessed her there missus Ellmother suddenly stopped Alban s first impression was that she might have fainted He looked closer and could just see her shadowy figure still seated in the chair He asked if she was ill No Then why don t you go on I have done she answered Do you think you can put me off he rejoined sternly with such an excuse as that What did Miss de Sor ask you to tell her You promised to trust me Be as good as your word In the days of her health and strength she would have set him at defiance All she could do now was to appeal to his mercy Make some allowance for me she said I have been terribly upset What has become of my courage What has broken me down in this way Spare me sir He refused to listen This vile attempt to practice on your fears may be repeated he reminded her More cruel advantage may be taken of the nervous derangement from which you are suffering in the climate of this place You little know me if you think I will allow that to go on She made a last effort to plead with him Oh sir is this behaving like the good kind man I thought you were You say you are Miss Emily s friend Don t press me for Miss Emily s sake Emily Alban exclaimed Is she concerned in this There was a change to tenderness in his voice which persuaded missus Ellmother that she had found her way to the weak side of him Her one effort now was to strengthen the impression which she believed herself to have produced Miss Emily is concerned in it she confessed In what way Never mind in what way But I do mind I tell you sir Miss Emily must never know it to her dying day The first suspicion of the truth crossed Alban s mind I understand you at last he said What Miss Emily must never know is what Miss de Sor wanted you to tell her Oh it s useless to contradict me Her motive in trying to frighten you is as plain to me now as if she had confessed it Are you sure you didn t betray yourself when she showed the image of wax I should have died first The reply had hardly escaped her before she regretted it What makes you want to be so sure about it she said It looks as if you knew I do know What The kindest thing that he could do now was to speak out Your secret is no secret to me he said Rage and fear shook her together For the moment she was like the missus Ellmother of former days You lie she cried I speak the truth I won t believe you I daren t believe you Listen to me In Emily s interests listen to me I have read of the murder at Zeeland That s nothing The man was a namesake of her father The man was her father himself Keep your seat There is nothing to be alarmed about I know that Emily is ignorant of the horrid death that her father died I know that you and your late mistress have kept the discovery from her to this day I know the love and pity which plead your excuse for deceiving her and the circumstances that favored the deception My good creature Emily s peace of mind is as sacred to me as it is to you I love her as I love my own life and better Are you calmer now He heard her crying it was the best relief that could come to her After waiting a while to let the tears have their way he helped her to rise There was no more to be said now The one thing to do was to take her back to the house I can give you a word of advice he said before we part for the night You must leave Miss de Sor s service at once Your health will be a sufficient excuse Give her warning immediately missus Ellmother hung back when he offered her his arm The bare prospect of seeing Francine again was revolting to her On Alban s assurance that the notice to leave could be given in writing she made no further resistance The village clock struck eleven as they ascended the terrace steps A minute later another person left the grounds by the path which led to the house Alban s precaution had been taken too late The smell of tobacco smoke had guided Francine when she was at a loss which way to turn next in search of missus Ellmother For the last quarter of an hour she had been listening hidden among the trees CHAPTER XXXVI CHANGE OF AIR The inmates of Netherwoods rose early and went to bed early When Alban and missus Ellmother arrived at the back door of the house they found it locked The only light visible along the whole length of the building glimmered through the Venetian blind of the window entrance to Francine s sitting room Alban proposed to get admission to the house by that way In her horror of again encountering Francine missus Ellmother positively refused to follow him when he turned away from the door They can t be all asleep yet she said and rang the bell One person was still out of bed and that person was the mistress of the house They recognized her voice in the customary question Who s there The door having been opened good Miss Ladd looked backward and forward between Alban and missus Ellmother with the bewildered air of a lady who doubted the evidence of her own eyes The next moment her sense of humor overpowered her She burst out laughing Close the door mister Morris she said and be so good as to tell me what this means Have you been giving a lesson in drawing by starlight missus Ellmother moved so that the light of the lamp in Miss Ladd s hand fell on her face I am faint and giddy she said let me go to my bed Miss Ladd instantly followed her Pray forgive me I didn t see you were ill when I spoke she gently explained What can I do for you Thank you kindly ma am I want nothing but peace and quiet I wish you good night Alban followed Miss Ladd to her study on the front side of the house He had just mentioned the circumstances under which he and missus Ellmother had met when they were interrupted by a tap at the door Francine had got back to her room unperceived by way of the French window She now presented herself with an elaborate apology and with the nearest approach to a penitent expression of which her face was capable I am ashamed Miss Ladd to intrude on you at this time of night My only excuse is that I am anxious about missus Ellmother I heard you just now in the hall If she is really ill I am the unfortunate cause of it In what way Miss de Sor I am sorry to say I frightened her while we were talking in my room quite unintentionally She rushed to the door and ran out I supposed she had gone to her bedroom I had no idea she was in the grounds In this false statement there was mingled a grain of truth It was true that Francine believed missus Ellmother to have taken refuge in her room for she had examined the room Finding it empty and failing to discover the fugitive in other parts of the house she had become alarmed and had tried the grounds next with the formidable result which has been already related Concealing this circumstance she had lied in such a skillfully artless manner that Alban having no suspicion of what had really happened to sharpen his wits was as completely deceived as Miss Ladd Proceeding to further explanation and remembering that she was in Alban s presence Francine was careful to keep herself within the strict limit of truth Confessing that she had frightened her servant by a description of sorcery as it was practiced among the slaves on her father s estate she only lied again in declaring that missus Ellmother had supposed she was in earnest when she was guilty of no more serious offense than playing a practical joke In this case Alban was necessarily in a position to detect the falsehood But it was so evidently in Francine s interests to present her conduct in the most favorable light that the discovery failed to excite his suspicion He waited in silence while Miss Ladd administered a severe reproof Francine having left the room as penitently as she had entered it with her handkerchief over her tearless eyes he was at liberty with certain reserves to return to what had passed between missus Ellmother and himself The fright which the poor old woman has suffered he said has led to one good result I have found her ready at last to acknowledge that she is ill and inclined to believe that the change to Netherwoods has had something to do with it I have advised her to take the course which you suggested by leaving this house Is it possible to dispense with the usual delay when she gives notice to leave Miss de Sor s service She need feel no anxiety poor soul on that account Miss Ladd replied In any case I had arranged that a week s notice on either side should be enough As it is I will speak to Francine myself The least she can do to express her regret is to place no difficulties in missus Ellmother s way The next day was Sunday Miss Ladd broke through her rule of attending to secular affairs on week days only and after consulting with missus Ellmother arranged with Francine that her servant should be at liberty to leave Netherwoods health permitting on the next day But one difficulty remained missus Ellmother was in no condition to take the long journey to her birthplace in Cumberland and her own lodgings in London had been let Under these circumstances what was the best arrangement that could be made for her Miss Ladd wisely and kindly wrote to Emily on the subject and asked for a speedy reply Later in the day Alban was sent for to see missus Ellmother He found her anxiously waiting to hear what had passed on the previous night between Miss Ladd and himself Were you careful sir to say nothing about Miss Emily I was especially careful I never alluded to her in any way Has Miss de Sor spoken to you I have not given her the opportunity She s an obstinate one she might try If she does she shall hear my opinion of her in plain words The talk between them turned next on Alban s discovery of the secret of which missus Ellmother had believed herself to be the sole depositary since Miss Letitia s death Without alarming her by any needless allusion to Doctor Allday or to Miss Jethro he answered her inquiries so far as he was himself concerned without reserve Her curiosity once satisfied she showed no disposition to pursue the topic She pointed to Miss Ladd s cat fast asleep by the side of an empty saucer Is it a sin mister Morris to wish I was Tom He doesn t trouble himself about his life that is past or his life that is to come If I could only empty my saucer and go to sleep I shouldn t be thinking of the number of people in this world like myself who would be better out of it than in it Miss Ladd has got me my liberty tomorrow and I don t even know where to go when I leave this place Suppose you follow Tom s example Alban suggested Enjoy to day in that comfortable chair and let to morrow take care of itself To morrow arrived and justified Alban s system of philosophy Emily answered Miss Ladd s letter to excellent purpose by telegraph I leave London to day with Cecilia the message announced for Monksmoor Park Hants Will missus Ellmother take care of the cottage in my absence I shall be away for a month at least All is prepared for her if she consents missus Ellmother gladly accepted this proposal In the interval of Emily s absence she could easily arrange to return to her own lodgings With words of sincere gratitude she took leave of Miss Ladd but no persuasion would induce her to say good by to Francine Do me one more kindness ma am don t tell Miss de Sor when I go away Ignorant of the provocation which had produced this unforgiving temper of mind Miss Ladd gently remonstrated Miss de Sor received my reproof in a penitent spirit she expresses sincere sorrow for having thoughtlessly frightened you Both yesterday and to day she has made kind inquiries after your health Come come don t bear malice wish her good by missus Ellmother s answer was characteristic I ll say good by by telegraph when I get to London Her last words were addressed to Alban If you can find a way of doing it sir keep those two apart Do you mean Emily and Miss de Sor Yes What are you afraid of I don t know Is that quite reasonable missus Ellmother I daresay not I only know that I am afraid The pony chaise took her away Alban s class was not yet ready for him He waited on the terrace Innocent alike of all knowledge of the serious reason for fear which did really exist missus Ellmother and Alban felt nevertheless the same vague distrust of an intimacy between the two girls Idle vain malicious false to know that Francine s character presented these faults without any discoverable merits to set against them was surely enough to justify a gloomy view of the prospect if she succeeded in winning the position of Emily s friend Alban reasoned it out logically in this way without satisfying himself and without accounting for the remembrance that haunted him of missus Ellmother s farewell look A commonplace man would say we are both in a morbid state of mind he thought and sometimes commonplace men turn out to be right He was too deeply preoccupied to notice that he had advanced perilously near Francine s window She suddenly stepped out of her room and spoke to him Do you happen to know mister Morris why missus Ellmother has gone away without bidding me good by She was probably afraid Miss de Sor that you might make her the victim of another joke Francine eyed him steadily Have you any particular reason for speaking to me in that way I am not aware that I have answered you rudely if that is what you mean That is not what I mean You seem to have taken a dislike to me I should be glad to know why I dislike cruelty and you have behaved cruelly to missus Ellmother Meaning to be cruel Francine inquired You know as well as I do Miss de Sor that I can t answer that question Francine looked at him again Am I to understand that we are enemies she asked You are to understand he replied that a person whom Miss Ladd employs to help her in teaching cannot always presume to express his sentiments in speaking to the young ladies If that means anything mister Morris it means that we are enemies It means Miss de Sor that I am the drawing master at this school and that I am called to my class Francine returned to her room relieved of the only doubt that had troubled her Plainly no suspicion that she had overheard what passed between missus Ellmother and himself existed in Alban s mind As to the use to be made of her discovery she felt no difficulty in deciding to wait and be guided by events Her curiosity and her self esteem had been alike gratified she had got the better of missus Ellmother at last and with that triumph she was content While Emily remained her friend it would be an act of useless cruelty to disclose the terrible truth There had certainly been a coolness between them at Brighton But Francine still influenced by the magnetic attraction which drew her to Emily did not conceal from herself that she had offered the provocation and had been therefore the person to blame I can set all that right she thought when we meet at Monksmoor Park She opened her desk and wrote the shortest and sweetest of letters to Cecilia I am entirely at the disposal of my charming friend on any convenient day may I add my dear the sooner the better CHAPTER XXXVII THE LADY WANTS YOU SIR The pupils of the drawing class put away their pencils and color boxes in high good humor the teacher s vigilant eye for faults had failed him for the first time in their experience Not one of them had been reproved they had chattered and giggled and drawn caricatures on the margin of the paper as freely as if the master had left the room Alban s wandering attention was indeed beyond the reach of control His interview with Francine had doubled his sense of responsibility toward Emily while he was further than ever from seeing how he could interfere to any useful purpose in his present position and with his reasons for writing under reserve One of the servants addressed him as he was leaving the schoolroom The landlady s boy was waiting in the hall with a message from his lodgings Now then what is it he asked irritably The lady wants you sir With this mysterious answer the boy presented a visiting card The name inscribed on it was Miss Jethro She had arrived by the train and she was then waiting at Alban s lodgings Say I will be with her directly Having given the message he stood for a while with his hat in his hand literally lost in astonishment It was simply impossible to guess at Miss Jethro s object and yet with the usual perversity of human nature he was still wondering what she could possibly want with him up to the final moment when he opened the door of his sitting room She rose and bowed with the same grace of movement and the same well bred composure of manner which Doctor Allday had noticed when she entered his consulting room Her dark melancholy eyes rested on Alban with a look of gentle interest A faint flush of color animated for a moment the faded beauty of her face passed away again and left it paler than before I cannot conceal from myself she began that I am intruding on you under embarrassing circumstances May I ask Miss Jethro to what circumstances you allude You forget mister Morris that I left Miss Ladd s school in a manner which justified doubt of me in the minds of strangers Speaking as one of those strangers Alban replied I cannot feel that I had any right to form an opinion on a matter which only concerned Miss Ladd and yourself Miss Jethro bowed gravely You encourage me to hope she said I think you will place a favorable construction on my visit when I mention my motive I ask you to receive me in the interests of Miss Emily Brown Stating her purpose in calling on him in those plain terms she added to the amazement which Alban already felt by handing to him as if she was presenting an introduction a letter marked Private addressed to her by Doctor Allday I may tell you she premised that I had no idea of troubling you until Doctor Allday suggested it I wrote to him in the first instance and there is his reply Pray read it The letter was dated Penzance and the doctor wrote as he spoke without ceremony MADAM Your letter has been forwarded to me I am spending my autumn holiday in the far West of Cornwall However if I had been at home it would have made no difference I should have begged leave to decline holding any further conversation with you on the subject of Miss Emily Brown for the following reasons In the first place though I cannot doubt your sincere interest in the young lady s welfare I don t like your mysterious way of showing it In the second place when I called at your address in London after you had left my house I found that you had taken to flight I place my own interpretation on this circumstance but as it is not founded on any knowledge of facts I merely allude to it and say no more Arrived at that point Alban offered to return the letter Do you really mean me to go on reading it he asked Yes she said quietly Alban returned to the letter In the third place I have good reason to believe that you entered Miss Ladd s school as a teacher under false pretenses After that discovery I tell you plainly I hesitate to attach credit to any statement that you may wish to make At the same time I must not permit my prejudices as you will probably call them to stand in the way of Miss Emily s interests supposing them to be really depending on any interference of yours Miss Ladd s drawing master mister Alban Morris is even more devoted to Miss Emily s service than I am Whatever you might have said to me you can say to him with this possible advantage that he may believe you There the letter ended Alban handed it back in silence Miss Jethro pointed to the words mister Alban Morris is even more devoted to Miss Emily s service than I am Is that true she asked Quite true I don t complain mister Morris of the hard things said of me in that letter you are at liberty to suppose if you like that I deserve them Attribute it to pride or attribute it to reluctance to make needless demands on your time I shall not attempt to defend myself I leave you to decide whether the woman who has shown you that letter having something important to say to you is a person who is mean enough to say it under false pretenses Tell me what I can do for you Miss Jethro and be assured beforehand that I don t doubt your sincerity My purpose in coming here she answered is to induce you to use your influence over Miss Emily Brown With what object Alban asked interrupting her My object is her own good Some years since I happened to become acquainted with a person who has attained some celebrity as a preacher You have perhaps heard of mister Miles Mirabel I have heard of him I have been in correspondence with him Miss Jethro proceeded He tells me he has been introduced to a young lady who was formerly one of Miss Ladd s pupils and who is the daughter of mister Wyvil of Monksmoor Park He has called on mister Wyvil and he has since received an invitation to stay at mister Wyvil s house The day fixed for the visit is Monday the fifth of next month Alban listened at a loss to know what interest he was supposed to have in being made acquainted with mister Mirabel s engagements Miss Jethro s next words enlightened him You are perhaps aware she resumed that Miss Emily Brown is Miss Wyvil s intimate friend She will be one of the guests at Monksmoor Park If there are any obstacles which you can place in her way if there is any influence which you can exert without exciting suspicion of your motive prevent her I entreat you from accepting Miss Wyvil s invitation until mister Mirabel s visit has come to an end Is there anything against mister Mirabel he asked I say nothing against him Is Miss Emily acquainted with him No Is he a person with whom it would be disagreeable to her to associate Quite the contrary And yet you expect me to prevent them from meeting Be reasonable Miss Jethro I can only be in earnest mister Morris more truly more deeply in earnest than you can suppose I declare to you that I am speaking in Miss Emily s interests Do you still refuse to exert yourself for her sake I am spared the pain of refusal Alban answered The time for interference has gone by She is at this moment on her way to Monksmoor Park Miss Jethro attempted to rise and dropped back into her chair Water she said faintly After drinking from the glass to the last drop she began to revive Her little traveling bag was on the floor at her side She took out a railway guide and tried to consult it Her fingers trembled incessantly she was unable to find the page to which she wished to refer Help me she said I must leave this place by the first train that passes To see Emily Alban asked Quite useless You have said it yourself the time for interference has gone by Look at the guide What place shall I look for Look for Vale Regis Alban found the place The train was due in ten minutes Surely you are not fit to travel so soon he suggested Fit or not I must see mister Mirabel I must make the effort to keep them apart by appealing to him With any hope of success With no hope and with no interest in the man himself Still I must try Out of anxiety for Emily s welfare Out of anxiety for more than that For what If you can t guess I daren t tell you That strange reply startled Alban Before he could ask what it meant Miss Jethro had left him In the emergencies of life a person readier of resource than Alban Morris it would not have been easy to discover The extraordinary interview that had now come to an end had found its limits Bewildered and helpless he stood at the window of his room and asked himself as if he had been the weakest man living What shall I do BOOK THE FOURTH THE COUNTRY HOUSE CHAPTER XXXVIII DANCING The windows of the long drawing room at Monksmoor are all thrown open to the conservatory Distant masses of plants and flowers mingled in ever varying forms of beauty are touched by the melancholy luster of the rising moon Nearer to the house the restful shadows are disturbed at intervals where streams of light fall over them aslant from the lamps in the room The fountain is playing In rivalry with its lighter music the nightingales are singing their song of ecstasy Sometimes the laughter of girls is heard and sometimes the melody of a waltz The younger guests at Monksmoor are dancing Emily and Cecilia are dressed alike in white with flowers in their hair Francine rivals them by means of a gorgeous contrast of color and declares that she is rich with the bright emphasis of diamonds and the soft persuasion of pearls Miss Plym from the rectory is fat and fair and prosperous she overflows with good spirits she has a waist which defies tight lacing and she dances joyously on large flat feet Miss Darnaway officer s daughter with small means is the exact opposite of Miss Plym She is thin and tall and faded poor soul Destiny has made it her hard lot in life to fill the place of head nursemaid at home In her pensive moments she thinks of the little brothers and sisters whose patient servant she is and wonders who comforts them in their tumbles and tells them stories at bedtime while she is holiday making at the pleasant country house Tender hearted Cecilia remembering how few pleasures this young friend has and knowing how well she dances never allows her to be without a partner There are three invaluable young gentlemen present who are excellent dancers Members of different families they are nevertheless fearfully and wonderfully like each other They present the same rosy complexions and straw colored mustachios the same plump cheeks vacant eyes and low forehead and they utter with the same stolid gravity the same imbecile small talk On sofas facing each other sit the two remaining guests who have not joined the elders at the card table in another room They are both men One of them is drowsy and middle aged happy in the possession of large landed property happier still in a capacity for drinking mister Wyvil s famous port wine without gouty results The other gentleman ah who is the other He is the confidential adviser and bosom friend of every young lady in the house Is it necessary to name the Reverend Miles Mirabel There he sits enthroned with room for a fair admirer on either side of him the clerical sultan of a platonic harem His persuasive ministry is felt as well as heard he has an innocent habit of fondling young persons One of his arms is even long enough to embrace the circumference of Miss Plym while the other clasps the rigid silken waist of Francine I do it everywhere else he says innocently why not here Why not indeed with that delicate complexion and those beautiful blue eyes with the glorious golden hair that rests on his shoulders and the glossy beard that flows over his breast Familiarities forbidden to mere men become privileges and condescensions when an angel enters society and more especially when that angel has enough of mortality in him to be amusing mister Mirabel on his social side is an irresistible companion He is cheerfulness itself he takes a favorable view of everything his sweet temper never differs with anybody In my humble way he confesses I like to make the world about me brighter Laughter harmlessly produced observe is the element in which he lives and breathes Miss Darnaway s serious face puts him out he has laid a bet with Emily not in money not even in gloves only in flowers that he will make Miss Darnaway laugh and he has won the wager Emily s flowers are in his button hole peeping through the curly interstices of his beard Must you leave me he asks tenderly when there is a dancing man at liberty and it is Francine s turn to claim him She leaves her seat not very willingly For a while the place is vacant Miss Plym seizes the opportunity of consulting the ladies bosom friend Dear mister Mirabel do tell me what you think of Miss de Sor Dear mister Mirabel bursts into enthusiasm and makes a charming reply His large experience of young ladies warns him that they will tell each other what he thinks of them when they retire for the night and he is careful on these occasions to say something that will bear repetition I see in Miss de Sor he declares the resolution of a man tempered by the sweetness of a woman When that interesting creature marries her husband will be shall I use the vulgar word henpecked Dear Miss Plym he will enjoy it and he will be quite right too and if I am asked to the wedding I shall say with heartfelt sincerity Enviable man In the height of her admiration for mister Mirabel s wonderful eye for character Miss Plym is called away to the piano Cecilia succeeds to her friend s place and has her waist taken in charge as a matter of course How do you like Miss Plym she asks directly mister Mirabel smiles and shows the prettiest little pearly teeth I was just thinking of her he confesses pleasantly Miss Plym is so nice and plump so comforting and domestic such a perfect clergyman s daughter You love her don t you Is she engaged to be married In that case between ourselves dear Miss Wyvil a clergyman is obliged to be cautious I may own that I love her too Delicious titillations of flattered self esteem betray themselves in Cecilia s lovely complexion She is the chosen confidante of this irresistible man and she would like to express her sense of obligation But mister Mirabel is a master in the art of putting the right words in the right places and simple Cecilia distrusts herself and her grammar At that moment of embarrassment a friend leaves the dance and helps Cecilia out of the difficulty Emily approaches the sofa throne breathless followed by her partner entreating her to give him one turn more She is not to be tempted she means to rest Cecilia sees an act of mercy suggested by the presence of the disengaged young man She seizes his arm and hurries him off to poor Miss Darnaway sitting forlorn in a corner and thinking of the nursery at home In the meanwhile a circumstance occurs mister Mirabel s all embracing arm shows itself in a new character when Emily sits by his side It becomes for the first time an irresolute arm It advances a little and hesitates Emily at once administers an unexpected check she insists on preserving a free waist in her own outspoken language No mister Mirabel keep that for the others You can t imagine how ridiculous you and the young ladies look and how absurdly unaware of it you all seem to be For the first time in his life the reverend and ready witted man of the world is at a loss for an answer Why For this simple reason He too has felt the magnetic attraction of the irresistible little creature whom every one likes Miss Jethro has been doubly defeated She has failed to keep them apart and her unexplained misgivings have not been justified by events Emily and mister Mirabel are good friends already The brilliant clergyman is poor his interests in life point to a marriage for money he has fascinated the heiresses of two rich fathers mister Tyvil and mister de Sor and yet he is conscious of an influence an alien influence without a balance at its bankers which has in some mysterious way got between him and his interests On Emily s side the attraction felt is of another nature altogether Among the merry young people at Monksmoor she is her old happy self again and she finds in mister Mirabel the most agreeable and amusing man whom she has ever met After those dismal night watches by the bed of her dying aunt and the dreary weeks of solitude that followed to live in this new world of luxury and gayety is like escaping from the darkness of night and basking in the fall brightn ess of day Cecilia declares that she looks once more like the joyous queen of the bedroom in the bygone time at school and Francine profaning Shakespeare without knowing it says Emily is herself again Now that your arm is in its right place reverend sir she gayly resumes I may admit that there are exceptions to all rules My waist is at your disposal in a case of necessity that is to say in a case of waltzing The one case of all others Mirabel answers with the engaging frankness that has won him so many friends which can never happen in my unhappy experience Waltzing I blush to own it means picking me up off the floor and putting smelling salts to my nostrils In other words dear Miss Emily it is the room that waltzes not I I can t look at those whirling couples there with a steady head Even the exquisite figure of our young hostess when it describes flying circles turns me giddy Hearing this allusion to Cecilia Emily drops to the level of the other girls She too pays her homage to the Pope of private life You promised me your unbiased opinion of Cecilia she reminds him and you haven t given it yet The ladies friend gently remonstrates Miss Wyvil s beauty dazzles me How can I give an unbiased opinion Besides I am not thinking of her I can only think of you Emily lifts her eyes half merrily half tenderly and looks at him over the top of her fan It is her first effort at flirtation She is tempted to engage in the most interesting of all games to a girl the game which plays at making love What has Cecilia told her in those bedroom gossipings dear to the hearts of the two friends Cecilia has whispered mister Mirabel admires your figure he calls you the Venus of Milo in a state of perfect abridgment Where is the daughter of Eve who would not have been flattered by that pretty compliment who would not have talked soft nonsense in return You can only think of Me Emily repeats coquettishly Have you said that to the last young lady who occupied my place and will you say it again to the next who follows me Not to one of them Mere compliments are for the others not for you What is for me mister Mirabel What I have just offered you a confession of the truth Emily is startled by the tone in which he replies He seems to be in earnest not a vestige is left of the easy gayety of his manner His face shows an expression of anxiety which she has never seen in it yet Do you believe me he asks in a whisper She tries to change the subject When am I to hear you preach mister Mirabel He persists When you believe me he says His eyes add an emphasis to that reply which is not to be mistaken Emily turns away from him and notices Francine She has left the dance and is looking with marked attention at Emily and Mirabel I want to speak to you she says and beckons impatiently to Emily Mirabel whispers Don t go Emily rises nevertheless ready to avail herself of the first excuse for leaving him Francine meets her half way and takes her roughly by the arm What is it Emily asks Suppose you leave off flirting with mister Mirabel and make yourself of some use In what way Use your ears and look at that girl She points disdainfully to innocent Miss Plym The rector s daughter possesses all the virtues with one exception the virtue of having an ear for music When she sings she is out of tune and when she plays she murders time Who can dance to such music as that says Francine Finish the waltz for her Emily naturally hesitates How can I take her place unless she asks me Francine laughs scornfully Say at once you want to go back to mister Mirabel Do you think I should have got up when you beckoned to me Emily rejoins if I had not wanted to get away from mister Mirabel Instead of resenting this sharp retort Francine suddenly breaks into good humor Come along you little spit fire I ll manage it for you She leads Emily to the piano and stops Miss Plym without a word of apology It s your turn to dance now Here s Miss Brown waiting to relieve you Cecilia has not been unobservant in her own quiet way of what has been going on Waiting until Francine and Miss Plym are out of hearing she bends over Emily and says My dear I really do think Francine is in love with mister Mirabel After having only been a week in the same house with him Emily exclaims At any rate said Cecilia more smartly than usual she is jealous of you CHAPTER XXXIX FEIGNING The next morning mister Mirabel took two members of the circle at Monksmoor by surprise One of them was Emily and one of them was the master of the house Seeing Emily alone in the garden before breakfast he left his room and joined her Let me say one word he pleaded before we go to breakfast I am grieved to think that I was so unfortunate as to offend you last night Emily s look of astonishment answered for her before she could speak What can I have said or done she asked to make you think that Now I breathe again he cried with the boyish gayety of manner which was one of the secrets of his popularity among women I really feared that I had spoken thoughtlessly It is a terrible confession for a clergyman to make but it is not the less true that I am one of the most indiscreet men living It is my rock ahead in life that I say the first thing which comes uppermost without stopping to think Being well aware of my own defects I naturally distrust myself Even in the pulpit Emily inquired He laughed with the readiest appreciation of the satire although it was directed against himself I like that question he said it tells me we are as good friends again as ever The fact is the sight of the congregation when I get into the pulpit has the same effect upon me that the sight of the footlights has on an actor All oratory though my clerical brethren are shy of confessing it is acting without the scenery and the costumes Did you really mean it last night when you said you would like to hear me preach Indeed I did How very kind of you I don t think myself the sermon is worth the sacrifice There is another specimen of my indiscreet way of talking What I mean is that you will have to get up early on Sunday morning and drive twelve miles to the damp and dismal little village in which I officiate for a man with a rich wife who likes the climate of Italy My congregation works in the fields all the week and naturally enough goes to sleep in church on Sunday I have had to counteract that Not by preaching I wouldn t puzzle the poor people with my eloquence for the world No no I tell them little stories out of the Bible in a nice easy gossiping way A quarter of an hour is my limit of time and I am proud to say some of them mostly the women do to a certain extent keep awake If you and the other ladies decide to honor me it is needless to say you shall have one of my grand efforts What will be the effect on my unfortunate flock remains to be seen I will have the church brushed up and luncheon of course at the parsonage Beans bacon and beer I haven t got anything else in the house Are you rich I hope not I suspect I am quite as poor as you are mister Mirabel I am delighted to hear it More of my indiscretion Our poverty is another bond between us Before he could enlarge on this text the breakfast bell rang He gave Emily his arm quite satisfied with the result of the morning s talk In speaking seriously to her on the previous night he had committed the mistake of speaking too soon To amend this false step and to recover his position in Emily s estimation had been his object in view and it had been successfully accomplished At the breakfast table that morning the companionable clergyman was more amusing than ever The meal being over the company dispersed as usual with the one exception of Mirabel Without any apparent reason he kept his place at the table mister Wyvil the most courteous and considerate of men felt it an attention due to his guest not to leave the room first All that he could venture to do was to give a little hint Have you any plans for the morning he asked I have a plan that depends entirely on yourself Mirabel answered and I am afraid of being as indiscreet as usual if I mention it Your charming daughter tells me you play on the violin Modest mister Wyvil looked confused I hope you have not been annoyed he said I practice in a distant room so that nobody may hear me My dear sir I am eager to hear you Music is my passion and the violin is my favorite instrument mister Wyvil led the way to his room positively blushing with pleasure Since the death of his wife he had been sadly in want of a little encouragement His daughters and his friends were careful over careful as he thought of intruding on him in his hours of practice And sad to say his daughters and his friends were from a musical point of view perfectly right Literature has hardly paid sufficient attention to a social phenomenon of a singularly perplexing kind We hear enough and more than enough of persons who successfully cultivate the Arts of the remarkable manner in which fitness for their vocation shows itself in early life of the obstacles which family prejudice places in their way and of the unremitting devotion which has led to the achievement of glorious results But how many writers have noticed those other incomprehensible persons members of families innocent for generations past of practicing Art or caring for Art who have notwithstanding displayed from their earliest years the irresistible desire to cultivate poetry painting or music who have surmounted obstacles and endured disappointments in the single hearted resolution to devote their lives to an intellectual pursuit being absolutely without the capacity which proves the vocation and justifies the sacrifice Here is Nature unerring Nature presented in flat contradiction with herself Here are men bent on performing feats of running without having legs and women hopelessly barren living in constant expectation of large families to the end of their days The musician is not to be found more completely deprived than mister Wyvil of natural capacity for playing on an instrument and for twenty years past it had been the pride and delight of his heart to let no day of his life go by without practicing on the violin I am sure I must be tiring you he said politely after having played without mercy for an hour and more No the insatiable amateur had his own purpose to gain and was not exhausted yet mister Wyvil got up to look for some more music In that interval desultory conversation naturally took place Mirabel contrived to give it the necessary direction the direction of Emily The most delightful girl I have met with for many a long year past mister Wyvil declared warmly I don t wonder at my daughter being so fond of her She leads a solitary life at home poor thing and I am honestly glad to see her spirits reviving in my house An only child Mirabel asked In the necessary explanation that followed Emily s isolated position in the world was revealed in few words But one more discovery the most important of all remained to be made Had she used a figure of speech in saying that she was as poor as Mirabel himself or had she told him the shocking truth He put the question with perfect delicacy but with unerring directness as well mister Wyvil quoting his daughter s authority described Emily s income as falling short even of two hundred a year Having made that disheartening reply he opened another music book You know this sonata of course he said The next moment the violin was under his chin and the performance began While Mirabel was to all appearance listening with the utmost attention he was actually endeavoring to reconcile himself to a serious sacrifice of his own inclinations If he remained much longer in the same house with Emily the impression that she had produced on him would be certainly strengthened and he would be guilty of the folly of making an offer of marriage to a woman who was as poor as himself The one remedy that could be trusted to preserve him from such infatuation as this was absence At the end of the week he had arranged to return to Vale Regis for his Sunday duty engaging to join his friends again at Monksmoor on the Monday following That rash promise there could be no further doubt about it must not be fulfilled He had arrived at this resolution when the terrible activity of mister Wyvil s bow was suspended by the appearance of a third person in the room Cecilia s maid was charged with a neat little three cornered note from her young lady to be presented to her master Wondering why his daughter should write to him mister Wyvil opened the note and was informed of Cecilia s motive in these words DEAREST PAPA I hear mister Mirabel is with you and as this is a secret I must write Emily has received a very strange letter this morning which puzzles her and alarms me When you are quite at liberty we shall be so much obliged if you will tell us how Emily ought to answer it mister Wyvil stopped Mirabel on the point of trying to escape from the music A little domestic matter to attend to he said But we will finish the sonata first CHAPTER XL CONSULTING Out of the music room and away from his violin the sound side of mister Wyvil s character was free to assert itself In his public and in his private capacity he was an eminently sensible man As a member of parliament he set an example which might have been followed with advantage by many of his colleagues In the first place he abstained from hastening the downfall of representative institutions by asking questions and making speeches In the second place he was able to distinguish between the duty that he owed to his party and the duty that he owed to his country When the Legislature acted politically that is to say when it dealt with foreign complications or electoral reforms he followed his leader When the Legislature acted socially that is to say for the good of the people he followed his conscience On the last occasion when the great Russian bugbear provoked a division he voted submissively with his Conservative allies But when the question of opening museums and picture galleries on Sundays arrayed the two parties in hostile camps he broke into open mutiny and went over to the Liberals He consented to help in preventing an extension of the franchise but he refused to be concerned in obstructing the repeal of taxes on knowledge I am doubtful in the first case he said but I am sure in the second He was asked for an explanation Doubtful of what and sure of what To the astonishment of his leader he answered The benefit to the people The same sound sense appeared in the transactions of his private life Lazy and dishonest servants found that the gentlest of masters had a side to his character which took them by surprise And on certain occasions in the experience of Cecilia and her sister the most indulgent of fathers proved to be as capable of saying No as the sternest tyrant who ever ruled a fireside Called into council by his daughter and his guest mister Wyvil assisted them by advice which was equally wise and kind but which afterward proved under the perverse influence of circumstances to be advice that he had better not have given The letter to Emily which Cecilia had recommended to her father s consideration had come from Netherwoods and had been written by Alban Morris He assured Emily that he had only decided on writing to her after some hesitation in the hope of serving interests which he did not himself understand but which might prove to be interests worthy of consideration nevertheless Having stated his motive in these terms he proceeded to relate what had passed between Miss Jethro and himself On the subject of Francine Alban only ventured to add that she had not produced a favorable impression on him and that he could not think her likely on further experience to prove a desirable friend On the last leaf were added some lines which Emily was at no loss how to answer She had folded back the page so that no eyes but her own should see how the poor drawing master finished his letter I wish you all possible happiness my dear among your new friends but don t forget the old friend who thinks of you and dreams of you and longs to see you again The little world I live in is a dreary world Emily in your absence Will you write to me now and then and encourage me to hope mister Wyvil smiled as he looked at the folded page which hid the signature I suppose I may take it for granted he said slyly that this gentleman really has your interests at heart May I know who he is Emily answered the last question readily enough mister Wyvil went on with his inquiries About the mysterious lady with the strange name he proceeded do you know anything of her Emily related what she knew without revealing the true reason for Miss Jethro s departure from Netherwoods In after years it was one of her most treasured remembrances that she had kept secret the melancholy confession which had startled her on the last night of her life at school mister Wyvil looked at Alban s letter again Do you know how Miss Jethro became acquainted with mister Mirabel he asked I didn t even know that they were acquainted Do you think it likely if mister Morris had been talking to you instead of writing to you that he might have said more than he has said in his letter Cecilia had hitherto remained a model of discretion Seeing Emily hesitate temptation overcame her Not a doubt of it papa she declared confidently Is Cecilia right mister Wyvil inquired Reminded in this way of her influence over Alban Emily could only make one honest reply She admitted that Cecilia was right mister Wyvil thereupon advised her not to express any opinion until she was in a better position to judge for herself When you write to mister Morris he continued say that you will wait to tell him what you think of Miss Jethro until you see him again I have no prospect at present of seeing him again Emily said You can see mister Morris whenever it suits him to come here mister Wyvil replied I will write and ask him to visit us and you can inclose the invitation in your letter Oh mister Wyvil how good of you Oh papa the very thing I was going to ask you to do The excellent master of Monksmoor looked unaffectedly surprised What are you two young ladies making a fuss about he said mister Morris is a gentleman by profession and may I venture to say it Miss Emily a valued friend of yours as well Who has a better claim to be one of my guests Cecilia stopped her father as he was about to leave the room I suppose we mustn t ask mister Mirabel what he knows of Miss Jethro she said My dear what can you be thinking of What right have we to question mister Mirabel about Miss Jethro It s so very unsatisfactory papa There must be some reason why Emily and mister Mirabel ought not to meet or why should Miss Jethro have been so very earnest about it Miss Jethro doesn t intend us to know why Cecilia It will perhaps come out in time Wait for time Left together the girls discussed the course which Alban would probably take on receiving mister Wyvil s invitation He will only be too glad Cecilia asserted to have the opportunity of seeing you again I doubt whether he will care about seeing me again among strangers Emily replied And you forget that there are obstacles in his way How is he to leave his class Quite easily His class doesn t meet on the Saturday half holiday He can be here if he starts early in time for luncheon and he can stay till Monday or Tuesday Who is to take his place at the school Miss Ladd to be sure if you make a point of it Write to her as well as to mister Morris The letters being written and the order having been given to prepare a room for the expected guest Emily and Cecilia returned to the drawing room They found the elders of the party variously engaged the men with newspapers and the ladies with work Entering the conservatory next they discovered Cecilia s sister languishing among the flowers in an easy chair Constitutional laziness in some young ladies assumes an invalid character and presents the interesting spectacle of perpetual convalescence The doctor declared that the baths at saint Moritz had cured Miss Julia Miss Julia declined to agree with the doctor Come into the garden with Emily and me Cecilia said Emily and you don t know what it is to be ill Julia answered The two girls left her and joined the young people who were amusing themselves in the garden Francine had taken possession of Mirabel and had condemned him to hard labor in swinging her He made an attempt to get away when Emily and Cecilia approached and was peremptorily recalled to his duty Higher cried Miss de Sor in her hardest tones of authority I want to swing higher than anybody else Mirabel submitted with gentleman like resignation and was rewarded by tender encouragement expressed in a look Do you see that Cecilia whispered He knows how rich she is I wonder whether he will marry her Emily smiled I doubt it while he is in this house she said You are as rich as Francine and don t forget that you have other attractions as well Cecilia shook her head mister Mirabel is very nice she admitted but I wouldn t marry him Would you Emily secretly compared Alban with Mirabel Not for the world she answered The next day was the day of Mirabel s departure His admirers among the ladies followed him out to the door at which mister Wyvil s carriage was waiting Francine threw a nosegay after the departing guest as he got in Mind you come back to us on Monday she said Mirabel bowed and thanked her but his last look was for Emily standing apart from the others at the top of the steps Francine said nothing her lips closed convulsively she turned suddenly pale CHAPTER XLI SPEECHIFYING On the Monday a plowboy from Vale Regis arrived at Monksmoor In respect of himself he was a person beneath notice In respect of his errand he was sufficiently important to cast a gloom over the household The faithless Mirabel had broken his engagement and the plowboy was the herald of misfortune who brought his apology To his great disappointment he wrote he was detained by the affairs of his parish He could only trust to mister Wyvil s indulgence to excuse him and to communicate his sincere sense of regret on scented note paper to the ladies Everybody believed in the affairs of the parish with the exception of Francine mister Mirabel has made the best excuse he could think of for shortening his visit and I don t wonder at it she said looking significantly at Emily Emily was playing with one of the dogs exercising him in the tricks which he had learned She balanced a morsel of sugar on his nose and had no attention to spare for Francine Cecilia as the mistress of the house felt it her duty to interfere That is a strange remark to make she answered Do you mean to say that we have driven mister Mirabel away from us I accuse nobody Francine began with spiteful candor Now she s going to accuse everybody Emily interposed addressing herself facetiously to the dog But when girls are bent on fascinating men whether they like it or not Francine proceeded men have only one alternative they must keep out of the way She looked again at Emily more pointedly than ever Even gentle Cecilia resented this Whom do you refer to she said sharply My dear Emily remonstrated need you ask She glanced at Francine as she spoke and then gave the dog his signal He tossed up the sugar and caught it in his mouth His audience applauded him and so for that time the skirmish ended Among the letters of the next morning s delivery arrived Alban s reply Emily s anticipations proved to be correct The drawing master s du ties would not permit him to leave Netherwoods and he like Mirabel sent his apologies His short letter to Emily contained no further allusion to Miss Jethro it began and ended on the first page Had he been disappointed by the tone of reserve in which Emily had written to him under mister Wyvil s advice Or as Cecilia suggested had his detention at the school so bitterly disappointed him that he was too disheartened to write at any length Emily made no attempt to arrive at a conclusion either one way or the other She seemed to be in depressed spirits and she spoke superstitiously for the first time in Cecilia s experience of her I don t like this reappearance of Miss Jethro she said If the mystery about that woman is ever cleared up it will bring trouble and sorrow to me and I believe in his own secret heart Alban Morris thinks so too Write and ask him Cecilia suggested He is so kind and so unwilling to distress me Emily answered that he wouldn t acknowledge it even if I am right In the middle of the week the course of private life at Monksmoor suffered an interruption due to the parliamentary position of the master of the house The insatiable appetite for making and hearing speeches which represents one of the marked peculiarities of the English race including their cousins in the United States had seized on mister Wyvil s constituents There was to be a political meeting at the market hall in the neighboring town and the member was expected to make an oration passing in review contemporary events at home and abroad Pray don t think of accompanying me the good man said to his guests The hall is badly ventilated and the speeches including my own will not be worth hearing This humane warning was ungratefully disregarded The gentlemen were all interested in the objects of the meeting and the ladies were firm in the resolution not to be left at home by themselves They dressed with a view to the large assembly of spectators before whom they were about to appear and they outtalked the men on political subjects all the way to the town The most delightful of surprises was in store for them when they reached the market hall Among the crowd of ordinary gentlemen waiting under the portico until the proceedings began appeared one person of distinction whose title was Reverend and whose name was Mirabel Francine was the first to discover him She darted up the steps and held out her hand This is a pleasure she cried Have you come here to see she was about to say Me but observing the strangers round her altered the word to Us Please give me your arm she whispered before her young friends had arrived within hearing I am so frightened in a crowd She held fast by Mirabel and kept a jealous watch on him Was it only her fancy or did she detect a new charm in his smile when he spoke to Emily Before it was possible to decide the time for the meeting had arrived mister Wyvil s friends were of course accommodated with seats on the platform Francine still insisting on her claim to Mirabel s arm got a chair next to him As she seated herself she left him free for a moment In that moment the infatuated man took an empty chair on the other side of him and placed it for Emily He communicated to that hated rival the information which he ought to have reserved for Francine The committee insist he said on my proposing one of the Resolutions I promise not to bore you mine shall be the shortest speech delivered at the meeting The proceedings began Among the earlier speakers not one was inspired by a feeling of mercy for the audience The chairman reveled in words The mover and seconder of the first Resolution not having so much as the ghost of an idea to trouble either of them poured out language in flowing and overflowing streams like water from a perpetual spring The heat exhaled by the crowded audience was already becoming insufferable Cries of Sit down assailed the orator of the moment The chairman was obliged to interfere A man at the back of the hall roared out Ventilation and broke a window with his stick He was rewarded with three rounds of cheers and was ironically invited to mount the platform and take the chair Under these embarrassing circumstances Mirabel rose to speak He secured silence at the outset by a humorous allusion to the prolix speaker who had preceded him Look at the clock gentlemen he said and limit my speech to an interval of ten minutes The applause which followed was heard through the broken window in the street The boys among the mob outside intercepted the flow of air by climbing on each other s shoulders and looking in at the meeting through the gaps left by the shattered glass Having proposed his Resolution with discreet brevity of speech Mirabel courted popularity on the plan adopted by the late Lord Palmerston in the House of Commons he told stories and made jokes adapted to the intelligence of the dullest people who were listening to him The charm of his voice and manner completed his success Punctually at the tenth minute he sat down amid cries of Go on Francine was the first to take his hand and to express admiration mutely by pressing it He returned the pressure but he looked at the wrong lady the lady on the other side Although she made no complaint he instantly saw that Emily was overcome by the heat Her lips were white and her eyes were closing Let me take you out he said or you will faint Francine started to her feet to follow them The lower order of the audience eager for amusement put their own humorous construction on the young lady s action They roared with laughter Let the parson and his sweetheart be they called out two s company miss and three isn t mister Wyvil interposed his authority and rebuked them A lady seated behind Francine interfered to good purpose by giving her a chair which placed her out of sight of the audience Order was restored and the proceedings were resumed On the conclusion of the meeting Mirabel and Emily were found waiting for their friends at the door mister Wyvil innocently added fuel to the fire that was burning in Francine He insisted that Mirabel should return to Monksmoor and offered him a seat in the carriage at Emily s side Later in the evening when they all met at dinner there appeared a change in Miss de Sor which surprised everybody but Mirabel She was gay and good humored and especially amiable and attentive to Emily who sat opposite to her at the table What did you and mister Mirabel talk about while you were away from us she asked innocently Politics Emily readily adopted Francine s friendly tone Would you have talked politics in my place she asked gayly In your place I should have had the most delightful of companions Francine rejoined I wish I had been overcome by the heat too Mirabel attentively observing her acknowledged the compliment by a bow and left Emily to continue the conversation In perfect good faith she owned to having led Mirabel to talk of himself She had heard from Cecilia that his early life had been devoted to various occupations and she was interested in knowing how circumstances had led him into devoting himself to the Church Francine listened with the outward appearance of implicit belief and with the inward conviction that Emily was deliberately deceiving her When the little narrative was at an end she was more agreeable than ever She admired Emily s dress and she rivaled Cecilia in enjoyment of the good things on the table she entertained Mirabel with humorous anecdotes of the priests at saint Domingo and was so interested in the manufacture of violins ancient and modern that mister Wyvil promised to show her his famous collection of instruments after dinner Her overflowing amiability included even poor Miss Darnaway and the absent brothers and sisters She heard with flattering sympathy how they had been ill and had got well again what amusing tricks they played what alarming accidents happened to them and how remarkably clever they were including I do assure you dear Miss de Sor the baby only ten months old When the ladies rose to retire Francine was socially speaking the heroine of the evening While the violins were in course of exhibition Mirabel found an opportunity of speaking to Emily unobserved Have you said or done anything to offend Miss de Sor he asked Nothing whatever Emily declared startled by the question What makes you think I have offended her I have been trying to find a reason for the change in her Mirabel answered especially the change toward yourself Well Well she means mischief Mischief of what sort Of a sort which may expose her to discovery unless she disarms suspicion at the outset That is as I believe exactly what she has been doing this evening I needn t warn you to be on your guard All the next day Emily was on the watch for events and nothing happened Not the slightest appearance of jealousy betrayed itself in Francine She made no attempt to attract to herself the attentions of Mirabel and she showed no hostility to Emily either by word look or manner The day after an event occurred at Netherwoods Alban Morris received an anonymous letter addressed to him in these terms A certain young lady in whom you are supposed to be interested is forgetting you in your absence If you are not mean enough to allow yourself to be supplanted by another man join the party at Monksmoor before it is too late CHAPTER XLII COOKING The day after the political meeting was a day of departures at the pleasant country house Miss Darnaway was recalled to the nursery at home The old squire who did justice to mister Wyvil s port wine went away next having guests to entertain at his own house A far more serious loss followed The three dancing men had engagements which drew them to new spheres of activity in other drawing rooms They said with the same dreary grace of manner Very sorry to go they drove to the railway arrayed in the same perfect traveling suits of neutral tint and they had but one difference of opinion among them each firmly believed that he was smoking the best cigar to be got in London The morning after these departures would have been a dull morning indeed but for the presence of Mirabel When breakfast was over the invalid Miss Julia established herself on the sofa with a novel Her father retired to the other end of the house and profaned the art of music on music s most expressive instrument Left with Emily Cecilia and Francine Mirabel made one of his happy suggestions We are thrown on our own resources he said Let us distinguish ourselves by inventing some entirely new amusement for the day You young ladies shall sit in council and I will be secretary He turned to Cecilia The meeting waits to hear the mistress of the house Modest Cecilia appealed to her school friends for help addressing herself in the first instance by the secretary s advice to Francine as the eldest They all noticed another change in this variable young person She was silent and subdued and she said wearily I don t care what we do shall we go out riding The unanswerable objection to riding as a form of amusement was that it had been more than once tried already Something clever and surprising was anticipated from Emily when it came to her turn She too disappointed expectation Let us sit under the trees was all that she could suggest and ask mister Mirabel to tell us a story Mirabel laid down his pen and took it on himself to reject this proposal Remember he remonstrated that I have an interest in the diversions of the day You can t expect me to be amused by my own story I appeal to Miss Wyvil to invent a pleasure which will include the secretary Cecilia blushed and looked uneasy I think I have got an idea she announced after some hesitation May I propose that we all go to the keeper s lodge There her courage failed her and she hesitated again Mirabel gravely registered the proposal as far as it went What are we to do when we get to the keeper s lodge he inquired We are to ask the keeper s wife Cecilia proceeded to lend us her kitchen To lend us her kitchen Mirabel repeated And what are we to do in the kitchen Cecilia looked down at her pretty hands crossed on her lap and answered softly Cook our own luncheon Here was an entirely new amusement in the most attractive sense of the words Here was charming Cecilia s interest in the pleasures of the table so happily inspired that the grateful meeting offered its tribute of applause even including Francine The members of the council were young their daring digestions contemplated without fear the prospect of eating their own amateur cookery The one question that troubled them now was what they were to cook I can make an omelet Cecilia ventured to say If there is any cold chicken to be had Emily added I undertake to follow the omelet with a mayonnaise There are clergymen in the Church of England who are even clever enough to fry potatoes Mirabel announced and I am one of them What shall we have next A pudding Miss de Sor can you make a pudding Francine exhibited another new side to her character a diffident and humble side I am ashamed to say I don t know how to cook anything she confessed you had better leave me out of it But Cecilia was now in her element Her plan of operations was wide enough even to include Francine You shall wash the lettuce my dear and stone the olives for Emily s mayonnaise Don t be discouraged You shall have a companion we will send to the rectory for Miss Plym the very person to chop parsley and shallot for my omelet Oh Emily what a morning we are going to have Her lovely blue eyes sparkled with joy she gave Emily a kiss which Mirabel must have been more or less than man not to have coveted I declare cried Cecilia completely losing her head I m so excited I don t know what to do with myself Emily s intimate knowledge of her friend applied the right remedy You don t know what to do with yourself she repeated Have you no sense of duty Give the cook your orders Cecilia instantly recovered her presence of mind She sat down at the writing table and made out a list of eatable productions in the animal and vegetable world in which every other word was underlined two or three times over Her serious face was a sight to see when she rang for the cook and the two held a privy council in a corner On the way to the keeper s lodge the young mistress of the house headed a procession of servants carrying the raw materials Francine followed held in custody by Miss Plym who took her responsibilities seriously and clamored for instruction in the art of chopping parsley Mirabel and Emily were together far behind they were the only two members of the company whose minds were not occupied in one way or another by the kitchen This child s play of ours doesn t seem to interest you Mirabel remarked I am thinking Emily answered of what you said to me about Francine I can say something more he rejoined When I noticed the change in her at dinner I told you she meant mischief There is another change to day which suggests to my mind that the mischief is done And directed against me Emily asked Mirabel made no direct reply It was impossible for him to remind her that she had no matter how innocently exposed herself to the jealous hatred of Francine Time will tell us what we don t know now he replied evasively You seem to have faith in time mister Mirabel The greatest faith Time is the inveterate enemy of deceit Sooner or later every hidden thing is a thing doomed to discovery Without exception Yes he answered positively without exception At that moment Francine stopped and looked back at them Did she think that Emily and Mirabel had been talking together long enough Miss Plym with the parsley still on her mind advanced to consult Emil y s experience The two walked on together leaving Mirabel to overtake Francine He saw in her first look at him the effort that it cost her to suppress those emotions which the pride of women is most deeply interested in concealing Before a word had passed he regretted that Emily had left them together I wish I had your cheerful disposition she began abruptly I am out of spirits or out of temper I don t know which and I don t know why Do you ever trouble yourself with thinking of the future As seldom as possible Miss de Sor In such a situation as mine most people have prospects I have none He spoke gravely conscious of not feeling at ease on his side If he had been the most modest man that ever lived he must have seen in Francine s face that she loved him When they had first been presented to each other she was still under the influence of the meanest instincts in her scheming and selfish nature She had thought to herself With my money to help him that man s celebrity would do the rest the best society in England would be glad to receive Mirabel s wife As the days passed strong feeling had taken the place of those contemptible aspirations Mirabel had unconsciously inspired the one passion which was powerful enough to master Francine sensual passion Wild hopes rioted in her Measureless desires which she had never felt before united themselves with capacities for wickedness which had been the horrid growth of a few nights capacities which suggested even viler attempts to rid herself of a supposed rivalry than slandering Emily by means of an anonymous letter Without waiting for it to be offered she took Mirabel s arm and pressed it to her breast as they slowly walked on The fear of discovery which had troubled her after she had sent her base letter to the post vanished at that inspiriting moment She bent her head near enough to him when he spoke to feel his breath on her face There is a strange similarity she said softly between your position and mine Is there anything cheering in my prospects I am far away from home my father and mother wouldn t care if they never saw me again People talk about my money What is the use of money to such a lonely wretch as I am Suppose I write to London and ask the lawyer if I may give it all away to some deserving person Why not to you My dear Miss de Sor Is there anything wrong mister Mirabel in wishing that I could make you a prosperous man You must not even talk of such a thing How proud you are she said submissively Oh I can t bear to think of you in that miserable village a position so unworthy of your talents and your claims And you tell me I must not talk about it Would you have said that to Emily if she was as anxious as I am to see you in your right place in the world I should have answered her exactly as I have answered you She will never embarrass you mister Mirabel by being as sincere as I am Emily can keep her own secrets Is she to blame for doing that It depends on your feeling for her What feeling do you mean Suppose you heard she was engaged to be married Francine suggested Mirabel s manner studiously cold and formal thus far altered on a sudden He looked with unconcealed anxiety at Francine Do you say that seriously he asked I said suppose I don t exactly know that she is engaged What do you know Oh how interested you are in Emily She is admired by some people Are you one of them Mirabel s experience of women warned him to try silence as a means of provoking her into speaking plainly The experiment succeeded Francine returned to the question that he had put to her and abruptly answered it You may believe me or not as you like I know of a man who is in love with her He has had his opportunities and he has made good use of them Would you like to know who he is I should like to know anything which you may wish to tell me He did his best to make the reply in a tone of commonplace politeness and he might have succeeded in deceiving a man The woman s quicker ear told her that he was angry Francine took the full advantage of that change in her favor I am afraid your good opinion of Emily will be shaken she quietly resumed when I tell you that she has encouraged a man who is only drawing master at a school At the same time a person in her circumstances I mean she has no money ought not to be very hard to please Of course she has never spoken to you of mister Alban Morris Not that I remember Only four words but they satisfied Francine The one thing wanting to complete the obstacle which she had now placed in Emily s way was that Alban Morris should enter on the scene He might hesitate but if he was really fond of Emily the anonymous letter would sooner or later bring him to Monksmoor In the meantime her object was gained She dropped Mirabel s arm Here is the lodge she said gayly I declare Cecilia has got an apron on already Come and cook CHAPTER XLIII SOUNDING Mirabel left Francine to enter the lodge by herself His mind was disturbed he felt the importance of gaining time for reflection before he and Emily met again The keeper s garden was at the back of the lodge Passing through the wicket gate he found a little summer house at a turn in the path Nobody was there he went in and sat down At intervals he had even yet encouraged himself to underrate the true importance of the feeling which Emily had awakened in him There was an end to all self deception now After what Francine had said to him this shallow and frivolous man no longer resisted the all absorbing influence of love He shrank under the one terrible question that forced itself on his mind Had that jealous girl spoken the truth In what process of investigation could he trust to set this anxiety at rest To apply openly to Emily would be to take a liberty which Emily was the last person in the world to permit In his recent intercourse with her he had felt more strongly than ever the importance of speaking with reserve He had been scrupulously careful to take no unfair advantage of his opportunity when he had removed her from the meeting and when they had walked together with hardly a creature to observe them in the lonely outskirts of the town Emily s gaiety and good humor had not led him astray he knew that these were bad signs viewed in the interests of love His one hope of touching her deeper sympathies was to wait for the help that might yet come from time and chance With a bitter sigh he resigned himself to the necessity of being as agreeable and amusing as ever it was just possible that he might lure her into alluding to Alban Morris if he began innocently by making her laugh As he rose to return to the lodge the keeper s little terrier prowling about the garden looked into the summer house Seeing a stranger the dog showed his teeth and growled Mirabel shrank back against the wall behind him trembling in every limb His eyes stared in terror as the dog came nearer barking in high triumph over the discovery of a frightened man whom he could bully Mirabel called out for help A laborer at work in the garden ran to the place and stopped with a broad grin of amusement at seeing a grown man terrified by a barking dog Well he said to himself after Mirabel had passed out under protection there goes a coward if ever there was one yet Mirabel waited a minute behind the lodge to recover himself He had been so completely unnerved that his hair was wet with perspiration While he used his handkerchief he shuddered at other recollections than the recollection of the dog After that night at the inn he thought the least thing frightens me He was received by the young ladies with cries of derisive welcome Oh for shame for shame here are the potatoes already cut and nobody to fry them Mirabel assumed the mask of cheerfulness with the desperate resolution of an actor amusing his audience at a time of domestic distress He astonished the keeper s wife by showing that he really knew how to use her frying pan Cecilia s omelet was tough but the young ladies ate it Emily s mayonnaise sauce was almost as liquid as water they swallowed it nevertheless by the help of spoons The potatoes followed crisp and dry and delicious and Mirabel became more popular than ever He is the only one of us Cecilia sadly acknowledged who knows how to cook When they all left the lodge for a stroll in the park Francine attached herself to Cecilia and Miss Plym She resigned Mirabel to Emily in the happy belief that she had paved the way for a misunderstanding between them The merriment at the luncheon table had revived Emily s good spirits She had a light hearted remembrance of the failure of her sauce Mirabel saw her smiling to herself May I ask what amuses you he said I was thinking of the debt of gratitude that we owe to mister Wyvil she replied If he had not persuaded you to return to Monksmoor we should never have seen the famous mister Mirabel with a frying pan in his hand and never have tasted the only good dish at our luncheon Mirabel tried vainly to adopt his companion s easy tone Now that he was alone with her the doubts that Francine had aroused shook the prudent resolution at which he had arrived in the garden He ran the risk and told Emily plainly why he had returned to mister Wyvil s house Although I am sensible of our host s kindness he answered I should have gone back to my parsonage but for You She declined to understand him seriously Then the affairs of your parish are neglected and I am to blame she said Am I the first man who has neglected his duties for your sake he asked I wonder whether the masters at school had the heart to report you when you neglected your lessons She thought of Alban and betrayed herself by a heightened color The moment after she changed the subject Mirabel could no longer resist the conclusion that Francine had told him the truth When do you leave us she inquired To morrow is Saturday I must go back as usual And how will your deserted parish receive you He made a desperate effort to be as amusing as usual I am sure of preserving my popularity he said while I have a cask in the cellar and a few spare sixpences in my pocket The public spirit of my parishioners asks for nothing but money and beer Before I went to that wearisome meeting I told my housekeeper that I was going to make a speech about reform She didn t know what I meant I explained that reform might increase the number of British citizens who had the right of voting at elections for parliament She brightened up directly Ah she said I ve heard my husband talk about elections The more there are of them he says the more money he ll get for his vote I m all for reform On my way out of the house I tried the man who works in my garden on the same subject He didn t look at the matter from the housekeeper s sanguine point of view I don t deny that parliament once gave me a good dinner for nothing at the public house he admitted But that was years ago and you ll excuse me sir I hear nothing of another dinner to come It s a matter of opinion of course I don t myself believe in reform There are specimens of the state of public spirit in our village He paused Emily was listening but he had not succeeded in choosing a subject that amused her He tried a topic more nearly connected with his own interests the topic of the future Our good friend has asked me to prolong my visit after Sunday s duties are over he said I hope I shall find you here next week Will the affairs of your parish allow you to come back Emily asked mischievously The affairs of my parish if you force me to confess it were only an excuse An excuse for what An excuse for keeping away from Monksmoor in the interests of my own tranquillity The experiment has failed While you are here I can t keep away She still declined to understand him seriously Must I tell you in plain words that flattery is thrown away on me she said Flattery is not offered to you he answered gravely I beg your pardon for having led to the mistake by talking of myself Having appealed to her indulgence by that act of submission he ventured on another distant allusion to the man whom he hated and feared Shall I meet any friends of yours he resumed when I return on Monday What do you mean I only meant to ask if mister Wyvil expects any new guests As he put the question Cecilia s voice was heard behind them calling to Emily They both turned round mister Wyvil had joined his daughter and her two friends He advanced to meet Emily I have some news for you that you little expect he said A telegram has just arrived from Netherwoods mister Alban Morris has got leave of absence and is coming here to morrow CHAPTER XLIV COMPETING Time at Monksmoor had advanced to the half hour before dinner on Saturday evening Cecilia and Francine mister Wyvil and Mirabel were loitering in the conservatory In the drawing room Emily had been considerately left alone with Alban He had missed the early train from Netherwoods but he had arrived in time to dress for dinner and to offer the necessary explanations If it had been possible for Alban to allude to the anonymous letter he might have owned that his first impulse had led him to destroy it and to assert his confidence in Emily by refusing mister Wyvil s invitation But try as he might to forget them the base words that he had read remained in his memory Irritating him at the outset they had ended in rousing his jealousy Under that delusive influence he persuaded himself that he had acted in the first instance without due consideration It was surely his interest it might even be his duty to go to mister Wyvil s house and judge for himself After some last wretched moments of hesitation he had decided on effecting a compromise with his own better sense by consulting Miss Ladd That excellent lady did exactly what he had expected her to do She made arrangements which granted him leave of absence from the Saturday to the Tuesday following The excuse which had served him in telegraphing to mister Wyvil must now be repeated in accounting for his unexpected appearance to Emily I found a person to take charge of my class he said and I gladly availed myself of the opportunity of seeing you again After observing him attentively while he was speaking to her Emily owned with her customary frankness that she had noticed something in his manner which left her not quite at her ease I wonder she said if there is any foundation for a doubt that has troubled me To his unutterable relief she at once explained what the doubt was I am afraid I offended you in replying to your letter about Miss Jethro In this case Alban could enjoy the luxury of speaking unreservedly He confessed that Emily s letter had disappointed him I expected you to answer me with less reserve he replied and I began to think I had acted rashly in writing to you at all When there is a better opportunity I may have a word to say He was apparently interrupted by something that he saw in the conservatory Looking that way Emily perceived that Mirabel was the object which had attracted Alban s attention The vile anonymous letter was in his mind again Without a preliminary word to prepare Emily he suddenly changed the subject How do you like the clergyman he asked Very much indeed she replied without the slightest embarrassment mister Mirabel is clever and agreeable and not at all spoiled by his success I am sure she said innocently you will like him too Alban s face answered her unmistakably in the negative sense but Emily s attention was drawn the other way by Francine She joined them at the moment on the lookout for any signs of an encouraging result which her treachery might already have produced Alban had been inclined to suspect her when he had received the letter He rose and bowed as she approached Something he was unable to realize what it was told him in the moment when they looked at each other that his suspicion had hit the mark In the conservatory the ever amiable Mirabel had left his friends for a while in search of flowers for Cecilia She turned to her father when they were alone and asked him which of the gentlemen was to take her in to dinner mister Mirabel or mister Morris mister Morris of course he answered He is the new guest and he turns out to be more than the equal socially speaking of our other friend When I showed him his room I asked if he was related to a man who bore the same name a fellow student of mine years and years ago at college He is my friend s younger son one of a ruined family but persons of high distinction in their day Mirabel returned with the flowers just as dinner was announced You are to take Emily to day Cecilia said to him leading the way out of the conservatory As they entered the drawing room Alban was just offering his arm to Emily Papa gives you to me mister Morris Cecilia explained pleasantly Alban hesitated apparently not understanding the allusion Mirabel interfered with his best grace mister Wyvil offers you the honor of taking his daughter to the dining room Alban s face darkened ominously as the elegant little clergyman gave his arm to Emily and followed mister Wyvil and Francine out of the room Cecilia looked at her silent and surly companion and almost envied her lazy sister dining under cover of a convenient headache in her own room Having already made up his mind that Alban Morris required careful handling Mirabel waited a little before he led the conversation as usual Between the soup and the fish he made an interesting confession addressed to Emily in the strictest confidence I have taken a fancy to your friend mister Morris he said First impressions in my case decide everything I like people or dislike them on impulse That man appeals to my sympathies Is he a good talker I should say Yes Emily answered prettily if you were not present Mirabel was not to be beaten even by a woman in the art of paying compliments He looked admiringly at Alban sitting opposite to him and said Let us listen This flattering suggestion not only pleased Emily it artfully served Mirabel s purpose That is to say it secured him an opportunity for observation of what was going on at the other side of the table Alban s instincts as a gentleman had led him to control his irritation and to regret that he had suffered it to appear Anxious to please he presented himself at his best Gentle Cecilia forgave and forgot the angry look which had startled her mister Wyvil was delighted with the son of his old friend Emily felt secretly proud of the good opinions which her admirer was gathering and Francine saw with pleasure that he was asserting his claim to Emily s preference in the way of all others which would be most likely to discourage his rival These various impressions produced while Alban s enemy was ominously silent began to suffer an imperceptible change from the moment when Mirabel decided that his time had come to take the lead A remark made by Alban offered him the chance for which he had been on the watch He agreed with the remark he enlarged on the remark he was brilliant and familiar and instructive and amusing and still it was all due to the remark Alban s temper was once more severely tried Mirabel s mischievous object had not escaped his penetration He did his best to put obstacles in the adversary s way and was baffled time after time with the readiest ingenuity If he interrupted the sweet tempered clergyman submitted and went on If he differed modest mister Mirabel said in the most amiable manner I daresay I am wrong and handled the topic from his opponent s point of view Never had such a perfect Christian sat before at mister Wyvil s table not a hard word not an impatient look escaped him The longer Alban resisted the more surely he lost ground in the general estimation Cecilia was disappointed Emily was grieved mister Wyvil s favorable opinion began to waver Francine was disgusted When dinner was over and the carriage was waiting to take the shepherd back to his flock by moonlight Mirabel s triumph was complete He had made Alban the innocent means of publicly exhibiting his perfect temper and perfect politeness under their best and brightest aspect So that day ended Sunday promised to pass quietly in the absence of Mirabel The morning came and it seemed doubtful whether the promise would be fulfilled Francine had passed an uneasy night No such encouraging result as she had anticipated had hitherto followed the appearance of Alban Morris at Monksmoor He had clumsily allowed Mirabel to improve his position while he had himself lost ground in Emily s estimation If this first disastrous consequence of the meeting between the two men was permitted to repeat itself on future occasions Emily and Mirabel would be brought more closely together and Alban himself would be the unhappy cause of it Francine rose on the Sunday morning before the table was laid for breakfast resolved to try the effect of a timely word of advice Her bedroom was situated in the front of the house The man she was looking for presently passed within her range of view from the window on his way to take a morning walk in the park She followed him immediately Good morning mister Morris He raised his hat and bowed without speaking and without looking at her We resemble each other in one particular she proceeded graciously we both like to breathe the fresh air before breakfast He said exactly what common politeness obliged him to say and no more he said Yes Some girls might have been discouraged Francine went on It is no fault of mine mister Morris that we have not been better friends For some reason into which I don t presume to inquire you seem to distrust me I really don t know what I have done to deserve it Are you sure of that he asked eying her suddenly and searchingly as he spoke Her hard face settled into a rigid look her eyes met his eyes with a stony defiant stare Now for the first time she knew that he suspected her of having written the anonymous letter Every evil quality in her nature steadily defied him A hardened old woman could not have sustained the shock of discovery with a more devilish composure than this girl displayed Perhaps you will explain yourself she said I have explained myself he answered Then I must be content she rejoined to remain in the dark I had intended out of my regard for Emily to suggest that you might with advantage to yourself and to interests that are very dear to you be more careful in your behavior to mister Mirabel Are you disposed to listen to me Do you wish me to answer that question plainly Miss de Sor I insist on your answering it plainly Then I am not disposed to listen to you May I know why or am I to be left in the dark again You are to be left if you please to your own ingenuity Francine looked at him with a malignant smile One of these days mister Morris I will deserve your confidence in my ingenuity She said it and went back to the house This was the only element of disturbance that troubled the perfect tranquillity of the day What Francine had proposed to do with the one idea of making Alban serve her purpose was accomplished a few hours later by Emily s influence for good over the man who loved her They passed the afternoon together uninterruptedly in the distant solitudes of the park In the course of conversation Emily found an opportunity of discreetly alluding to Mirabel You mustn t be jealous of our clever little friend she said I like him and admire him but But you don t love him She smiled at the eager way in which Alban put the question There is no fear of that she answered brightly Not even if you discovered that he loves you Not even then Are you content at last Promise me not to be rude to mister Mirabel again For his sake No for my sake I don t like to see you place yourself at a disadvantage toward another man I don t like you to disappoint me The happiness of hearing her say those words transfigured him the manly beauty of his earlier and happier years seemed to have returned to Alban He took her hand he was too agitated to speak You are forgetting mister Mirabel she reminded him gently I will be all that is civil and kind to mister Mirabel I will like him and admire him as you do Oh Emily are you a little only a very little fond of me I don t quite know May I try to find out How she asked Her fair cheek was very near to him The softly rising color on it said Answer me here and he answered CHAPTER XLV MISCHIEF MAKING On Monday Mirabel made his appearance and the demon of discord returned with him Alban had employed the earlier part of the day in making a sketch in the park intended as a little present for Emily Presenting himself in the drawing room when his work was completed he found Cecilia and Francine alone He asked where Emily was The question had been addressed to Cecilia Francine answered it Emily mustn t be disturbed she said Why not She is with mister Mirabel in the rose garden I saw them talking together evidently feeling the deepest interest in what they were saying to each other Don t interrupt them you will only be in the way Cecilia at once protested against this last assertion She is trying to make mischief mister Morris don t believe her I am sure they will be glad to see you if you join them in the garden Francine rose and left the room She turned and looked at Alban as she opened the door Try it she said and you will find I am right Francine sometimes talks in a very ill natured way Cecilia gently remarked Do you think she means it mister Morris I had better not offer an opinion Alban replied Why I can t speak impartially I dislike Miss de Sor There was a pause Alban s sense of self respect forbade him to try the experiment which Francine had maliciously suggested His thoughts less easy to restrain wandered in the direction of the garden The attempt to make him jealous had failed but he was conscious at the same time that Emily had disappointed him After what they had said to each other in the park she ought to have remembered that women are at the mercy of appearances If Mirabel had something of importance to say to her she might have avoided exposing herself to Francine s spiteful misconstruction it would have been easy to arrange with Cecilia that a third person should be present at the interview While he was absorbed in these reflections Cecilia embarrassed by the silence was trying to find a topic of conversation Alban roughly pushed his sketch book away from him on the table Was he displeased with Emily The same question had occurred to Cecilia at the time of the correspondence on the subject of Miss Jethro To recall those letters led her by natural sequence to another effort of memory She was reminded of the person who had been the cause of the correspondence her interest was revived in the mystery of Miss Jethro Has Emily told you that I have seen your letter she asked He roused himself with a start I beg your pardon What letter are you thinking of I was thinking of the letter which mentions Miss Jethro s strange visit Emily was so puzzled and so surprised that she showed it to me and we both consulted my father Have you spoken to Emily about Miss Jethro I have tried but she seemed to be unwilling to pursue the subject Have you made any discoveries since you wrote to Emily No The mystery is as impenetrable as ever As he replied in those terms Mirabel entered the conservatory from the garden evidently on his way to the drawing room To see the man whose introduction to Emily it had been Miss Jethro s mysterious object to prevent at the very moment when he had been speaking of Miss Jethro herself was not only a temptation of curiosity but a direct incentive in Emily s own interests to make an effort at discovery Alban pursued the conversation with Cecilia in a tone which was loud enough to be heard in the conservatory The one chance of getting any information that I can see he proceeded is to speak to mister Mirabel I shall be only too glad if I can be of any service to Miss Wyvil and mister Morris With those obliging words Mirabel made a dramatic entry and looked at Cecilia with his irresistible smile Startled by his sudden appearance she unconsciously assisted Alban s design Her silence gave him the opportunity of speaking in her place We were talking he said quietly to Mirabel of a lady with whom you are acquainted Indeed May I ask the lady s name Miss Jethro Mirabel sustained the shock with extraordinary self possession so far as any betrayal by sudden movement was concerned But his color told the truth it faded to paleness it revealed even to Cecilia s eyes a man overpowered by fright Alban offered him a chair He refused to take it by a gesture Alban tried an apology next I am afraid I have ignorantly revived some painful associations Pray excuse me The apology roused Mirabel he felt the necessity of offering some explanation In timid animals the one defensive capacity which is always ready for action is cunning Mirabel was too wily to dispute the inference the inevitable inference which any one must have drawn after seeing the effect on him that the name of Miss Jethro had produced He admitted that painful associations had been revived and deplored the nervous sensibility which had permitted it to be seen No blame can possibly attach to you my dear sir he continued in his most amiable manner Will it be indiscreet on my part if I ask how you first became acquainted with Miss Jethro I first became acquainted with her at Miss Ladd s school Alban answered She was for a short time only one of the teachers and she left her situation rather suddenly He paused but Mirabel made no remark After an interval of a few months he resumed I saw Miss Jethro again She called on me at my lodgings near Netherwoods Merely to renew your former acquaintance Mirabel made that inquiry with an eager anxiety for the reply which he was quite unable to conceal Had he any reason to dread what Miss Jethro might have it in her power to say of him to another person Alban was in no way pledged to secrecy and he was determined to leave no means untried of throwing light on Miss Jethro s mysterious warning He repeated the plain narrative of the interview which he had communicated by letter to Emily Mirabel listened without making any remark After what I have told you can you give me no explanation Alban asked I am quite unable mister Morris to help you Was he lying or speaking the truth The impression produced on Alban was that he had spoken the truth Women are never so ready as men to resign themselves to the disappointment of their hopes Cecilia silently listening up to this time now ventured to speak animated by her sisterly interest in Emily Can you not tell us she said to Mirabel why Miss Jethro tried to prevent Emily Brown from meeting you here I know no more of her motive than you do Mirabel replied Alban interposed Miss Jethro left me he said with the intention quite openly expressed of trying to prevent you from accepting mister Wyvil s invitation Did she make the attempt Mirabel admitted that she had made the attempt But he added without mentioning Miss Emily s name I was asked to postpone my visit as a favor to herself because she had her own reasons for wishing it I had my reasons he bowed with gallantry to Cecilia for being eager to have the honor of knowing mister Wyvil and his daughter and I refused Once more the doubt arose was he lying or speaking the truth And once more Alban could not resist the conclusion that he was speaking the truth There is one thing I should like to know Mirabel continued after some hesitation Has Miss Emily been informed of this strange affair Certainly Mirabel seemed to be disposed to continue his inquiries and suddenly changed his mind Was he beginning to doubt if Alban had spoken without concealment in describing Miss Jethro s visit Was he still afraid of what Miss Jethro might have said of him In any case he changed the subject and made an excuse for leaving the room I am forgetting my errand he said to Alban Miss Emily was anxious to know if you had finished your sketch I must tell her that you have returned He bowed and withdrew Alban rose to follow him and checked himself No he thought I trust Emily He sat down again by Cecilia s side Mirabel had indeed returned to the rose garden He found Emily employed as he had left her in making a crown of roses to be worn by Cecilia in the evening But in one other respect there was a change Francine was present Excuse me for sending you on a needless errand Emily said to Mirabel Miss de Sor tells me mister Morris has finished his sketch She left him in the drawing room why didn t you bring him here He was talking with Miss Wyvil Mirabel answered absently with his eyes on Francine He gave her one of those significant looks which says to a third person Why are you here Francine s jealousy declined to understand him He tried a broader hint in words Are you going to walk in the garden he said Francine was impenetrable No she answered I am going to stay here with Emily Mirabel had no choice but to yield Imperative anxieties forced him to say in Francine s presence what he had hoped to say to Emily privately When I joined Miss Wyvil and mister Morris he began what do you think they were doing They were talking of Miss Jethro Emily dropped the rose crown on her lap It was easy to see that she had been disagreeably surprised mister Morris has told me the curious story of Miss Jethro s visit Mirabel continued but I am in some doubt whether he has spoken to me without reserve Perhaps he expressed himself more freely when he spoke to you Miss Jethro may have said something to him which tended to lower me in your estimation Certainly not mister Mirabel so far as I know If I had heard anything of the kind I should have thought it my duty to tell you Will it relieve your anxiety if I go at once to mister Morris and ask him plainly whether he has concealed anything from you or from me Mirabel gratefully kissed her hand Your kindness overpowers me he said speaking for once with true emotion Emily immediately returned to the house As soon as she was out of sight Francine approached Mirabel trembling with suppressed rage CHAPTER XLVI PRETENDING Miss de Sor began cautiously with an apology Excuse me mister Mirabel for reminding you of my presence mister Mirabel made no reply I beg to say Francine proceeded that I didn t intentionally see you kiss Emily s hand Mirabel stood looking at the roses which Emily had left on her chair as completely absorbed in his own thoughts as if he had been alone in the garden Am I not even worth notice Francine asked Ah I know to whom I am indebted for your neglect She took him familiarly by the arm and burst into a harsh laugh Tell me now in confidence do you think Emily is fond of you The impression left by Emily s kindness was still fresh in Mirabel s memory he was in no humor to submit to the jealous resentment of a woman whom he regarded with perfect indifference Through the varnish of politeness which overlaid his manner there rose to the surface the underlying insolence hidden on all ordinary occasions from all human eyes He answered Francine mercilessly answered her at last It is the dearest hope of my life that she may be fond of me he said Francine dropped his arm And fortune favors your hopes she added with an ironical assumption of interest in Mirabel s prospects When mister Morris leaves us to morrow he removes the only obstacle you have to fear Am I right No you are wrong In what way if you please In this way I don t regard mister Morris as an obstacle Emily is too delicate and too kind to hurt his feelings she is not in love with him There is no absorbing interest in her mind to divert her thoughts from me She is idle and happy she thoroughly enjoys her visit to this house and I am associated with her enjoyment There is my chance He suddenly stopped Listening to him thus far unnaturally calm and cold Francine now showed that she felt the lash of his contempt A hideous smile passed slowly over her white face It threatened the vengeance which knows no fear no pity no remorse the vengeance of a jealous woman Hysterical anger furious language Mirabel was prepared for The smile frightened him Well she said scornfully why don t you go on A bolder man might still have maintained the audacious position which he had assumed Mirabel s faint heart shrank from it He was eager to shelter himself under the first excuse that he could find His ingenuity paralyzed by his fears was unable to invent anything new He feebly availed himself of the commonplace trick of evasion which he had read of in novels and seen in action on the stage Is it possible he asked with an overacted assumption of surprise that you think I am in earnest In the case of any other person Francine would have instantly seen through that flimsy pretense But the love which accepts the meanest crumbs of comfort that can be thrown to it which fawns and grovels and deliberately deceives itself in its own intensely selfish interests was the love that burned in Francine s breast The wretched girl believed Mirabel with such an ecstatic sense of belief that she trembled in every limb and dropped into the nearest chair I was in earnest she said faintly Didn t you see it He was perfectly shameless he denied that he had seen it in the most positive manner Upon my honor I thought you were mystifying me and I humored the joke She sighed and looking at him with an expression of tender reproach I wonder whether I can believe you she said softly Indeed you may believe me he assured her She hesitated for the pleasure of hesitating I don t know Emily is very much admired by some men Why not by you For the best of reasons he answered She is poor and I am poor Those are facts which speak for themselves Yes but Emily is bent on attracting you She would marry you to morrow if you asked her Don t attempt to deny it Besides you kissed her hand Oh Miss de Sor Don t call me Miss de Sor Call me Francine I want to know why you kissed her hand He humored her with inexhaustible servility Allow me to kiss your hand Francine and let me explain that kissing a lady s hand is only a form of thanking her for her kindness You must own that Emily She interrupted him for the third time Emily she repeated Are you as familiar as that already Does she call you Miles when you are by yourselves Is there any effort at fascination which this charming creature has left untried She told you no doubt what a lonely life she leads in her poor little home Even Mirabel felt that he must not permit this to pass She has said nothing to me about herself he answered What I know of her I know from mister Wyvil Oh indeed You asked mister Wyvil about her family of course What did he say He said she lost her mother when she was a child and he told me her father had died suddenly a few years since of heart complaint Well and what else Never mind now Here is somebody coming The person was only one of the servants Mirabel felt grateful to the man for interrupting them Animated by sentiments of a precisely opposite nature Francine spoke to him sharply What do you want here A message miss From whom From Miss Brown For me No miss He turned to Mirabel Miss Brown wishes to speak to you sir if you are not engaged Francine controlled herself until the man was out of hearing Upon my word this is too shameless she declared indignantly Emily can t leave you with me for five minutes without wanting to see you again If you go to her after all that you have said to me she cried threatening Mirabel with her outstretched hand you are the meanest of men He was the meanest of men he carried out his cowardly submission to the last extremity Only say what you wish me to do he replied Even Francine expected some little resistance from a creature bearing the outward appearance of a man Oh do you really mean it she asked I want you to disappoint Emily Will you stay here and let me make your excuses I will do anything to please you Francine gave him a farewell look Her admiration made a desperate effort to express itself appropriately in words You are not a man she said you are an angel Left by himself Mirabel sat down to rest He reviewed his own conduct with perfect complacency Not one man in a hundred could have managed that she devil as I have done he thought How shall I explain matters to Emily Considering this question he looked by chance at the unfinished crown of roses The very thing to help me he said and took out his pocketbook and wrote these lines on a blank page I have had a scene of jealousy with Miss de Sor which is beyond all description To spare you a similar infliction I have done violence to my own feelings Instead of instantly obeying the message which you have so kindly sent to me I remain here for a little while entirely for your sake Having torn out the page and twisted it up among the roses so that only a corner of the paper appeared in view Mirabel called to a lad who was at work in the garden and gave him his directions accompanied by a shilling Take those flowers to the servants hall and tell one of the maids to put them in Miss Brown s room Stop Which is the way to the fruit garden The lad gave the necessary directions Mirabel walked away slowly with his hands in his pockets His nerves had been shaken he thought a little fruit might refresh him CHAPTER XLVII DEBATING In the meanwhile Emily had been true to her promise to relieve Mirabel s anxieties on the subject of Miss Jethro Entering the drawing room in search of Alban she found him talking with Cecilia and heard her own name mentioned as she opened the door Here she is at last Cecilia exclaimed What in the world has kept you all this time in the rose garden Has mister Mirabel been more interesting than usual Alban asked gayly Whatever sense of annoyance he might have felt in Emily s absence was forgotten the moment she appeared all traces of trouble in his face vanished when they looked at each other You shall judge for yourself Emily replied with a smile mister Mirabel has been speaking to me of a relative who is very dear to him his sister Cecilia was surprised Why has he never spoken to us of his sister she asked It s a sad subject to speak of my dear His sister lives a life of suffering she has been for years a prisoner in her room He writes to her constantly His letters from Monksmoor have interested her poor soul It seems he said something about me and she has sent a kind message inviting me to visit her one of these days Do you understand it now Cecilia Of course I do Tell me is mister Mirabel s sister older or younger than he is Older Is she married She is a widow Does she live with her brother Alban asked Oh no She has her own house far away in Northumberland Is she near Sir Jervis Redwood I fancy not Her house is on the coast Any children Cecilia inquired No she is quite alone Now Cecilia I have told you all I know and I have something to say to mister Morris No you needn t leave us it s a subject in which you are interested A subject she repeated turning to Alban which you may have noticed is not very agreeable to me Miss Jethro Alban guessed Yes Miss Jethro Cecilia s curiosity instantly asserted itself We have tried to get mister Mirabel to enlighten us and tried in vain she said You are a favorite Have you succeeded I have made no attempt to succeed Emily replied My only object is to relieve mister Mirabel s anxiety if I can with your help mister Morris In what way can I help you You mustn t be angry Do I look angry You look serious It is a very simple thing mister Mirabel is afraid that Miss Jethro may have said something disagreeable about him which you might hesitate to repeat Is he making himself uneasy without any reason Without the slightest reason I have concealed nothing from mister Mirabel Thank you for the explanation She turned to Cecilia May I send one of the servants with a message I may as well put an end to mister Mirabel s suspense The man was summoned and was dispatched with the message Emily would have done well after this if she had abstained from speaking further of Miss Jethro But Mirabel s doubts had unhappily inspired a similar feeling of uncertainty in her own mind She was now disposed to attribute the tone of mystery in Alban s unlucky letter to some possible concealment suggested by regard for herself I wonder whether I have any reason to feel uneasy she said half in jest half in earnest Uneasy about what Alban inquired About Miss Jethro of course Has she said anything of me which your kindness has concealed Alban seemed to be a little hurt by the doubt which her question implied Was that your motive he asked for answering my letter as cautiously as if you had been writing to a stranger Indeed you are quite wrong Emily earnestly assured him I was perplexed and startled and I took mister Wyvil s advice before I wrote to you Shall we drop the subject Alban would have willingly dropped the subject but for that unfortunate allusion to mister Wyvil Emily had unconsciously touched him on a sore place He had already heard from Cecilia of the consultation over his letter and had disapproved of it I think you were wrong to trouble mister Wyvil he said The altered tone of his voice suggested to Emily that he would have spoken more severely if Cecilia had not been in the room She thought him needlessly ready to complain of a harmless proceeding and she too returned to the subject after having proposed to drop it not a minute since You didn t tell me I was to keep your letter a secret she replied Cecilia made matters worse with the best intentions I m sure mister Morris my father was only too glad to give Emily his advice Alban remained silent ungraciously silent as Emily thought after mister Wyvil s kindness to him The thing to regret she remarked is that mister Morris allowed Miss Jethro to leave him without explaining herself In his place I should have insisted on knowing why she wanted to prevent me from meeting mister Mirabel in this house Cecilia made another unlucky attempt at judicious interference This time she tried a gentle remonstrance Remember Emily how mister Morris was situated He could hardly be rude to a lady And I daresay Miss Jethro had good reasons for not wishing to explain herself Francine opened the drawing room door and heard Cecilia s last words Miss Jethro again she exclaimed Where is mister Mirabel Emily asked I sent him a message He regrets to say he is otherwise engaged for the present Francine replied with spiteful politeness Don t let me interrupt the conversation Who is this Miss Jethro whose name is on everybody s lips Alban could keep silent no longer We have done with the subject he said sharply Because I am here Because we have said more than enough about Miss Jethro already Speak for yourself mister Morris Emily answered resenting the masterful tone which Alban s interference had assumed I have not done with Miss Jethro yet I can assure you My dear you don t know where she lives Cecilia reminded her Leave me to discover it Emily answered hotly Perhaps mister Mirabel knows I shall ask mister Mirabel I thought you would find a reason for returning to mister Mirabel Francine remarked Before Emily could reply one of the maids entered the room with a wreath of roses in her hand mister Mirabel sends you these flowers miss the woman said addressing Emily The boy told me they were to be taken to your room I thought it was a mistake and I have brought them to you here Francine who happened to be nearest to the door took the roses from the girl on pretense of handing them to Emily Her jealous vigilance detected the one visible morsel of Mirabel s letter twisted up with the flowers Had Emily entrapped him into a secret correspondence with her A scrap of waste paper among your roses she said crumpling it up in her hand as if she meant to throw it away But Emily was too quick for her She caught Francine by the wrist Waste paper or not she said it was among my flowers and it belongs to me Francine gave up the letter with a look which might have startled Emily if she had noticed it She handed the roses to Cecilia I was making a wreath for you to wear this evening my dear and I left it in the garden It s not quite finished yet Cecilia was delighted How lovely it is she exclaimed And how very kind of you I ll finish it myself She turned away to the conservatory I had no idea I was interfering with a letter said Francine watching Emily with fiercely attentive eyes while she smoothed out the crumpled paper Having read what Mirabel had written to her Emily looked up and saw that Alban was on the point of following Cecilia into the conservatory He had noticed something in Francine s face which he was at a loss to understand but which made her presence in the room absolutely hateful to him Emily followed and spoke to him I am going back to the rose garden she said For any particular purpose Alban inquired For a purpose which I am afraid you won t approve of I mean to ask mister Mirabel if he knows Miss Jethro s address I hope he is as ignorant of it as I am Alban answered gravely Are we going to quarrel over Miss Jethro as we once quarreled over missus Rook Emily asked with the readiest recovery of her good humor Come come I am sure you are as anxious in your own private mind to have this matter cleared up as I am With one difference that I think of consequences and you don t He said it in his gentlest and kindest manner and stepped into the conservatory Never mind the consequences she called after him if we can only get at the truth I hate being deceived There is no person living who has better reason than you have to say that Emily looked round with a start Alban was out of hearing It was Francine who had answered her What do you mean she said Francine hesitated A ghastly paleness overspread her face Are you ill Emily asked No I am thinking After waiting for a moment in silence Emily moved away toward the door of the drawing room Francine suddenly held up her hand Stop she cried Emily stood still My mind is made up Francine said Made up to what You asked what I meant just now I did Well my mind is made up to answer you Miss Emily Brown you are leading a sadly frivolous life in this house I am going to give you something more serious to think about than your flirtation with mister Mirabel Oh don t be impatient I am coming to the point Without knowing it yourself you have been the victim of deception for years past cruel deception wicked deception that puts on the mask of mercy Are you alluding to Miss Jethro Emily asked in astonishment I thought you were strangers to each other Just now you wanted to know who she was I know nothing about her I care nothing about her I am not thinking of Miss Jethro Who are you thinking of I am thinking Francine answered of your dead father CHAPTER XLVIII INVESTIGATING Having revived his sinking energies in the fruit garden Mirabel seated himself under the shade of a tree and reflected on the critical position in which he was placed by Francine s jealousy If Miss de Sor continued to be mister Wyvil s guest there seemed to be no other choice before Mirabel than to leave Monksmoor and to trust to a favorable reply to his sister s invitation for the free enjoyment of Emily s society under another roof Try as he might he could arrive at no more satisfactory conclusion than this In his preoccupied state time passed quickly Nearly an hour had elapsed before he rose to return to the house Entering the hall he was startled by a cry of terror in a woman s voice coming from the upper regions At the same time mister Wyvil passing along the bedroom corridor after leaving the music room was confronted by his daughter hurrying out of Emily s bedchamber in such a state of alarm that she could hardly speak Gone she cried the moment she saw her father mister Wyvil took her in his arms and tried to compose her Who has gone he asked Emily Oh papa Emily has left us She has heard dreadful news she told me so herself What news How did she hear it I don t know how she heard it I went back to the drawing room to show her my roses Was she alone Yes She frightened me she seemed quite wild She said Let me be by myself I shall have to go home She kissed me and ran up to her room Oh I am such a fool Anybody else would have taken care not to lose sight of her How long did you leave her by herself I can t say I thought I would go and tell you And then I got anxious about her and knocked at her door and looked into the room Gone Gone mister Wyvil rang the bell and confided Cecilia to the care of her maid Mirabel had already joined him in the corridor They went downstairs together and consulted with Alban He volunteered to make immediate inquiries at the railway station mister Wyvil followed him as far as the lodge gate which opened on the highroad while Mirabel went to a second gate at the opposite extremity of the park mister Wyvil obtained the first news of Emily The lodge keeper had seen her pass him on her way out of the park in the greatest haste He had called after her Anything wrong miss and had received no reply Asked what time had elapsed since this had happened he was too confused to be able to answer with any certainty He knew that she had taken the road which led to the station and he knew no more mister Wyvil and Mirabel met again at the house and instituted an examination of the servants No further discoveries were made The question which occurred to everybody was suggested by the words which Cecilia had repeated to her father Emily had said she had heard dreadful news how had that news reached her The one postal delivery at Monksmoor was in the morning Had any special messenger arrived with a letter for Emily The servants were absolutely certain that no such person had entered the house The one remaining conclusion suggested that somebody must have communicated the evil tidings by word of mouth But here again no evidence was to be obtained No visitor had called during the day and no new guests had arrived Investigation was completely baffled Alban returned from the railway with news of the fugitive He had reached the station some time after the departure of the London train The clerk at the office recognized his description of Emily and stated that she had taken her ticket for London The station master had opened the carriage door for her and had noticed that the young lady appeared to be very much agitated This information obtained Alban had dispatched a telegram to Emily in Cecilia s name Pray send us a few words to relieve our anxiety and let us know if we can be of any service to you This was plainly all that could be done but Cecilia was not satisfied If her father had permitted it she would have followed Emily Alban comforted her He apologized to mister Wyvil for shortening his visit and announced his intention of traveling to London by the next train We may renew our inquiries to some advantage he added after hearing what had happened in his absence if we can find out who was the last person who saw her and spoke to her before your daughter found her alone in the drawing room When I went out of the room I left her with Miss de Sor The maid who waited on Miss de Sor was sent for Francine had been out by herself walking in the park She was then in her room changing her dress On hearing of Emily s sudden departure she had been as the maid reported much shocked and quite at a loss to understand what it meant Joining her friends a few minutes later Francine presented so far as personal appearance went a strong contrast to the pale and anxious faces round her She looked wonderfully well after her walk In other respects she was in perfect harmony with the prevalent feeling She expressed herself with the utmost propriety her sympathy moved poor Cecilia to tears I am sure Miss de Sor you will try to help us mister Wyvil began With the greatest pleasure Francine answered How long were you and Miss Emily Brown together after mister Morris left you Not more than a quarter of an hour I should think Did anything remarkable occur in the course of conversation Nothing whatever Alban interfered for the first time Did you say anything he asked which agitated or offended Miss Brown That s rather an extraordinary question Francine remarked Have you no other answer to give Alban inquired I answer No she said with a sudden outburst of anger There the matter dropped While she spoke in reply to mister Wyvil Francine had confronted him without embarrassment When Alban interposed she never looked at him except when he provoked her to anger Did she remember that the man who was questioning her was also the man who had suspected her of writing the anonymous letter Alban was on his guard against himself knowing how he disliked her But the conviction in his own mind was not to be resisted In some unimaginable way Francine was associated with Emily s flight from the house The answer to the telegram sent from the railway station had not arrived when Alban took his departure for London Cecilia s suspense began to grow unendurable she looked to Mirabel for comfort and found none His office was to console and his capacity for performing that office was notorious among his admirers but he failed to present himself to advantage when mister Wyvil s lovely daughter had need of his services He was in truth too sincerely anxious and distressed to be capable of commanding his customary resources of ready made sentiment and fluently pious philosophy Emily s influence had awakened the only earnest and true feeling which had ever ennobled the popular preacher s life Toward evening the long expected telegram was received at last What could be said under the circumstances it said in these words Safe at home don t be uneasy about me will write soon With that promise they were for the time forced to be content BOOK THE FIFTH THE COTTAGE CHAPTER XLIX EMILY SUFFERS missus Ellmother left in charge of Emily s place of abode and feeling sensible of her lonely position from time to time had just thought of trying the cheering influence of a cup of tea when she heard a cab draw up at the cottage gate A violent ring at the bell followed She opened the door and found Emily on the steps One look at that dear and familiar face was enough for the old servant God help us she cried what s wrong now Without a word of reply Emily led the way into the bedchamber which had been the scene of Miss Letitia s death missus Ellmother hesitated on the threshold Why do you bring me in here she asked Why did you try to keep me out Emily answered When did I try to keep you out miss When I came home from school to nurse my aunt Ah you remember now Is it true I ask you here where your old mistress died is it true that my aunt deceived me about my father s death And that you knew it There was dead silence missus Ellmother trembled horribly her lips dropped apart her eyes wandered round the room with a stare of idiotic terror Is it her ghost tells you that she whispered Where is her ghost The room whirls round and round miss and the air sings in my ears Emily sprang forward to support her She staggered to a chair and lifted her great bony hands in wild entreaty Don t frighten me she said Stand back Emily obeyed her She dashed the cold sweat off her forehead You were talking about your father s death just now she burst out in desperate defiant tones Well we know it and we are sorry for it your father died suddenly My father died murdered in the inn at Zeeland All the long way to London I have tried to doubt it Oh me I know it now Answering in those words she looked toward the bed Harrowing remembrances of her aunt s delirious self betrayal made the room unendurable to her She ran out The parlor door was open Entering the room she passed by a portrait of her father which her aunt had hung on the wall over the fireplace She threw herself on the sofa and burst into a passionate fit of crying Oh my father my dear gentle loving father my first best truest friend murdered murdered Oh God where was your justice where was your mercy when he died that dreadful death A hand was laid on her shoulder a voice said to her Hush my child God knows best Emily looked up and saw that missus Ellmother had followed her You poor old soul she said suddenly remembering I frightened you in the other room I have got over it my dear I am old and I have lived a hard life A hard life schools a person I make no complaints She stopped and began to shudder again Will you believe me if I tell you something she asked I warned my self willed mistress Standing by your father s coffin I warned her Hide the truth as you may I said a time will come when our child will know what you are keeping from her now One or both of us may live to see it I am the one who has lived no refuge in the grave for me I want to hear about it there s no fear of frightening or hurting me now I want to hear how you found it out Was it by accident my dear or did a person tell you Emily s mind was far away from missus Ellmother She rose from the sofa with her hands held fast over her aching heart The one duty of my life she said I am thinking of the one duty of my life Look I am calm now I am resigned to my hard lot Never never again can the dear memory of my father be what it was From this time it is the horrid memory of a crime The crime has gone unpunished the man has escaped others He shall not escape Me She paused and looked at missus Ellmother absently What did you say just now You want to hear how I know what I know Naturally naturally Sit down here sit down my old friend on the sofa with me and take your mind back to Netherwoods Alban Morris missus Ellmother recoiled from Emily in dismay Don t tell me he had anything to do with it The kindest of men the best of men The man of all men living who least deserves your good opinion or mine Emily answered sternly You missus Ellmother exclaimed you say that I say it He who won on me to like him he was in the conspiracy to deceive me and you know it He heard me talk of the newspaper story of the murder of my father I say he heard me talk of it composedly talk of it carelessly in the innocent belief that it was the murder of a stranger and he never opened his lips to prevent that horrid profanation He never even said speak of something else I won t hear you No more of him God forbid I should ever see him again No Do what I told you Carry your mind back to Netherwoods One night you let Francine de Sor frighten you You ran away from her into the garden Keep quiet At your age must I set you an example of self control I want to know Miss Emily where Francine de Sor is now She is at the house in the country which I have left Where does she go next if you please Back to Miss Ladd I suppose so What interest have you in knowing where she goes next I won t interrupt you miss It s true that I ran away into the garden I can guess who followed me How did she find her way to me and mister Morris in the dark The smell of tobacco guided her she knew who smoked she had seen him talking to you on that very day she followed the scent she heard what you two said to each other and she has repeated it to me Oh my old friend the malice of a revengeful girl has enlightened me when you my nurse and he my lover left me in the dark it has told me how my father died That s said bitterly miss Is it said truly No It isn t said truly of myself God knows you would never have been kept in the dark if your aunt had listened to me I begged and prayed I went down on my knees to her I warned her as I told you just now Must I tell you what a headstrong woman Miss Letitia was She insisted She put the choice before me of leaving her at once and forever or giving in I wouldn t have given in to any other creature on the face of this earth I am obstinate as you have often told me Well your aunt s obstinacy beat mine I was too fond of her to say No Besides if you ask me who was to blame in the first place I tell you it wasn t your aunt she was frightened into it Who frightened her Your godfather the great London surgeon he who was visiting in our house at the time Sir Richard Yes Sir Richard He said he wouldn t answer for the consequences in the delicate state of your health if we told you the truth Ah he had it all his own way after that He went with Miss Letitia to the inquest he won over the coroner and the newspaper men to his will he kept your aunt s name out of the papers he took charge of the coffin he hired the undertaker and his men strangers from London he wrote the certificate who but he Everybody was cap in hand to the famous man Surely the servants and the neighbors asked questions Hundreds of questions What did that matter to Sir Richard They were like so many children in his hands And mind you the luck helped him To begin with there was the common name Who was to pick out your poor father among the thousands of James Browns Then again the house and lands went to the male heir as they called him the man your father quarreled with in the bygone time He brought his own establishment with him Long before you got back from the friends you were staying with don t you remember it we had cleared out of the house we were miles and miles away and the old servants were scattered abroad finding new situations wherever they could How could you suspect us We had nothing to fear in that way but my conscience pricked me I made another attempt to prevail on Miss Letitia when you had recovered your health I said There s no fear of a relapse now break it to her gently but tell her the truth No Your aunt was too fond of you She daunted me with dreadful fits of crying when I tried to persuade her And that wasn t the worst of it She bade me remember what an excitable man your father was she reminded me that the misery of your mother s death laid him low with brain fever she said Emily takes after her father I have heard you say it yourself she has his constitution and his sensitive nerves Don t you know how she loved him how she talks of him to this day Who can tell if we are not careful what dreadful mischief we may do That was how my mistress worked on me I got infected with her fears it was as if I had caught an infection of disease Oh my dear blame me if it must be but don t forget how I have suffered for it since I was driven away from my dying mistress in terror of what she might say while you were watching at her bedside I have lived in fear of what you might ask me and have longed to go back to you and have not had the courage to do it Look at me now The poor woman tried to take out her handkerchief her quivering hand helplessly entangled itself in her dress I can t even dry my eyes she said faintly Try to forgive me miss Emily put her arms round the old nurse s neck It is you she said sadly who must forgive me For a while they were silent Through the window that was open to the little garden came the one sound that could be heard the gentle trembling of leaves in the evening wind The silence was harshly broken by the bell at the cottage door They both started Emily s heart beat fast Who can it be she said missus Ellmother rose Shall I say you can t see anybody she asked before leaving the room Yes yes Emily heard the door opened heard low voices in the passage There was a momentary interval Then missus Ellmother returned She said nothing Emily spoke to her Is it a visitor Yes Have you said I can t see anybody I couldn t say it Why not Don t be hard on him my dear It s mister Alban Morris CHAPTER L MISS LADD ADVISES missus Ellmother sat by the dying embers of the kitchen fire thinking over the events of the day in perplexity and distress She had waited at the cottage door for a friendly word with Alban after he had left Emily The stern despair in his face warned her to let him go in silence She had looked into the parlor next Pale and cold Emily lay on the sofa sunk in helpless depression of body and mind Don t speak to me she whispered I am quite worn out It was but too plain that the view of Alban s conduct which she had already expressed was the view to which she had adhered at the interview between them They had parted in grief perhaps in anger perhaps forever missus Ellmother lifted Emily in compassionate silence and carried her upstairs and waited by her until she slept In the still hours of the night the thoughts of the faithful old servant dwelling for a while on past and present advanced by slow degrees to consideration of the doubtful future Measuring to the best of her ability the responsibility which had fallen on her she felt that it was more than she could bear or ought to bear alone To whom could she look for help The gentlefolks at Monksmoor were strangers to her Doctor Allday was near at hand but Emily had said Don t send for him he will torment me with questions and I want to keep my mind quiet if I can But one person was left to whose ever ready kindness missus Ellmother could appeal and that person was Miss Ladd It would have been easy to ask the help of the good schoolmistress in comforting and advising the favorite pupil whom she loved But missus Ellmother had another object in view she was determined that the cold blooded cruelty of Emily s treacherous friend should not be allowed to triumph with impunity If an ignorant old woman could do nothing else she could tell the plain truth and could leave Miss Ladd to decide whether such a person as Francine deserved to remain under her care To feel justified in taking this step was one thing to put it all clearly in writing was another After vainly making the attempt overnight missus Ellmother tore up her letter and communicated with Miss Ladd by means of a telegraphic message in the morning Miss Emily is in great distress I must not leave her I have something besides to say to you which cannot be put into a letter Will you please come to us Later in the forenoon missus Ellmother was called to the door by the arrival of a visitor The personal appearance of the stranger impressed her favorably He was a handsome little gentleman his manners were winning and his voice was singularly pleasant to hear I have come from mister Wyvil s house in the country he said and I bring a letter from his daughter May I take the opportunity of asking if Miss Emily is well Far from it sir I am sorry to say She is so poorly that she keeps her bed At this reply the visitor s face revealed such sincere sympathy and regret that missus Ellmother was interested in him she added a word more My mistress has had a hard trial to bear sir I hope there is no bad news for her in the young lady s letter On the contrary there is news that she will be glad to hear Miss Wyvil is coming here this evening Will you excuse my asking if Miss Emily has had medical advice She won t hear of seeing the doctor sir He s a good friend of hers and he lives close by I am unfortunately alone in the house If I could leave her I would go at once and ask his advice Let me go Mirabel eagerly proposed missus Ellmother s face brightened That s kindly thought of sir if you don t mind the trouble My good lady nothing is a trouble in your young mistress s service Give me the doctor s name and address and tell me what to say to him There s one thing you must be careful of missus Ellmother answered He mustn t come here as if he had been sent for she would refuse to see him Mirabel understood her I will not forget to caution him Kindly tell Miss Emily I called my name is Mirabel I will return to morrow He hastened away on his errand only to find that he had arrived too late Doctor Allday had left London called away to a serious case of illness He was not expected to get back until late in the afternoon Mirabel left a message saying that he would return in the evening The next visitor who arrived at the cottage was the trusty friend in whose generous nature missus Ellmother had wisely placed confidence Miss Ladd had resolved to answer the telegram in person the moment she read it If there is bad news she said let me hear it at once I am not well enough to bear suspense my busy life at the school is beginning to tell on me There is nothing that need alarm you ma am but there is a great deal to say before you see Miss Emily My stupid head turns giddy with thinking of it I hardly know where to begin Begin with Emily Miss Ladd suggested missus Ellmother took the advice She described Emily s unexpected arrival on the previous day and she repeated what had passed between them afterward Miss Ladd s first impulse when she had recovered her composure was to go to Emily without waiting to hear more Not presuming to stop her missus Ellmother ventured to put a question Do you happen to have my telegram about you ma am Miss Ladd produced it Will you please look at the last part of it again Miss Ladd read the words I have something besides to say to you which cannot be put into a letter She at once returned to her chair Does what you have still to tell me refer to any person whom I know she said It refers ma am to Miss de Sor I am afraid I shall distress you What did I say when I came in Miss Ladd asked Speak out plainly and try it s not easy I know but try to begin at the beginning missus Ellmother looked back through her memory of past events and began by alluding to the feeling of curiosity which she had excited in Francine on the day when Emily had made them known to one another From this she advanced to the narrative of what had taken place at Netherwoods to the atrocious attempt to frighten her by means of the image of wax to the discovery made by Francine in the garden at night and to the circumstances under which that discovery had been communicated to Emily Miss Ladd s face reddened with indignation Are you sure of all that you have said she asked I am quite sure ma am I hope I have not done wrong missus Ellmother added simply in telling you all this Wrong Miss Ladd repeated warmly If that wretched girl has no defense to offer she is a disgrace to my school and I owe you a debt of gratitude for showing her to me in her true character She shall return at once to Netherwoods and she shall answer me to my entire satisfaction or leave my house What cruelty what duplicity In all my experience of girls I have never met with the like of it Let me go to my dear little Emily and try to forget what I have heard missus Ellmother led the good lady to Emily s room and returning to the lower part of the house went out into the garden The mental effort that she had made had left its result in an aching head and in an overpowering sense of depression A mouthful of fresh air will revive me she thought The front garden and back garden at the cottage communicated with each other Walking slowly round and round missus Ellmother heard footsteps on the road outside which stopped at the gate She looked through the grating and discovered Alban Morris Come in sir she said rejoiced to see him He obeyed in silence The full view of his face shocked missus Ellmother Never in her experience of the friend who had been so kind to her at Netherwoods had he looked so old and so haggard as he looked now Oh mister Alban I see how she has distressed you Don t take her at her word Keep a good heart sir young girls are never long together of the same mind Alban gave her his hand I mustn t speak about it he said Silence helps me to bear my misfortune as becomes a man I have had some hard blows in my time they don t seem to have blunted my sense of feeling as I thought they had Thank God she doesn t know how she has made me suffer I want to ask her pardon for having forgotten myself yesterday I spoke roughly to her at one time No I won t intrude on her I have said I am sorry in writing Do you mind giving it to her Good by and thank you I mustn t stay longer Miss Ladd expects me at Netherwoods Miss Ladd is in the house sir at this moment Here in London Upstairs with Miss Emily Upstairs Is Emily ill She is getting better sir Would you like to see Miss Ladd I should indeed I have something to say to her and time is of importance to me May I wait in the garden Why not in the parlor sir The parlor reminds me of happier days In time I may have courage enough to look at the room again Not now If she doesn t make it up with that good man missus Ellmother thought on her way back to the house my nurse child is what I have never believed her to be yet she s a fool In half an hour more Miss Ladd joined Alban on the little plot of grass behind the cottage I bring Emily s reply to your letter she said Read it before you speak to me Alban read it Don t suppose you have offended me and be assured that I feel gratefully the tone in which your note is written I try to write forbearingly on my side I wish I could write acceptably as well It is not to be done I am as unable as ever to enter into your motives You are not my relation you were under no obligation of secrecy you heard me speak ignorantly of the murder of my father as if it had been the murder of a stranger and yet you kept me deliberately cruelly kept me deceived The remembrance of it burns me like fire I cannot oh Alban I cannot restore you to the place in my estimation which you have lost If you wish to help me to bear my trouble I entreat you not to write to me again Alban offered the letter silently to Miss Ladd She signed to him to keep it I know what Emily has written she said and I have told her what I now tell you she is wrong in every way wrong It is the misfortune of her impetuous nature that she rushes to conclusions and those conclusions once formed she holds to them with all the strength of her character In this matter she has looked at her side of the question exclusively she is blind to your side Not willfully Alban interposed Miss Ladd looked at him with admiration You defend Emily she said I love her Alban answered Miss Ladd felt for him as missus Ellmother had felt for him Trust to time mister Morris she resumed The danger to be afraid of is the danger of some headlong action on her part in the interval Who can say what the end may be if she persists in her present way of thinking There is something monstrous in a young girl declaring that it is her duty to pursue a murderer and to bring him to justice Don t you see it yourself Alban still defended Emily It seems to me to be a natural impulse he said natural and noble Noble Miss Ladd exclaimed Yes for it grows out of the love which has not died with her father s death Then you encourage her With my whole heart if she would give me the opportunity We won t pursue the subject mister Morris I am told by missus Ellmother that you have something to say to me What is it I have to ask you Alban replied to let me resign my situation at Netherwoods Miss Ladd was not only surprised she was also a very rare thing with her inclined to be suspicious After what he had said to Emily it occurred to her that Alban might be meditating some desperate project with the hope of recovering his lost place in her favor Have you heard of some better employment she asked I have heard of no employment My mind is not in a state to give the necessary attention to my pupils Is that your only reason for wishing to leave me It is one of my reasons The only one which you think it necessary to mention Yes I shall be sorry to lose you mister Morris Believe me Miss Ladd I am not ungrateful for your kindness Will you let me in all kindness say something more Miss Ladd answered I don t intrude on your secrets I only hope that you have no rash project in view I don t understand you Miss Ladd Yes mister Morris you do She shook hands with him and went back to Emily CHAPTER LI THE DOCTOR SEES Alban returned to Netherwoods to continue his services until another master could be found to take his place By a later train Miss Ladd followed him Emily was too well aware of the importance of the mistress s presence to the well being of the school to permit her to remain at the cottage It was understood that they were to correspond and that Emily s room was waiting for her at Netherwoods whenever she felt inclined to occupy it missus Ellmother made the tea that evening earlier than usual Being alone again with Emily it struck her that she might take advantage of her position to say a word in Alban s favor She had chosen her time unfortunately The moment she pronounced the name Emily checked her by a look and spoke of another person that person being Miss Jethro missus Ellmother at once entered her protest in her own downright way Whatever you do she said don t go back to that What does Miss Jethro matter to you I am more interested in her than you suppose I happen to know why she left the school Begging your pardon miss that s quite impossible She left the school Emily persisted for a serious reason Miss Ladd discovered that she had used false references Good Lord who told you that You see I know it I asked Miss Ladd how she got her information She was bound by a promise never to mention the person s name I didn t say it to her but I may say it to you I am afraid I have an idea of who the person was No missus Ellmother obstinately asserted you can t possibly know who it was How should you know Do you wish me to repeat what I heard in that room opposite when my aunt was dying Drop it Miss Emily For God s sake drop it I can t drop it It s dreadful to me to have suspicions of my aunt and no better reason for them than what she said in a state of delirium Tell me if you love me was it her wandering fancy or was it the truth As I hope to be saved Miss Emily I can only guess as you do I don t rightly know My mistress trusted me half way as it were I m afraid I have a rough tongue of my own sometimes I offended her and from that time she kept her own counsel What she did she did in the dark so far as I was concerned How did you offend her I shall be obliged to speak of your father if I tell you how Speak of him He was not to blame mind that missus Ellmother said earnestly If I wasn t certain of what I say now you wouldn t get a word out of me Good harmless man there s no denying it he was in love with Miss Jethro What s the matter Emily was thinking of her memorable conversation with the disgraced teacher on her last night at school Nothing she answered Go on If he had not tried to keep it secret from us missus Ellmother resumed your aunt might never have taken it into her head that he was entangled in a love affair of the shameful sort I don t deny that I helped her in her inquiries but it was only because I felt sure from the first that the more she discovered the more certainly my master s innocence would show itself He used to go away and visit Miss Jethro privately In the time when your aunt trusted me we never could find out where She made that discovery afterward for herself I can t tell you how long afterward and she spent money in employing mean wretches to pry into Miss Jethro s past life She had if you will excuse me for saying it an old maid s hatred of the handsome young woman who lured your father away from home and set up a secret in a manner of speaking between her brother and herself I won t tell you how we looked at letters and other things which he forgot to leave under lock and key I will only say there was one bit in a journal he kept which made me ashamed of myself I read it out to Miss Letitia and I told her in so many words not to count any more on me No I haven t got a copy of the words I can remember them without a copy Even if my religion did not forbid me to peril my soul by leading a life of sin with this woman whom I love that was how it began the thought of my daughter would keep me pure No conduct of mine shall ever make me unworthy of my child s affection and respect There I m making you cry I won t stay here any longer All that I had to say has been said Nobody but Miss Ladd knows for certain whether your aunt was innocent or guilty in the matter of Miss Jethro s disgrace Please to excuse me my work s waiting downstairs From time to time as she pursued her domestic labors missus Ellmother thought of Mirabel Hours on hours had passed and the doctor had not appeared Was he too busy to spare even a few minutes of his time Or had the handsome little gentleman after promising so fairly failed to perform his errand This last doubt wronged Mirabel He had engaged to return to the doctor s house and he kept his word Doctor Allday was at home again and was seeing patients Introduced in his turn Mirabel had no reason to complain of his reception At the same time after he had stated the object of his visit something odd began to show itself in the doctor s manner He looked at Mirabel with an appearance of uneasy curiosity and he contrived an excuse for altering the visitor s position in the room so that the light fell full on Mirabel s face I fancy I must have seen you the doctor said at some former time I am ashamed to say I don t remember it Mirabel answered Ah very likely I m wrong I ll call on Miss Emily sir you may depend on it Left in his consulting room Doctor Allday failed to ring the bell which summoned the next patient who was waiting for him He took his diary from the table drawer and turned to the daily entries for the past month of July Arriving at the fifteenth day of the month he glanced at the first lines of writing A visit from a mysterious lady calling herself Miss Jethro Our conference led to some very unexpected results No that was not what he was in search of He looked a little lower down and read on regularly from that point as follows Called on Miss Emily in great anxiety about the discoveries which she might make among her aunt s papers Papers all destroyed thank God except the Handbill offering a reward for discovery of the murderer which she found in the scrap book Gave her back the Handbill Emily much surprised that the wretch should have escaped with such a careful description of him circulated everywhere She read the description aloud to me in her nice clear voice Supposed age between twenty five and thirty years A well made man of small stature Fai r complexion delicate features clear blue eyes Hair light and cut rather short Clean shaven with the exception of narrow half whiskers and so on Emily at a loss to understand how the fugitive could disguise himself Reminded her that he could effectually disguise his head and face with time to help him by letting his hair grow long and cultivating his beard Emily not convinced even by this self evident view of the case Changed the subject The doctor put away his diary and rang the bell Curious he thought That dandified little clergyman has certainly reminded me of my discussion with Emily more than two months since Was it his flowing hair I wonder or his splendid beard Good God suppose it should turn out He was interrupted by the appearance of his patient Other ailing people followed Doctor Allday s mind was professionally occupied for the rest of the evening CHAPTER LII IF I COULD FIND A FRIEND Shortly after Miss Ladd had taken her departure a parcel arrived for Emily bearing the name of a bookseller printed on the label It was large and it was heavy Reading enough I should think to last for a lifetime missus Ellmother remarked after carrying the parcel upstairs Emily called her back as she was leaving the room I want to caution you she said before Miss Wyvil comes Don t tell her don t tell anybody how my father met his death If other persons are taken into our confidence they will talk of it We don t know how near to us the murderer may be The slightest hint may put him on his guard Oh miss are you still thinking of that I think of nothing else Bad for your mind Miss Emily and bad for your body as your looks show I wish you would take counsel with some discreet person before you move in this matter by yourself Emily sighed wearily In my situation where is the person whom I can trust You can trust the good doctor Can I Perhaps I was wrong when I told you I wouldn t see him He might be of some use to me missus Ellmother made the most of this concession in the fear that Emily might change her mind Doctor Allday may call on you tomorrow she said Do you mean that you have sent for him Don t be angry I did it for the best and mister Mirabel agreed with me mister Mirabel What have you told mister Mirabel Nothing except that you are ill When he heard that he proposed to go for the doctor He will be here again to morrow to ask for news of your health Will you see him I don t know yet I have other things to think of Bring Miss Wyvil up here when she comes Am I to get the spare room ready for her No She is staying with her father at the London house Emily made that reply almost with an air of relief When Cecilia arrived it was only by an effort that she could show grateful appreciation of the sympathy of her dearest friend When the visit came to an end she felt an ungrateful sense of freedom the restraint was off her mind she could think again of the one terrible subject that had any interest for her now Over love over friendship over the natural enjoyment of her young life predominated the blighting resolution which bound her to avenge her father s death Her dearest remembrances of him tender remembrances once now burned in her to use her own words like fire It was no ordinary love that had bound parent and child together in the bygone time Emily had grown from infancy to girlhood owing all the brightness of her life a life without a mother without brothers without sisters to her father alone To submit to lose this beloved this only companion by the cruel stroke of disease was of all trials of resignation the hardest to bear But to be severed from him by the murderous hand of a man was more than Emily s fervent nature could passively endure Before the garden gate had closed on her friend she had returned to her one thought she was breathing again her one aspiration The books that she had ordered with her own purpose in view books that might supply her want of experience and might reveal the perils which beset the course that lay before her were unpacked and spread out on the table Hour after hour when the old servant believed that her mistress was in bed she was absorbed over biographies in English and French which related the stratagems by means of which famous policemen had captured the worst criminals of their time From these she turned to works of fiction which found their chief topic of interest in dwelling on the discovery of hidden crime The night passed and dawn glimmered through the window and still she opened book after book with sinking courage and still she gained nothing but the disheartening conviction of her inability to carry out her own plans Almost every page that she turned over revealed the immovable obstacles set in her way by her sex and her age Could she mix with the people or visit the scenes familiar to the experience of men in fact and in fiction who had traced the homicide to his hiding place and had marked him among his harmless fellow creatures with the brand of Cain No A young girl following or attempting to follow that career must reckon with insult and outrage paying their abominable tribute to her youth and her beauty at every turn What proportion would the men who might respect her bear to the men who might make her the object of advances which it was hardly possible to imagine without shuddering She crept exhausted to her bed the most helpless hopeless creature on the wide surface of the earth a girl self devoted to the task of a man Careful to perform his promise to Mirabel without delay the doctor called on Emily early in the morning before the hour at which he usually entered his consulting room Well What s the matter with the pretty young mistress he asked in his most abrupt manner when missus Ellmother opened the door Is it love or jealousy or a new dress with a wrinkle in it You will hear about it sir from Miss Emily herself I am forbidden to say anything But you mean to say something for all that Don t joke Doctor Allday The state of things here is a great deal too serious for joking Make up your mind to be surprised I say no more Before the doctor could ask what this meant Emily opened the parlor door Come in she said impatiently Doctor Allday s first greeting was strictly professional My dear child I never expected this he began You are looking wretchedly ill He attempted to feel her pulse She drew her hand away from him It s my mind that s ill she answered Feeling my pulse won t cure me of anxiety and distress I want advice I want help Dear old doctor you have always been a good friend to me be a better friend than ever now What can I do Promise you will keep secret what I am going to say to you and listen pray listen patiently till I have done Doctor Allday promised and listened He had been in some degree at least prepared for a surprise but the disclosure which now burst on him was more than his equanimity could sustain He looked at Emily in silent dismay She had surprised and shocked him not only by what she said but by what she unconsciously suggested Was it possible that Mirabel s personal appearance had produced on her the same impression which was present in his own mind His first impulse when he was composed enough to speak urged him to put the question cautiously If you happened to meet with the suspected man he said have you any means of identifying him None whatever doctor If you would only think it over He stopped her there convinced of the danger of encouraging her and resolved to act on his conviction I have enough to occupy me in my profession he said Ask your other friend to think it over What other friend mister Alban Morris The moment he pronounced the name he saw that he had touched on some painful association Has mister Morris refused to help you he inquired I have not asked him to help me Why There was no choice with such a man as Doctor Allday between offending him or answering him Emily adopted the last alternative On this occasion she had no reason to complain of his silence Your view of mister Morris s conduct surprises me he replied surprises me more than I can say he added remembering that he too was guilty of having kept her in ignorance of the truth out of regard mistaken regard as it now seemed to be for her peace of mind Be good to me and pass it over if I am wrong Emily said I can t dispute with you I can only tell you what I feel You have always been so kind to me may I count on your kindness still Doctor Allday relapsed into silence May I at least ask she went on if you know anything of persons She paused discouraged by the cold expression of inquiry in the old man s eyes as he looked at her What persons he said Persons whom I suspect Name them Emily named the landlady of the inn at Zeeland she could now place the right interpretation on missus Rook s conduct when the locket had been put into her hand at Netherwoods Doctor Allday answered shortly and stiffly he had never even seen missus Rook Emily mentioned Miss Jethro next and saw at once that she had interested him What do you suspect Miss Jethro of doing he asked I suspect her of knowing more of my father s death than she is willing to acknowledge Emily replied The doctor s manner altered for the better I agree with you he said frankly But I have some knowledge of that lady I warn you not to waste time and trouble in trying to discover the weak side of Miss Jethro That was not my experience of her at school Emily rejoined At the same time I don t know what may have happened since those days I may perhaps have lost the place I once held in her regard How Through my aunt Through your aunt I hope and trust I am wrong Emily continued but I fear my aunt had something to do with Miss Jethro s dismissal from the school and in that case Miss Jethro may have found it out Her eyes resting on the doctor suddenly brightened You know something about it she exclaimed He considered a little whether he should or should not tell her of the letter addressed by Miss Ladd to Miss Letitia which he had found at the cottage If I could satisfy you that your fears are well founded he asked would the discovery keep you away from Miss Jethro I should be ashamed to speak to her even if we met Very well I can tell you positively that your aunt was the person who turned Miss Jethro out of the school When I get home I will send you a letter that proves it Emily s head sank on her breast Why do I only hear of this now she said Because I had no reason for letting you know of it before to day If I have done nothing else I have at least succeeded in keeping you and Miss Jethro apart Emily looked at him in alarm He went on without appearing to notice that he had startled her I wish to God I could as easily put a stop to the mad project which you are contemplating The mad project Emily repeated Oh Doctor Allday Do you cruelly leave me to myself at the time of all others when I am most in need of your sympathy That appeal moved him He spoke more gently he pitied while he condemned her My poor dear child I should be cruel indeed if I encouraged you You are giving yourself up to an enterprise so shockingly unsuited to a young girl like you that I declare I contemplate it with horror Think I entreat you think and let me hear that you have yielded not to my poor entreaties but to your own better sense His voice faltered his eyes moistened I shall make a fool of myself he burst out furiously if I stay here any longer Good by He left her She walked to the window and looked out at the fair morning No one to feel for her no one to understand her nothing nearer that could speak to poor mortality of hope and encouragement than the bright heaven so far away She turned from the window The sun shines on the murderer she thought as it shines on me She sat down at the table and tried to quiet her mind to think steadily to some good purpose Of the few friends that she possessed every one had declared that she was in the wrong Had they lost the one loved being of all beings on earth and lost him by the hand of a homicide and that homicide free All that was faithful all that was devoted in the girl s nature held her to her desperate resolution as with a hand of iron If she shrank at that miserable moment it was not from her design it was from the sense of her own helplessness Oh if I had been a man she said to herself Oh if I could find a friend CHAPTER LIII THE FRIEND IS FOUND missus Ellmother looked into the parlor I told you mister Mirabel would call again she announced Here he is Has he asked to see me He leaves it entirely to you For a moment and a moment only Emily was undecided Show him in she said Mirabel s embarrassment was visible the moment he entered the room For the first time in his life in the presence of a woman the popular preacher was shy He who had taken hundreds of fair hands with sympathetic pressure he who had offered fluent consolation abroad and at home to beauty in distress was conscious of a rising color and was absolutely at a loss for words when Emily received him And yet though he appeared at disadvantage and worse still though he was aware of it himself there was nothing contemptible in his look and manner His silence and confusion revealed a change in him which inspired respect Love had developed this spoiled darling of foolish congregations this effeminate pet of drawing rooms and boudoirs into the likeness of a Man and no woman in Emily s position could have failed to see that it was love which she herself had inspired Equally ill at ease they both took refuge in the commonplace phrases suggested by the occasion These exhausted there was a pause Mirabel alluded to Cecilia as a means of continuing the conversation Have you seen Miss Wyvil he inquired She was here last night and I expect to see her again to day before she returns to Monksmoor with her father Do you go back with them Yes if you do I remain in London Then I remain in London too The strong feeling that was in him had forced its way to expression at last In happier days when she had persistently refused to let him speak to her seriously she would have been ready with a light hearted reply She was silent now Mirabel pleaded with her not to misunderstand him by an honest confession of his motives which presented him under a new aspect The easy plausible man who had hardly ever seemed to be in earnest before meant seriously meant what he said now May I try to explain myself he asked Certainly if you wish it Pray don t suppose me capable Mirabel said earnestly of presuming to pay you an idle compliment I cannot think of you alone and in trouble without feeling anxiety which can only be relieved in one way I must be near enough to hear of you day by day Not by repeating this visit Unless you wish it I will not again cross the threshold of your door missus Ellmother will tell me if your mind is more at ease missus Ellmother will tell me if there is any new trial of your fortitude She needn t even mention that I have been speaking to her at the door and she may be sure and you may be sure that I shall ask no inquisitive questions I can feel for you in your misfortune without wishing to know what that misfortune is If I can ever be of the smallest use think of me as your other servant Say to missus Ellmother I want him and say no more Where is the woman who could have resisted such devotion as this inspired truly inspired by herself Emily s eyes softened as she answered him You little know how your kindness touches me she said Don t speak of my kindness until you have put me to the proof he interposed Can a friend such a friend as I am I mean be of any use Of the greatest use if I could feel justified in trying you I entreat you to try me But mister Mirabel you don t know what I am thinking of I don t want to know I may be wrong My friends all say I am wrong I don t care what your friends say I don t care about any earthly thing but your tranquillity Does your dog ask whether you are right or wrong I am your dog I think of You and I think of nothing else She looked back through the experience of the last few days Miss Ladd missus Ellmother Doctor Allday not one of them had felt for her not one of them had spoken to her as this man had felt and had spoken She remembered the dreadful sense of solitude and helplessness which had wrung her heart in the interval before Mirabel came in Her father himself could hardly have been kinder to her than this friend of a few weeks only She looked at him through her tears she could say nothing that was eloquent nothing even that was adequate You are very good to me was her only acknowledgment of all that he had offered How poor it seemed to be and yet how much it meant He rose saying considerately that he would leave her to recover herself and would wait to hear if he was wanted No she said I must not let you go In common gratitude I ought to decide before you leave me and I do decide to take you into my confidence She hesitated her color rose a little I know how unselfishly you offer me your help she resumed I know you speak to me as a brother might speak to a sister He gently interrupted her No he said I can t honestly claim to do that And may I venture to remind you you know why She started Her eyes rested on him with a momentary expression of reproach Is it quite fair she asked in my situation to say that Would it have been quite fair he rejoined to allow you to deceive yourself Should I deserve to be taken into your confidence if I encouraged you to trust me under false pretenses Not a word more of those hopes on which the happiness of my life depends shall pass my lips unless you permit it In my devotion to your interests I promise to forget myself My motives may be misinterpreted my position may be misunderstood Ignorant people may take me for that other happier man who is an object of interest to you Stop mister Mirabel The person to whom you refer has no such claim on me as you suppose Dare I say how happy I am to hear it Will you forgive me I will forgive you if you say no more Their eyes met Completely overcome by the new hope that she had inspired Mirabel was unable to answer her His sensitive nerves trembled under emotion like the nerves of a woman his delicate complexion faded away slowly into whiteness Emily was alarmed he seemed to be on the point of fainting She ran to the window to open it more widely Pray don t trouble yourself he said I am easily agitated by any sudden sensation and I am a little overcome at this moment by my own happiness Let me give you a glass of wine Thank you I don t need it indeed You really feel better I feel quite well again and eager to hear how I can serve you It s a long story mister Mirabel and a dreadful story Dreadful Yes Let me tell you first how you can serve me I am in search of a man who has done me the cruelest wrong that one human creature can inflict on another But the chances are all against me I am only a woman and I don t know how to take even the first step toward discovery You will know when I guide you He reminded her tenderly of what she might expect from him and was rewarded by a grateful look Seeing nothing suspecting nothing they advanced together nearer and nearer to the end Once or twice Emily continued I spoke to you of my poor father when we were at Monksmoor and I must speak of him again You could have no interest in inquiring about a stranger and you cannot have heard how he died Pardon me I heard from mister Wyvil how he died You heard what I had told mister Wyvil Emily said I was wrong Wrong Mirabel exclaimed in a tone of courteous surprise Was it not a sudden death It was a sudden death Caused by disease of the heart Caused by no disease I have been deceived about my father s death and I have only discovered it a few days since At the impending moment of the frightful shock which she was innocently about to inflict on him she stopped doubtful whether it would be best to relate how the discovery had been made or to pass at once to the result Mirabel supposed that she had paused to control her agitation He was so immeasurably far away from the faintest suspicion of what was coming that he exerted his ingenuity in the hope of sparing her I can anticipate the rest he said Your sad loss has been caused by some fatal accident Let us change the subject tell me more of that man whom I must help you to find It will only distress you to dwell on your father s death Distress me she repeated His death maddens me Oh don t say that Hear me hear me My father died murdered at Zeeland and the man you must help me to find is the wretch who killed him She started to her feet with a cry of terror Mirabel dropped from his chair senseless to the floor CHAPTER LIV THE END OF THE FAINTING FIT Emily recovered her presence of mind She opened the door so as to make a draught of air in the room and called for water Returning to Mirabel she loosened his cravat missus Ellmother came in just in time to prevent her from committing a common error in the treatment of fainting persons by raising Mirabel s head The current of air and the sprinkling of water over his face soon produced their customary effect He ll come round directly missus Ellmother remarked Your aunt was sometimes taken with these swoons miss and I know something about them He looks a poor weak creature in spite of his big beard Has anything frightened him Emily little knew how correctly that chance guess had hit on the truth Nothing can possibly have frightened him she replied I am afraid he is in bad health He turned suddenly pale while we were talking and I thought he was going to be taken ill he made light of it and seemed to recover Unfortunately I was right it was the threatening of a fainting fit he dropped on the floor a minute afterward A sigh fluttered over Mirabel s lips His eyes opened looked at missus Ellmother in vacant terror and closed again Emily whispered to her to leave the room The old woman smiled satirically as she opened the door then looked back with a sudden change of humor To see the kind young mistress bending over the feeble little clergyman set her by some strange association of ideas thinking of Alban Morris Ah she muttered to herself on her way out I call him a Man There was wine in the sideboard the wine which Emily had once already offered in vain Mirabel drank it eagerly this time He looked round the room as if he wished to be sure that they were alone Have I fallen to a low place in your estimation he asked smiling faintly I am afraid you will think poorly enough of your new ally after this I only think you should take more care of your health Emily replied with sincere interest in his recovery Let me leave you to rest on the sofa He refused to remain at the cottage he asked with a sudden change to fretfulness if she would let her servant get him a cab She ventured to doubt whether he was quite strong enough yet to go away by himself He reiterated piteously reiterated his request A passing cab was stopped directly Emily accompanied him to the gate I know what to do he said in a hurried absent way Rest and a little tonic medicine will soon set me right The clammy coldness of his skin made Emily shudder as they shook hands You won t think the worse of me for this he asked How can you imagine such a thing she answered warmly Will you see me if I come to morrow I shall be anxious to see you So they parted Emily returned to the house pitying him with all her heart BOOK THE SIXTH HERE AND THERE CHAPTER LV MIRABEL SEES HIS WAY Reaching the hotel at which he was accustomed to stay when he was in London Mirabel locked the door of his room He looked at the houses on the opposite side of the street His mind was in such a state of morbid distrust that he lowered the blind over the window In solitude and obscurity the miserable wretch sat down in a corner and covered his face with his hands and tried to realize what had happened to him Nothing had been said at the fatal interview with Emily which could have given him the slightest warning of what was to come Her father s name absolutely unknown to him when he fled from the inn had only been communicated to the public by the newspaper reports of the adjourned inquest At the time when those reports appeared he was in hiding under circumstances which prevented him from seeing a newspaper While the murder was still a subject of conversation he was in France far out of the track of English travelers and he remained on the continent until the summer of eighteen hundred and eighty one No exercise of discretion on his part could have extricated him from the terrible position in which he was now placed He stood pledged to Emily to discover the man suspected of the murder of her father and that man was himself What refuge was left open to him If he took to flight his sudden disappearance would be a suspicious circumstance in itself and would therefore provoke inquiries which might lead to serious results Supposing that he overlooked the risk thus presented would he be capable of enduring a separation from Emily which might be a separation for life Even in the first horror of discovering his situation her influence remained unshaken the animating spirit of the one manly capacity for resistance which raised him above the reach of his own fears The only prospect before him which he felt himself to be incapable of contemplating was the prospect of leaving Emily Having arrived at this conclusion his fears urged him to think of providing for his own safety The first precaution to adopt was to separate Emily from friends whose advice might be hostile to his interests perhaps even subversive of his security To effect this design he had need of an ally whom he could trust That ally was at his disposal far away in the north At the time when Francine s jealousy began to interfere with all freedom of intercourse between Emily and himself at Monksmoor he had contemplated making arrangements which might enable them to meet at the house of his invalid sister missus Delvin He had spoken of her and of the bodily affliction which confined her to her room in terms which had already interested Emily In the present emergency he decided on returning to the subject and on hastening the meeting between the two women which he had first suggested at mister Wyvil s country seat No time was to be lost in carrying out this intention He wrote to missus Delvin by that day s post confiding to her in the first place the critical position in which he now found himself This done he proceeded as follows To your sound judgment dearest Agatha it may appear that I am making myself needlessly uneasy about the future Two persons only know that I am the man who escaped from the inn at Zeeland You are one of them and Miss Jethro is the other On you I can absolutely rely and after my experience of her I ought to feel sure of Miss Jethro I admit this but I cannot get over my distrust of Emily s friends I fear the cunning old doctor I doubt mister Wyvil I hate Alban Morris Do me a favor my dear Invite Emily to be your guest and so separate her from these friends The old servant who attends on her will be included in the invitation of course missus Ellmother is as I believe devoted to the interests of mister Alban Morris she will be well out of the way of doing mischief while we have her safe in your northern solitude There is no fear that Emily will refuse your invitation In the first place she is already interested in you In the second place I shall consider the small proprieties of social life and instead of traveling with her to your house I shall follow by a later train In the third place I am now the chosen adviser in whom she trusts and what I tell her to do she will do It pains me really and truly pains me to be compelled to deceive her but the other alternative is to reveal myself as the wretch of whom she is in search Was there ever such a situation And oh Agatha I am so fond of her If I fail to persuade her to be my wife I don t care what becomes of me I used to think disgrace and death on the scaffold the most frightful prospect that a man can contemplate In my present frame of mind a life without Emily may just as well end in that way as in any other When we are together in your old sea beaten tower do your best my dear to incline the heart of this sweet girl toward me If she remains in London how do I know that mister Morris may not recover the place he has lost in her good opinion The bare idea of it turns me cold There is one more point on which I must touch before I can finish my letter When you last wrote you told me that Sir Jervis Redwood was not expected to live much longer and that the establishment would be broken up after his death Can you find out for me what will become under the circumstances of mister and missus Rook So far as I am concerned I don t doubt that the alteration in my personal appearance which has protected me for years past may be trusted to preserve me from recognition by these two people But it is of the utmost importance remembering the project to which Emily has devoted herself that she should not meet with missus Rook They have been already in correspondence and missus Rook has expressed an intention if the opportunity offers itself of calling at the cottage Another reason and a pressing reason for removing Emily from London We can easily keep the Rooks out of your house but I own I should feel more at my ease if I heard that they had left Northumberland With that confession missus Delvin s brother closed his letter CHAPTER LVI ALBAN SEES HIS WAY During the first days of Mirabel s sojourn at his hotel in London events were in progress at Netherwoods affecting the interests of the man who was the especial object of his distrust Not long after Miss Ladd had returned to her school she heard of an artist who was capable of filling the place to be vacated by Alban Morris It was then the twenty third of the month In four days more the new master would be ready to enter on his duties and Alban would be at liberty On the twenty fourth Alban received a telegram which startled him The person sending the message was missus Ellmother and the words were Meet me at your railway station to day at two o clock He found the old woman in the waiting room and he met with a rough reception Minutes are precious mister Morris she said you are two minutes late The next train to London stops here in half an hour and I must go back by it Good heavens what brings you here Is Emily Emily is well enough in health if that s what you mean As to why I come here the reason is that it s a deal easier for me worse luck to take this journey than to write a letter One good turn deserves another I don t forget how kind you were to me away there at the school and I can t and won t see what s going on at the cottage behind your back without letting you know of it Oh you needn t be alarmed about her I ve made an excuse to get away for a few hours but I haven t left her by herself Miss Wyvil has come to London again and mister Mirabel spends the best part of his time with her Excuse me for a moment will you I m so thirsty after the journey I can hardly speak She presented herself at the counter in the waiting room I ll trouble you young woman for a glass of ale She returned to Alban in a better humor It s not bad stuff that When I have said my say I ll have a drop more just to wash the taste of mister Mirabel out of my mouth Wait a bit I have something to ask you How much longer are you obliged to stop here teaching the girls to draw I leave Netherwoods in three days more Alban replied That s all right You may be in time to bring Miss Emily to her senses yet What do you mean I mean if you don t stop it she will marry the parson I can t believe it missus Ellmother I won t believe it Ah it s a comfort to him poor fellow to say that Look here mister Morris this is how it stands You re in disgrace with Miss Emily and he profits by it I was fool enough to take a liking to mister Mirabel when I first opened the door to him I know better now He got on the blind side of me and now he has got on the blind side of her Shall I tell you how By doing what you would have done if you had had the chance He s helping her or pretending to help her I don t know which to find the man who murdered poor mister Brown After four years And when all the police in England with a reward to encourage them did their best and it came to nothing Never mind that Alban said impatiently I want to know how mister Mirabel is helping her That s more than I can tell you You don t suppose they take me into their confidence All I can do is to pick up a word here and there when fine weather tempts them out into the garden She tells him to suspect missus Rook and to make inquiries after Miss Jethro And he has his plans and he writes them down which is dead against his doing anything useful in my opinion I don t hold with your scribblers At the same time I wouldn t count too positively in your place on his being likely to fail That little Mirabel if it wasn t for his beard I should believe he was a woman and a sickly woman too he fainted in our house the other day that little Mirabel is in earnest Rather than leave Miss Emily from Saturday to Monday he has got a parson out of employment to do his Sunday work for him And what s more he has persuaded her for some reasons of his own to leave London next week Is she going back to Monksmoor Not she mister Mirabel has got a sister a widow lady she s a cripple or something of the sort Her name is missus Delvin She lives far away in the north country by the sea and Miss Emily is going to stay with her Are you sure of that Sure I ve seen the letter Do you mean the letter of invitation Yes I do Miss Emily herself showed it to me I m to go with her in attendance on my mistress as the lady puts it This I will say for missus Delvin her handwriting is a credit to the school that taught her and the poor bedridden creature words her invitation so nicely that I myself couldn t have resisted it and I m a hard one as you know You don t seem to heed me mister Morris I beg your pardon I was thinking Thinking of what if I may make so bold Of going back to London with you instead of waiting till the new master comes to take my place Don t do that sir You would do harm instead of good if you showed yourself at the cottage now Besides it would not be fair to Miss Ladd to leave her before the other man takes your girls off your hands Trust me to look after your interests and don t go near Miss Emily don t even write to her unless you have got something to say about the murder which she will be eager to hear Make some discovery in that direction mister Morris while the parson is only trying to do it or pretending to do it and I ll answer for the result Look at the clock In ten minutes more the train will be here My memory isn t as good as it was but I do think I have told you all I had to tell You are the best of good friends Alban said warmly Never mind about that sir If you want to do a friendly thing in return tell me if you know what has become of Miss de Sor She has returned to Netherwoods Aha Miss Ladd is as good as her word Would you mind writing to tell me of it if Miss de Sor leaves the school again Good Lord there she is on the platform with bag and baggage Don t let her see me mister Morris If she comes in here I shall set the marks of my ten finger nails on that false face of hers as sure as I am a Christian woman Alban placed himself at the door so as to hide missus Ellmother There indeed was Francine accompanied by one of the teachers at the school She took a seat on the bench outside the booking office in a state of sullen indifference absorbed in herself noticing nothing Urged by ungovernable curiosity missus Ellmother stole on tiptoe to Alban s side to look at her To a person acquainted with the circumstances there could be no possible doubt of what had happened Francine had failed to excuse herself and had been dismissed from Miss Ladd s house I would have traveled to the world s end missus Ellmother said to see that She returned to her place in the waiting room perfectly satisfied The teacher noticed Alban on leaving the booking office after taking the tickets I shall be glad she said looking toward Francine when I have resigned the charge of that young lady to the person who is to receive her in London Is she to be sent back to her parents Alban asked We don t know yet Miss Ladd will write to saint Domingo by the next mail In the meantime her father s agent in London the same person who pays her allowance takes care of her until he hears from the West Indies Does she consent to this She doesn t seem to care what becomes of her Miss Ladd has given her every opportunity of explaining and excusing herself and has produced no impression You can see the state she is in Our good mistress always hopeful even in the worst cases as you know thinks she is feeling ashamed of herself and is too proud and self willed to own it My own idea is that some secret disappointment is weighing on her mind Perhaps I am wrong No Miss Ladd was wrong and the teacher was right The passion of revenge being essentially selfish in its nature is of all passions the narrowest in its range of view In gratifying her jealous hatred of Emily Francine had correctly foreseen consequences as they might affect the other object of her enmity Alban Morris But she had failed to perceive the imminent danger of another result which in a calmer frame of mind might not have escaped discovery In triumphing over Emily and Alban she had been the indirect means of inflicting on herself the bitterest of all disappointments she had brought Emily and Mirabel together The first forewarning of this catastrophe had reached her on hearing that Mirabel would not return to Monksmoor Her worst fears had been thereafter confirmed by a letter from Cecilia which had followed her to Netherwoods From that moment she who had made others wretched paid the penalty in suffering as keen as any that she had inflicted Completely prostrated powerless through ignorance of his address in London to make a last appeal to Mirabel she was literally as had just been said careless what became of her When the train approached she sprang to her feet advanced to the edge of the platform and suddenly drew back shuddering The teacher looked in terror at Alban Had the desperate girl meditated throwing herself under the wheels of the engine The thought had been in both their minds but neither of them acknowledged it Francine stepped quietly into the carriage when the train drew up and laid her head back in a corner and closed her eyes missus Ellmother took her place in another compartment and beckoned to Alban to speak to her at the window Where can I see you when you go to London she asked At Doctor Allday s house On what day On Tuesday next CHAPTER LVII APPROACHING THE END Alban reached London early enough in the afternoon to find the doctor at his luncheon Too late to see missus Ellmother he announced Sit down and have something to eat Has she left any message for me A message my good friend that you won t like to hear She is off with her mistress this morning on a visit to mister Mirabel s sister Does he go with them No he follows by a later train Has missus Ellmother mentioned the address There it is in her own handwriting Alban read the address missus Delvin The Clink Belford Northumberland Turn to the back of that bit of paper the doctor said missus Ellmother has written something on it She had written these words No discoveries made by mister Mirabel up to this time Sir Jervis Redwood is dead The Rooks are believed to be in Scotland and Miss Emily if need be is to help the parson to find them No news of Miss Jethro Now you have got your information Doctor Allday resumed let me have a look at you You re not in a rage that s a good sign to begin with I am not the less determined Alban answered To bring Emily to her senses the doctor asked To do what Mirabel has not done and then to let her choose between us Ay ay Your good opinion of her hasn t altered though she has treated you so badly My good opinion makes allowance for the state of my poor darling s mind after the shock that has fallen on her Alban answered quietly She is not my Emily now She will be my Emily yet I told her I was convinced of it in the old days at school and my conviction is as strong as ever Have you seen her since I have been away at Netherwoods Yes and she is as angry with me as she is with you For the same reason No no I heard enough to warn me to hold my tongue I refused to help her that s all You are a man and you may run risks which no young girl ought to encounter Do you remember when I asked you to drop all further inquiries into the murder for Emily s sake The circumstances have altered since that time Can I be of any use Of the greatest use if you can give me Miss Jethro s address Oh You mean to begin in that way do you Yes You know that Miss Jethro visited me at Netherwoods Go on She showed me your answer to a letter which she had written to you Have you got that letter Doctor Allday produced it The address was at a post office in a town on the south coast Looking up when he had copied it Alban saw the doctor s eyes fixed on him with an oddly mingled expression partly of sympathy partly of hesitation Have you anything to suggest he asked You will get nothing out of Miss Jethro the doctor answered unless there he stopped Unless what Unless you can frighten her How am I to do that After a little reflection Doctor Allday returned without any apparent reason to the subject of his last visit to Emily There was one thing she said in the course of our talk he continued which struck me as being sensible possibly for we are all more or less conceited because I agreed with her myself She suspects Miss Jethro of knowing more about that damnable murder than Miss Jethro is willing to acknowledge If you want to produce the right effect on her he looked hard at Alban and checked himself once more Well what am I to do Tell her you have an idea of who the murderer is But I have no idea But I have Good God what do you mean Don t mistake me An impression has been produced on my mind that s all Call it a freak or fancy worth trying perhaps as a bold experiment and worth nothing more Come a little nearer My housekeeper is an excellent woman but I have once or twice caught her rather too near to that door I think I ll whisper it He did whisper it In breathless wonder Alban heard of the doubt which had crossed Doctor Allday s mind on the evening when Mirabel had called at his house You look as if you didn t believe it the doctor remarked I m thinking of Emily For her sake I hope and trust you are wrong Ought I to go to her at once I don t know what to do Find out first my good fellow whether I am right or wrong You can do it if you will run the risk with Miss Jethro Alban recovered himself His old friend s advice was clearly the right advice to follow He examined his railway guide and then looked at his watch If I can find Miss Jethro he answered I ll risk it before the day is out The doctor accompanied him to the door You will write to me won t you Without fail Thank you and good by BOOK THE SEVENTH THE CLINK CHAPTER LVIII A COUNCIL OF TWO Early in the last century one of the picturesque race of robbers and murderers practicing the vices of humanity on the borderlands watered by the river Tweed built a tower of stone on the coast of Northumberland He lived joyously in the perpetration of atrocities and he died penitent under the direction of his priest Since that event he has figured in poems and pictures and has been greatly admired by modern ladies and gentlemen whom he would have outraged and robbed if he had been lucky enough to meet with them in the good old times His son succeeded him and failed to profit by the paternal example that is to say he made the fatal mistake of fighting for other people instead of fighting for himself In the rebellion of Forty Five this northern squire sided to serious purpose with Prince Charles and the Highlanders He lost his head and his children lost their inheritance In the lapse of years the confiscated property fell into the hands of strangers the last of whom having a taste for the turf discovered in course of time that he was in want of money A retired merchant named Delvin originally of French extraction took a liking to the wild situation and purchased the tower His wife already in failing health had been ordered by the doctors to live a quiet life by the sea Her husband s death left her a rich and lonely widow by day and night alike a prisoner in her room wasted by disease and having but two interests which reconciled her to life writing poetry in the intervals of pain and paying the debts of a reverend brother who succeeded in the pulpit and prospered nowhere else In the later days of its life the tower had been greatly improved as a place of residence The contrast was remarkable between the dreary gray outer walls and the luxuriously furnished rooms inside rising by two at a time to the lofty eighth story of the building Among the scattered populace of the country round the tower was still known by the odd name given to it in the bygone time The Clink It had been so called as was supposed in allusion to the noise made by loose stones washed backward and forward at certain times of the tide in hollows of the rock on which the building stood On the evening of her arrival at missus Delvin s retreat Emily retired at an early hour fatigued by her long journey Mirabel had an opportunity of speaking with his sister privately in her own room Send me away Agatha if I disturb you he said and let me know when I can see you in the morning My dear Miles have you forgotten that I am never able to sleep in calm weather My lullaby for years past has been the moaning of the great North Sea under my window Listen There is not a sound outside on this peaceful night It is the right time of the tide just now and yet the clink is not to be heard Is the moon up Mirabel opened the curtains The whole sky is one great abyss of black he answered If I was superstitious I should think that horrid darkness a bad omen for the future Are you suffering Agatha Not just now I suppose I look sadly changed for the worse since you saw me last But for the feverish brightness of her eyes she would have looked like a corpse Her wrinkled forehead her hollow cheeks her white lips told their terrible tale of the suffering of years The ghastly appearance of her face was heightened by the furnishing of the room This doomed woman dying slowly day by day delighted in bright colors and sumptuous materials The paper on the walls the curtains the carpet presented the hues of the rainbow She lay on a couch covered with purple silk under draperies of green velvet to keep her warm Rich lace hid h er scanty hair turning prematurely gray brilliant rings glittered on her bony fingers The room was in a blaze of light from lamps and candles Even the wine at her side that kept her alive had been decanted into a bottle of lustrous Venetian glass My grave is open she used to say and I want all these beautiful things to keep me from looking at it I should die at once if I was left in the dark Her brother sat by the couch thinking Shall I tell you what is in your mind she asked Mirabel humored the caprice of the moment Tell me he said You want to know what I think of Emily she answered Your letter told me you were in love but I didn t believe your letter I have always doubted whether you were capable of feeling true love until I saw Emily The moment she entered the room I knew that I had never properly appreciated my brother You are in love with her Miles and you are a better man than I thought you Does that express my opinion Mirabel took her wasted hand and kissed it gratefully What a position I am in he said To love her as I love her and if she knew the truth to be the object of her horror to be the man whom she would hunt to the scaffold as an act of duty to the memory of her father You have left out the worst part of it missus Delvin reminded him You have bound yourself to help her to find the man Your one hope of persuading her to become your wife rests on your success in finding him And you are the man There is your situation You can t submit to it How can you escape from it You are trying to frighten me Agatha I am trying to encourage you to face your position boldly I am doing my best Mirabel said with sullen resignation Fortune has favored me so far I have really and truly been unable to satisfy Emily by discovering Miss Jethro She has left the place at which I saw her last there is no trace to be found of her and Emily knows it Don t forget missus Delvin replied that there is a trace to be found of missus Rook and that Emily expects you to follow it Mirabel shuddered I am surrounded by dangers whichever way I look he said Do what I may it turns out to be wrong I was wrong perhaps when I brought Emily here No I could easily make an excuse Mirabel persisted and take her back to London And for all you know to the contrary his wiser sister replied missus Rook may go to London and you may take Emily back in time to receive her at the cottage In every way you are safer in my old tower And don t forget you have got my money to help you if you want it In my belief Miles you will want it You are the dearest and best of sisters What do you recommend me to do What you would have been obliged to do missus Delvin answered if you had remained in London You must go to Redwood Hall tomorrow as Emily has arranged it If missus Rook is not there you must ask for her address in Scotland If nobody knows the address you must still bestir yourself in trying to find it And when you do fall in with missus Rook Well Take care wherever it may be that you see her privately Mirabel was alarmed Don t keep me in suspense he burst out Tell me what you propose Never mind what I propose to night Before I can tell you what I have in my mind I must know whether missus Rook is in England or Scotland Bring me that information to morrow and I shall have something to say to you Hark The wind is rising the rain is falling There is a chance of sleep for me I shall soon hear the sea Good night Good night dearest and thank you again and again CHAPTER LIX THE ACCIDENT AT BELFORD Early in the morning Mirabel set forth for Redwood Hall in one of the vehicles which missus Delvin still kept at The Clink for the convenience of visitors He returned soon after noon having obtained information of the whereabout of missus Rook and her husband When they had last been heard of they were at Lasswade near Edinburgh Whether they had or had not obtained the situation of which they were in search neither Miss Redwood nor any one else at the Hall could tell In half an hour more another horse was harnessed and Mirabel was on his way to the railway station at Belford to follow missus Rook at Emily s urgent request Before his departure he had an interview with his sister missus Delvin was rich enough to believe implicitly in the power of money Her method of extricating her brother from the serious difficulties that beset him was to make it worth the while of mister and missus Rook to leave England Their passage to America would be secretly paid and they would take with them a letter of credit addressed to a banker in New York If Mirabel failed to discover them after they had sailed Emily could not blame his want of devotion to her interests He understood this but he remained desponding and irresolute even with the money in his hands The one person who could rouse his courage and animate his hope was also the one person who must know nothing of what had passed between his sister and himself He had no choice but to leave Emily without being cheered by her bright looks invigorated by her inspiriting words Mirabel went away on his doubtful errand with a heavy heart The Clink was so far from the nearest post town that the few letters usually addressed to the tower were delivered by private arrangement with a messenger The man s punctuality depended on the convenience of his superiors employed at the office Sometimes he arrived early and sometimes he arrived late On this particular morning he presented himself at half past one o clock with a letter for Emily and when missus Ellmother smartly reproved him for the delay he coolly attributed it to the hospitality of friends whom he had met on the road The letter directed to Emily at the cottage had been forwarded from London by the person left in charge It addressed her as Honored Miss She turned at once to the end and discovered the signature of missus Rook And mister Mirabel has gone Emily exclaimed just when his presence is of the greatest importance to us Shrewd missus Ellmother suggested that it might be as well to read the letter first and then to form an opinion Emily read it Lasswade near Edinburgh Sept twenty sixth HONORED MISS I take up my pen to bespeak your kind sympathy for my husband and myself two old people thrown on the world again by the death of our excellent master We are under a month s notice to leave Redwood Hall Hearing of a situation at this place also that our expenses would be paid if we applied personally we got leave of absence and made our application The lady and her son are either the stingiest people that ever lived or they have taken a dislike to me and my husband and they make money a means of getting rid of us easily Suffice it to say that we have refused to accept starvation wages and that we are still out of place It is just possible that you may have heard of something to suit us So I write at once knowing that good chances are often lost through needless delay We stop at Belford on our way back to see some friends of my husband and we hope to get to Redwood Hall in good time on the twenty eighth Would you please address me to care of Miss Redwood in case you know of any good situation for which we could apply Perhaps we may be driven to try our luck in London In this case will you permit me to have the honor of presenting my respects as I ventured to propose when I wrote to you a little time since I beg to remain Honored Miss Your humble servant R ROOK Emily handed the letter to missus Ellmother Read it she said and tell me what you think I think you had better be careful Careful of missus Rook Yes and careful of missus Delvin too Emily was astonished Are you really speaking seriously she said missus Delvin is a most interesting person so patient under her sufferings so kind so clever so interested in all that interests me I shall take the letter to her at once and ask her advice Have your own way miss I can t tell you why but I don t like her missus Delvin s devotion to the interests of her guest took even Emily by surprise After reading missus Rook s letter she rang the bell on her table in a frenzy of impatience My brother must be instantly recalled she said Telegraph to him in your own name telling him what has happened He will find the message waiting for him at the end of his journey The groom summoned by the bell was ordered to saddle the third and last horse left in the stables to take the telegram to Belford and to wait there until the answer arrived How far is it to Redwood Hall Emily asked when the man had received his orders Ten miles missus Delvin answered How can I get there to day My dear you can t get there Pardon me missus Delvin I must get there Pardon me My brother represents you in this matter Leave it to my brother The tone taken by Mirabel s sister was positive to say the least of it Emily thought of what her faithful old servant had said and began to doubt her own discretion in so readily showing the letter The mistake if a mistake it was had however been committed and wrong or right she was not disposed to occupy the subordinate position which missus Delvin had assigned to her If you will look at missus Rook s letter again Emily replied you will see that I ought to answer it She supposes I am in London Do you propose to tell missus Rook that you are in this house missus Delvin asked Certainly You had better consult my brother before you take any responsibility on yourself Emily kept her temper Allow me to remind you she said that mister Mirabel is not acquainted with missus Rook and that I am If I speak to her personally I can do much to assist the object of our inquiries before he returns She is not an easy woman to deal with And therefore missus Delvin interposed the sort of person who requires careful handling by a man like my brother a man of the world The sort of person as I venture to think Emily persisted whom I ought to see with as little loss of time as possible missus Delvin waited a while before she replied In her condition of health anxiety was not easy to bear missus Rook s letter and Emily s obstinacy had seriously irritated her But like all persons of ability she was capable when there was serious occasion for it of exerting self control She really liked and admired Emily and as the elder woman and the hostess she set an example of forbearance and good humor It is out of my power to send you to Redwood Hall at once she resumed The only one of my three horses now at your disposal is the horse which took my brother to the Hall this morning A distance there and back of twenty miles You are not in too great a hurry I am sure to allow the horse time to rest Emily made her excuses with perfect grace and sincerity I had no idea the distance was so great she confessed I will wait dear missus Delvin as long as you like They parted as good friends as ever with a certain reserve nevertheless on either side Emily s eager nature was depressed and irritated by the prospect of delay missus Delvin on the other hand devoted to her brother s interests thought hopefully of obstacles which might present themselves with the lapse of time The horse might prove to be incapable of further exertion for that day Or the threatening aspect of the weather might end in a storm But the hours passed and the sky cleared and the horse was reported to be fit for work again Fortune was against the lady of the tower she had no choice but to submit missus Delvin had just sent word to Emily that the carriage would be ready for her in ten minutes when the coachman who had driven Mirabel to Belford returned He brought news which agreeably surprised both the ladies Mirabel had reached the station five minutes too late the coachman had left him waiting the arrival of the next train to the North He would now receive the telegraphic message at Belford and might return immediately by taking the groom s horse missus Delvin left it to Emily to decide whether she would proceed by herself to Redwood Hall or wait for Mirabel s return Under the changed circumstances Emily would have acted ungraciously if she had persisted in holding to her first intention She consented to wait The sea still remained calm In the stillness of the moorland solitude on the western side of The Clink the rapid steps of a horse were heard at some little distance on the highroad Emily ran out followed by careful missus Ellmother expecting to meet Mirabel She was disappointed it was the groom who had returned As he pulled up at the house and dismounted Emily noticed that the man looked excited Is there anything wrong she asked There has been an accident miss Not to mister Mirabel No no miss An accident to a poor foolish woman traveling from Lasswade Emily looked at missus Ellmother It can t be missus Rook she said That s the name miss She got out before the train had quite stopped and fell on the platform Was she hurt Seriously hurt as I heard They carried her into a house hard by and sent for the doctor Was mister Mirabel one of the people who helped her He was on the other side of the platform miss waiting for the train from London I got to the station and gave him the telegram just as the accident took place We crossed over to hear more about it mister Mirabel was telling me that he would return to The Clink on my horse when he heard the woman s name mentioned Upon that he changed his mind and went to the house Was he let in The doctor wouldn t hear of it He was making his examination and he said nobody was to be in the room but her husband and the woman of the house Is mister Mirabel waiting to see her Yes miss He said he would wait all day if necessary and he gave me this bit of a note to take to the mistress Emily turned to missus Ellmother It s impossible to stay here not knowing whether missus Rook is going to live or die she said I shall go to Belford and you will go with me The groom interfered I beg your pardon miss It was mister Mirabel s most particular wish that you were not on any account to go to Belford Why not He didn t say Emily eyed the note in the man s hand with well grounded distrust In all probability Mirabel s object in writing was to instruct his sister to prevent her guest from going to Belford The carriage was waiting at the door With her usual promptness of resolution Emily decided on taking it for granted that she was free to use as she pleased a carriage which had been already placed at her disposal Tell your mistress she said to the groom that I am going to Belford instead of to Redwood Hall In a minute more she and missus Ellmother were on their way to join Mirabel at the station CHAPTER LX OUTSIDE THE ROOM Emily found Mirabel in the waiting room at Belford Her sudden appearance might well have amazed him but his face expressed a more serious emotion than surprise he looked at her as if she had alarmed him Didn t you get my message he asked I told the groom I wished you to wait for my return I sent a note to my sister in case he made any mistake The man made no mistake Emily answered I was in too great a hurry to be able to speak with missus Delvin Did you really suppose I could endure the suspense of waiting till you came back Do you think I can be of no use I who know missus Rook They won t let you see her Why not You seem to be waiting to see her I am waiting for the return of the rector of Belford He is at Berwick and he has been sent for at missus Rook s urgent request Is she dying She is in fear of death whether rightly or wrongly I don t know There is some internal injury from the fall I hope to see her when the rector returns As a brother clergyman I may with perfect propriety ask him to use his influence in my favor I am glad to find you so eager about it I am always eager in your interests Don t think me ungrateful Emily replied gently I am no stranger to missus Rook and if I send in my name I may be able to see her before the clergyman returns She stopped Mirabel suddenly moved so as to place himself between her and the door I must really beg of you to give up that idea he said you don t know what horrid sight you may see what dreadful agonies of pain this unhappy woman may be suffering His manner suggested to Emily that he might be acting under some motive which he was unwilling to acknowledge If you have a reason for wishing that I should keep away from missus Rook she said let me hear what it is Surely we trust each other I have done my best to set the example at any rate Mirabel seemed to be at a loss for a reply While he was hesitating the station master passed the door Emily asked him to direct her to the house in which missus Rook had been received He led the way to the end of the platform and pointed to the house Emily and missus Ellmother immediately left the station Mirabel accompanied them still remonstrating still raising obstacles The house door was opened by an old man He looked reproachfully at Mirabel You have been told already he said that no strangers are to see my wife Encouraged by discovering that the man was mister Rook Emily mentioned her name Perhaps you may have heard missus Rook speak of me she added I ve heard her speak of you oftentimes What does the doctor say He thinks she may get over it She doesn t believe him Will you say that I am anxious to see her if she feels well enough to receive me mister Rook looked at missus Ellmother Are there two of you wanting to go upstairs he inquired This is my old friend and servant Emily answered She will wait for me down here She can wait in the parlor the good people of this house are well known to me He pointed to the parlor door and then led the way to the first floor Emily followed him Mirabel as obstinate as ever followed Emily mister Rook opened a door at the end of the landing and turning round to speak to Emily noticed Mirabel standing behind her Without making any remarks the old man pointed significantly down the stairs His resolution was evidently immovable Mirabel appealed to Emily to help him She will see me if you ask her he said Let me wait here The sound of his voice was instantly followed by a cry from the bed chamber a cry of terror mister Rook hurried into the room and closed the door In less than a minute he opened it again with doubt and horror plainly visible in his face He stepped up to Mirabel eyed him with the closest scrutiny and drew back again with a look of relief She s wrong he said you are not the man This strange proceeding startled Emily What man do you mean she asked mister Rook took no notice of the question Still looking at Mirabel he pointed down the stairs once more With vacant eyes moving mechanically like a sleep walker in his dream Mirabel silently obeyed mister Rook turned to Emily Are you easily frightened he said I don t understand you Emily replied Who is going to frighten me Why did you speak to mister Mirabel in that strange way mister Rook looked toward the bedroom door Maybe you ll hear why inside there If I could have my way you shouldn t see her but she s not to be reasoned with A caution miss Don t be too ready to believe what my wife may say to you She s had a fright He opened the door In my belief he whispered she s off her head Emily crossed the threshold mister Rook softly closed the door behind her CHAPTER LXI INSIDE THE ROOM A decent elderly woman was seated at the bedside She rose and spoke to Emily with a mingling of sorrow and confusion strikingly expressed on her face It isn t my fault she said that missus Rook receives you in this manner I am obliged to humor her She drew aside and showed missus Rook with her head supported by many pillows and her face strangely hidden from view under a veil Emily started back in horror Is her face injured she asked missus Rook answered the question herself Her voice was low and weak but she still spoke with the same nervous hurry of articulation which had been remarked by Alban Morris on the day when she asked him to direct her to Netherwoods Not exactly injured she explained but one s appearance is a matter of some anxiety even on one s death bed I am disfigured by a thoughtless use of water to bring me to when I had my fall and I can t get at my toilet things to put myself right again I don t wish to shock you Please excuse the veil Emily remembered the rouge on her cheeks and the dye on her hair when they had first seen each other at the school Vanity of all human frailties the longest lived still held its firmly rooted place in this woman s nature superior to torment of conscience unassailable by terror of death The good woman of the house waited a moment before she left the room What shall I say she asked if the clergyman comes missus Rook lifted her hand solemnly Say she answered that a dying sinner is making atonement for sin Say this young lady is present by the decree of an all wise Providence No mortal creature must disturb us Her hand dropped back heavily on the bed Are we alone she asked We are alone Emily answered What made you scream just before I came in No I can t allow you to remind me of that missus Rook protested I must compose myself Be quiet Let me think Recovering her composure she also recovered that sense of enjoyment in talking of herself which was one of the marked peculiarities in her character You will excuse me if I exhibit religion she resumed My dear parents were exemplary people I was most carefully brought up Are you pious Let us hope so Emily was once more reminded of the past The bygone time returned to her memory the time when she had accepted Sir Jervis Redwood s offer of employment and when missus Rook had arrived at the school to be her traveling companion to the North The wretched creature had entirely forgotten her own loose talk after she had drunk Miss Ladd s good wine to the last drop in the bottle As she was boasting now of her piety so she had boasted then of her lost faith and hope and had mockingly declared her free thinking opinions to be the result of her ill assorted marriage Forgotten all forgotten in this later time of pain and fear Prostrate under the dread of death her innermost nature stripped of the concealments of her later life was revealed to view The early religious training at which she had scoffed in the insolence of health and strength revealed its latent influence intermitted but a living influence always from first to last missus Rook was tenderly mindful of her exemplary parents and proud of exhibiting religion on the bed from which she was never to rise again Did I tell you that I am a miserable sinner she asked after an interval of silence Emily could endure it no longer Say that to the clergyman she answered not to me Oh but I must say it missus Rook insisted I am a miserable sinner Let me give you an instance of it she continued with a shameless relish of the memory of her own frailties I have been a drinker in my time Anything was welcome when the fit was on me as long as it got into my head Like other persons in liquor I sometimes talked of things that had better have been kept secret We bore that in mind my old man and I when we were engaged by Sir Jervis Miss Redwood wanted to put us in the next bedroom to hers a risk not to be run I might have talked of the murder at the inn and she might have heard me Please to remark a curious thing Whatever else I might let out when I was in my cups not a word about the pocketbook ever dropped from me You will ask how I know it My dear I should have heard of it from my husband if I had let that out and he is as much in the dark as you are Wonderful are the workings of the human mind as the poet says and drink drowns care as the proverb says But can drink deliver a person from fear by day and fear by night I believe if I had dropped a word about the pocketbook it would have sobered me in an instant Have you any remark to make on this curious circumstance Thus far Emily had allowed the woman to ramble on in the hope of getting information which direct inquiry might fail to produce It was impossible however to pass over the allusion to the pocketbook After giving her time to recover from the exhaustion which her heavy breathing sufficiently revealed Emily put the question Who did the pocketbook belong to Wait a little said missus Rook Everything in its right place is my motto I mustn t begin with the pocketbook Why did I begin with it Do you think this veil on my face confuses me Suppose I take it off But you must promise first solemnly promise you won t look at my face How can I tell you about the murder the murder is part of my confession you know with this lace tickling my skin Go away and stand there with your back to me Thank you Now I ll take it off Ha the air feels refreshing I know what I am about Good heavens I have forgotten something I have forgotten him And after such a fright as he gave me Did you see him on the landing Who are you talking of Emily asked missus Rook s failing voice sank lower still Come closer she said this must be whispered Who am I talking of she repeated I am talking of the man who slept in the other bed at the inn the man who did the deed with his own razor He was gone when I looked into the outhouse in the gray of the morning Oh I have done my duty I have told mister Rook to keep an eye on him downstairs You haven t an idea how obstinate and stupid my husband is He says I couldn t know the man because I didn t see him Ha there s such a thing as hearing when you don t see I heard and I knew it again Emily turned cold from head to foot What did you know again she said His voice missus Rook answered I ll swear to his voice before all the judges in England Emily rushed to the bed She looked at the woman who had said those dreadful words speechless with horror You re breaking your promise cried missus Rook You false girl you re breaking your promise She snatched at the veil and put it on again The sight of her face momentary as it had been reassured Emily Her wild eyes made wilder still by the blurred stains of rouge below them half washed away her disheveled hair with streaks of gray showing through the dye presented a spectacle which would have been grotesque under other circumstances but which now reminded Emily of mister Rook s last words warning her not to believe what his wife said and even declaring his conviction that her intellect was deranged Emily drew back from the bed conscious of an overpowering sense of self reproach Although it was only for a moment she had allowed her faith in Mirabel to be shaken by a woman who was out of her mind Try to forgive me she said I didn t willfully break my promise you frightened me missus Rook began to cry I was a handsome woman in my time she murmured You would say I was handsome still if the clumsy fools about me had not spoiled my appearance Oh I do feel so weak Where s my medicine The bottle was on the table Emily gave her the prescribed dose and revived her failing strength I am an extraordinary person she resumed My resolution has always been the admiration of every one who knew me But my mind feels how shall I express it a little vacant Have mercy on my poor wicked soul Help me How can I help you I want to recollect Something happened in the summer time when we were talking at Netherwoods I mean when that impudent master at the school showed his suspicions of me Lord how he frightened me when he turned up afterward at Sir Jervis s house You must have seen yourself he suspected me How did he show it He showed you my locket Emily answered Oh the horrid reminder of the murder missus Rook exclaimed I didn t mention it don t blame Me You poor innocent I have something dreadful to tell you Emily s horror of the woman forced her to speak Don t tell me she cried I know more than you suppose I know what I was ignorant of when you saw the locket missus Rook took offense at the interruption Clever as you are there s one thing you don t know she said You asked me just now who the pocketbook belonged to It belonged to your father What s the matter Are you crying Emily was thinking of her father The pocketbook was the last present she had given to him a present on his birthday Is it lost she asked sadly No it s not lost You will hear more of it directly Dry your eyes and expect something interesting I m going to talk about love Love my dear means myself Why shouldn t it I m not the only nice looking woman married to an old man who has had a lover Wretch what has that got to do with it Everything you rude girl My lover was like the rest of them he would bet on race horses and he lost He owned it to me on the day when your father came to our inn He said I must find the money or be off to America and say good by forever I was fool enough to be fond of him It broke my heart to hear him talk in that way I said If I find the money and more than the money will you take me with you wherever you go Of course he said Yes I suppose you have heard of the inquest held at our old place by the coroner and jury Oh what idiots They believed I was asleep on the night of the murder I never closed my eyes I was so miserable I was so tempted Tempted What tempted you Do you think I had any money to spare Your father s pocketbook tempted me I had seen him open it to pay his bill over night It was full of bank notes Oh what an overpowering thing love is Perhaps you have known it yourself Emily s indignation once more got the better of her prudence Have you no feeling of decency on your death bed she said missus Rook forgot her piety she was ready with an impudent rejoinder You hot headed little woman your time will come she answered But you re right I am wandering from the point I am not sufficiently sensible of this solemn occasion By the by do you notice my language I inherit correct English from my mother a cultivated person who married beneath her My paternal grandfather was a gentleman Did I tell you that there came a time on that dreadful night when I could stay in bed no longer The pocketbook I did nothing but think of that devilish pocketbook full of bank notes My husband was fast asleep all the time I got a chair and stood on it I looked into the place where the two men were sleeping through the glass in the top of the door Your father was awake he was walking up and down the room What do you say Was he agitated I didn t notice I don t know whether the other man was asleep or awake I saw nothing but the pocketbook stuck under the pillow half in and half out Your father kept on walking up and down I thought to myself I ll wait till he gets tired and then I ll have another look at the pocketbook Where s the wine The doctor said I might have a glass of wine when I wanted it Emily found the wine and gave it to her She shuddered as she accidentally touched missus Rook s hand The wine helped the sinking woman I must have got up more than once she resumed And more than once my heart must have failed me I don t clearly remember what I did till the gray of the morning came I think that must have been the last time I looked through the glass in the door She began to tremble She tore the veil off her face She cried out piteously Lord be merciful to me a sinner Come here she said to Emily Where are you No I daren t tell you what I saw I daren t tell you what I did When you re pos sessed by the devil there s nothing nothing nothing you can t do Where did I find the courage to unlock the door Where did I find the courage to go in Any other woman would have lost her senses when she found blood on her fingers after taking the pocketbook Emily s head swam her heart beat furiously she staggered to the door and opened it to escape from the room I m guilty of robbing him but I m innocent of his blood missus Rook called after her wildly The deed was done the yard door was wide open and the man was gone when I looked in for the last time Come back come back Emily looked round I can t go near you she said faintly Come near enough to see this She opened her bed gown at the throat and drew up a loop of ribbon over her head The pocketbook was attached to the ribbon She held it out Your father s book she said Won t you take your father s book For a moment and only for a moment Emily was repelled by the profanation associated with her birthday gift Then the loving remembrance of the dear hands that had so often touched that relic drew the faithful daughter back to the woman whom she abhorred Her eyes rested tenderly on the book Before it had lain in that guilty bosom it had been his book The beloved memory was all that was left to her now the beloved memory consecrated it to her hand She took the book Open it said missus Rook There were two five pound bank notes in it His Emily asked No mine the little I have been able to save toward restoring what I stole Oh Emily cried is there some good in this woman after all There s no good in the woman missus Rook answered desperately There s nothing but fear fear of hell now fear of the pocketbook in the past time Twice I tried to destroy it and twice it came back to remind me of the duty that I owed to my miserable soul I tried to throw it into the fire It struck the bar and fell back into the fender at my feet I went out and cast it into the well It came back again in the first bucket of water that was drawn up From that moment I began to save what I could Restitution Atonement I tell you the book found a tongue and those were the grand words it dinned in my ears morning and night She stooped to fetch her breath stopped and struck her bosom I hid it here so that no person should see it and no person take it from me Superstition Oh yes superstition Shall tell you something You may find yourself superstitious if you are ever cut to the heart as I was He left me The man I had disgraced myself for deserted me on the day when I gave him the stolen money He suspected it was stolen he took care of his own cowardly self and left me to the hard mercy of the law if the theft was found out What do you call that in the way of punishment Haven t I suffered Haven t I made atonement Be a Christian say you forgive me I do forgive you Say you will pray for me I will Ah that comforts me Now you can go Emily looked at her imploringly Don t send me away knowing no more of the murder than I knew when I came here Is there nothing really nothing you can tell me missus Rook pointed to the door Haven t I told you already Go downstairs and see the wretch who escaped in the dawn of the morning Gently ma am gently You re talking too loud cried a mocking voice from outside It s only the doctor said missus Rook She crossed her hands over her bosom with a deep drawn sigh I want no doctor now My peace is made with my Maker I m ready for death I m fit for Heaven Go away go away CHAPTER LXII DOWNSTAIRS In a moment more the doctor came in a brisk smiling self sufficient man smartly dressed with a flower in his button hole A stifling odor of musk filled the room as he drew out his handkerchief with a flourish and wiped his forehead Plenty of hard work in my line just now he said Hullo missus Rook somebody has been allowing you to excite yourself I heard you before I opened the door Have you been encouraging her to talk he asked turning to Emily and shaking his finger at her with an air of facetious remonstrance Incapable of answering him forgetful of the ordinary restraints of social intercourse with the one doubt that preserved her belief in Mirabel eager for confirmation Emily signed to this stranger to follow her into a corner of the room out of hearing She made no excuses she took no notice of his look of surprise One hope was all she could feel one word was all she could say after that second assertion of Mirabel s guilt Indicating missus Rook by a glance at the bed she whispered the word Mad Flippant and familiar the doctor imitated her he too looked at the bed No more mad than you are miss As I said just now my patient has been exciting herself I daresay she has talked a little wildly in consequence Hers isn t a brain to give way I can tell you But there s somebody else Emily had fled from the room He had destroyed her last fragment of belief in Mirabel s innocence She was on the landing trying to console herself when the doctor joined her Are you acquainted with the gentleman downstairs he asked What gentleman I haven t heard his name he looks like a clergyman If you know him I do know him I can t answer questions My mind Steady your mind miss and take your friend home as soon as you can He hasn t got missus Rook s hard brain he s in a state of nervous prostration which may end badly Do you know where he lives He is staying with his sister missus Delvin missus Delvin she s a friend and patient of mine Say I ll look in to morrow morning and see what I can do for her brother In the meantime get him to bed and to rest and don t be afraid of giving him brandy The doctor returned to the bedroom Emily heard missus Ellmother s voice below Are you up there miss Yes missus Ellmother ascended the stairs It was an evil hour she said that you insisted on going to this place mister Mirabel The sight of Emily s face suspended the next words on her lips She took the poor young mistress in her motherly arms Oh my child what has happened to you Don t ask me now Give me your arm let us go downstairs You won t be startled when you see mister Mirabel will you my dear I wouldn t let them disturb you I said nobody should speak to you but myself The truth is mister Mirabel has had a dreadful fright What are you looking for Is there a garden here Any place where we can breathe the fresh air There was a courtyard at the back of the house They found their way to it A bench was placed against one of the walls They sat down Shall I wait till you re better before I say any more missus Ellmother asked No You want to hear about mister Mirabel My dear he came into the parlor where I was and mister Rook came in too and waited looking at him mister Mirabel sat down in a corner in a dazed state as I thought It wasn t for long He jumped up and clapped his hand on his heart as if his heart hurt him I must and will know what s going on upstairs he says mister Rook pulled him back and told him to wait till the young lady came down mister Mirabel wouldn t hear of it Your wife s frightening her he says your wife s telling her horrible things about me He was taken on a sudden with a shivering fit his eyes rolled and his teeth chattered mister Rook made matters worse he lost his temper I m damned he says if I don t begin to think you are the man after all I ve half a mind to send for the police mister Mirabel dropped into his chair His eyes stared his mouth fell open I took hold of his hand Cold cold as ice What it all meant I can t say Oh miss you know Let me tell you the rest of it some other time Emily insisted on hearing more The end she cried How did it end I don t know how it might have ended if the doctor hadn t come in to pay his visit you know upstairs He said some learned words When he came to plain English he asked if anybody had frightened the gentleman I said mister Rook had frightened him The doctor says to mister Rook Mind what you are about If you frighten him again you may have his death to answer for That cowed mister Rook He asked what he had better do Give me some brandy for him first says the doctor and then get him home at once I found the brandy and went away to the inn to order the carriage Your ears are quicker than mine miss do I hear it now They rose and went to the house door The carriage was there Still cowed by what the doctor had said mister Rook appeared carefully leading Mirabel out He had revived under the action of the stimulant Passing Emily he raised his eyes to her trembled and looked down again When mister Rook opened the door of the carriage he paused with one of his feet on the step A momentary impulse inspired him with a false courage and brought a flush into his ghastly face He turned to Emily May I speak to you he asked She started back from him He looked at missus Ellmother Tell her I am innocent he said The trembling seized on him again mister Rook was obliged to lift him into the carriage Emily caught at missus Ellmother s arm You go with him she said I can t How are you to get back miss She turned away and spoke to the coachman I am not very well I want the fresh air I ll sit by you missus Ellmother remonstrated and protested in vain As Emily had determined it should be so it was Has he said anything she asked when they had arrived at their journey s end He has been like a man frozen up he hasn t said a word he hasn t even moved Take him to his sister and tell her all that you know Be careful to repeat what the doctor said I can t face missus Delvin Be patient my good old friend I have no secrets from you Only wait till to morrow and leave me by myself to night Alone in her room Emily opened her writing case Searching among the letters in it she drew out a printed paper It was the Handbill describing the man who had escaped from the inn and offering a reward for the discovery of him At the first line of the personal description of the fugitive the paper dropped from her hand Burning tears forced their way into her eyes Feeling for her handkerchief she touched the pocketbook which she had received from missus Rook After a little hesitation she took it out She looked at it She opened it The sight of the bank notes repelled her she hid them in one of the pockets of the book There was a second pocket which she had not yet examined She pat her hand into it and touching something drew out a letter The envelope already open was addressed to James Brown esquire Post Office Zeeland Would it be inconsistent with her respect for her father s memory to examine the letter No a glance would decide whether she ought to read it or not It was without date or address a startling letter to look at for it only contained three words I say No The words were signed in initials S J In the instant when she read the initials the name occurred to her Sara Jethro CHAPTER LXIII THE DEFENSE OF MIRABEL The discovery of the letter gave a new direction to Emily s thoughts and so for the time at least relieved her mind from the burden that weighed on it To what question on her father s part had I say No been Miss Jethro s brief and stern reply Neither letter nor envelope offered the slightest hint that might assist inquiry even the postmark had been so carelessly impressed that it was illegible Emily was still pondering over the three mysterious words when she was interrupted by missus Ellmother s voice at the door I must ask you to let me come in miss though I know you wished to be left by yourself till to morrow missus Delvin says she must positively see you to night It s my belief that she will send for the servants and have herself carried in here if you refuse to do what she asks You needn t be afraid of seeing mister Mirabel Where is he His sister has given up her bedroom to him missus Ellmother answered She thought of your feelings before she sent me here and had the curtains closed between the sitting room and the bedroom I suspect my nasty temper misled me when I took a dislike to missus Delvin She s a good creature I m sorry you didn t go to her as soon as we got back Did she seem to be angry when she sent you here Angry She was crying when I left her Emily hesitated no longer She noticed a remarkable change in the invalid s sitting room so brilliantly lighted on other occasions the moment she entered it The lamps were shaded and the candles were all extinguished My eyes don t bear the light so well as usual missus Delvin said Come and sit near me Emily I hope to quiet your mind I should be grieved if you left my house with a wrong impression of me Knowing what she knew suffering as she must have suffered the quiet kindness of her tone implied an exercise of self restraint which appealed irresistibly to Emily s sympathies Forgive me she said for having done you an injustice I am ashamed to think that I shrank from seeing you when I returned from Belford I will endeavor to be worthy of your better opinion of me missus Delvin replied In one respect at least I may claim to have had your best interests at heart while we were still personally strangers I tried to prevail on my poor brother to own the truth when he discovered the terrible position in which he was placed toward you He was too conscious of the absence of any proof which might induce you to believe him if he attempted to defend himself in one word he was too timid to take my advice He has paid the penalty and I have paid the penalty of deceiving you Emily started In what way have you deceived me she asked In the way that was forced on us by our own conduct missus Delvin said We have appeared to help you without really doing so we calculated on inducing you to marry my brother and then when he could speak with the authority of a husband on prevailing on you to give up all further inquiries When you insisted on seeing missus Rook Miles had the money in his hand to bribe her and her husband to leave England Oh missus Delvin I don t attempt to excuse myself I don t expect you to consider how sorely I was tempted to secure the happiness of my brother s life by marriage with such a woman as yourself I don t remind you that I knew when I put obstacles in your way that you were blindly devoting yourself to the discovery of an innocent man Emily heard her with angry surprise Innocent she repeated missus Rook recognized his voice the instant she heard him speak Impenetrable to interruption missus Delvin went on But what I do ask she persisted even after our short acquaintance is this Do you suspect me of deliberately scheming to make you the wife of a murderer Emily had never viewed the serious question between them in this light Warmly generously she answered the appeal that had been made to her Oh don t think that of me I know I spoke thoughtlessly and cruelly to you just now You spoke impulsively missus Delvin interposed that was all My one desire before we part how can I expect you to remain here after what has happened is to tell you the truth I have no interested object in view for all hope of your marriage with my brother is now at an end May I ask if you have heard that he and your father were strangers when they met at the inn Yes I know that If there had been any conversation between them when they retired to rest they might have mentioned their names But your father was preoccupied and my brother after a long day s walk was so tired that he fell asleep as soon as his head was on the pillow He only woke when the morning dawned What he saw when he looked toward the opposite bed might have struck with terror the boldest man that ever lived His first impulse was naturally to alarm the house When he got on his feet he saw his own razor a blood stained razor on the bed by the side of the corpse At that discovery he lost all control over himself In a panic of terror he snatched up his knapsack unfastened the yard door and fled from the house Knowing him as you and I know him can we wonder at it Many a man has been hanged for murder on circumstantial evidence less direct than the evidence against poor Miles His horror of his own recollections was so overpowering that he forbade me even to mention the inn at Zeeland in my letters while he was abroad Never tell me he wrote who that wretched murdered stranger was if I only heard of his name I believe it would haunt me to my dying day I ought not to trouble you with these details and yet I am surely not without excuse In the absence of any proof I cannot expect you to believe as I do in my brother s innocence But I may at least hope to show you that there is some reason for doubt Will you give him the benefit of that doubt Willingly Emily replied Am I right in supposing that you don t despair of proving his innocence even yet I don t quite despair But my hopes have grown fainter and fainter as the years have gone on There is a person associated with his escape from Zeeland a person named Jethro You mean Miss Jethro Yes Do you know her I know her and my father knew her I have found a letter addressed to him which I have no doubt was written by Miss Jethro It is barely possible that you may understand what it means Pray look at it I am quite unable to help you missus Delvin answered after reading the letter All I know of Miss Jethro is that but for her interposition my brother might have fallen into the hands of the police She saved him Knowing him of course That is the remarkable part of it they were perfect strangers to each other But she must have had some motive There is the foundation of my hope for Miles Miss Jethro declared when I wrote and put the question to her that the one motive by which she was actuated was the motive of mercy I don t believe her To my mind it is in the last degree improbable that she would consent to protect a stranger from discovery who owned to her as my brother did that he was a fugitive suspected of murder She knows something I am firmly convinced of that dreadful event at Zeeland and she has some reason for keeping it secret Have you any influence over her Tell me where I can find her I can t tell you She has removed from the address at which my brother saw her last He has made every possible inquiry without result As she replied in those discouraging terms the curtains which divided missus Delvin s bedroom from her sitting room were drawn aside An elderly woman servant approached her mistress s couch mister Mirabel is awake ma am He is very low I can hardly feel his pulse Shall I give him some more brandy missus Delvin held out her hand to Emily Come to me to morrow morning she said and signed to the servant to wheel her couch into the next room As the curtain closed over them Emily heard Mirabel s voice Where am I he said faintly Is it all a dream The prospect of his recovery the next morning was gloomy indeed He had sunk into a state of deplorable weakness in mind as well as in body The little memory of events that he still preserved was regarded by him as the memory of a dream He alluded to Emily and to his meeting with her unexpectedly But from that point his recollection failed him They had talked of something interesting he said but he was unable to remember what it was And they had waited together at a railway station but for what purpose he could not tell He sighed and wondered when Emily would marry him and so fell asleep again weaker than ever Not having any confidence in the doctor at Belford missus Delvin had sent an urgent message to a physician at Edinburgh famous for his skill in treating diseases of the nervous system I cannot expect him to reach this remote place without some delay she said I must bear my suspense as well as I can You shall not bear it alone Emily answered I will wait with you till the doctor comes missus Delvin lifted her frail wasted hands to Emily s face drew it a little nearer and kissed her CHAPTER LXIV ON THE WAY TO LONDON The parting words had been spoken Emily and her companion were on their way to London For some little time they traveled in silence alone in the railway carriage After submitting as long as she could to lay an embargo on the use of her tongue missus Ellmother started the conversation by means of a question Do you think mister Mirabel will get over it miss It s useless to ask me Emily said Even the great man from Edinburgh is not able to decide yet whether he will recover or not You have taken me into your confidence Miss Emily as you promised and I have got something in my mind in consequence May I mention it without giving offense What is it I wish you had never taken up with mister Mirabel Emily was silent missus Ellmother having a design of her own to accomplish ventured to speak more plainly I often think of mister Alban Morris she proceeded I always did like him and I always shall Emily suddenly pulled down her veil Don t speak of him she said I didn t mean to offend you You don t offend me You distress me Oh how often I have wished She threw herself back in a corner of the carriage and said no more Although not remarkable for the possession of delicate tact missus Ellmother discovered that the best course she could now follow was a course of silence Even at the time when she had most implicitly trusted Mirabel the fear that she might have acted hastily and harshly toward Alban had occasionally troubled Emily s mind The impression produced by later events had not only intensified this feeling but had presented the motives of that true friend under an entirely new point of view If she had been left in ignorance of the manner of her father s death as Alban had designed to leave her as she would have been left but for the treachery of Francine how happily free she would have been from thoughts which it was now a terror to her to recall She would have parted from Mirabel when the visit to the pleasant country house had come to an end remembering him as an amusing acquaintance and nothing more He would have been spared and she would have been spared the shock that had so cruelly assailed them both What had she gained by missus Rook s detestable confession The result had been perpetual disturbance of mind provoked by self torturing speculations on the subject of the murder If Mirabel was innocent who was guilty The false wife without pity and without shame or the brutal husband who looked capable of any enormity What was her future to be How was it all to end In the despair of that bitter moment seeing her devoted old servant looking at her with kind compassionate eyes Emily s troubled spirit sought refuge in impetuous self betrayal the very betrayal which she had resolved should not escape her hardly a minute since She bent forward out of her corner and suddenly drew up her veil Do you expect to see mister Alban Morris when we get back she asked I should like to see him miss if you have no objection Tell him I am ashamed of myself and say I ask his pardon with all my heart The Lord be praised missus Ellmother burst out and then when it was too late remembered the conventional restraints appropriate to the occasion Gracious what a fool I am she said to herself Beautiful weather Miss Emily isn t it she continued in a desperate hurry to change the subject Emily reclined again in her corner of the carriage She smiled for the first time since she had become missus Delvin s guest at the tower BOOK THE LAST AT HOME AGAIN CHAPTER LXV CECILIA IN A NEW CHARACTER Reaching the cottage at night Emily found the card of a visitor who had called during the day It bore the name of Miss Wyvil and had a message written on it which strongly excited Emily s curiosity I have seen the telegram which tells your servant that you return to night Expect me early to morrow morning with news that will deeply interest you To what news did Cecilia allude Emily questioned the woman who had been left in charge of the cottage and found that she had next to nothing to tell Miss Wyvil had flushed up and had looked excited when she read the telegraphic message that was all Emily s impatience was as usual not to be concealed Expert missus Ellmother treated the case in the right way first with supper and then with an adjournment to bed The clock struck twelve when she put out the young mistress s candle Ten hours to pass before Cecilia comes here Emily exclaimed Not ten minutes missus Ellmother reminded her if you will only go to sleep Cecilia arrived before the breakfast table was cleared as lovely as gentle as affectionate as ever but looking unusually serious and subdued Out with it at once Emily cried What have you got to tell me Perhaps I had better tell you first Cecilia said that I know what you kept from me when I came here after you left us at Monksmoor Don t think my dear that I say this by way of complaint mister Alban Morris says you had good reasons for keeping your secret mister Alban Morris Did you get your information from him Yes Do I surprise you More than words can tell Can you bear another surprise mister Morris has seen Miss Jethro and has discovered that mister Mirabel has been wrongly suspected of a dreadful crime Our amiable little clergyman is guilty of being a coward and guilty of nothing else Are you really quiet enough to read about it She produced some leaves of paper filled with writing There she explained is mister Morris s own account of all that passed between Miss Jethro and himself But how do you come by it mister Morris gave it to me He said Show it to Emily as soon as possible and take care to be with her while she reads it There is a reason for this Cecilia s voice faltered On the brink of some explanation she seemed to recoil from it I will tell you by and by what the reason is she said Emily looked nervously at the manuscript Why doesn t he tell me himself what he has discovered Is he The leaves began to flutter in her trembling fingers is he angry with me Oh Emily angry with You Read what he has written and you shall know why he keeps away Emily opened the manuscript CHAPTER LXVI ALBAN S NARRATIVE The information which I have obtained from Miss Jethro has been communicated to me on the condition that I shall not disclose the place of her residence Let me pass out of notice she said as completely as if I had passed out of life I wish to be forgotten by some and to be unknown by others With this one stipulation she left me free to write the present narrative of what passed at the interview between us I feel that the discoveries which I have made are too important to the persons interested to be trusted to memory one She Receives Me Finding Miss Jethro s place of abode with far less difficulty than I had anticipated thanks to favoring circumstances I stated plainly the object of my visit She declined to enter into conversation with me on the subject of the murder at Zeeland I was prepared to meet with this rebuke and to take the necessary measures for obtaining a more satisfactory reception A person is suspected of having committed the murder I said and there is reason to believe that you are in a position to say whether the suspicion is justified or not Do you refuse to answer me if I put the question Miss Jethro asked who the person was I mentioned the name mister Miles Mirabel It is not necessary and it would certainly be not agreeable to me to describe the effect which this reply produced on Miss Jethro After giving her time to compose herself I entered into certain explanations in order to convince her at the outset of my good faith The result justified my anticipations I was at once admitted to her confidence She said I must not hesitate to do an act of justice to an innocent man But in such a serious matter as this you have a right to judge for yourself whether the person who is now speaking to you is a person whom you can trust You may believe that I tell the truth about others if I begin whatever it may cost me by telling the truth about myself two She Speaks of Herself I shall not attempt to place on record the confession of a most unhappy woman It was the common story of sin bitterly repented and of vain effort to recover the lost place in social esteem Too well known a story surely to be told again But I may with perfect propriety repeat what Miss Jethro said to me in allusion to later events in her life which are connected with my own personal experience She recalled to my memory a visit which she had paid to me at Netherwoods and a letter addressed to her by Doctor Allday which I had read at her express request She said You may remember that the letter contained some severe reflections on my conduct Among other things the doctor mentions that he called at the lodging I occupied during my visit to London and found I had taken to flight also that he had reason to believe I had entered Miss Ladd s service under false pretenses I asked if the doctor had wronged her She answered No in one case he is ignorant in the other he is right On leaving his house I found myself followed in the street by the man to whom I owe the shame and misery of my past life My horror of him is not to be described in words The one way of escaping was offered by an empty cab that passed me I reached the railway station safely and went back to my home in the country Do you blame me It was impossible to blame her and I said so She then confessed the deception which she had practiced on Miss Ladd I have a cousin she said who was a Miss Jethro like me Before her marriage she had been employed as a governess She pitied me she sympathized with my longing to recover the character that I had lost With her permission I made use of the testimonials which she had earned as a teacher I was betrayed to this day I don t know by whom and I was dismissed from Netherwoods Now you know that I deceived Miss Ladd you may reasonably conclude that I am likely to deceive You I assured her with perfect sincerity that I had drawn no such conclusion Encouraged by my reply Miss Jethro proceeded as follows three She Speaks of Mirabel Four years ago I was living near Cowes in the Isle of Wight in a cottage which had been taken for me by a gentleman who was the owner of a yacht We had just returned from a short cruise and the vessel was under orders to sail for Cherbourg with the next tide While I was walking in my garden I was startled by the sudden appearance Of a man evidently a gentleman who was a perfect stranger to me He was in a pitiable state of terror and he implored my protection In reply to my first inquiries he mentioned the inn at Zeeland and the dreadful death of a person unknown to him whom I recognized partly by the description given and partly by comparison of dates as mister James Brown I shall say nothing of the shock inflicted on me you don t want to know what I felt What I did having literally only a minute left for decision was to hide the fugitive from discovery and to exert my influence in his favor with the owner of the yacht I saw nothing more of him He was put on board as soon as the police were out of sight and was safely landed at Cherbourg I asked what induced her to run the risk of protecting a stranger who was under suspicion of having committed a murder She said You shall hear my explanation directly Let us have done with mister Mirabel first We occasionally corresponded during the long absence on the continent never alluding at his express request to the horrible event at the inn His last letter reached me after he had established himself at Vale Regis Writing of the society in the neighborhood he informed me of his introduction to Miss Wyvil and of the invitation that he had received to meet her friend and schoolfellow at Monksmoor I knew that Miss Emily possessed a Handbill describing personal peculiarities in mister Mirabel not hidden under the changed appearance of his head and face If she remembered or happened to refer to that description while she was living in the same house with him there was a possibility at least of her suspicion being excited The fear of this took me to you It was a morbid fear and as events turned out an unfounded fear but I was unable to control it Failing to produce any effect on you I went to Vale Regis and tried vainly again to induce mister Mirabel to send an excuse to Monksmoor He like you wanted to know what my motive was When I tell you that I acted solely in Miss Emily s interests and that I knew how she had been deceived about her father s death need I say why I was afraid to acknowledge my motive I understood that Miss Jethro might well be afraid of the consequences if she risked any allusion to mister Brown s horrible death and if it afterward chanced to reach his daughter s ears But this state of feeling implied an extraordinary interest in the preservation of Emily s peace of mind I asked Miss Jethro how that interest had been excited She answered I can only satisfy you in one way I must speak of her father now Emily looked up from the manuscript She felt Cecilia s arm tenderly caressing her She heard Cecilia say My poor dear there is one last trial of your courage still to come I am afraid of what you are going to read when you turn to the next page And yet And yet Emily replied gently it must be done I have learned my hard lesson of endurance Cecilia don t be afraid Emily turned to the next page four She Speaks of the Dead For the first time Miss Jethro appeared to be at a loss how to proceed I could see that she was suffering She rose and opening a drawer in her writing table took a letter from it She said Will you read this It was written by Miss Emily s father Perhaps it may say more for me than I can say for myself I copy the letter It was thus expressed You have declared that our farewell to day is our farewell forever For the second time you have refused to be my wife and you have done this to use your own words in mercy to Me In mercy to Me I implore you to reconsider your decision If you condemn me to live without you I feel it I know it you condemn me to despair which I have not fortitude enough to endure Look at the passages which I have marked for you in the New Testament Again and again I say it your true repentance has made you worthy of the pardon of God Are you not worthy of the love admiration and respect of man Think oh Sara think of what our lives might be and let them be united for time and for eternity I can write no more A deadly faintness oppresses me My mind is in a state unknown to me in past years I am in such confusion that I sometimes think I hate you And then I recover from my delusion and know that man never loved woman as I love you You will have time to write to me by this evening s post I shall stop at Zeeland to morrow on my way back and ask for a letter at the post office I forbid explanations and excuses I forbid heartless allusions to your duty Let me have an answer which does not keep me for a moment in suspense For the last time I ask you Do you consent to be my wife Say Yes or say No I gave her back the letter with the one comment on it which the circumstances permitted me to make You said No She bent her head in silence I went on not willingly for I would have spared her if it had been possible I said He died despairing by his own hand and you knew it She looked up No To say that I knew it is too much To say that I feared it is the truth Did you love him She eyed me in stern surprise Have I any right to love Could I disgrace an honorable man by allowing him to marry me You look as if you held me responsible for his death Innocently responsible I said She still followed her own train of thought Do you suppose I could for a moment anticipate that he would destroy himself when I wrote my reply He was a truly religious man If he had been in his right mind he would have shrunk from the idea of suicide as from the idea of a crime On reflection I was inclined to agree with her In his terrible position it was at least possible that the sight of the razor placed ready with the other appliances of the toilet for his fellow traveler s use might have fatally tempted a man whose last hope was crushed whose mind was tortured by despair I should have been merciless indeed if I had held Miss Jethro accountable thus far But I found it hard to sympathize with the course which she had pursued in permitting mister Brown s death to be attributed to murder without a word of protest Why were you silent I said She smiled bitterly A woman would have known why without asking she replied A woman would have understood that I shrank from a public confession of my shameful past life A woman would have remembered what reasons I had for pitying the man who loved me and for accepting any responsibility rather than associate his memory before the world with an unworthy passion for a degraded creature ending in an act of suicide Even if I had made that cruel sacrifice would public opinion have believed such a person as I am against the evidence of a medical man and the verdict of a jury No mister Morris I said nothing and I was resolved to say nothing so long as the choice of alternatives was left to me On the day when mister Mirabel implored me to save him that choice was no longer mine and you know what I did And now again when suspicion after all the long interval that had passed has followed and found that innocent man you know what I have done What more do you ask of me Your pardon I said for not having understood you and a last favor May I repeat what I have heard to the one person of all others who ought to know and who must know what you have told me It was needless to hint more plainly that I was speaking of Emily Miss Jethro granted my request It shall be as you please she answered Say for me to his daughter that the grateful remembrance of her is my one refuge from the thoughts that tortured me when we spoke together on her last night at school She has made this dead heart of mine feel a reviving breath of life when I think of her Never in our earthly pilgrimage shall we meet again I implore her to pity and forget me Farewell mister Morris farewell forever I confess that the tears came into my eyes When I could see clearly again I was alone in the room CHAPTER LXVII THE TRUE CONSOLATION Emily closed the pages which told her that her father had died by his own hand Cecilia still held her tenderly embraced By slow degrees her head dropped until it rested on her friend s bosom Silently she suffered Silently Cecilia bent forward and kissed her forehead The sounds that penetrated to the room were not out of harmony with the time From a distant house the voices of children were just audible singing the plaintive melody of a hymn and now and then the breeze blew the first faded leaves of autumn against the window Neither of the girls knew how long the minutes followed each other uneventfully before there was a change Emily raised her head and looked at Cecilia I have one friend left she said Not only me love oh I hope not only me Yes Only you I want to say something Emily but I am afraid of hurting you My dear do you remember what we once read in a book of history at school It told of the death of a tortured man in the old time who was broken on the wheel He lived through it long enough to say that the agony after the first stroke of the club dulled his capacity for feeling pain when the next blows fell I fancy pain of the mind must follow the same rule Nothing you can say will hurt me now I only wanted to ask Emily if you were engaged at one time to marry mister Mirabel Is it true False He pressed me to consent to an engagement and I said he must not hurry me What made you say that I thought of Alban Morris Vainly Cecilia tried to restrain herself A cry of joy escaped her Are you glad Emily asked Why Cecilia made no direct reply May I tell you what you wanted to know a little while since she said You asked why mister Morris left it all to me instead of speaking to you himself When I put the same question to him he told me to read what he had written Not a shadow of suspicion rests on mister Mirabel he said Emily is free to marry him and free through Me Can I tell her that For her sake and for mine it must not be All that I can do is to leave old remembrances to plead for me If they fail I shall know that she will be happier with mister Mirabel than with me And you will submit I asked Because I love her he answered I must submit Oh how pale you are Have I distressed you You have done me good Will you see him Emily pointed to the manuscript At such a time as this she said Cecilia still held to her resolution Such a time as this is the right time she answered It is now when you most want to be comforted that you ought to see him Who can quiet your poor aching heart as he can quiet it She impulsively snatched at the manuscript and threw it out of sight I can t bear to look at it she said Emily if I have done wrong will you forgive me I saw him this morning before I came here I was afraid of what might happen I refused to break the dreadful news to you unless he was somewhere near us Your good old servant knows where to go Let me send her missus Ellmother herself opened the door and stood doubtful on the threshold hysterically sobbing and laughing at the same time I m everything that s bad the good old creature burst out I ve been listening I ve been lying I said you wanted him Turn me out of my situation if you like I ve got him Here he is In another moment Emily was in his arms and they were alone On his faithful breast the blessed relief of tears came to her at last she burst out crying Oh Alban can you forgive me He gently raised her head so that he could see her face My love let me look at you he said I want to think again of the day when we parted in the garden at school Do you remember the one conviction that sustained me I told you Emily there was a time of fulfillment to come in our two lives and I have never wholly lost the dear belief My own darling the time has come POSTSCRIPT GOSSIP IN THE STUDIO The winter time had arrived Alban was clearing his palette after a hard day s work at the cottage The servant announced that tea was ready and that Miss Ladd was waiting to see him in the next room Alban ran in and received the visitor cordially with both hands Welcome back to England I needn t ask if the sea voyage has done you good You are looking ten years younger than when you went away Miss Ladd smiled I shall soon be ten years older again if I go back to Netherwoods she replied I didn t believe it at the time but I know better now Our friend Doctor Allday was right when he said that my working days were over I must give up the school to a younger and stronger successor and make the best I can in retirement of what is left of my life You and Emily may expect to have me as a near neighbor Where is Emily Far away in the North In the North You don t mean that she has gone back to missus Delvin She has gone back with missus Ellmother to take care of her at my express request You know what Emily is when there is an act of mercy to be done That unhappy man has been sinking with intervals of partial recovery for months past missus Delvin sent word to us that the end was near and that the one last wish her brother was able to express was the wish to see Emily He had been for some hours unable to speak when my wife arrived But he knew her and smiled faintly He was just able to lift his hand She took it and waited by him and spoke words of consolation and kindness from time to time As the night advanced he sank into sleep still holding her hand They only knew that he had passed from sleep to death passed without a movement or a sigh when his hand turned cold Emily remained for a day at the tower to comfort poor missus Delvin and she comes home thank God this evening I needn t ask if you are happy Miss Ladd said Happy I sing when I have my bath in the morning If that isn t happiness in a man of my age I don t know what is And how are you getting on Famously I have turned portrait painter since you were sent away for your health A portrait of mister Wyvil is to decorate the town hall in the place that he represents and our dear kind hearted Cecilia has induced a fascinated mayor and corporation to confide the work to my hands Is there no hope yet of that sweet girl being married Miss Ladd asked We old maids all believe in marriage mister Morris though some of us don t own it There seems to be a chance Alban answered A young lord has turned up at Monksmoor a handsome pleasant fellow and a rising man in politics He happened to be in the house a few days before Cecilia s birthday and he asked my advice about the right present to give her I said Try something new in Tarts When he found I was in earnest what do you think he did Sent his steam yacht to Rouen for some of the famous pastry You should have seen Cecilia when the young lord offered his delicious gift If I could paint that smile and those eyes I should be the greatest artist living I believe she will marry him Need I say how rich they will be We shall not envy them we are rich too Everything is comparative The portrait of mister Wyvil will put three hundred pounds in my pocket I have earned a hundred and twenty more by illustrations since we have been married And my wife s income I like to be particular is only five shillings and tenpence short of two hundred a year Moral we are rich as well as happy Without a thought of the future Miss Ladd asked slyly Oh Doctor Allday has taken the future in hand He revels in the old fashioned jokes which used to be addressed to newly married people in his time My dear fellow he said the other day you may possibly be under a joyful necessity of sending for the doctor before we are all a year older In that case let it be understood that I am Honorary Physician to the family The warm hearted old man talks of getting me another portrait to do The greatest ass in the medical profession he informed me has just been made a baronet and his admiring friends have decided that he is to be painted at full length with his bandy legs hidden under a gown and his great globular eyes staring at the spectator I ll get you the job Shall I tell you what he says of missus Rook s recovery Miss Ladd held up her hands in amazement Recovery she exclaimed And a most remarkable recovery too Alban informed her It is the first case on record of any person getting over such an injury as she has received Doctor Allday looked grave when he heard of it I begin to believe in the devil he said nobody else could have saved missus Rook Other people don t take that view She has been celebrated in all the medical newspapers and she has been admitted to come excellent almshouse to live in comfortable idleness to a green old age The best of it is that she shakes her head when her wonderful recovery is mentioned It seems such a pity she says I was so fit for heaven mister Rook having got rid of his wife is in excellent spirits He is occupied in looking after an imbecile old gentleman and when he is asked if he likes the employment he winks mysteriously and slaps his pocket Now Miss Ladd I think it s my turn to hear some news What have you got to tell me I believe I can match your account of missus Rook Miss Ladd said Do you care to hear what has become of Francine Alban rattling on hitherto in boyish high spirits suddenly became serious I have no doubt Miss de Sor is doing well he said sternly She is too heartless and wicked not to prosper You are getting like your old cynical self again mister Morris and you are wrong I called this morning on the agent who had the care of Francine when I left England When I mentioned her name he showed me a telegram sent to him by her father There s my authority he said for letting her leave my house The message was short enough to be easily remembered Anything my daughter likes as long as she doesn t come back to us In those cruel terms mister de Sor wrote of his own child The agent was just as unfeeling in his way He called her the victim of slighted love and clever proselytizing In plain words he said the priest of the Catholic chapel close by has converted her and she is now a novice in a convent of Carmelite nuns in the West of England Who could have expected it Who knows how it may end As Miss Ladd spoke the bell rang at the cottage gate Here she is Alban cried leading the way into the hall Emily has come home End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of I Say No by Wilkie Collins END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK
