I FORENSIC MEDICINE I CRIMES Forensic medicine is also called Medical Jurisprudence or Legal Medicine and includes all questions which bring medical matters into relation with the law It deals therefore with one crimes and two civil injuries one A crime is the voluntary act of a person of sound mind harmful to others and also unjust No act is a crime unless it is plainly forbidden by law To constitute a crime two circumstances are necessary to be proved a that the act has been committed b that a guilty mind or malice was present The act may be one of omission or of commission Every person who commits a crime may be punished unless he is under the age of seven years is insane or has been made to commit it under compulsion Crimes are divided into misdemeanours and felonies The distinction is not very definite but as a rule the former are less serious forms of crime and are punishable with a term of imprisonment generally under two years while felonies comprise the more serious charges as murder manslaughter rape which involve the capital sentence or long terms of imprisonment An offence is a trivial breach of the criminal law and is punishable on summary conviction before a magistrate or justices only while the more serious crimes indictable offences must be tried before a jury two Civil injuries differ from crimes in that the former are compensated by damages awarded while the latter are punished any person whether injured or not may prosecute for a crime while only the sufferer can sue for a civil injury The Crown may remit punishment for a crime but not for a civil injury II MEDICAL EVIDENCE On being called the medical witness enters the witness box and takes the oath This is very generally done by uplifting the right hand and repeating the oath Scottish form or by kissing the Bible or by making a solemn affirmation one He may be called to give ordinary evidence as a common witness Thus he may be asked to detail the facts of an accident which he has observed and of the inferences he has deduced This evidence is what any lay observer might be asked two Expert Witness On the other hand he may be examined on matters of a technical or professional character The medical man then gives evidence of a skilled or expert nature He may be asked his opinion on certain facts narrated e g if a certain wound would be immediately fatal Again he may be asked whether he concurs with opinions held by other medical authorities In important cases specialists are often called to give evidence of a skilled nature Thus the hospital surgeon the nerve specialist or the mental consultant may be served with a subpoena to appear at court on a certain date to give evidence The evidence of such skilled observers will it is supposed carry greater weight with the jury than would the evidence of an ordinary practitioner Skilled witnesses may hear the evidence of ordinary witnesses in regard to the case in which they are to give evidence and it is indeed better that they should understand the case thoroughly but they are not usually allowed to hear the evidence of other expert witnesses In civil cases the medical witness should previous to the trial make an agreement with the solicitor who has called him with reference to the fee he is to receive Before consenting to appear as a witness the practitioner should insist on having all the facts of the case put before him in writing In this way only can he decide as to whether in his opinion the plaintiff or defendant is right as regards the medical evidence If summoned by the side on which he thinks the medical testimony is correct then it is his duty to consent to appear If however he is of opinion that the medical evidence is clearly and correctly on the opposite side then he ought to refuse to appear and give evidence and indeed the lawyer would not desire his presence in the witness box unless he could uphold the case Whether an expert witness who has no personal knowledge of the facts is bound to attend on a subpoena is a moot point It would be safer for him to do so and to explain to the judge before taking the oath that his memory has not been sufficiently refreshed The solicitor if he desires his evidence will probably see that the fee is forthcoming A witness may be subjected to three examinations first by the party on whose side he is engaged which is called the examination in chief and in which he affords the basis for the next examination or cross examination by the opposite side The third is the re examination by his own side In the first he merely gives a clear statement of facts or of his opinions In the next his testimony is subjected to rigid examination in order to weaken his previous statements In the third he is allowed to clear up any discrepancies in the cross examination but he must not introduce any new matter which would render him liable to another cross examination The medical witness should answer questions put to him as clearly and as concisely as possible He should make his statements in plain and simple language avoiding as much as possible technical terms and figurative expressions and should not quote authorities in support of his opinions An expert witness when giving evidence may refer to notes for the purpose of refreshing his memory but only if the notes were taken by him at the time when the observations were made or as soon after as practicable There are various courts in which a medical witness may be called on to give evidence one The Coroner s Court When a coroner is informed that the dead body of a person is lying within his jurisdiction and that there is reasonable cause to suspect that such person died either a violent or unnatural death or died a sudden death of which the cause is unknown he must summon a jury of not less than twelve men to investigate the matter in other words hold an inquest and if the deceased had received medical treatment the coroner may summon the medical attendant to give evidence By the Coroners Emergency Provisions Act of nineteen seventeen the number of the jury has been cut down to a minimum of seven and a maximum of eleven men By the Juries Act of nineteen eighteen the coroner has the power of holding a court without a jury if in his discretion it appears to be unnecessary In charges of murder manslaughter deaths of prisoners in prison inmates of asylums or inebriates homes or of infants in nursing homes he must summon a jury The coroner may be satisfied with the evidence as to the cause of a person s death and may dispense with an inquest and grant a burial certificate Cases are notified to the coroner by the police parish officer any medical practitioner registrar of deaths or by any private individual Witnesses having been cited to appear are examined on oath by the coroner who must in criminal cases at least take down the evidence in writing This is then read over to each witness who signs it and this forms his deposition At the end of each case the coroner sums up and the jury return their verdict or inquisition either unanimously or by a majority If this charges any person with murder or manslaughter he is committed by the coroner to prison to await trial or if not present the coroner may issue a warrant for his arrest A chemical analysis of the contents of the stomach et cetera in suspected cases of poisoning is usually done by a special analyst named by the coroner If any witness disobeys the summons to attend the inquest he renders himself liable to a fine not exceeding Ltwo twos but in addition the coroner may commit him to prison for contempt of court In criminal cases the witnesses are bound over to appear at the assizes to give evidence there The coroner may give an order for the exhumation of a body if he thinks the evidence warrants a post mortem examination Coroners inquests are held in all cases of sudden or violent death where the cause of death is not clear in cases of assault where death has taken place immediately or some time afterwards in cases of homicide or suicide where the medical attendant refuses to give a certificate of death where the attendants on the deceased have been culpably negligent or in certain cases of uncertified deaths The medical witness should be very careful in giving evidence before a coroner Even though the inquest be held in a coach house or barn yet it has to be remembered it is a court of law If the case goes on for trial before a superior court your deposition made to the coroner forms the basis of your examination Any misstatements or discrepancies in your evidence will be carefully inquired into and you will make a bad impression on judge and jury if you modify retract or explain away your evidence as given to the coroner You had your opportunity of making any amendments on your evidence when the coroner read over to you your deposition before you signed it as true By the Licensing Act of nineteen oh two an inquest may not be held in any premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor if other suitable premises have been provided The duties of the coroner are based partly on Common Law and are also defined by statute principally by the Coroners Act of eighteen eighty seven fifty and fifty one Vict c seventy one They have been modified however by subsequent Acts e g the Act of eighteen ninety two the Coroners Emergency Provisions Act nineteen seventeen and the Juries Act of nineteen eighteen The fee payable to a medical witness for giving evidence at an inquest is one guinea with an extra guinea for making a post mortem examination and report in the metropolitan area these fees are doubled The coroner must sign the order authorizing the payment and should an inquest be adjourned to a later day no further fee is payable If the deceased died in a hospital infirmary or lunatic asylum the medical witness is not paid any fee Should a medical witness neglect to make the post mortem examination after receiving the order to do so he is liable to a fine of Lfive In Scotland the Procurator Fiscal fulfils many of the duties of the coroner but he cannot hold a public inquiry He interrogates the witnesses privately and these questions with the answers form the precognition More serious cases are dealt with by the Sheriff of each county and capital charges must be dealt with by the High Court of Justiciary In Scotland the verdicts of the jury may be guilty not guilty or not proven two The Magistrate s Court or Petty Sessions is also a court of preliminary inquiry The prisoner may be dealt with summarily as for example in minor assault cases or if the case is of sufficient gravity and the evidence justifies such a course may be committed for trial The fee for a medical witness who resides within three miles of the court is ten shillings and sixpence if at a greater distance one guinea In the Metropolis the prisoner in the first instance is brought before a magistrate technically known as the beak who in addition to being a person of great acumen is a stipendiary and thus occupies a superior position to the ordinary J P who is one of the great unpaid In the City of London is the Mansion House Justice Room presided over by the Lord Mayor or one of the Aldermen The prisoner may ultimately be sent for trial to the Central Criminal Court known as the Old Bailey or elsewhere three Quarter Sessions These are held every quarter by Justices of the Peace All cases can be tried before the sessions except felonies or cases which involve difficult legal questions In London this court is known as the Central Criminal Court and it also acts as the Assize Court In Borough Sessions a barrister known as the Recorder is appointed as sole judge four The Assizes deal with both criminal and civil cases There is the Crown Court where criminal cases are tried and there is the Civil Court where civil cases are heard Before a case sent up by a lower court can be tried by the judge and petty jury it is investigated by the grand jury which is composed of superior individuals If they find a true bill the case goes on but if they throw it out the accused is at liberty to take his departure At the Court of Assize the prisoner is tried by a jury of twelve In bringing in the verdict the jury must be unanimous If they cannot agree the case must be retried before a new jury At the Assize Court the medical witness gets a guinea a day with two shillings extra to pay for his bed and board for every night he is away from home with his second class railway fare if there is a second class on the railway by which he travels If there is no railway and he has to walk he is entitled to threepence a mile for refreshments both ways five Court of Criminal Appeal This was established in nineteen oh eight and consists of three judges A right of appeal may be based one solely on a question of law two on certificate from the judge who tried the prisoner three on mitigation of sentence Speaking generally in the Superior Courts the fees which may be claimed by medical men called on to give evidence are a guinea a day if resident in the town in which the case is tried and from two to three guineas a day if resident at a distance from the place of trial this to include everything except travelling expenses The medical witness also receives a reasonable allowance for hotel and travelling expenses If a witness is summoned to appear before two courts at the same time he must obey the summons of the higher court Criminal cases take precedence of civil A medical man has no right to claim privilege as an excuse for not divulging professional secrets in a court of law and the less he talks about professional etiquette the better Still in a civil case if he were to make an emphatic protest the matter in all probability would not be pressed In a criminal case he would promptly be reminded of the nature of his oath A medical man may be required to furnish a formal written report It may be the history of a fatal illness or the result of a post mortem examination These reports must be drawn up very carefully and no technical terms should be employed No witness on being sworn can be compelled to kiss the book The Oaths Act fifty one and fifty two Vict c forty six Sec five declares without any qualification that if any person to whom an oath is administered desires to swear with uplifted hand in the form and manner in which an oath is usually administered in Scotland he shall be permitted to do so and the oath shall be administered to him in such form and manner without further question The witness takes the oath standing with the bare right hand uplifted above the head the formula being I swear by Almighty God that I will speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth The presiding judge should say the words and the witness should repeat them after him There is no kissing of the book and the words So help me God which occur in the English form are not employed It will be noted that the Scotch form constitutes an oath and is not an affirmation The judge has no right to ask if you object on religious grounds or to put any question He is bound by the provisions of the Act and the enactment applies not only to all forms of the witness oath whether in civil or criminal courts or before coroners but to every oath which may be lawfully administered either in Great Britain or Ireland A witness engaged to give expert evidence should demand his fee before going into court or at all events before being sworn With regard to notes these should be made at the time on the spot and may be used by the witness in court as a refresher to the memory though not altogether to supply its place All evidence is made up of testimony but all testimony is not evidence The witness must not introduce hearsay testimony In one case only is hearsay evidence admissible and that is in the case of a dying declaration This is a statement made by a dying person as to how his injuries were inflicted These declarations are accepted because the law presumes that a dying man is anxious to speak the truth But the person must believe that he is actually on the point of death with absolutely no hope of recovery A statement was rejected because the dying person in using the expression I have no hope of recovery requested that the words at present should be added If after making the statement the patient were to say I hope now I shall get better it would invalidate the declaration To make the declaration admissible as evidence death must ensue If possible a magistrate should take the dying declaration but if he is not available the medical man without any suggestions or comments of his own should write down the statements made by the dying person and see them signed and witnessed It must be made clear to the court that at the time of making his statement the witness was under the full conviction of approaching or impending death III PERSONAL IDENTITY It is but seldom that medical evidence is required with regard to the identification of the living though it may sometimes be so as in the celebrated Tichborne case The medical man may in such cases be consulted as to family resemblance marks on the body naevi materni scars and tattoo marks or with regard to the organs of generation in cases of doubtful sex Tattoo marks may disappear during life the brighter colours as vermilion as a rule more readily than those made with carbon as Indian ink after death the colouring matter may be found in the proximal glands If the tattooing is superficial merely underneath the cuticle the marks may possibly be removed by acetic acid or cantharides or even by picking out the colouring matter with a fine needle With regard to scars and their permanence it will be remembered that scars occasioned by actual loss of substance or by wounds healed by granulation never disappear The scars of leech bites lancet wounds or cupping instruments may disappear after a lapse of time It is difficult if not impossible to give any certain or positive opinion as to the age of a scar recent scars are pink in colour old scars are white and glistening The cicatrix resulting from a wound depends upon its situation Of incised wounds an elliptical cicatrix is typical linear being chiefly found between the fingers and toes By way of disguise the hair may be dyed black with lead acetate or nitrate of silver detected by allowing the hair to grow or by steeping some of it in dilute nitric acid and testing with iodide of potassium for lead and hydrochloric acid for silver The hair may be bleached with chlorine or peroxide of hydrogen detected by letting the hair grow and by its unnatural feeling and the irregularity of the bleaching Finger print impressions are the most trustworthy of all means of identification Such a print is obtained by rubbing the pulp of the finger in lampblack and then impressing it on a glazed card The impression reveals the fine lines which exist at the tips of the fingers The arrangement of these lines is special to each person and cannot be changed Hence this method is employed by the police in the identification of prisoners In the determination of cases of doubtful sex in the living the following points should be noticed the size of the penis or clitoris and whether perforate or not the form of the prepuce the presence or absence of nymphae and of testicles or ovaries Openings must be carefully sounded as to their communication with bladder or uterus After puberty inquiry should be made as to menstrual or vicarious discharges the general development of the body the growth of hair the tone of voice and the behaviour of the individual towards either sex With regard to the identification of the dead in cases of death by accident or violence the medical man s assistance may be called The sex of the skeleton if that only be found may be judged from the bones of the female generally being smaller and more slender than those of the male by the female thorax being deeper the costal cartilages longer the ilia more expanded the sacrum flatter and broader the coccyx movable and turned back the tuberosities of the ischia wider apart the pubes shallow and the whole pelvis shallower and with larger outlets But of all these signs the only one of any real value is the roundness of the pubic arch in the female as compared with the pointed arch in the male Before puberty the sex cannot be determined from an examination of the bones Age may be calculated from the presence nature and number of the erupted teeth from the cartilages of the ribs which gradually ossify as age advances from the angle formed by the ramus of the lower jaw with its body obtuse in infancy a right angle in the adult and again obtuse in the aged from loss of the teeth and in the young from the condition of the epiphyses with regard to their attachment to their respective shafts To determine stature the whole skeleton should be laid out and measured one one two to two inches being allowed for the soft parts IV EXAMINATION OF PERSONS FOUND DEAD When a medical man is called to a case of sudden death he should carefully note anything likely to throw any light on the cause of death He should notice the place where the body was found the position and attitude of the body the soil or surface on which the body lies the position of surrounding objects and the condition of the clothes He should also notice if there are any signs of a struggle having taken place if the hands are clenched if the face is distorted if there has been foaming at the mouth and if urine or faeces have been passed involuntarily Urine may be drawn off with a catheter and tested for albumin and sugar If required to make a post mortem examination every cavity and important organ of the body must be carefully and minutely examined the seat of injury being inspected first V MODES OF SUDDEN DEATH There are three modes in which death may occur one Syncope two asphyxia three coma one Syncope is death beginning at the heart in other words failure of circulation It may arise from one Anaemia or deficiency of blood due to haemorrhage such as occurs in injuries or from bleeding from the lungs stomach uterus or other internal organs two Asthenia or failure of the heart s action met with in starvation in exhausting diseases such as phthisis cancer pernicious anaemia and Bright s disease and in some cases of poisoning for example aconite The symptoms of syncope are faintness giddiness pallor slow weak and irregular pulse sighing respiration insensibility dilated pupils and convulsions Post mortem the heart is found empty and contracted When however there is sudden stoppage of the heart the right and left cavities contain blood in the normal quantities and blood is found in the venae cavae and in the arterial trunks There is no engorgement of either lungs or brain two Asphyxia or death beginning at the lungs may be due to obstruction of the air passages from foreign bodies in the larynx drowning suffocation strangling and hanging from injury to the cervical cord effusion into the pleurae with consequent pressure on the lungs embolism of the pulmonary artery and from spasmodic contraction of the thoracic and abdominal muscles in strychnine poisoning The symptoms of this condition are fighting for breath giddiness relaxation of the sphincters and convulsions Post mortem cadaveric lividity is well marked especially in nose lips ears et cetera the right cavities of the heart and the venae cavae are found gorged with dark fluid blood The pulmonary veins the left cavities of the heart and the aorta are either empty or contain but little blood The lungs are dark and engorged with blood and the lining of the air tubes is bright red in colour Much bloody froth escapes on cutting into the lungs Numerous small haemorrhages Tardieu s spots are found on the surface and in the substance of the internal organs as well as in the skin of the neck and face three Coma or death beginning at the brain may arise from concussion compression cerebral pressure from haemorrhage and other forms of apoplexy blocking of a cerebral artery from embolism dietetic and uraemic conditions and from opium and other narcotic poisons The symptoms of this condition are stupor loss of consciousness and stertorous breathing The post mortem signs are congestion of the substance of the brain and its membranes with accumulation of the blood in the cavities of the heart more on the right side than on the left It must be remembered that owing to the interdependence of all the vital functions there is no line of demarcation between the various modes of death In all cases of sudden death think of angina pectoris and the rupture of an aneurism The following is a list of some of the commoner causes of sudden death a Instantaneously Sudden Death one Syncope by far the commonest cause two Aortic incompetence three Rupture of heart four Rupture of a valve five Rupture of aortic aneurism six Embolism of coronary artery seven Angina pectoris b Less Sudden but Unexpected Death one Cerebral haemorrhage or embolism two Mitral and tricuspid valvular lesions if the patient exerts himself three Rupture of a gastric or duodenal ulcer rupture of liver spleen or extra uterine gestation or abdominal aneurism four Suffocation during an epileptic fit vomited matter or other material drawn into the trachea or air passages croup five Arterio sclerosis may lead to thrombosis embolism or aneurism six Poisoning as by hydrocyanic acid cyanide of potassium inhalation of carbonic acid or coal gas oedema of glottis following inhalation of ammonia seven Rapid onset of some acute specific disease such as pneumonia or diphtheria collapse from cholera eight Heat stroke lightning shocks of electricity of high tension nine Mental or physical shock ten Exertion while the stomach is overloaded eleven Diabetic coma uraemia twelve Status lymphaticus This is a general hyperplastic condition of the lymphatic structures in the body and is seen in enlargement of tonsils thymus spleen as well as of Peyer s patches and mesenteric glands It is a frequent cause of death during chloroform anaesthesia for slight operations in young people In addition it may be as well to remember that death sometimes occurs suddenly in exophthalmic goitre hypertrophy of the thymus and in Addison s disease In some cases of sudden death nothing has been found post mortem even when the autopsy has been made by skilled observers and the brain and cord have been submitted to microscopical examination VI SIGNS OF DEATH one Cadaveric appearance ashy white colour two Cessation of the circulation and respiration no sound being heard by the stethoscope Cessation of the circulation may be determined by a placing a ligature round the base of a finger Magnus test b injecting a solution of fluorescin Icard s test c looking through the web of the fingers at a bright light diaphanous test d the dulling of a steel needle when thrust into the living body e the clear outline of the dead heart when viewed in the fluorescent screen three The state of the eye the tension is at once lost iris insensible to light fundus yellow in colour cornea dull and sunken four The state of the skin pale livid with loss of elasticity five Extinction of muscular irritability The above signs afford no means of determining how long life has been extinct The following however do Cooling of the Body The average internal temperature of the body is from ninety eight deg to one hundred deg F The time taken in cooling is from fifteen to twenty hours but it may be modified by the kind of death the age of the person the presence or absence of clothing on the body the surrounding temperature and the stillness or otherwise of the air about the body Still the body other things being equal may be said to be quite cold in about twelve hours Hypostasis or post mortem staining is due to the settling down of the blood in the most dependent parts of the body while the body is cooling It is a sure sign of death and occurs in all forms of death even in that due to haemorrhage although not so marked in degree Post mortem staining cadaveric lividity begins to appear in from eight to twelve hours after death and its position on the body will help to determine the length of time the body has lain in the position in which it was found The staining is of a dull red or slaty blue colour It must be distinguished from ecchymosis the result of a bruise by making an incision into the part in the case of hypostasis a few small bloody points of divided arteries will be seen in the case of ecchymosis the subcutaneous tissues are infiltrated with blood clot Internally hypostasis must not be mistaken for congestion of the brain or lungs or the results of inflammation of the intestines If the intestine is pulled straight inflammatory redness is continuous hypostasis is disconnected About the neck hypostasis must not be mistaken for the mark of a cord or other ligature When the blood is of a bright red colour after death as happens in poisoning by company or HCN or in death from cold the hypostasis is bright red also Cadaveric Rigidity Rigor Mortis For some time after death the muscles continue to contract under stimuli When this irritability ceases and it seldom exceeds two hours rigidity and hardening sets in and in all cases precedes putrefaction It is caused by the coagulation of the muscle plasma It commences in the muscles of the back of the neck and lower jaw and then passes into the muscles of the face front of the neck chest upper extremities and lastly to the lower extremities It has been noticed in the new born infant as well as in the foetus It lasts from sixteen to twenty hours or more In lingering diseases after violent exertion and in warm climates it sets in quickly and disappears in two or three hours in those who are in perfect health and die from accident or asphyxia it may not come on until from ten to twenty four hours and may last three or four days After death from convulsions or strychnine poisoning the body may pass at once into rigor mortis Rigor mortis must be distinguished from cadaveric spasm or the death clutch in the former articles in the hands are readily removable in the latter this is not the case In tetanic spasm the limbs when bent return to their former position not so in rigor mortis Putrefaction appears in from one to three days after death as a greenish blue discoloration of the abdomen in the drowned over the head and face This increases becomes darker and more general a strong putrefactive odour is developed the thorax and abdomen become distended with gas and the epidermis peels off The muscles then become pulpy and assume a dark greenish colour the whole body at length becoming changed into a soft semi fluid mass The organ first showing the putrefactive change is the trachea that which resists putrefaction longest is the uterus These putrefactive changes are modified by the fat or lean condition of the body the temperature putrefaction taking place more rapidly in summer than in winter access of air the period place mode of interment age et cetera Bodies which remain in water putrefy more slowly than those in air Saponification In bodies which are very fat and have lain in water or moist soil for from one to three years this process takes place the fat uniting with the ammonia given off by the decomposition to form adipocere This consists of a margarate or stearate of ammonium with lime oxide of iron potash certain fatty acids and a yellowish odorous matter It has a fatty unctuous feel is either pure white or pale yellow with an odour of decayed cheese Small portions of the body may show signs of this change in six weeks Post Mortem Examination Never make an autopsy in criminal cases without a written order from the coroner or Procurator Fiscal If authorized however first have the body identified then photographed if it has not been identified A medical man representing the accused may be present but only by consent of the Crown authorities or of the Sheriff Clothing should be examined for blood stains cuts et cetera Examine external surface of body and take accurate measurements of wounds marks deformities tattooings note degree and distribution of post mortem staining rigidity et cetera Examine brain by making incision from ear to ear across vertex reflect scalp forwards and backwards and saw off calvarium Examine brain carefully externally and on section Examine organs of chest and abdomen through an incision made from symphysis menti to pubis reflecting tissues from chest wall and cutting through costal cartilages In cases of suspected poisoning have several clean jars into which you place the stomach with contents intestines with contents piece of liver kidney spleen et cetera and seal each up carefully attaching label with name of deceased date and contained organs and transmit these personally to the analyst Exhumation A body which has been buried cannot be exhumed without an order from a coroner fiscal or from the Home Secretary There is no legal limit in England as to when a body may be exhumed in Scotland however if an interval of twenty years has elapsed an accused person cannot be prosecuted prescription of crime VII DEATH FROM ANAESTHETICS et cetera The coroner in England and Wales and Ireland must inquire into every case of death during the administration of an anaesthetic The anaesthetist has to appear at the inquest and must answer a long series of questions relative to the administration of the drug Before therefore giving an anaesthetic and so as to furnish yourself with a proper defence in the event of death occurring you ought to examine the heart lungs and kidneys of the patient to see if they are healthy Should a fatal result follow the anaesthetist will require to prove that it was necessary to give the anaesthetic that the one employed was the most suitable that the patient was in a fit state of health to have it administered that it was given skilfully and in moderate amount that he had the usual remedies at hand in case of failure of the heart or lungs and that he employed every means in his power to resuscitate the patient The condition of the lungs is of more importance than the state of the heart The chloroformist ought always to use the best chloroform An anaesthetic should never be administered except in the presence of a third person This applies especially to dentists who give gas to females Malpractice In every case where a medical man attends a patient he must give him that amount of care skill knowledge or judgment that the law expects of him If he does not then the charge of malpractice may be brought against him It is most frequently alleged in connection with surgical affections e g overlooking a fracture or dislocation Before a major operation is performed it is well to get a written agreement VIII PRESUMPTION OF DEATH SURVIVORSHIP Presumption of Death If a person be unheard of for seven years the court may on application by the nearest relative presume death to have taken place If however it can be shown that in all probability death had occurred in a certain accident or shipwreck the decree may be made much earlier Presumption of Survivorship When two or more related persons perish in a common accident it may be necessary in order to decide questions of succession to determine which of them died first It is generally accepted that the stronger and more vigorous will survive longest IX ASSAULT MURDER MANSLAUGHTER et cetera Assault This is an attempt or offer to do violence to another person it is not necessary that actual injury has been done but evil intention must be proved When a corporal hurt has been sustained then assault and battery has been committed The assault may be aggravated by the use of weapons et cetera Homicide may be justifiable as in the case of judicial execution or excusable as in defence of one s family or property Felonious homicide is murder This means that a human being has been killed by another maliciously and deliberately or with reckless disregard of consequences Manslaughter or Culpable Homicide Scotland is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice as homicide after great provocation signalman who allows a train to pass and so collide with another in front X WOUNDS AND MECHANICAL INJURIES A wound may be defined as a breach of continuity in the structures of the body whether external or internal suddenly occasioned by mechanical violence The law does not define a wound but the true skin must be broken Wounds are dangerous from shock haemorrhage from the supervention of crysipelas or pyaemia and from malum regimen on the part of the patient or surgeon Is the wound dangerous to life This question can only be answered by a full consideration of all the circumstances of the case a guarded prognosis is wise in all cases Burns are caused by flames highly heated solids or very cold solids as solid carbonic acid scalds by steam or hot fluids Burns may cause death from shock suffocation oedema glottidis inflammation of serous surfaces bronchitis pneumonia duodenal ulcer coma or exhaustion A burn of the skin inflicted during life is followed by a bleb containing serum the edges of this blister are bright red and the base seen after removing the cuticle is red and inflamed if sustained after death a bleb if present contains but little fluid and there are no signs of vital reaction There are six degrees of burns one Superficial inflammation two formation of vesicles three destruction of superficial layer of skin four destruction of cellular tissue five deep parts charred six carbonization of bones The larger the area of skin burnt the more grave is the prognosis Burns of the abdomen and genital organs are especially dangerous Young children are specially liable to die after burns XI CONTUSED WOUNDS AND INJURIES UNACCOMPANIED BY SOLUTION OF CONTINUITY If a blow be inflicted with a blunt instrument there is produced a bruise or ecchymosis of which it is unnecessary here to describe the appearance and progress A bruise may be distinguished from a post mortem stain by the cuticle in the former often being abraded and raised When an incision is made into the bruise the whole of the subcutaneous tissues are found to be infiltrated with blood clot and there is no clear margin In the case of a post mortem stain the edges are sharply defined not raised and on section mere bloody points are seen which are the cut ends of the divided blood vessels XII INCISED WOUNDS AND THOSE ACCOMPANIED BY SOLUTION OF CONTINUITY These comprise incised punctured and lacerated wounds In a recent incised wound inflicted during life there is copious haemorrhage the cellular tissue is filled with blood the edges of the wound gape and are everted and the cavity of the wound is filled with coagula Lacerated wounds combine the characters of incised and contused wounds They are caused by falls being ridden over machinery crushes bites blows from blunt weapons et cetera The wounds heal by suppuration Punctured wounds come intermediate between incised and lacerated They are greater in depth than in length being caused by sword or rapier thrusts They cause little haemorrhage externally but death may be due to internal haemorrhage They may be complicated by one the introduction of septic material adhering to the instrument two the entrance of foreign bodies which lodge in the wound not only carrying in septic matter but acting as mechanical irritants three injury to deeper parts which may at the time be difficult to detect An apparently incised wound may be produced by a hard blunt weapon over a bone e g shin or cranium It is often difficult to distinguish between a wound of the scalp inflicted with a knife and one made by a blow with a stick A puncture with a sharp edged pointed knife leaves a fusiform or spindle shaped wound A wound from a blow with a stick might be of this character or it might present a jagged swollen appearance at the margin with much contusion of the surrounding tissues If the wound is seen soon after it is inflicted examination with a lens may disclose irregularities of the margins or little bridges of connective tissue or vessels running across the wound and so be inconsistent with its production by a cutting instrument Lacerated wounds as a rule bleed less freely than those which are incised Symptoms of concussion would favour the theory of the injury having been inflicted by a heavy instrument Again it is often difficult to decide whether the injury which caused death was the result of a blow or a fall A heavy blow with a stick may at once cause fatal effusion of blood but this might equally result from fracture of the skull resulting from a fall The wound should be carefully examined for foreign bodies such as grit dirt or sand The distinction between incised wounds inflicted during life and after death is found in the fact that a wound inflicted during life presents the appearances already described whereas in a post mortem incised wound only a small quantity of liquid venous blood is effused the edges are close yielding inelastic the blood is not effused into the cellular tissue and there are no signs of vital reaction The presence of inflammatory reaction or pus shows that the wound must have been inflicted some time before death probably two or three days Self inflicted wounds are made by the person himself in order to divert suspicion or in order to bring accusation against another Such wounds are always in front not over vital organs and superficial in character Note the condition of the clothes in such cases XIII GUNSHOT WOUNDS These may be punctured contused or lacerated Round balls make a larger opening than those which are conical Small shot fired at a short distance make one large ragged opening while at distances greater than three feet the shot scatter and there is no central opening The Lee Metford bullet is more destructive than the Mauser The former is the larger but the difference in size is not great The Martini Henry bullet weighs four hundred eighty grains the Lee Metford two hundred fifteen and the Mauser one hundred seventy three Speaking generally a gunshot wound unlike a punctured wound becomes larger as it increases in depth the aperture of entrance is round clean with inverted edges and that of exit larger less regular than that of entrance and with everted edges In the case of high velocity bullets from smooth bore rifles including the Mauser and Lee Metford the aperture of entry is small the aperture of exit is slightly larger and tends to be more slit like There is but little tendency to carry in portions of clothing or septic material and the wound heals by first intention if reasonable precautions be taken The external cicatrices finally look very similar to those produced by bad acne pustules The contents of all gunshot wounds should be preserved as they may be useful in evidence A pocket revolver as a rule leaves the bullet in the body Wounds inflicted by firearms may be due to accident homicide or suicide Blackening of the wound singeing of the hair scorching of the skin and clothing show that the weapon was fired at close quarters whilst blackening of the hand points to suicide Even when the weapon is fired quite close there may be no blackening of the skin and the hand is not always blackened in cases of suicide Smokeless powder does not blacken the skin Wounds on the back of the body are not usually self inflicted but a suicide may elect to blow off the back of his head A wound in the back may be met with in a sportsman who indulges in the careless habit of dragging a loaded gun after him If a revolver is found tightly grasped in the hand it is probably a case of suicide whilst if it lies lightly in the hand it may be suicide or homicide If no weapon is found near the body it is not conclusive proof that it is not suicide for it may have been thrown into a river or pond or to some distance and picked up by a passer by A bullet penetrating the skull even from a distance of three thousand yards may act as an explosive scattering the contents in all directions but the bullet from a revolver will usually be found in the cranium The prognosis depends partly on the extent of the injury and the parts involved but there is also risk from secondary haemorrhage and from such complications as pleurisy pericarditis and peritonitis Death may result from shock haemorrhage injury to brain or important nervous structures XIV WOUNDS OF VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY one Of the Head Wounds of the scalp are likely to be followed by one erysipelatous inflammation two inflammation of the tendinous structures with or without suppuration A severe blow on the vertex may cause fracture of the base of the skull Injuries of the brain include concussion compression wounds contusion and inflammation Concussion is a common effect of blows or violent shocks and the symptoms follow immediately on the accident death sometimes taking place without reaction Compression may be caused by depressed bone or effused blood rupture of middle meningeal artery and serum The symptoms may come on suddenly or gradually Wounds of the brain present very great difficulties and vary greatly in their effect very slight wounds producing severe symptoms and vice versa A person may receive an injury to the head recover from the first effects and then die with all the symptoms of compression from internal haemorrhage This is due to the fact that the primary syncope arrests the haemorrhage which returns during the subsequent reaction or on the occurrence of any excitement Inflammation of the meninges or brain may follow injuries not only to the brain itself but to the scalp and adjacent parts as the orbit and ear Inflammation does not usually come on at once but after variable periods two Injuries to the Spinal Cord may be due to concussion compression fracture dislocation or wounds That the wound has penetrated the meninges is shown by the escape of cerebro spinal fluid The cord and nerves may be injured one by the puncture two by extravasation of blood and the formation of a clot and three by subsequent septic inflammation Division or complete compression of the cord at or above the level of the fourth cervical vertebra is immediately fatal as happens in judicial hanging When the injury is below the fourth the diaphragm continues forcibly in action but the lungs are imperfectly expanded and life will not be maintained for more than a day or two When the injury is in the dorsal region there is paralysis of the legs and of the sphincters of the bladder and rectum but power is retained in the arms and the upper intercostal muscles act the extent of paralysis depending on the level of the lesion In injuries to the lumbar region the legs may be partly paralysed and the rectal and bladder sphincters may be involved Railway spine or traumatic neurasthenia may be set up by concussion of the cord as a result of blows or falls Passengers after railway accidents or miners often suffer from this affection three Of the Face These produce great disfigurement and inconvenience and there is a risk of injury to the brain The seventh nerve may be involved giving rise to facial paralysis Punctured wounds of the orbit are especially dangerous Wounds apparently confined to the external parts often conceal deep seated mischief four Of the Eye The iris may be injured by sharp blows as from the cork of a soda water bottle It is usually followed by haemorrhage into the anterior chamber and there may be separation of the iris from its ciliary border Wounds at the edge of the cornea are often followed by prolapse of the iris Acute traumatic iritis or irido cyclitis may supervene four or five days after the injury The lens is frequently wounded in addition to the cornea and iris In dislocation of the lens into the anterior chamber as the result of a blow the lens appears like a large drop of oil lying at the back of the cornea the margin exhibiting a brilliant yellow reflex Partial dislocations of the lens as the result of severe blows generally terminate in cataract five Of the Throat Very frequently inflicted by suicides Division of the carotid artery is fatal and of the internal jugular vein very dangerous on account of entrance of air Wounds of the larynx and trachea are not necessarily or immediately dangerous but septic pneumonia is very apt to follow Wounds of the throat inflicted by suicides are commonly situated at the upper part involving the hyoid bone and the thyroid and cricoid cartilages The larynx is opened but the large vessels often escape In most suicidal wounds of the throat the direction is from left to right the incision being slightly inclined from above downwards At the termination of a suicidal cut throat the skin is the last structure divided the wound being shallower as it reaches its termination the wounds often show parallelism The weapon is often firmly grasped in the hand Inquiry should be made as to whether the patient is right or left handed or ambidextrous Homicidal cut throat is usually very severe and situated low down in the neck or far to the side six Of the Chest Incised wounds of the walls are not of necessity dangerous but severe blows by causing fracture of the bones and internal injuries are often fatal The symptoms of penetrating wounds of the chest are one The passage of blood and air through the wound two haemoptysis three pneumothorax and four protrusion of the lung forming a tumour covered with pleura Fracture of the ribs may be due to direct violence as from a blow when the ends are driven inwards or to indirect violence as from a squeeze in a crowd when the ends are driven outwards seven Of the Lungs These usually cause haemorrhage and are frequently followed by pleurisy either dry or with effusion and by pneumonia eight Of the Heart Penetrating wounds are fatal from haemorrhage of the base more speedily than of the apex but life may be prolonged for some time even after a severe wound to the heart Injury to the right ventricle is the most fatal injury and the most frequent Rupture from disease usually occurs in the left ventricle rupture from a crush is usually towards the base and on the right side nine Of the Aorta and Pulmonary Artery Fatal ten Of the Diaphragm Generally fatal owing to the severe injury of the other abdominal organs If the diaphragm be ruptured hernia of the organs may result eleven Of the Abdomen Of the walls may be dangerous from division of the epigastric artery ventral hernia may follow internal haemorrhage et cetera Blows on the abdomen are prone to cause death from cardiac inhibition twelve Of the Liver May divide the large vessels Venous blood flows profusely from a punctured wound of the liver Wounds of the gall bladder cause effusion of bile and peritoneal inflammation Laceration of the liver may result from external violence without leaving any outward sign of the injury it is commonly fatal There is rapid and acute anaemia from the pouring out of blood into the abdominal cavity This may also occur with injuries of other organs in the abdomen thirteen Of the Spleen Fatal haemorrhage may result from penetrating wounds or from rupture due to kicks blows crushes especially if the spleen be enlarged fourteen Of the Stomach May be fatal from shock from haemorrhage from extravasation of contents or from inflammation The danger is materially lessened by prompt surgical intervention fifteen Of the Intestines May be fatal in the same way as those of the stomach More dangerous in the small than in the large intestines sixteen Of the Kidneys May prove fatal from haemorrhage extravasation of urine or inflammation seventeen Of the Bladder Dangerous from extravasation of urine In fracture of the pelvis the bladder is often injured and extraperitoneal infiltration of urine occurs with frequently a fatal issue eighteen Of Genital Organs Incised wounds of penis may produce fatal haemorrhage Removal of testicles may prove fatal from shock to nervous system Wounds of the spermatic cord may be dangerous from haemorrhage Wounds to the vulva are dangerous owing to haemorrhage from the large plexus of veins without valves XV DETECTION OF BLOOD STAINS et cetera Stains may require detection on clothing on cutting instruments on floors and furniture et cetera The following are the distinctive characters of blood stains a Ocular Inspection Blood stains on dark coloured materials which in daylight might be easily overlooked may be readily detected by the use of artificial light as that of a candle brought near the cloth Blood spots when recent are of a bright red colour if arterial of a purple hue if venous the latter becoming brighter on exposure to the air After a few hours blood stains assume a reddish brown or chocolate tint which they maintain for years This change is due to the conversion of haemoglobin into methaemoglobin and finally into haematin The change of colour in warm weather usually occurs in less than twenty four hours The colour is determined not entirely by the age of the stain but is influenced by the presence or absence of impurities in the air such as the vapours of sulphurous sulphuric and hydrochloric acids If recent a jelly like material may be seen by the aid of a magnifying glass lying between the fibres If old a cinnabar red streak is seen on drawing a needle across the stain b Microscopic Demonstration With the aid of the microscope blood may be detected by the presence of the characteristic blood corpuscles The human blood corpuscle is a non nucleated biconcave disc having a diameter of about one three thousand five hundred of an inch All mammalian red corpuscles have the same shape except those of the camel which are oval The corpuscles of birds fishes reptiles and amphibians are oval and nucleated The corpuscles of most mammals are smaller than those of man but the size of a corpuscle is affected by various circumstances such as drying or moisture so that the medical witness is rarely justified in going farther than stating whether the stain is that of the blood of a mammal or not Unfortunately the corpuscles are usually so dried that little information regarding their size can be given c Action of Water Water has a solvent action on blood fresh stains rapidly dissolving when the material on which they occur is placed in cold distilled water forming a bright red solution The haematin of old stains dissolves very slowly so employ a weak solution of ammonia and this will give a solution of alkaline haematin Rust is not soluble in water d Action of Heat Blood stains on knives may be removed by heating the metal when the blood will peel off at once distinguishing it from rust Should the blood stain on the metal be long exposed to the air rust may be mixed with the blood when the test will fail The solution obtained in water is coagulated by heat the colour entirely destroyed and a flocculent muddy brown precipitate formed e Action of Caustic Potash The solution of blood obtained in water is boiled when a coagulum is formed soluble in hot caustic potash the solution formed being greenish by transmitted and red by reflected light f Action of Nitric Acid Nitric acid added to a watery solution produces a whitish grey precipitate g Action of Guaiacum Tincture of guaiacum produces in the watery solution a reddish white precipitate of the resin but on addition of an aqueous solution of peroxide of hydrogen or of an ethereal solution of the same substance known as ozonic ether a blue or bluish green colour is developed This test is delicate and succeeds best in dilute solutions It is not absolutely indicative of the presence of blood for tincture of guaiacum is coloured blue by milk saliva and pus h Haemin Crystals Teichman s Crystals These are produced by heating a drop of blood or a watery solution of it with a minute crystal of sodium chloride on a glass slide and evaporating to dryness A cover glass is placed over this and a drop of glacial acetic acid allowed to run in It is again heated until bubbles appear Crystals of haemin may now be detected by the microscope They are dark brown or yellow rhombic prisms An improvement on this test is the use of formic acid alone on slowly evaporating it numerous very small dark crystals are visible if haemoglobin has been present Whitney s test i Spectroscopic Appearances If a solution of a recent stain be examined by the spectroscope we get two absorption bands situated between the lines D and E the one nearer E being doubly as broad as the other These bands indicate oxyhaemoglobin If we now add a little ammonium sulphide to this solution we get the spectrum of reduced haemoglobin which is a single broad absorption band situated in the interval between the preceding oxyhaemoglobin bands By shaking the solution oxyhaemoglobin is again reproduced and gives its special absorption bands If ammonia be added to the original solution alkaline haematin is produced or if acetic acid be chosen acid haematin is produced and each gives its appropriate absorption bands Methaemoglobin is formed in stains which have been exposed to the air for a few days and haematin is found in old stains Haemochromogen gives a very characteristic spectrum and is obtained by reducing alkaline haematin by ammonium sulphide Carbon monoxide haemoglobin gives a spectrum which resembles that of oxyhaemoglobin but it is not reduced by ammonium sulphide j Precipitin Test This allows us to tell whether the blood is from a human being or not A specific serum must be obtained from a rabbit which is sensitized as follows ten c c of human blood is injected into its peritoneal cavity at intervals until from three to five injections have been given The serum of this animal s blood will then give a white precipitate only when brought into contact with dilute solutions of human blood but with the blood of no other animal This is known also as the biologic or Uhlenhuth s test Rust Stains These are yellowish red in colour and do not stiffen the cloth The iron may be dissolved by placing the stain in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid when on adding ferrocyanide of potassium Prussian blue is produced Fruit Stains are seldom so dark as blood stains Solutions of these do not change colour or coagulate on boiling ammonia changes the colour to blue or green acid brightens the original colour while chlorine bleaches it Hairs Human hairs must be identified and distinguished from those of the lower mammals If the hair has been pulled out from the root the microscope will show that the bulbous root has a concave surface which fitted over the hair papilla or that the root is encased in a fatty sheath Fibres of Clothing Microscopically wool fibres are coarse curly and striated transversely cotton fibres appear as flattened bands twisted into spirals linen fibres are round jointed at frequent intervals with small root like filaments silk fibres are solid continuous and highly glistening XVI DEATH BY SUFFOCATION Signs and Symptoms There are usually three stages one Exaggerated respiratory activity air hunger anxiety congested appearance of face ringing in ears two Loss of consciousness convulsions relaxation of sphincters three Respirations feeble and gasping and soon cease convulsions of stretching character heart continues to beat for three to four minutes after breathing ceases Post Mortem Appearances External Cadaveric lividity well marked nose lips ears finger tips almost black in colour appearance may be placid or if asphyxia has been sudden the tongue may be protruded and eyeballs prominent with much bloody mucus escaping from mouth and nose Internal The blood is dark and remains fluid great engorgement of venous system right side of heart great veins of thorax and abdomen liver spleen et cetera Lungs dark purple in colour much bloody froth escapes on squeezing them mucous lining of trachea and bronchi congested and bright red in colour air cells distended or ruptured many small haemorrhages on surface of lungs and other organs as well as in their substance Tardieu s spots due to rupture of venous capillaries from increased vascular pressure XVII DEATH BY HANGING In hanging death occurs by asphyxia as in drowning Sensibility is soon lost and death takes place in four or five minutes The eyes in some cases are brilliant and staring tongue swollen and livid blood or bloody froth is found about the mouth and nostrils and the hands are clenched In other cases the countenance is placid with an almost entire absence of the signs just given The mark on the neck which may be more or less interrupted by the beard shows the course of the cord which in hanging is obliquely round the neck following the line of the jaw but straight round in strangulation In judicial hanging death is not due to asphyxiation but owing to the long drop the cervical vertebrae are dislocated and the spinal cord injured so high up that almost instant death takes place On dissection the muscles and ligaments of the windpipe may be found stretched bruised or torn and the inner coats of the carotid arteries are sometimes found divided In ordinary suicidal hanging there may be entire absence of injury to the soft parts about the neck the length of the drop modifying these appearances The mark of the cord is not a sign of hanging is a purely cadaveric phenomenon and may be produced some hours after death XVIII DEATH BY STRANGULATION This differs from hanging in that the body is not suspended It may be effected by a ligature round the neck or by direct pressure on the windpipe with the hand in which case death is said to be caused by throttling Strangulation is frequently suicidal but may be accidental When homicidal much injury is done to the neck owing to the force with which the ligature is drawn In throttling the marks of the finger nails are found on the neck XIX DEATH BY DROWNING Death by drowning occurs when breathing is arrested by watery or semi fluid substances blood urine et cetera The fluid acts mechanically by entering the air cells of the lung and preventing the due oxidation of the blood The post mortem appearances include those usually present in death by asphyxia together with the following peculiar to death by drowning Excoriations of the fingers with sand or mud under the nails fragments of plants grasped in the hand water in the stomach this is a vital act and shows that the person fell into the water alive fine froth at the mouth and nostrils cutis anserina retraction of penis and scrotum On post mortem examination the lungs are found to be increased in size ballooned on section froth water mud sand in air tubes The presence of this fine often blood stained froth is the most characteristic sign of drowning Froth like that of soap suds in the trachea is an indication of a vital act and must not be mistaken for the tenacious mucus of bronchitis The presence of vomited matters in the trachea and bronchi is a valuable sign of drowning The blood collects in the venous system and is dark and fluid Tardieu s spots are not so frequently met with in cases of drowning as in other forms of asphyxia The other signs of death by asphyxia are present Wounds may be present on the body due to falling on stakes injuries from passing vessels et cetera The methods of performing artificial respiration in the case of the apparently drowned are the following the best and most easily performed is Schaefer s prone pressure method one Schaefer s Place the patient on his face with a folded coat under the lower part of the chest Unfasten the collar and neckband Go to work at once Kneel over him athwart or on one side facing his head Place your hands flat over the lower part of his back and make pressure on his ribs on both sides and throw the weight of your body on to them so as to squeeze out the air from his chest Get back into position at once but leave your hands as they were Do this every five seconds and get someone to time you with a watch Keep this going for half an hour and when you are tired get someone to relieve you Other people may apply hot flannels to the limbs and hot water to the feet Hypodermic injections of one fifty grain of atropine suprarenal or pituitary extracts may be found useful two Silvester s In this method the capacity of the chest is increased by raising the arms above the head holding them by the elbows and thus dragging upon and elevating the ribs the chest being emptied by lowering the arms against the sides of the chest and exerting lateral pressure on the thorax The patient is in the supine position but first the water must have been drained from the mouth and nose by keeping the body in the prone position The tongue must be kept forward by transfixing with a pin three Marshall Hall s This consists in placing the patient in the prone position with a folded coat under the chest and rolling the body alternately into the lateral and prone positions four Howard s This consists in emptying the thorax by forcibly compressing the lower part of the chest on relaxing the pressure the chest again fills with air Here the patient is placed in the supine position The objections to the supine position are that the tongue falls back and not only blocks the entrance of air but prevents the escape of water mucus and froth from the air passages five Laborde s Method This consists in holding the tongue by means of a handkerchief and rhythmically drawing it out fully at the rate of fifteen times per minute This excites the respiratory centre and this method may be employed along with any of the other methods XX DEATH FROM STARVATION The post mortem appearances in death from starvation are as follows There is marked general emaciation the skin is dry shrivelled and covered with a brown bad smelling excretion the muscles soft atrophied and free from fat the liver is small but the gall bladder is distended with bile The heart lungs and internal organs are shrivelled and bloodless The stomach is sometimes quite healthy in other cases it may be collapsed empty and ulcerated The intestines are also contracted empty and translucent In the absence of any disease productive of extreme emaciation e g tuberculosis stricture of oesophagus diabetes Addison s disease such a state of body will furnish a strong presumption of death by starvation In the case of children there is not always absolute deprivation of food but what is supplied is insufficient in quantity or of improper quality The defence commonly set up is that the child died either of marasmus or of tuberculosis In cases where it is alleged that a child has been starved and ill used one must examine the body for signs of neglect e g dirtiness of skin and hair presence of vermin bruises or skin eruptions Compare its weight with a normal child of the same age and sex If the disproportion be great and signs of neglect present then the probability is great provided there be no actual disease present that the child has been starved XXI DEATH FROM LIGHTNING AND ELECTRICITY The signs of death from lightning vary greatly In some cases there are no signs in others the body may be most curiously marked Wounds of various characters contused lacerated and punctured may be produced There may be burns vesications and ecchymoses arborescent markings are not uncommon The hair may be singed or burnt and the clothing damaged Rigor mortis is very rapid in its onset and transient Post mortem there are no characteristic signs but the blood may be dark in colour and fluid The presence or absence of a storm may assist the diagnosis Injuries by electrical currents of high pressure are not uncommon speaking generally one thousand to two thousand volts will kill In America where electricity is adopted as the official means of destroying criminals fifteen hundred volts is regarded as the lethal dose but there are many instances of persons having been exposed to higher voltages without bad effects The alternating current is supposed to be more fatal than the continuous Much depends on whether the contact is good perspiring hands or damp clothes Death has been attributed in these cases to respiratory arrest or sudden cessation of the heart s action The best treatment is artificial respiration but the inhalation of nitrite of amyl may prove useful Rescuers must be careful that they also do not receive a shock The patient should be handled with india rubber gloves or through a blanket thrown over him XXII DEATH FROM COLD OR HEAT Cold The weak aged or infants readily succumb to low temperatures The symptoms are increasing lassitude drowsiness coma with sometimes illusions of sight Post mortem bright red patches are found on the skin surface and the blood remains fluid for long Heat Death may result from syncope the result of exposure to great heat Sunstroke The person loses consciousness and falls down insensible the body temperature may be one hundred twelve deg F the pulse is full and a peculiar pungent odour is given off from the skin Coma convulsions with rarely delirium may precede death Treatment consists in lowering the body temperature by application of cold cloths stimulants strychnine or digitalin hypodermically XXIII PREGNANCY The signs of the existence of pregnancy are of two kinds uncertain and certain or maternal and foetal Amongst the former class are included Cessation of menstruation which may occur without pregnancy morning vomiting salivation enlargement of the breasts and of the abdomen quickening It must be borne in mind that every woman with a big abdomen is not necessarily pregnant The tests which afford conclusive evidence of the existence of a foetus in the uterus are Ballottement the uterine souffle intermittent uterine contractions foetal movements and above all the pulsation of the foetal heart The uterine souffle is synchronous with the maternal pulse the foetal heart is not being about one hundred twenty beats per minute Evidence of pregnancy may also be afforded by the discharge from the uterus of an early ovum of moles hydatids et cetera Disease of the uterus and ovarian dropsy may be mistaken for pregnancy Careful examination is necessary to determine the nature of the condition present Pregnancy may be pleaded in bar of immediate capital punishment in which case the woman must be shown to be quick with child A woman may also plead pregnancy to delay her trial in Scotland and both in England and Scotland in civil cases to produce a successor to estates to increase damages for seduction in compensation cases where a husband has been killed to obtain increased damages et cetera A woman may become pregnant within a month of her last delivery In cases of rape and suspected pregnancy it must be borne in mind that a medical man who examines a woman under any circumstances against her will renders himself liable to heavy damages and that the law will not support him in so doing If on being requested to permit an examination the woman refuse such refusal may go against her but of this she is the best judge The duty of the medical man ends on making the suggestion XXIV DELIVERY The signs of recent delivery are as follows The face is pale with dark circles round the eyes the pulse quickened the skin soft warm and covered with a peculiar sweat the breasts full tense and knotty the abdomen distended its integuments relaxed with irregular light pink streaks on the lower part The labia and vagina show signs of distension and injury For the first three or four days there is a discharge from the uterus more or less sanguineous in character consisting of blood mucus epithelium and shreds of membrane During the next four or five days it becomes of a dirty green colour and in a few days more of a yellowish milky mucous character continuing for two to three weeks The change in character of the lochial discharge is due to the quantity of blood decreasing and its place being taken by fatty granules and leucocytes The os uteri is soft patulous and its edges are torn The uterus may be felt for two or three hours above the pubis as a hard round ball regaining its normal size in about eight weeks after delivery Most of these signs disappear about the tenth day after which it becomes impossible to fix the date of delivery In the dead the external parts have the same appearance as given above The uterus will vary in appearance according to the time elapsed since delivery If death occurred immediately after delivery the uterus will be wide open about nine or ten inches long with clots of blood inside and the inner surface lined by decidua The signs of a previous delivery consist in silvery streaks in the skin of the abdomen which however may be due to distension from other causes similar marks on the breast circular and jagged condition of the os uteri the virgin os being oval and smooth marks of rupture of the perineum or fourchette absence of the vaginal rugae dark coloured areola round the nipples et cetera The difference between the virgin corpus luteum and that of recent pregnancy is not so marked as to justify a confident use of it for medico legal purposes XXV FOETICIDE OR CRIMINAL ABORTION This consists in giving to any woman or causing to be taken by her with intent to procure her miscarriage any poison or other noxious thing or using for the same purpose any instruments or other means whatsoever It is a felony to procure or attempt to procure the miscarriage of a woman whether she be pregnant or not and it is a felony for the woman if pregnant to attempt to procure her own miscarriage It is a misdemeanour for any person or persons to procure drugs or instruments for a like purpose It is not necessary that the woman be quick with child The offence is the intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman whether she be or be not with child When from any causes it is necessary to procure abortion a medical man should do so only after consultation with a brother practitioner Even in these cases there is no exemption legally Any medical man who gives even the most harmless medicine where he suspects the possibility of pregnancy may render himself liable to grave suspicion should the woman abort In medicine an abortion is said to occur when the foetus is expelled before the sixth month after that it is premature birth In law however any expulsion of the contents of the uterus before the full time is an abortion or miscarriage In deciding whether any substance expelled from the uterus is really a foetus or a mole and therefore the result of conception or the coat of the uterus and unconnected with pregnancy the examination of the substances expelled must be carefully made Moles are blighted foetuses An examination of the woman will be necessary though it is not easy during the early months of pregnancy and especially in those who have borne children to say whether abortion has taken place or not The history must be inquired into the regular or exceptional use of drugs to promote menstruation is important for in the former case no criminal intent may exist although pregnancy be present The state of the breasts the hymen and the os uteri should all be carefully examined Putting a few apparently unimportant questions as to the frequent use of purgatives the presence or absence of constipation will often assist the diagnosis as showing that the woman has acted in an unusual manner Abortion may be procured by the introduction of instruments by falls violent exercise blows on the abdomen et cetera In the hands of ignorant persons the use of instruments sounds bougies skewers et cetera is attended with great danger Perforation of the vaginal walls bladder cervix or uterus may follow their use Septic pelvic peritonitis may ensue and the woman may lose her life The person who has employed such means for inducing abortion is liable to be charged with the crime of murder There is no evidence to show that ergot savin bitter apple pennyroyal or any other drug administered internally will cause a woman to abort except when taken in such large doses that actual poisoning results with inflammation of the contents of the true pelvis In such cases reflex uterine contractions may be set up and abortion may follow Diachylon pills are largely employed to induce abortion and very often the woman taking them suffers severely from lead poisoning XXVI INFANTICIDE Infanticide or the murder of a new born child is not treated as a specific crime but is tried by the same rules as in cases of felonious homicide The term is applied technically to those cases in which the mother kills her child at or soon after its birth She is often in such a condition of mental anxiety as not to be responsible for her actions It is usually committed with the object of concealing delivery and to hide the fact that the girl has in popular language strayed from the paths of virtue The child must have had a separate existence To constitute live birth the child must have been alive after its body was entirely born that is entirely outside the maternal passages and it must have had an independent circulation though this does not imply the severance of the umbilical cord Every child is held in law to be born dead until it has been shown to have been born alive Killing a child in the act of birth and before it is fully born is not infanticide but if before birth injuries are inflicted which result in death after birth it is murder Medical evidence will be called to show that the child was born alive The methods of death usually employed are one Suffocation by the hand or a cloth two Strangulation with the hands by a tape or ribbon or by the umbilical cord itself three Blows on the head or dashing the child against the wall four Drowning by putting it in the privy or in a bucket of water five Omission by neglecting to do what is absolutely necessary for the newly born child e g not separating the cord allowing it to lie under the bed clothes and be suffocated With regard to the question of the maturity of a child the differences between a child of six or seven months and one at full term may be stated as follows Between the sixth and seventh month length of child ten to fourteen inches that is the length of the child after the fifth month is about double the lunar months weight one to three pounds skin dusky red covered with downy hair lanugo and sebaceous matter membrana pupillaris disappearing nails not reaching to ends of fingers meconium at upper part of large intestine testes near kidneys no appearance of convolutions in brain points of ossification in four divisions of sternum At nine months length of child eighteen to twenty two inches weight seven to eight pounds skin rosy lanugo only about shoulders sebaceous matter on the body hair on head about an inch long testes past inguinal ring clitoris covered by the labia membrana pupillaris disappeared nails reach to ends of fingers meconium at termination of large intestine points of ossification in centre of cartilage at lower end of femur about one one two to two one two lines in diameter umbilicus midway between the ensiform cartilage and pubis Owing to the difficulty of proving that the crime of infanticide has been committed the woman may in England be tried for concealment of birth and in Scotland for concealment of pregnancy if she conceal her pregnancy during the whole time and fail to call for assistance in the birth Either of these charges would only be brought against a woman who had obviously been pregnant and now the child is missing or its dead body has been found It is expected that every pregnant woman should make provision for the child about to be born and so should have talked about it or have made clothes et cetera for it The punishment for concealment is imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years The charge of concealment is very often alternative to infanticide To substantiate the charge however it must be proved that there had been a secret disposition of the dead body of the infant as well as an endeavour to conceal its birth A woman may be delivered of a child unconsciously for the contractile power of the womb is independent of volition Under an anaesthetic the uterus acts as energetically as if the patient were in the full possession of her senses Nowadays a woman is rarely hanged for infanticide and it is a mere travesty of justice to pass on her the death sentence well knowing that it will never be executed XXVII EVIDENCES OF LIVE BIRTH The signs of live birth prior to respiration are negative and positive A negative opinion may be formed when evidence is found of the child having undergone intra uterine maceration In this case the body will be flaccid and flattened the ilia prominent the head soft and yielding the cuticle more or less detached and raised into large bullae the skin of a red or brownish red colour the cavities filled with abundant bloody serum the umbilical cord straight and flaccid A positive opinion is justified when such injuries are found on the body as could not have been inflicted during birth and are attended with such haemorrhage as could only have occurred while the blood was circulating Fractures of the cranium from accidental falls precipitate labour are as a rule stellate and are situated on the vertex or in the parietal protuberance The fractures from violence are more extensive usually depressed and accompanied by laceration of the scalp The evidences of live birth after respiration has taken place are usually deduced from the condition of the lungs though indications are also found in other organs The diaphragm is more arched before than after respiration and rises higher in the thorax in the former case than in the latter The lungs before respiration are situated in the back of the thorax and do not fill that cavity they are of a dark red brown colour and of the consistence of liver without mottling After respiration they expand and occupy the whole thorax and closely surround the heart and thymus gland The portions containing air are of a light brick red colour and crepitate under the finger The lungs are mottled from the presence of islands of aerated tissue surrounded by arteries and veins The weight of the lungs before respiration is about five hundred fifty grains after an hour s respiration nine hundred grains but this test is of little value The ratio of the weight of the lungs to that of the body Ploucquet s test which is also unreliable is before respiration about one to seventy after one to thirty five Lungs in which respiration has taken place float in water those in which it has not sink There are exceptions to this rule on which however is founded the hydrostatic test As originally performed this test consisted merely in placing the lungs with or without the heart in water and noticing whether they sank or floated The test is now modified by squeezing and by cutting the lungs up into pieces The objections to the test as originally performed are one That the lungs may sink as the result of disease e g double pneumonia two That respiration may have been so limited in extent that the lungs may sink owing to large portions of lung tissue remaining unexpanded atelectasis three Putrefaction may cause the lungs to float when respiration has not taken place four The lungs may have been inflated artificially Few of these objections apply however when the hydrostatic test modified by pressure is employed To take these objections in detail it may be stated one If the lungs sink from disease the question of live birth is answered two This objection is too refined for practical use The lungs sink there is an absence of any of the signs of suffocation and the matter ends The examiner has only to describe the conditions which he finds and is not required to indulge in conjectures as to the amount of respiration which may or may not have taken place three Gas due to putrefaction collects under the pleural membrane and can be expelled by pressure and is not found in the air cells The lungs decompose late hence in a fresh body putrefaction of the lungs is absent in a putrefied child if the lungs sink it must have been stillborn The so called emphysema pulmonum neonatorum is simply incipient putrefaction The lung test simply shows that the child has breathed but affords no proof that the child has been born alive The child may have breathed as soon as its head protruded the rest of the body being in the maternal passages The child is not born alive until it has been completely expelled although it is not necessary that the umbilical cord should have been cut In addition to these tests live birth may be suspected from the following conditions The stomach may contain milk or food recognized by the microscope and by Trommer s test for sugar the large intestines in stillborn children are filled with meconium in those born alive they are usually empty the bladder is generally emptied soon after birth the skin is in a condition of exfoliation soon after birth The organs of circulation undergo the following changes after birth and the extent to which these changes have advanced will give an idea of how long the child has lived The ductus arteriosus begins to contract within a few seconds of birth at the end of a week it is about the size of a crow quill and about the tenth day is obliterated The umbilical arteries and vein the arteries are remarkably diminished in calibre at the end of twenty four hours and obliterated almost up to the iliacs in three days the umbilical vein and the ductus venosus are generally completely contracted by the fifth day The foramen ovale becomes obliterated at extremely variable periods and may continue open even in the adult Importance of late has been attached to the stomach bowel test If the stomach and duodenum contain air and consequently float in water the chances are that the child did not die immediately after birth this is known as Breslau s second life test and the lower the air in the intestinal canal the greater is the probability that the child survived birth The umbilical cord in a new born child is fresh firm round and bluish in colour blood is contained in its vessels The cord may be ruptured by the child falling from the maternal parts in a precipitate labour and the ruptured parts present ragged ends It is seldom that a child bleeds to death from an untied or cut umbilical cord and the chances in a torn cord are still more remote The changes in the cord are as follows First it shrinks from the ligature towards the navel this change may begin early and is rarely delayed beyond thirty hours the cord becomes flabby and there is a distinct inflammatory circle round its insertion The next change is that of desiccation or mummification the cord becomes reddish brown then flattened and shrivelled then translucent and of the colour of parchment and falls off about the fifth day The third stage that of cicatrization then ensues about the tenth to the twelfth day The bright red rim round the insertion of the cord with inflammatory thickening and slight purulent secretion may be considered as evidence of live birth and the stage at which the separation of the cord by ulcerative process has arrived will point to the probable duration of time the child has existed after birth There are many fallacies in the application of any of these tests and the whole subject bristles with difficulties The medical witness would do well to exhibit a cautious reserve for if the child dies immediately after birth it is almost impossible to prove that it was born alive XXVIII CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE FOETUS The death of the foetus may be due to one Immaturity or intra uterine malnutrition or simply from deficient vitality two complications occurring during or immediately after birth which may either be unavoidable or inherent in the process of parturition or may be induced with criminal intent In the latter category come such accidents as the pressure of tumours in the pelvic passages or disease of the bones in the mother or pressure on the cord from malposition of the child during labour asphyxiation from the funis being twisted tightly round the neck or limbs or from injuries due to falls on the floor in sudden labours Where the death of the foetus has been induced with criminal intent it may be due to punctured wounds of the fontanelles orbits heart or spinal marrow dislocation of the neck separation of the head from the body fracture of the bones of the head and face strangulation suffocation drowning in the closet pan or privy or from being thrown into water Under the head of infanticide by commission we have injuries of all kinds under infanticide by omission neglecting to tie the cord allowing it to be suffocated by discharges in the bed neglect to provide food clothes and warmth for the new born child XXIX DURATION OF PREGNANCY The natural period of gestation is considered as forty weeks ten lunar months or two hundred eighty days A medical witness would have to admit the possibility of gestation being prolonged to three hundred days and if this time were not very materially exceeded it would be well to give the woman the benefit of the doubt It may be mentioned that three hundred days is the extreme limit fixed by the French and Scottish law No fixed period is assigned in English or American law to the duration of pregnancy though it is allowed that utero gestation may be greatly prolonged In a recent case decided the Lord Chancellor accepted a case where it was alleged pregnancy had extended to three hundred thirty one days A child only five months old may live for a short time at all events There is considerable difficulty in many cases in fixing the date of conception The data from which it is calculated are the following one Peculiar sensations attending conception which are not sufficiently defined to be recognized by those conceiving for the first time two Cessation of the catamenia Other causes may however cause this and on the other hand a woman may menstruate during the whole period of her pregnancy This datum also gives a variable period and may involve an error of several days or a month for the menses may be arrested by cold et cetera at one monthly period and the woman become pregnant before the next three The period of quickening This when perceived which is not always the case also occurs at variable periods from the tenth to the twenty sixth week four A single coitus This does not however correspond to the time of fertilization Several days may elapse before the spermatozoa meet with an ovum and fertilize it In Scotland a child born six months after marriage is legitimate which is allowing an ample margin XXX VIABILITY OF CHILDREN A child may be born alive but may not be viable by which is meant that it is not endowed with a capacity of maintaining its life Speaking generally one hundred eighty days represents the lowest limit at which a child is viable but prolonged survival under these circumstances is the exception Many cases however have been recorded in which children born at six months have been reared The signs of immaturity and maturity may be thus tabulated IMMATURITY MATURITY Centre of body high head Strong movements and cries as soon disproportionate in size membrana as born body clear red colour pupillaris present testicles coated with sebaceous matter mouth undescended deep red colour of nostrils eyelids and ears open parts of generation intense red skull somewhat firm and fontanelles colour mottled appearance and not far apart hair eyebrows and downy covering of skin nails not nails perfectly developed formed feeble movements testicles descended free discharge inability to suck necessity for of urine and meconium power of artificial heat almost unbroken suction indicated by seizure on the sleep rare and imperfect nipple or a finger placed in the discharges of urine and meconium mouth closed state of mouth eyelids and nostrils XXXI LEGITIMACY A child born in wedlock is presumed to have the mother s husband for its father This may however be open to question upon the following grounds Absence or death of the reputed father impotence or disease in the husband preventing matrimonial intercourse premature delivery in a newly married woman want of access and the marriage of the woman again immediately on the death of her husband In the last case where either husband might have been the father the child at the age of twenty one is at liberty to select its father from the possible pair A child born of parents before marriage is in Scotland rendered legitimate by their subsequent marriage but in England the offspring remains illegitimate whether the parents marry or not after its birth The offspring of voidable or invalid marriages may be made legitimate by application to the courts There is a difference between being legitimate and lawfully begotten A child born in wedlock is legitimate but if the parents were married only a week previously it could not have been lawfully begotten The Acts and rulings relating to Marriage and Legitimacy are extremely complicated It is not putting it too strongly to say that a very large number of people in this country who believe themselves to be legally married are not married at all and that thousands of children who have not the slightest doubt as to their legitimacy are in the eyes of the law bastards XXXII SUPERFOETATION By superfoetation is meant the conception by a woman already pregnant of a second embryo resulting in the birth of two children at the same time differing much in their degree of maturity or in two separate births with a considerable interval between The possibility of the occurrence of superfoetation has been doubted but there are well authenticated cases which countenance the theory of a double conception It has been shown that the os uteri is not closed as was once supposed immediately on conception Should an ovum escape into the uterus it may become impregnated a month or so after a previous conception The most probable explanation is that the case has been one of twins one being born prematurely or on the other hand the uterus may have been double and conception may have taken place in one cornu at a later period than in the other cornu XXXIII INHERITANCE In order to inherit the child must be born alive must be born during the lifetime of the mother and must be born capable of inheriting that is to say monsters are incapable of inheriting There is a mode of inheritance called tenancy by courtesy When a man marries a woman possessed of an estate or inheritance and has by her issue born alive in her lifetime capable of inheriting her estate in this case he shall on the death of his wife hold the lands for his life as tenant by the courtesy of England The meaning of the words born alive in this instance is not the same as in cases of infanticide In Civil law any motion of the child s body however slight or the fact of it having been heard to cry by witnesses is held to be sufficient proof of the child having been born alive It may die immediately afterwards and it is not necessary that the child be viable XXXIV IMPOTENCE AND STERILITY In the male impotence may arise from physical or mental causes The physical causes may be too great or too tender an age malformation of the genital organs crypsorchides defect or disease in the testicles constitutional disease diabetes neurasthenia et cetera or debility from acute disease as mumps Masturbation and early and excessive sexual indulgence are also causes The mental causes include passion timidity apprehension aversion and disgust The case will be remembered of the man who was impotent unless the lady were attired in a black silk dress and high heeled French kid boots If a man is impotent when he marries the marriage may be set aside on the ground that it had never been consummated The law requires that the impotency should have existed ab initio that is before marriage and should be of a permanent or incurable nature marriage as far as the law goes being regarded as a contract in which it is presupposed that both the contracting parties are capable of fulfilling all the objects of marriage In the case of the Earl of Essex the defendant admitted the charge as regards the Countess but pleaded that he was not impotent with others as many of her waiting maids could testify When a man becomes impotent after marriage his wife must accept the situation and has no redress A man may be sterile without being impotent but the law will not take cognizance of that The wife may be practically impotent but the law will not assist the husband He must continue to do his best under difficult circumstances In former times in case of doubt a husband was permitted to demonstrate his competency in open court but this custom is no longer regarded with favour by the judges The removal of the testicles does not of necessity render a man impotent although it deprives him of his procreative power Eunuchs are capable of affording illicit pleasure whilst the male sopranos or castrati are often utilized for that purpose In the female impotence may be caused by the narrowness of the vagina adhesion of the vulva absence of vagina imperforate hymen and tumours of the vagina Sterility in women may occur from the above named causes of impotence together with absence of the uterus and ovaries or from great debility syphilis constant amenorrhoea dysmenorrhoea or menorrhagia XXXV RAPE Rape is the carnal knowledge of a woman by force and against her will The resistance of the woman must be to the utmost of her power but if she yield through fear or duress it is still rape The woman is a competent witness but her statements may be impugned on the ground of her previous bad character and evidence may be called to substantiate the charge The perpetrator must be above the age of fourteen years The definition of rape which we have given is not altogether satisfactory Take for example the case of a woman who goes to bed expecting her husband to return at a certain hour The lodger let us say takes advantage of this fact and getting into bed has connection with her she not resisting assuming all the while that it is her husband This is rape but it is not by force and it is not against her will but it is without her consent as she has not been fully informed as to all the circumstances of the case In all cases of rape in which there is no actual resistance or objection consent may be assumed It is not essential that the woman should state in so many words that she does not object The force used may be moral and not physical e g threats fear horror syncope By forty eight and forty nine Vict c forty nine the carnal knowledge of a girl under thirteen is technically rape The consent of the girl makes no difference since she is not of an age to become a consenting party An attempt at carnal knowledge of a girl under thirteen is a misdemeanour Her consent makes no difference and even the solicitation of the act on the part of the child will not exonerate the accused Intercourse with a girl between thirteen and sixteen even with her consent is a misdemeanour This Act is a favourite with the blackmailer The child is sent out to solicit dressed like a woman but appears in the witness box in a much more juvenile costume To constitute rape there must be penetration but this may be of the slightest There may be a sufficient degree of penetration to constitute rape without rupturing the hymen Proof of actual emission is now unnecessary The subject of carnal knowledge C K or its attempt may be summed up as follows Under thirteen C K Felony Under thirteen Attempt Misdemeanour Consent no defence From thirteen to sixteen C K Misdemeanour From thirteen to sixteen Attempt Misdemeanour Consent and even solicitation no defence Reasonable cause to believe the girl over sixteen is a good defence Charge must be brought within three months Over sixteen C K with consent Nil Subject to civil action for loss of girl s services by father Idiot or imbecile C K with violence Rape Idiot or imbecile C K without violence Misdemeanour Personation of husband Rape Tacit consent no defence for obtained by fraud Married woman C K with consent Adultery Mother sister daughter C K consent immaterial Incest grand daughter born in wedlock or not Females Indecent assaults Misdemeanour It is a misdemeanour to give to a woman any drug so as to stupefy her and so enable any person to have unlawful connection with her False charges of rape are very often made The motive may be to extort blackmail revenge or mere delusion On examining such cases bruises are seldom found but scratches which the woman has made on the front of her body may be discovered and the local injuries to the generative organs are slight if present at all Physical Signs In the adult the hymen may be ruptured the fourchette lacerated and blood found on the parts together with scratches and other marks and signs of a struggle In the child there may be no haemorrhage but there will be indications of bruising on the external organs with probably considerable laceration of the hymen the laceration in some cases extending into the rectum Severe haemorrhage and even death may follow the rape of a young child The patient will have difficulty in walking and in passing water and faeces After some hours the parts are very tender and swollen and a sticky greenish yellow discharge is present These signs last longer in children than in adults but as a rule in the adult at least all signs of rape disappear in three or four days Young and delicate children may suffer from a vaginal discharge with swelling of the external genitals simulating an attempt at rape Infantile leucorrhoea is common and many innocent people have been exposed to danger from false charges of rape on children instituted as a means of levying blackmail A knowledge of these facts suggests the necessity of giving a guarded opinion when children are brought for examination in suspected cases Pregnancy may follow rape Seminal stains render the clothing stiff and greyish yellow in colour with translucent edges On being moistened they give the characteristic seminal odour Semen may be found on the linen of the woman and man and will be recognized under the microscope by the presence in it of spermatozoa minute filamentary bodies with a pear shaped head but it must not be forgotten that the non detection of spermatozoa is no proof of absence of sexual intercourse for these bodies are not always present in the semen of even healthy adult young men Spermatozoa must not be mistaken for the Trichomonas vaginae found in the vaginae of some women The latter have cilia surrounding the head which is globular Florence s Micro Chemical Test for Spermatic Fluid If a drop of the fluid obtained by wetting a supposed spermatic stain be mixed with a drop of the following solution KI parts one point sixty five pure iodine two point fifty four distilled water thirty in a watch glass brownish red pointed crystals resembling haemin crystals are obtained Barberio s Test Mix a drop of the spermatic stain with a drop of a saturated solution of picric acid when needle shaped yellow rhombic crystals are formed Gonorrhoeal Stains A cover glass preparation stained with methylene blue reveals the gonococci lying in pairs within the leucocytes XXXVI UNNATURAL OFFENCES Trials for sodomy and bestiality are common at the assizes but as they are rarely reported they fail to attract attention Sodomy is a crime both in the active and passive agent unless the latter is a non consenting party The evidence of either associated may be received as against his colleague If the crime is committed on a boy under fourteen it is a felony in the active agent only As in cases of rape emission is not essential and penetration however slight answers all practical purposes There can be no doubt that in the majority of these cases there exists a congenitally abnormal condition of the sexual instinct these individuals from their childhood manifesting a perverted sexual instinct The man is physically a man but psychically a woman and vice versa The tendency nowadays is not to charge these people with the more serious offence but to deal with them under Section eleven of the Criminal Law Amendment Act eighteen eighty five forty eight and forty nine Vict c sixty nine This section which is sufficiently comprehensive runs as follows Any male person who in public or private commits or is a party to the commission or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of any act of gross indecency with another male person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour The penalty is imprisonment for two years with or without hard labour It is provided by Section four of the same Act that a boy under sixteen may be whipped Incest This crime is dealt with under the Punishment of Incest Act nineteen oh eight eight Edward VII c forty five Carnal knowledge with mother sister daughter or grand daughter is a misdemeanour provided the relationship is known It also applies to the half brother and half sister It is equally an offence whether the relationship can or cannot be traced through lawful wedlock Consent is no defence A woman may be charged under the Act if she being above the age of sixteen with consent permits her grandfather father brother or son to have carnal knowledge of her XXXVII BLACKMAILING There are in London and every large city scores of men and women who live by blackmailing or chantage There are many different forms of this industry There is the man who knows something about your past life which he threatens to reveal to your friends or colleagues unless you buy him off There is the breach of promise blackmailer and there is the female patient who threatens to charge you with improper conduct or indecent assault Medical men from their position are often selected as victims The introduction of corridor carriages on many of our railways has done much to stamp out one particular form of blackmailing but public urinals are still a source of danger It is the worst possible policy to temporize with a blackmailer If you give him a single penny you are his for life It is as well to remember that it is just as criminal to attempt to extract money from a guilty as from an innocent person It is of no use attempting to deal with these cases single handed You must not only deny the allegation but spurn the allegator Put the matter into the hands of a good sharp criminal solicitor and instruct him to rid you of the nuisance by taking criminal proceedings XXXVIII MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE Marriage may be accomplished in many ways one By the publication of banns two by an ordinary licence three by a special licence four by the Superintendent Registrar s licence five by a special licence granted by the Archbishop of Canterbury in consideration of the payment of the sum of Ltwenty five Then for persons having a domicile in Scotland there is the marriage by repute The consent of the parties which is the essence of the contract may be expressed before witnesses and it is not requisite that a clergyman should assist but it is essential that the expressions of consent must be for a matrimonial intent Habit and repute constitute good evidence but the repute must be the general constant and unvarying belief of friends and neighbours The cohabitation must be in Scotland Any irregularity in the marriage ceremony or the non observance of any formality will not invalidate the marriage unless it were known to both the contracting parties If a man were married in a wrong name the contract would still be valid if the wife were unacquainted with the deception at the time If the person who officiated were a bogus clergyman the marriage would hold good if the contracting parties supposed him to be a properly ordained priest In a case in which a marriage was solemnized in a building near the church at a time when the church was undergoing repairs and where during such alterations Divine service had been performed it was held that the ceremony was good To all intents and purposes marriage comes under the Law of Contract see Anson W R Bart and the law looks to the intention rather than to the actual details All marriages between persons within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity are null and void This prohibition extends both to the illegitimate as well as the legitimate children of the late wife s or husband s parents A marriage with a deceased wife s sister is now legal in Great Britain and the Colonies and is recognized in most foreign countries A common device with people within the prohibited degrees is to get married abroad but such marriage is strictly speaking inoperative and the children of such union are illegitimate Practically however it is a matter of no importance for when people live together and say they are married they are accepted at their own estimate A man can obtain a divorce from his wife if he can prove that she has been guilty of adultery since her marriage This may be established by inference Obviously it is difficult in the majority of cases to establish by ocular demonstration that adultery has been committed But given evidence of familiarity and affection with opportunity and suspicious conduct a jury will commonly infer it A woman cannot obtain a divorce from her husband for adultery alone She must prove adultery plus cruelty or adultery plus desertion without reasonable cause Failing this she may be able to prove either bigamy or incestuous adultery Legal cruelty is a very comprehensive term and does not of necessity mean physical violence If the husband as the result of his infidelity were to give his wife a contagious disease that would constitute cruelty Taking a more extreme case if a husband were to have connection in her house with his wife s maid that would probably be held to constitute cruelty as it would tend to lower her in the eyes of her servants A wife can obtain a judicial separation if she can prove one adultery two cruelty or three desertion without reasonable cause for two years If a husband is away on his business as for example the case of an officer ordered abroad that is not desertion For a woman to get a judicial separation it is sufficient if she can prove one variety of matrimonial offence but for a divorce she requires more than one The jury may find that missus A has committed adultery with mister B but that mister B has not committed adultery with missus A The explanation is that a wife s confession is evidence against herself but not against another person You can confess your own sins but not another s The Divorce Law of Scotland differs materially from that of England In Scotland there is no decree nisi no decree absolute and no intervention by the King s Proctor Instead there is a single and final judgment and when a decree of divorce is pronounced the successful litigant at once succeeds to all rights legal and conventional that would have come to him or her on the death of the losing party If the husband is the offender the wife in such circumstances may claim her right to one third of his real estate and if there are children to one third of his personal property and to one half if there are none Voidable Marriages If a man and woman go through the marriage ceremony such a contract is null and void under the following circumstances one Where bigamy has been committed two if one of the parties were insane at the time of marriage three where the plaintiff is under sixteen years of age four when the marriage has not been consummated or followed by cohabitation five when one of the parties was incapable of performing the marital act impotent and such not known by the other at the time six when drunkenness had been induced so as to obtain consent seven concealment of pregnancy at the time of marriage XXXIX FEIGNED DISEASES Malingering in its various forms is by no means uncommon and by many is regarded as a disease in itself It is necessary however to distinguish between those cases in which it is feigned for some definite purpose for example to escape punishment or avoid public service and those in which there is adequate motive and the patient shams simply with the view of exciting sympathy or from the mere delight of giving trouble It is not uncommon for individuals summoned on a jury or to give evidence in the law courts to apply to their doctor for a certificate assigning as a cause of exemption neuralgia or some similar complaint unattended with objective symptoms In such cases it is well to remind the patient that in most courts such certificates are received with suspicion and are often rejected and that the personal attendance of the medical man is required to endorse his certificate on oath Malingering has become much more common since the National Health Insurance Act has been passed The possibility of obtaining a fair sum each week without the necessity of working for it induces many persons either to feign disease or to make recovery from actual disease or accident much more tedious than it ought really to be The feasibility of successfully malingering is greatly enhanced by the possession of some chronic organic disease An old mitral regurgitant murmur is useful for this purpose It is not flattering to one s vanity to overlook a case of malingering but should this occur little harm is done It is a much more serious matter to accuse a person of malingering when in reality he may be suffering from an organic disease Here are some of the diseases which are most frequently feigned Nervous Diseases as headache vertigo paralysis of limbs vomiting sciatica or incontinence or suppression of urine spitting of blood others again simulate hysteria epilepsy or insanity On the other hand the malingerer may actually produce injuries on his person either to excite commiseration or to escape from work Thus the beggar produces ulcers on his legs by binding a penny piece tightly on for some days the hospital patient in order to escape discharge produces factitious skin diseases by the application of irritants or caustics It is much more difficult to decide whether certain symptoms are due to a real disease which is present or whether they are merely exaggerations of slight symptoms or simulations of past ones The miner after an injury to his back recovers very slowly if at all He is suffering from traumatic neurasthenia a condition only too often simulated and a disease very difficult to diagnose accurately The miner takes advantage of our ignorance and continues to draw his compensation A workman during his work receives a fracture instead of being able to resume work in six weeks he asserts that the pain and stiffness prevent him and this disability may persist for months Such cases as these frequently come before the courts when the employer has discontinued to pay the weekly compensation for the injury Medical men are called to give evidence for or against the injured workman Epilepsy is often simulated The foaming at the mouth is produced by a piece of soap between the gums and the cheek The true epileptic especially if he suspects that a fit is imminent takes his walks abroad in some secluded spot whilst the impostor selects a crowded locality for his exertions The epileptic often injures himself in falling his imitator never one bites his tongue but the other carefully refrains from doing so The skin of an epileptic during an attack is cold and pallid but that of the exhibitor is covered with sweat as the result of his exertions In epilepsy the urine and faeces are passed involuntarily but his colleague rarely considers it necessary to carry his deception to this extent In true epilepsy the eyes are partly open with the eyeballs rolling and distorted whilst the pupils are dilated and do not contract to light the impostor keeps his eyes closed and he cannot prevent the iris from contracting when a bicycle lamp is flashed across his face A useful test is to give the impostor a pinch of snuff which promptly brings the entertainment to an end Lumbago is often feigned and the imposture should be suspected when there is a motive and when physical signs such as nodes and tender spots are absent A simple test is to inadvertently drop a shilling in front of him when he will promptly stoop and pick it up The same principles apply to spurious sciatica Haemorrhages purporting to come from the lungs stomach or bowels rarely present much difficulty The microscope is of use in all cases of bleeding Possibly the gums or the inside of the cheeks may have been scratched or abraded with a pin Skin Diseases are excited artificially especially those which may be produced by mechanical and chemical irritants The most commonly employed are vinegar acetic acid carbolic acid nitric acid and carbonate of sodium but tramps frequently use sorrel and various species of ranunculus The lesions simulated are usually inflammatory in character such as erythema vesicular and bullous eruptions and ulceration of the skin They may be complicated by the presence of pediculi and other animal and vegetable parasites Chromidrosis of the lower eyelids in young women often owes its origin to a box of paints Factitious skin diseases are seen most commonly on the face and extremities especially on the left side in other words on the most accessible parts of the body Feigned menstruation pregnancy abortion and recent delivery are common and should give rise to no difficulty The same may be said of feigned insanity aphonia deaf mutism and loss of memory The following hints may be useful to a medical man when called to a supposed case of malingering Do not be satisfied with one visit but go again and unexpectedly see that the patient is watched between the visits make an objective examination compare the indications with the statements of the patient noting especially any discrepancies between his account of his symptoms and the real symptoms of disease ask questions the reverse of the patient s statements or take them for granted and he will often be found to contradict himself have all dressings and bandages removed suggest in the hearing of the patient some heroic methods of treatment the actual cautery or severe surgical operation for example finally chloroform will be found of great use in the detection of many sham diseases XL MENTAL UNSOUNDNESS The presumption in law is in favour of a person s sanity even though he may be deaf dumb or blind The terms insanity lunacy unsoundness of mind mental derangement madness and mental alienation or aberration are indifferently applied to those states of disordered mind in which the person loses the power of regulating his actions and conduct according to the ordinary rules of society The reasoning power is lost or perverted and he is no longer fitted to discharge those duties which his social position demands In some cases of insanity as in confirmed idiocy there is no evidence of the exercise of the intellectual faculties It is probable that no standard of sanity as fixed by nature can be said to exist The medical witness should decline to commit himself to any definition of insanity There is no practical advantage in attempting to classify the different forms of insanity According to English law madness absolves from all guilt but in order to excuse from punishment on this ground it must be proved that the individual was not capable of distinguishing right from wrong in relation to the particular act of which he is accused and that he did not know at the time of committing the crime that the offence was against the laws of God and nature Lunatics are competent witnesses in relation to testimony as in relation to crime if they understand the nature of an oath and the character of the proceedings in which they are engaged The judge as in the case of children examines the lunatic tendered as a witness as to his knowledge of the nature and obligation of an oath and if satisfied he allows him to be sworn A person if suffering from such a state of mental unsoundness as to be unable to take care of his property may be placed under the care of the Court of Chancery The Court then administers his property and otherwise allows him entire freedom of action With regard to the care of lunatics no person is allowed to receive more than one lunatic into his house unless such house is licensed and the proper certificates have been signed One patient may be taken without the house being licensed but the usual certificates must in all cases be signed and the Lunacy Commissioners communicated with If a person receives another not of unsound mind into his house and such person becomes subsequently insane the person so keeping him renders himself liable to heavy penalties unless the legal certificates are at once procured and the Commissioners of Lunacy communicated with At common law it appears that a lunatic cannot be placed in an asylum unless dangerous to himself or to others but under the Lunacy Acts the placing of a madman in an asylum is considered as a part of the treatment with a view to the cure of the patient XLI IDIOCY IMBECILITY CRETINISM Idiocy is not a disease but a congenital condition in which the intellectual faculties are either never manifested or have not been sufficiently developed to enable the idiot to acquire an amount of knowledge equal to that acquired by other persons of his own age and in similar circumstances with himself Idiots as a rule are deformed in body as well as deficient in mind Their heads are generally small and badly shaped and their features ill formed and distorted The teeth are few in number and very irregular The hard palate has a very deep arch or may even be cleft The complexion is sallow and unhealthy the limbs imperfectly developed and the gait is awkward shambling and unsteady In his legal relations an absolute idiot is civilly disabled and irresponsible but in regard to crime or as a witness see remarks made above Imbecility is a form of mental defect not usually congenital but commencing in infancy or in early life The line of demarcation between the imbecile and the idiot may be found in the possession by the former of the faculty of speech in distinction from the mere parrot like utterance of a few words which can be taught the idiot Imbecility may be intellectual moral or general Questions frequently arise as to their responsibility for actions done by them or as to their ability to manage their own affairs Cretinism is a form of amentia which is endemic in certain districts especially in some of the valleys of Switzerland Savoy and France The malady is not congenital but its symptoms usually appear within a few months of birth The characteristics of this form of idiocy are an enlarged thyroid gland constituting a goitre or bronchocele a high arched palate dwarfed stature squinting eyes sallow complexion small legs conical head large mouth and indistinct speech Feeble Minded These are persons who are capable of earning a living under favourable circumstances but are incapable from mental defect which has existed from birth or from an early age of a competing on equal terms with their normal fellows or b of managing themselves and their affairs with ordinary prudence Feeble mindedness may affect the moral nature only rendering the person selfish untruthful obscene or unemployable The Act of eighteen ninety nine controls feeble minded children many such become paupers criminals prostitutes et cetera Mental Deficiency and Lunacy Act nineteen thirteen Those included under this Act are idiots imbeciles feeble minded persons and moral imbeciles The parents or guardians of such children between the ages of five and sixteen years must provide for them education and proper care If they are unable to do so the School Boards or Parish Councils must do so XLII DEMENTIA ACUTE CHRONIC SENILE AND PARALYTIC In dementia the mental aberration does not occur until the mind has become fully developed thus differing from amentia which is congenital or comes on very early in life Acute Dementia This is a condition of profound melancholy or stupor which arises from sudden mental shock the mind being as it were arrested and fixed in abstraction on the event Chronic Dementia is generally caused by the gradual action on the mind of grief or anxiety by severe pain mania apoplexy paralysis or repeated attacks of epilepsy Senile Dementia is a form which is incidental to aged persons and commences gradually with such symptoms as loss of memory for recent events dulness of perception and inability to fix the attention Later on the reasoning powers begin to fail and finally memory reason and power of attention are quite lost the muscular power and force remaining intact In the last stage there is simply bare physical existence General Paralysis of the Insane Paralytic Dementia This is a most interesting form of dementia It is closely allied to if not identical with locomotor ataxy Its most prominent and characteristic symptom consists in delusions of great power exalted position and unlimited wealth megalomania The exaltation is universal and the patient may maintain at one and the same time that he is running a theatrical company that he is the Prince of Wales and that he is the Almighty Moral perversion is a common symptom and the patient is often guilty of criminal assaults indecent exposures bigamous marriages and the like It is accompanied with progressive bodily and mental decay Women are comparatively rarely affected by it and it generally commences in men about middle age and its duration is from a few months to three years It is commonly parasyphilitic in origin Paralytic symptoms first appear in the tongue lips and face the speech becomes thick and hesitating The paralytic symptoms gradually go on increasing the sphincters refuse to act and death may occur from suffocation and choking Sometimes during the earlier stages especially there may be maniacal paroxysms or epileptic fits The delusions remain the same throughout the patient always expresses himself as being happy and his last words will probably have reference to money and other absurd delusions When a person of hitherto blameless life is charged with an act of indecency he should be examined for G P I The condition of his prostate should also be investigated He may be suffering from either mental or physical disease or both see p fifty nine XLIII MANIA Under the term mania are included all those forms of mental unsoundness in which there is undue excitement It is divided into general intellectual and moral and each of the two latter classes again into general and partial General Mania affects the intellect as well as the passions and emotions Mania is usually preceded by an incubative period in which the patient s general health is affected The duration of this period may vary from a few days to fifteen or twenty years When the disease is established the patient has paroxysms of violence directed against himself as well as others He tears his clothes to pieces either abstains from food and drink or eats voraciously and sustains immense muscular exertion without apparent fatigue The face becomes flushed the eye wild and sparkling there is pain weight and giddiness in the head with restlessness General Intellectual Mania attacking the intellect alone is rare but some one emotion or passion as pride vanity or love of gain may obtain ascendancy and fill the mind with intellectual delusions A delusion may be defined as a perversion of the judgment a chimerical thought an illusion an incorrect impression of the senses counterfeit appearances hence we speak of a delusion of the mind an illusion of the senses Lawyers lay great stress on the presence of delusions as indicative of insanity An hallucination is a sensation which is supposed by the patient to be produced by external impressions although no material object acts upon his senses at the time Partial Intellectual Mania or Monomania also called Melancholia is a form of the disease in which the patient becomes possessed of some single notion contradictory alike to common sense and his own experience General Moral Mania This is a morbid perversion of the natural feelings affections inclinations temper habits moral dispositions and natural impulses without any remarkable disorder or defect of the intellect or knowing and reasoning faculties and particularly without any insane illusion or hallucination It is often difficult to distinguish this form of mania from the moral depravity which we associate with the criminal classes Partial Moral Mania Paranoia Delusional Insanity In this form one or two only of the moral powers are perverted Delusions are always present and very frequently are those of persecution The patient s conduct is dominated by his delusion thus murder and suicide may be committed There are several forms Kleptomania a propensity to theft common in women in easy circumstances Dipsomania or Oinomania an insatiable desire for drink Morphinomania a craving for morphine or its preparations Erotomania or amorous madness When occurring in women this is also called Nymphomania and in men Satyriasis It consists in an uncontrollable desire for sexual intercourse Pyromania an insane impulse to set fire to everything Homicidal mania a propensity to murder Suicidal mania a propensity to self destruction Some consider suicide as always a manifestation of insanity Insanity of Pregnancy This may show itself after the third month of pregnancy in the form of melancholia It is not recovered from until after delivery Puerperal Mania This form of mania attacks women soon after childbirth There is in many cases a strong homicidal tendency against the child Insanity of Lactation comes on four to eight months after parturition either as mania or melancholia The mother may repeatedly attempt suicide Mania with Lucid Intervals In many cases mania is intermittent or recurrent in its nature the patient in the interval being in his right mind The question of the presence or absence of a lucid interval frequently occurs where attempts are made to set aside wills made by persons having property In these cases the law from the reasonableness of the provisions of the will may assume the existence of the lucid interval A will made during a lucid interval is valid When an attempt is made to set aside the provisions of a will on the ground of insanity in a person not previously judged insane the plaintiff must show that the testator was mad when the provisions of the will of a lunatic are attempted to be upheld the plaintiff must show that the will was made during a lucid interval A testator is capable of making a valid will when he has one a knowledge of his property and of his kindred two memory sufficient to recognize his proper relations to those about him three freedom from delusions affecting his property and his friends and four sufficient physical and mental power to resist undue influence The fact of a man being subject to delusions may not affect his testamentary capacity He may believe himself to be a tea kettle and yet be sufficiently sound mentally to make a valid will Undue Influence Persons of weak mind or those suffering from senile dementia are often said to have been unduly influenced in making their wills and subsequently their dispositions are disputed in court Before witnessing the will made by such a person the medical man should satisfy himself that the testator is of a sound disposing mind This he will do by questioning and his knowledge of the home life of the patient will either confirm or set aside the idea of influence A person who is aphasic may be competent to make a will He may not be able to speak but may understand what is said to him and may be able to indicate his wishes by nods and shakes of the head Ask him if he wishes to make a will then inquire if he has Lten thousand to leave then if he has Lone hundred and in this way arrive approximately at the sum Then ask him if he wishes to leave it all to one person If he nods assent ask if it be to his wife or some other likely person If he wishes to divide it ascertain his intention by definite questions and having ascertained his views commit them to writing read the document over to him and ask if it expresses his intentions That being settled a mark which he acknowledges in the presence of two witnesses preferably men of standing will constitute a valid document In certain forms of neurasthenia the phobias are common but must not be regarded as evidence of insanity Agoraphobia is the fear of crossing an open space batophobia is the fear that high things will fall siderophobia is the fear of thunder and lightning pathophobia is the fear of disease whilst pantophobia is the fear of everything and everybody Epilepsy in Relation to Insanity The subjects of this disease are often subject to sudden fits of uncontrollable passion their conduct is sometimes brutal ferocious and often very immoral As the fits increase in number the intellect deteriorates and chronic dementia or delusional insanity may supervene one Before a fit the patient may develop paroxysms of rage with brutal impulses preparoxysmal insanity and may commit crimes such as rape or murder two Instead of the usual epileptic fit the patient may have a violent maniacal attack masked epilepsy epileptic equivalent psychic form of epilepsy three After the fit the patient may perform various automatic actions post epileptic automatism of which he has no subsequent recollection Thus the patient may urinate or undress in a public place and may be arrested for indecent exposure Epileptics who suffer from both petit and grand mal attacks are specially liable to maniacal attacks Such insanity differs from ordinary insanity in its sudden onset intensity of symptoms short duration and abrupt ending To establish a plea of epilepsy in cases of crime one must show that the individual really did suffer from true epilepsy and that the crime was committed at a period having a definite relation to the epileptic seizure Alcoholic Insanity This may occur in three forms one Acute Alcoholic Delirium mania a potu due to excessive amount of alcohol consumed two Delirium Tremens due to long continued over drinking The patient suffers from horrible dreams illusions and suspicions which may lead him to attack people or commit suicide three Chronic Alcoholic Insanity Loss of memory is the chief symptom with paralysis of motion hallucinations and delusions of persecution Responsibility for Criminal Acts To establish a defence on the ground of insanity it must be proved that the prisoner at the time when the crime was committed did not know the nature and quality of the act he was committing and did not know that it was wrong At the present time however the power of controlling his actions is usually made the test The plea of insanity is brought forward as a rule only in capital charges so that the prisoner if found guilty will escape hanging If proved guilty but insane the person is sentenced to be kept in a criminal lunatic asylum during His Majesty s pleasure XLIV EXAMINATION OF PERSONS OF UNSOUND MIND The following hints with regard to the examination of patients supposed to be insane will be useful The general appearance and shape of head complexion and expression of countenance gait movements and speech should be noted the state of the general health appetite bowels tongue skin and pulse should be inquired into and in women the state of the menstrual function should be ascertained The family history must be traced out and the personal history taken with care especially as to whether the unsoundness came on late in life or followed any physical cause Ascertain whether it is a first attack whether the patient has suffered from epilepsy has squandered his money grown restless has absurd delusions et cetera In order to ascertain the capacity of the mind questions should be asked with regard to age birthplace profession number of family and common events such as the day of week month and year The power of performing simple arithmetical operations may be tested It may be necessary to pay more than one visit The examiner should be careful to ask questions adapted to the station of life of the supposed lunatic a man is not necessarily mad because he cannot perform simple arithmetical operations or does not know about things with which his questioner is well acquainted The opinion of a supposed lunatic that his examiner s feet were large was not considered by the Commissioners among the facts indicating insanity yet statements quite as absurd are made by medical men as facts of insanity observed by themselves Reads his Bible and is anxious about the salvation of his soul is another example of a bad certificate Some well marked delusion should be recorded For a lunacy certificate Reception Order on Petition or Judicial Reception Order except in the case of a pauper patient there are required the signatures of two independent medical men and of a relation or friend The medical men must not be in partnership or in any way interested in the patient they must make separate visits at different times and write on the proper forms the facts observed by themselves and those observed by others giving the name of the informer A certificate is valid only for seven days In very urgent non pauper cases the signature of one medical man is sufficient but such certificate Emergency Certificate or Urgency Order is only valid for two days and as the patient can only be detained in the asylum under this order for seven days in England or three in Scotland it must be supplemented by another signed as above directed The medical certificate must contain a statement that it is expedient for the alleged lunatic to be placed forthwith under care with reasons for making such statement The certifying medical practitioner must have personally examined the patient not more than two clear days before his reception In London and other large towns where an expert opinion is readily obtainable it is not expedient to resort to such urgency orders Medical men should be careful how they sign certificates of insanity No medical man is bound to certify but if he does so he must be prepared to take the responsibility of his acts There must be no reasonable ground for alleging want of good faith or reasonable care The practitioner must exercise that amount of care and skill which he may reasonably be expected to possess XLV THE INEBRIATES ACTS It is somewhat difficult to define an inebriate but for the moment the following will suffice and will ultimately in all probability be officially adopted An inebriate is a person who habitually takes or uses any intoxicating thing or things and while under the influence of such thing or things or in consequence of the effects thereof is a dangerous to himself or others or b a cause of harm or serious annoyance to his family or others or c incapable of managing himself or his affairs or of ordinary proper conduct Under the provisions of the Habitual Drunkards Acts forty two and forty three Vict c nineteen and fifty one and fifty two Vict c nineteen any habitual drunkard may voluntarily place himself under restraint He must make an application to the owner of a licensed retreat stating the time during which he undertakes to remain His application must be accompanied by a statutory declaration of two persons stating that they knew the applicant to be a confirmed drunkard Without this testimony as to moral character his application cannot be entertained His signature must also be attested by two justices who must state that he understands the effect of his application and that it has been explained to him The limit to the term of restraint is twelve months after which he must resume his former habits if he wishes to qualify for another period The Act works automatically and when it has been set for a certain time the patient cannot release himself until the period has expired The Inebriates Retreat must be duly licensed and the licensee incurs distinct obligation in return for the powers entrusted to him It is an offence against the Act to assist any habitual drunkard to escape from his retreat and should he succeed in effecting his escape he may be arrested on a warrant A drunkard who does not obey orders and conform to the rules of the establishment may be sent to prison for seven days It may be as well to mention that it is an offence to supply any drunkard under the Act with any intoxicating drink or sedative or stimulant drug without authority and that the penalty is a fine of Ltwenty or three months imprisonment The Act is a good one but might be carried farther with advantage It has been ruled that a crime committed during drunkenness is as much a crime as if committed during sobriety A person is supposed to know the effect of drink and if he takes away his senses by drink it is no excuse He is held answerable both for being under the influence of alcohol or of any other drug and for the acts such influence induces Inebriates Act eighteen ninety eight nineteen hundred If an habitual drunkard be sentenced to imprisonment or penal servitude for an offence committed during drunkenness or if he has been convicted four times in one year the court may order him to be detained for a term not exceeding three years in an inebriate reformatory PART II TOXICOLOGY I DEFINITION OF A POISON Though the law does not define in definite terms what a poison really is it lays stress on the malicious intention in giving a drug or other substance to an individual It is a felony to administer or cause to be administered any poison or other destructive thing with intent to murder or with the intention of stupefying or overpowering an individual so that any indictable offence may be committed It is a misdemeanour to administer any poison or destructive or noxious thing merely to aggrieve injure or annoy an individual For a working definition we may state that a poison is a substance which when introduced into or applied to the body is capable of injuring health or destroying life A poison may therefore be swallowed applied to the skin injected into the tissues or introduced into any orifice of the body II SALE OF POISONS SCHEDULED POISONS The sale of poisons is regulated by various Acts but chiefly by the Pharmacy Act eighteen sixty eight and by the Poisons and Pharmacy Act nineteen oh eight Only registered medical practitioners and legally qualified druggists are permitted to dispense and sell scheduled poisons They are responsible for any errors which may be committed in the sale of poisons If a druggist knows that a drug in a prescription is to be used for an improper purpose he may refuse to dispense it The practitioner who carelessly prescribes a drug in a poisonous dose is not held responsible but the dispenser would be if he dispensed it and harmful or fatal consequences followed on its being swallowed When a dispenser finds an error in a prescription it is his duty to communicate with the prescriber privately pointing out the mistake A great responsibility rests on the medical man who does his own dispensing as there is no one to check his work If a doctor prescribes a drug with the intention of curing or preventing a disease but that contrary to expectation and general experience it causes illness or even death no responsibility can rest with the prescriber It has to be proved that actual injury has been sustained by the complainant before an action for damages can be commenced and that the plaintiff was free from all contributory negligence Scheduled Poisons By the Pharmacy Act of eighteen sixty eight two groups of poisons are scheduled Part I contains a list of those which are considered very active poisons e g arsenic alkaloids belladonna cantharides coca if containing more than one per cent alkaloids corrosive sublimate diachylon cyanides tartar emetic ergot nux vomica laudanum opium savin picrotoxin veronal and all poisonous urethanes prussic acid vermin killers et cetera Such poisons must not be sold to strangers but only to persons known to or introduced by someone known to the druggist If sold the latter must enter into the Poison Register the name of the poison the name of the person to whom it is sold the quantity and purpose for which it is to be used and date of sale The entry must be signed by the purchaser and by the introducer The word Poison must be affixed to the bottle or package and also the name and address of the seller Part II contains a list of poisons supposed to be less active These may only be sold if on the bottle box or package there is affixed a label with the name of the article the word Poison and the name and address of the seller It is not necessary to enter the transaction in a register Chemists are required to keep poisons in specially distinguishable bottles and these in a special room or locked cupboard Dangerous Drugs Act nineteen twenty The regulations restrict the manufacture and sale of opium morphine cocaine and heroin so as to prevent their abuse Preparations containing less than one five per cent of the first two or less than one ten per cent of the last two are excluded Prescriptions containing the above drugs must be dated and signed with the full name and address of the prescriber and must have also those of the patient The total amount of the drug to be supplied must be stated and it must not be dispensed more than once the dispenser retains the prescription Special books must be kept recording the purchase and sale of these drugs Proprietary Medicines Bill introduced in nineteen twenty and likely soon to become law The sale of any unregistered proprietary medicine purporting to cure certain diseases or produce abortion is made an offence A register of proprietary medicines et cetera is established The object is to protect the public against quack remedies Notification of Poisoning Every case of poisoning which occurs in any industry lead arsenic anthrax et cetera must be notified by the medical attendant to the Chief Inspector of Factories Factory and Workshops Act eighteen ninety five III ACTION OF POISONS CLASSIFICATION OF POISONS Action of Poisons They may act either locally or only after absorption into the system one Local Action as seen in a corrosive poisons b irritant poisons causing congestion and inflammation of the mucous membranes e g metallic and vegetable irritants c stimulants or sedatives to the nerve endings as aconite conium cocaine two Remote Action This may be of reflex character as seen in the shock produced by the pain caused by corrosive poisons or the poison may exert a special action on certain structures as belladonna on the cells of the brain strychnine on the motor nerve cells of the spinal cord three In Both Ways Certain poisons as carbolic or oxalic acids act in this way Age idiosyncrasy tolerance and disease all exert modifying influences on the action of a poison The form in which the poison is swallowed and the quantity also determine its action In the gaseous form poisons act most rapidly and fatally When in solution and injected hypodermically they also act very rapidly In the solid form they act as a rule slowly and may even set up vomiting and so may be entirely ejected by vomiting Poisons act most energetically when the stomach is empty If taken when the stomach already contains food solution and absorption may be greatly delayed Some poisons are cumulative in their action and thus even if infinitesimal doses be swallowed each day there is a certain amount of storage in the tissues though a certain percentage of the poison is being constantly eliminated and at last symptoms of poisoning show themselves Classification of Poisons As an aid to memory the following classification is perhaps the best I Inorganic one Corrosive acids and alkalies and caustic salts carbolic and oxalic acids also two Irritant practically all the metals and the metalloids I Cl Br P II Organic Treatment Transfusion of blood or saline fluid stimulants Sulphuret of Potassium liver of sulphur occurs in mass or powder of a dirty green colour has a strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen Symptoms Of acute irritant poisoning with stupor

used in medicine and the arts It occurs as metallic arsenic which is of a steel grey colour brittle and gives off a garlic like odour when heated as arsenious acid in the form of two sulphides the red sulphide or realgar and the yellow sulphide or orpiment and as arsenite of copper or Scheele s green It also exists as an impurity in the ores of several metals iron copper silver tin zinc nickel and cobalt Sulphuric acid is frequently impregnated with arsenic from the iron pyrites used in preparing the acid It is a constituent of many rat pastes vermin or weed killers complexion powders sheep dips et cetera Arsenious Acid White Arsenic Trioxide of Arsenic Colourless odourless and almost tasteless It occurs in commerce as a white powder or in a solid cake which is at first translucent but afterwards becomes opaque Slightly soluble in cold water one ounce of water dissolves about one two grain of arsenic Fowler s solution is the best known medicinal preparation of arsenic and contains one grain of arsenious anhydride in one hundred ten minims Symptoms Commence in from half to one hour Faintness nausea incessant vomiting epigastric pain headache diarrhoea tightness and heat of throat and fauces thirst catching in the breath restlessness debility cramp in the legs and convulsive twitchings The skin becomes cold and clammy In some cases the symptoms are those of collapse with but little pain vomiting or diarrhoea In others the patient falls into a deep sleep while in the fourth class the symptoms resemble closely those of English cholera The vomited matters are often blue from indigo or black from soot or greenish from bile mixed with the poison Should the patient survive some days no trace of arsenic may be found in the body as the poison is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys In all suspected cases the urine should be examined The symptoms of chronic poisoning by arsenic are loss of appetite silvery tongue thirst nausea colicky pains diarrhoea headache languor sleeplessness cutaneous eruptions soreness of the edges of the eyelids emaciation falling out of the hair cough haemoptysis anaemia great tenderness on pressure over muscles of legs and arms due to peripheral neuritis and convulsions Pigmentation is common the face becomes dusky red the rest of the body a dark brown shade This darkening is most marked in situations normally pigmented and in parts exposed to pressure of the clothes such as the neck axilla and inner aspect of the arms the extensor aspects being less marked than the flexor The pigmentation resembles the bronzing of Addison s disease but there are no patches on the mucous membranes and the normal rosy tint of the lips is not altered The skin over the feet may show marked hyperkeratosis The nervous system is notably affected The sensory symptoms appear first numbness and tingling of the hands and feet pain in the soles of the feet on walking pain on moving the joints and erythromelalgia Then come the motor symptoms with drop wrist and drop foot The patient suffers severely from neuritis and there may be early loss of patellar reflex The nervous symptoms come on later than the cutaneous manifestations Post Mortem Appearances Signs of acute inflammation of stomach duodenum small intestines colon and rectum Stomach may contain dark grumous fluid and its mucous coat presents the appearance of crimson velvet Ulceration is rare and cases of perforation still less common the patient dying before it occurs If life has been preserved for some days there is extensive fatty degeneration of the organs There may be entire absence of post mortem signs Putrefaction of the body is retarded by arsenic Treatment The stomach pump emetics then milk milk and eggs oil and lime water Inflammatory symptoms collapse coma et cetera must be treated on ordinary principles As an antidote the best when the poison is in solution is the hydrated sesquioxide of iron formed by precipitating tinctura ferri perchloridi with excess of ammonia or carbonate of soda This is filtered off through muslin and given in tablespoonful doses It forms ferric arsenate which is sparingly soluble Colloidal iron hydroxide may be used instead Dialyzed iron in large quantities is efficacious Fatal Dose Smallest Two grains Exceptionally recovery from very large doses if rejected by vomiting Fatal Period Shortest Twenty minutes Exceptionally death as late as the sixteenth day The effects of arsenic are modified by tolerance some persons being able to take considerable quantities The peasants of Styria are in the habit of eating it Method of Extraction from the Stomach The coats of the stomach should be examined with a lens for any white particles These if present may be collected mixed with a little charcoal in a test tube and heated If arsenic is present a metallic ring will be formed in the cooler parts of the tube If this ring be also heated octahedral crystals of arsenic will be deposited farther up the tube and are easily recognized by the microscope The contents of the stomach or the solid organs minced up should be boiled with pure hydrochloric acid and water then filtered The filtrate can then be subjected to Marsh s or Reinsch s process Tests In solution arsenic may be detected by the liquid tests one Ammonio nitrate of silver gives a yellow precipitate arsenite of silver two Ammonio sulphate of copper gives a green precipitate Scheele s green three Sulphuretted hydrogen water gives a yellow precipitate Marsh s Process Put pure distilled water into a Marsh s apparatus with metallic zinc and sulphuric acid Hydrogen is set free and should be tested by lighting the issuing gas and depressing over it a piece of white porcelain If no mark appears the reagents are pure and the suspected liquid may now be added The hydrogen decomposes arsenious acid and forms arseniuretted hydrogen The gas carried off by a fine tube is again ignited A piece of glass or porcelain held to the flame will have if arsenic be present a deposit on it having the following characters In the centre a deposit of metallic arsenic round this a mixture of metallic arsenic and arsenious acid and outside this another ring of arsenious acid in octahedral crystals The deposit is dissolved by a solution of chloride of lime turned yellow by sulphide of ammonium after evaporation on the addition of strong nitric acid evaporated and neutralized with ammonia and nitrate of silver added a brick red colour is produced arseniate of silver Reinsch s Process Boil distilled water with one sixth or one eighth of hydrochloric acid and introduce a slip of bright copper If after a quarter of an hour s boiling there is no stain on the copper add the suspected liquid If arsenic be present it will form an iron grey deposit If this foil be dried cut up put in a reduction tube and heated crystals of arsenious trioxide will be deposited on the cold part of the tube These tests are difficult to apply but as arsenic is a ubiquitous poison and as there are many sources of fallacy it would be well when possible to obtain the services of an expert Biological Test Put the substance to be tested into a flask with some small pieces of bread sterilize for half an hour at one hundred twenty deg C When cold inoculate with a culture of Penicillium brevicaule and keep at a temperature of thirty seven deg C If arsenic is present a garlic like odour is noticed in twenty four hours due to arseniuretted hydrogen or an organic combination of arsenic This test is delicate and will detect one one thousand of a milligramme but it is not quantitative Other Preparations of Arsenic These are arsenite of potash Fowler s solution cacodylate of sodium and arsenite of copper Scheele s green the last frequently used for colouring dresses and wall papers Persons using these preparations may suffer from catarrhal symptoms rashes on the neck ears and face thirst nausea pain in stomach vomiting headache perhaps peripheral neuritis and loss of patellar reflex The cacodylates although formerly employed in the treatment of phthisis should be used with the utmost caution The arsenites give the reactions of arsenious acid Arsenic is eliminated not only by the kidneys and bowels but by the skin and in women by the menses It may be detected in the sweat the saliva the bronchial secretion and during lactation in the milk The sale of arsenic and its preparations to the public is properly hedged round with restrictions of all kinds It is included in Part I of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act eight Edward VII c fifty five No arsenic may be sold to a person under age nor may it be sold unless mixed with soot or indigo in the proportion of one ounce of soot or one two ounce of indigo at the least to every pound of arsenic Arseniuretted Hydrogen arsine AsH is an extremely poisonous gas and is evolved in various chemical and manufacturing processes When damp Ferro silicon evolves AsH and PH both very lethal gases Ferrochrome is used in making steel and it also evolves PH and in such extreme dilution as zero point two per cent may cause death XXII ANTIMONY AND ITS PREPARATIONS Tartar Emetic tartarized antimony potassio tartrate of antimony occurs as a white powder or in yellowish white efflorescent crystals Vinum antimoniale contains two grains to a fluid ounce of the wine Symptoms Metallic taste rapidly followed by nausea incessant vomiting burning heat and pain in stomach purging Dysphagia sense of constriction in throat intense thirst cramps faintness profound depression in fatal cases giddiness and tetanic spasms In chronic poisoning nausea vomiting and purging weak pulse loss of appetite debility cold sweats great prostration progressive emaciation The symptoms in chronic poisoning may simulate gastritis or enteritis Externally applied it produces an eruption not unlike that of smallpox Post Mortem Appearances Inflammation softening and an aphthous condition of the throat gullet and stomach the last reddened in patches In chronic poisoning inflammation also of caecum and colon Brain and lungs may be congested Decomposition is hindered for long Treatment Promote vomiting by warm greasy water or the stomach tube may be used Cinchona bark or any preparation containing tannin as tea decoction of oak bark et cetera Morphine to allay pain Fatal Dose In an adult two grains same as arsenic Fatal Period Death follows in eight to twelve hours from exhaustion Method of Extraction from the Stomach The contents of the stomach or its coats should be finely cut up and boiled in water acidulated with tartaric acid and subjected to dialysis or strained and filtered Pass hydrogen sulphide through the filtered or dialyzed fluid until a precipitate ceases to fall collect the sulphide thus formed wash and dry it Boil the orange coloured sulphide in a little hydrochloric acid If the solution be now added to a large bulk of water the white oxychloride is precipitated which is soluble in tartaric acid and precipitated orange yellow with hydrogen sulphide The chloride of bismuth is also precipitated white but the precipitate is not soluble in tartaric acid and the precipitate with hydrogen sulphide is black Tests Soluble in water but not in alcohol Heated in substance it crepitates and chars and if heat be increased the metal is deposited Treated with sulphuretted hydrogen a characteristic orange red sulphide is formed A drop of the solution evaporated leaves crystals either tetrahedric or cubes with edges bevelled off Sulphuretted hydrogen passed through gives the orange red precipitate above named Dilute nitric acid gives a white precipitate soluble in excess and also in tartaric acid Marsh s and Reinsch s processes are applicable for the detection of antimony but Reinsch s is the better Reinsch s process gives a violet deposit instead of the black lustrous one of arsenic Chloride of Antimony Butter of Antimony A light yellow or dark red corrosive liquid Symptoms Violet corrosion and irritation of the alimentary canal with the addition of narcotic symptoms After death the mucous membrane of the entire canal is charred softened and abraded Treatment As for tartar emetic magnesia in milk XXIII MERCURY AND ITS PREPARATIONS The most important salt of mercury toxicologically is corrosive sublimate Other poisonous preparations are red precipitate white precipitate mercuric nitrate the cyanide and potassio mercuric iodide Calomel has very little toxic action Metallic mercury is not poisonous but its vapour is Corrosive Sublimate perchloride of mercury is in heavy colourless masses of prismatic crystals possessing an acrid metallic taste It is soluble in sixteen parts of cold and two of boiling water Soluble in alcohol and ether the latter also separating it from its solution in water Symptoms come on rapidly Acrid metallic taste constriction and burning in throat and stomach nausea vomiting of stringy mucus tinged with blood tenesmus purging Feeble quick and irregular pulse dysuria with scanty albuminous or bloody urine or total suppression Cramp twitches and convulsions of limbs occasionally paralysis In poisoning from the medicinal use of mercury there may be salivation a coppery taste in the mouth peculiar foetor of breath tenderness and swelling of mouth inflammation swelling and ulceration of gums cancrum oris a blue line on the gums and the loosening of teeth Mercury is less quickly eliminated from the body than arsenic In chronic cases mercurialism hydrargyrism ptyalism or salivation including most of the symptoms enumerated above May get eczema mercuriale and periostitis Profound anaemia often a prominent symptom neuritis not uncommon If fumes of mercury inhaled mercurial tremors develop Post Mortem Appearances Corrosion softening and sloughing ulceration of stomach and intestines The mucous membrane of the oesophagus and stomach is often of a bluish grey colour The large intestine and rectum are often ulcerated and gangrenous Inflamed condition of urinary organs with contraction of the bladder Treatment Encourage or produce vomiting Albumin as white of egg gluten or wheat flour is the best antidote Demulcent drinks milk and ice Stomach tube to be used with care owing to softened state of gullet and stomach Fatal Dose Three grains in a child Fatal Period Half an hour the shortest Method of Extraction from the Stomach A trial test may be made of the contents of the stomach with copper foil If mercury is found the contents of the stomach may be dialyzed the resulting clear fluid concentrated and shaken with ether which has the power of taking corrosive sublimate up and thus separating it from arsenic and other metallic poisons The ether allowed to evaporate will leave the corrosive sublimate in white silky looking prisms Suppose no mercury is found in the dialyzed fluid owing to the fact that corrosive sublimate enters into insoluble compounds with albumin fibrin mucous membrane gluten tannic acid et cetera we must dry the insoluble matter and heat it with nitro hydrochloric acid until all organic matter is destroyed and excess of nitric acid expelled The residue dissolved in water filtered and tested with copper foil et cetera Tests The following table gives the action of corrosive sublimate with reagents one With iodide of potassium Bright scarlet colour two With potash solution Bright yellow colour three With hydrochloric acid and First a yellowish and then a black sulphuretted hydrogen colour four Heated in a reduction tube Melts boils is volatilized and forms a white crystalline sublimate five With ether Freely soluble the ethereal solution when allowed to evaporate spontaneously deposits the salt in white prismatic crystals six Heated with carbonate of Globules of metallic mercury are sodium in a reduction tube produced A very simple process for detecting corrosive sublimate is to put a drop of the suspected solution on a sovereign and touch the gold through the solution with a key when metallic mercury will be deposited on the gold XXIV LEAD AND ITS PREPARATIONS Acetate of Lead Sugar of Lead A glistening white powder or crystalline mass Soluble in water with a sweetish taste It is practically the only lead salt which gives rise to acute symptoms and only when taken in large doses Symptoms Metallic taste dryness in throat intense thirst vomiting colicky pains cramps cold sweat constipation and scanty urine severe headache convulsions Chronic lead poisoning is liable to occur in those who handle lead in any form white lead workers paint manufacturers plumbers pottery workers et cetera In chronic lead poisoning the most prominent symptoms are a blue line on the gums anaemia emaciation pallor quick pulse persistent constipation colic cramps in limbs and paralysis of the extensor muscles causing dropped hand May get saturnine encephalopathies of which intense headache optic neuritis and epileptiform convulsions are the most common Albumin in urine tendency to gout and in women to abortion Post Mortem Appearances Inflamed mucous membrane of stomach and intestines with layers of white or whitish yellow mucus impregnated with the salt of lead Treatment Sulphate of sodium or magnesium or a mixture of dilute sulphuric acid spirits of chloroform and peppermint water Milk or milk and eggs As a prophylactic among workers in lead a drink containing sulphuric acid flavoured with treacle should be given Lavatory accommodation should be provided and scrupulous cleanliness should also be enjoined in the workshops The dry grinding of lead salts should be prohibited The ionization method of Sir Thomas Oliver is most useful both as regards cure and also prevention of chronic poisoning by lead Fatal Dose and Fatal Period Uncertain Method of Extraction from the Stomach Dry the contents of the stomach or portions of the liver et cetera and incinerate in a porcelain crucible Treat the ash with nitric acid dry and dissolve in water The solution of nitrate of lead may now have the proper tests applied Tests Sulphuretted hydrogen gives a black precipitate liquor potassae white precipitate sulphuric acid white precipitate insoluble in nitric acid iodide of potassium a bright yellow precipitate A delicate test for lead in water is to stir the water concentrated or not with a glass rod dipped in ammonium sulphide a brown coloration is produced One tenth of a grain of lead in a gallon of water may be detected Chronic lead poisoning is an industrial disease and being an occupation risk its victims are entitled to compensation at the hands of their employers In case of death compensation has been awarded even when at the autopsy the patient has been found to have suffered from acute tuberculosis of the lungs The responsibility of apportioning the monetary value of disablement resulting from the action of the lead rests with a judge or jury who are guided by the expert medical evidence available Diachylon or lead plaster is largely used as an abortifacient XXV COPPER AND ITS PREPARATIONS Poisoning with copper salts is rare The most important are the sulphate subacetate and arsenite Sulphate of Copper bluestone blue vitriol in half ounce doses is a powerful irritant Has been given to procure abortion Subacetate of Copper verdegris occurs in masses or as a greenish powder Powerful astringent metallic taste Half ounce doses have proved fatal Symptoms Epigastric pain vomiting of bluish or greenish matter diarrhoea Dyspnoea depression cold extremities headache purple line round the gums Jaundice is common A chronic form of poisoning may occur with symptoms closely resembling those of lead Post Mortem Appearances Inflammation of stomach and intestines which are bluish or green in colour Treatment Encourage vomiting Give albumin or very dilute solution of ferrocyanide of potassium Method of Extraction from the Stomach Boil the contents of the stomach in water filter pass hydrogen sulphide filter collect precipitate and boil in nitric acid filter dilute filtrate with water and apply tests In the case of the solid organs dry incinerate digest ash in hydrochloric acid evaporate nearly to dryness dilute with water and test Tests Polished steel put into a solution containing a copper salt receives a coating of metallic copper Ammonia gives a whitish blue precipitate soluble in excess Ferrocyanide of potassium gives a rich red brown precipitate Sulphuretted hydrogen gives a deep brown precipitate XXVI ZINC SILVER BISMUTH AND CHROMIUM The salts of zinc requiring notice are the sulphate and chloride Sulphate of Zinc has been taken in mistake for Epsom salts In large doses it causes dryness of throat thirst vomiting purging and abdominal pain Post Mortem Appearances Those of inflammation of digestive tract Treatment Tea decoction of oak bark carbonate of potassium or sodium as antidote Chloride of Zinc A solution containing this substance two hundred thirty grains to the ounce constitutes Burnett s disinfecting fluid It is a corrosive poison The symptoms are burning sensation in the mouth throat stomach and abdomen followed by vomiting diarrhoea with tenesmus and distension of the abdomen The vomited matter contains shreds of mucous membrane with blood There is profound collapse cold surface clammy sweats weak pulse with great prostration The treatment is to wash out the stomach with large and weak solutions of carbonate of sodium Mucilaginous drinks may be given and hypodermic injections of morphine are useful to allay the pain Method of Extraction from the Stomach Dry and incinerate the tissues in a porcelain crucible digest ash in water apply tests Tests Ammonia a white precipitate soluble in excess reprecipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen ferrocyanide of potassium a white precipitate sulphuretted hydrogen a white precipitate in pure and neutral solutions Nitrate of baryta will show the presence of sulphuric acid and nitrate of silver of hydrochloric acid Silver Nitrate of silver is a powerful irritant Tests Black precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen white with hydrochloric acid Treatment Common salt Chronic nitrate of silver poisoning is characterized by argyria The gums show a blue line which is darker than that produced by lead and the skin presents a greyish hue which is permanent Bismuth The bismuth salts are not poisonous but may contain arsenic as an impurity although this is far less common than it was some years ago Chromic Acid Chromate Bichromate of Potassium These act as corrosives when solid or in concentrated liquid forms In dilute solutions they act as irritants Used as dyes have proved fatal more than once Those engaged in their manufacture suffer from unhealthy ulcers on the nasal septum and hands The former may to some extent be prevented by taking snuff Lead chromate chrome yellow is a powerful irritant poison Two drachms of the bichromate caused death in four hours Tests Yellow precipitate with salts of lead deep red with those of silver Treatment Emetics magnesia and diluents Washing out of the stomach with weak solution of nitrate of silver XXVII

delirium convulsions with hot skin flushed face and dilated pupils Fatal Dose Thirty grains Cocculus Indicus The fruit of Anamirta cocculus Contains a poisonous active principle picrotoxin used to adulterate beer and by poachers to stupefy fish Symptoms Convulsions followed by stupor and complete loss of voluntary power XXXIII TETRACHLORETHANE et cetera Tetrachlorethane Cellon Acetylene tetrachloride vapour has caused poisoning in aeroplane dope and cinema film works Symptoms Gastric symptoms and marked jaundice This may be followed in days or weeks by stupor coma death Post Mortem Fatty degeneration of internal organs chiefly liver Trinitrotoluene T N T An explosive solid which stains the skin an orange colour may be absorbed through skin or be inhaled Symptoms Shortness of breath headache drowsiness Later skin irritation gastritis jaundice blood degeneration Treatment Remove from work rest in bed diuretics purgatives alkalies XXXIV ALCOHOL ETHER AND CHLOROFORM Alcohol ether and chloroform induce general anaesthesia often preceded by delirious excitement and followed by nausea and vomiting When they cause death it is by inducing a state like apoplexy or by paralyzing the heart Alcohol Absolute alcohol is ethyl hydroxide C H OH with not more than one per cent by weight of water Rectified spirit spiritus rectificatus contains ninety per cent of alcohol Methylated spirit consists of rectified spirit with ten per cent of wood spirit Proof spirit contains a little over forty nine per cent of absolute alcohol brandy or whisky fifty three per cent port wine twenty to twenty five per cent ales and stout four to six per cent Symptoms Acute poisoning confusion giddiness staggering gait headache passing into stupor with subnormal temperature and coma Vomiting may occur and recovery ensue otherwise collapse sets in Pupils usually dilated Dipsomaniacs suffer from indigestion vomiting and purging jaundice albuminuria diabetes cirrhosis of liver degeneration of kidneys congestion of brain peripheral neuritis alcoholic insanity and various forms of paralysis In the acute form delirium tremens is the most common manifestation Post Mortem Appearances Deep red colour of lining membranes of stomach Sometimes congestion of cerebral vessels and meninges Lungs congested blood fluid Rigor mortis persistent Fatal Dose Death from one two pint of gin and from two bottles of port but recovery from larger quantities Fatal Period Average about twenty four hours Treatment Stomach tube cold affusion electricity injection of a pint of hot coffee into the rectum Give chloride of ammonium in thirty grain doses to prevent delirium strychnine or digitalin hypodermically Method of Extraction from the Stomach Neutralize the contents of the stomach if acid with sodium carbonate place them in a retort and carefully distil Collect the distillate mix with chloride of calcium or anhydrous sulphate of copper and again distil Agitate distillate with dry potassium carbonate and draw off some of the supernatant fluid for testing Tests Odour Dissolves camphor With dilute sulphuric acid and bichromate of potassium turns green and evolves aldehyde Product of combustion makes lime water white and turbid Methyl Alcohol Wood Naphtha Used to produce intoxication by painters furniture polishers et cetera Symptoms are those of alcoholic poisoning but vomiting and delirium are more persistent Total or partial blindness may follow as a sequel of optic atrophy A fatal result not infrequently follows The following table gives the points of distinction between concussion of brain alcoholic poisoning and opium poisoning CONCUSSION OF BRAIN ALCOHOL OPIUM one Marks of violence one No marks of violence one As alcohol on head unless person has fallen History will be of use two Stupor sudden two Excitement precedes two Symptoms slow sudden stupor Drowsiness stupor lethargy three Face pale cold three Face flushed pupils three Face pale pupils pupils sluggish generally dilated contracted sometimes dilated four Remission rare four Partial recovery may four Remission rare Patient recovers occur followed by slowly death five No odour of alcohol five Odour of alcohol five Odour of opium in in breath in breath breath Ether is a volatile liquid prepared from ethylic alcohol by interaction with sulphuric acid It contains ninety two per cent of ethyl oxide C H O It was formerly called sulphuric ether It is a colourless inflammable liquid having a strong and characteristic odour specific gravity zero point seven hundred thirty five Purified ether from which the ethylic alcohol has been removed by washing with distilled water and most of the water by subsequent distillation in the presence of calcium chloride and lime It is this preparation which is used for the production of general anaesthesia It has a specific gravity of zero point seven hundred twenty two to zero point seven hundred twenty and its vapour is very inflammable Symptoms When taken as a liquid same as alcohol When inhaled as vapour causes slow prolonged and stertorous breathing face becomes pale lips bluish surface of body cold Pulse first quickens then slows Pupils dilated eyes glassy and fixed muscles become flabby and relaxed profound anaesthesia Then pulse sinks and coma ensues sensation being entirely suspended Nausea and vomiting not uncommon Post Mortem Appearances Brain and lungs congested Cavities of heart full of dark liquid blood Vessels at upper part of spinal cord congested Treatment Exposure to pure air cold affusion artificial respiration galvanism Method of Extraction from the Contents of the Stomach Same as for alcohol During distillation pass some of the vapour into concentrated solution of bichromate of potash nitric and sulphuric acids and note reaction as for alcohol Tests Vapour burns with smoky flame depositing carbon Sparingly soluble in water With bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid same as alcohol Chloroform A colourless liquid specific gravity one point four hundred ninety to one point four hundred ninety five very volatile giving off dense vapour Sweet taste and pleasant odour Symptoms When swallowed characteristic smell in breath anxious countenance burning pain in the throat stomach and region of the abdomen staggering gait coldness of the extremities vomiting insensibility deepening into coma with stertorous breathing dilated pupils and imperceptible pulse When inhaled much the same as ether but produces insensibility and muscular relaxation more rapidly It would be impossible to instantly render a person insensible by holding a pocket handkerchief saturated with chloroform over the face Statements such as this which are often made in cases of robbery from the person and in cases of rape are incredible Delayed Chloroform Poisoning Death may take place in from four to seven days after chloroform has been administered especially in the case of children The internal organs are found to be fattily degenerated and death is thought to be due to acetonuria Post Mortem Appearances Cerebral and pulmonary congestion Heart empty or right side distended with dark blood Treatment Stomach tube and free lavage cold affusion drawing forward tongue artificial respiration galvanism and suspension with head downward Inhalation of nitrite of amyl strychnine hypodermically Fatal Dose When swallowed from one to two ounces Method of Extraction from the Stomach By distillation at one hundred twenty deg F The vapour as it passes along a glass tube may be decomposed by heat into chlorine hydrochloric acid and carbon the first shown by setting free iodine in iodide of starch the second by reddening blue litmus paper and the last by its deposit Tests Taste colour weight burns with a green flame dissolves camphor guttapercha and caoutchouc Iodoform Poisoning may result from its use in surgery It produces delirium sleepiness and coma It may lead to mental weakness or optic neuritis XXXV CHLORAL HYDRATE It was formerly largely used as a hypnotic and many fatal consequences ensued It is prepared from alcohol and chlorine Symptoms Deep sleep loss of muscular power diminished or abolished reflex action and sensibility followed by loss of consciousness and marked fall of temperature Pulse may become quick and face flushed or livid and bloated Prolonged use of this drug may produce a peculiar eruption on the skin Supposed to act in the blood by being decomposed into chloroform and sodium formate Its effects are due chiefly to depression of the central nervous system the medulla being the last part of the nervous system to be attacked Method of Extraction from the Stomach By distillation in strongly alkaline solutions when it may be obtained as chloroform and tested as such Treatment Stomach tube or emetic Hypodermic injections of strychnine Keep patient warm and inject a pint of hot strong coffee into the rectum Nitrite of amyl and artificial respiration Tests Heated with caustic potash it yields chloroform and potassium formate The chloroform is readily recognized by its odour and if the solution be concentrated by separating as a heavy layer at the bottom of the test tube XXXVI PETROLEUM AND PARAFFIN OIL Cases of poisoning by petroleum and paraffin are common and occur chiefly in children Petroleum is a natural product and is a mixture of the higher saturated hydrocarbons The crude petroleum is purified by distillation and is then free from colour but retains its peculiar penetrating odour Different varieties are sold under the names of cymogene gasolene naphtha petrol and benzoline Benzoline is highly inflammable and is often called mineral naphtha petroleum naphtha and petroleum spirit Benzoline is not the same as benzene or benzol which is one of the products of the dry distillation of coal From its very general use as a fuel in motor cars many accidents have happened from inhaling the vapour of petrol It gives rise to coldness shallow respiration syncope and insensibility but seldom death Paraffin also known as kerosene and mineral oil is a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons obtained by the distillation of shale By the retailer the terms petroleum and paraffin oil are used indifferently and each is sold for the other without prejudice Symptoms These substances are not very active poisons and as a rule even children recover The breath has the odour of paraffin the face is pale and cyanotic hot and dry and there may be vomiting Death may result from gastro enteritis or from coma Fatal Dose In the case of an adult one two pint should not prove lethal and patients have recovered after drinking a pint Treatment Emetics purgatives and stimulants XXXVII ANTIPYRINE ANTIFEBRIN PHENACETIN AND ANILINE Many of the synthetical coal tar products now so largely employed as analgesics are powerful toxic agents Phenazone Antipyrine or Analgesin is a complex benzene derivative prepared from aniline aceto acetic ether and methyl iodide It is in colourless inodorous scaly crystals which have a bitter taste It is soluble in its own weight of water Tests Can be extracted from an alkaline solution of chloroform The residue left on the evaporation of chloroform should be employed for testing If heated with strong nitric acid and allowed to cool a purple colour is produced Ferric chloride gives a blood red coloration destroyed by the addition of mineral acids Treatment Stimulants freely inhalation of oxygen patient to be kept in the recumbent position Acetanilide Antifebrin Phenylacetamide a constituent of Daisy or headache powders is obtained by the interaction of acetic acid and aniline It is in colourless inodorous lamellar crystals which have a slight pungent taste It is insoluble in water Tests May be extracted from acid solutions by ether or chloroform If heated with solution of potassium hydroxide odour of aniline is given off if liquid when it is warmed with a few drops of chloroform a penetrating and unpleasant odour of isocyanide Treatment Emetics stimulants inhalation of ether recumbent position Phenacetin Phenacetinum is produced by the interaction of glacial acetic acid and para phenetidin It is in white tasteless inodorous glistening scaly crystals insoluble in water Of all the members of the group it most rarely produces toxic symptoms Treatment As for the other members of this group Exalgin Aspirin et cetera as well as the above may all act as poisons to certain persons and even small medicinal doses may cause serious and even fatal consequences Symptoms more or less common to all Nausea vomiting hurried respiration marked cyanosis syncope Persistent sneezing and widespread urticaria may be present collapse Aniline is an oily liquid heavier than and not soluble in water It is colourless or reddish brown it has a peculiar tar like odour it is soluble in alcohol and forms a soluble sulphate with sulphuric acid A solution of bleaching powder gives with solution of the sulphate a purple colour changing to red brown Symptoms Nausea vomiting giddiness intoxication drowsiness gasping for breath feeble pulse and marked cyanosis In its industrial use it may act as a poison either by inhalation of the fumes or by absorption through the skin The symptoms then are mainly those of peripheral neuritis with blindness Fatal Dose About six drachms Treatment Wash out stomach stimulants artificial respiration inhalation of oxygen transfusion Nitro benzol Artificial Oil of Bitter Almonds It is used in perfumery but is very poisonous when swallowed or inhaled or absorbed through skin It is used in the manufacture of aniline dyes and may act as an industrial poison The symptoms closely resemble those of aniline poisoning but there is perhaps greater mental confusion Fatal Dose Eight to ten drops have caused death Treatment Emetics stimulants transfusion of saline or blood pituitrin strychnine or digitalin hypodermically Nitroglycerine gives rise to intense and persistent headache powder headache Throbbing and pulsation of all the arteries in the body flushing of the face and collapse may follow Dinitrobenzene causes symptoms resembling nitro benzol poisoning and when acting as a chronic poison gives rise to weakness jaundice peripheral neuritis XXXVIII SULPHONAL TRIONAL TETRONAL VERONAL PARALDEHYDE These are dangerous drugs The ordinary symptoms of the group are noises in the ears headache vertigo inability to stand or to walk properly insensibility and cyanosis The most interesting point is the condition of the urine In cases of poisoning it is dark or reddish brown in colour due to the presence of haematoporphyrin It contains albumin and casts but no red corpuscles In cases of haematoporphyrinuria the prognosis is bad and it is said that these cases invariably end fatally Treatment In an ordinary case emetics strong coffee hypodermic injections of strychnine saline injections and transfusion Cases of chronic poisoning from the als are not uncommon and are increasing in frequency Hypnogen is apparently identical with veronal All the above named aniline derivatives are included in Part I of the scheduled poisons XXXIX CONIUM AND CALABAR BEAN Conium Maculatum Spotted Hemlock All parts of the plant are poisonous often mistaken for parsley Contains the poisonous principle coniine a volatile liquid alkaloid with a mousy smell insoluble in water soluble in alcohol ether and chloroform It also contains methyl coniine Symptoms Dryness of throat headache dilated pupil dysphagia loss of muscular power passing into complete paralysis Delirium coma and convulsions occasionally Post Mortem Appearances Congested brain and lungs redness of the mucous membrane of the stomach The stomach and intestines should be examined for fragments of the leaves and fruit recognized by their microscopical appearances Treatment Emetics tannic acid or gallic acid Diffusible stimulants Method of Extraction from the Stomach Use Stas Otto process Tests The mousy odour Deepened colour and dense white fumes with nitric acid Pale red deepening with hydrochloric acid There are several other umbelliferous plants which are poisonous The water hemlock Cicuta virosa produces symptoms not unlike those of hemlock it has been mistaken for parsnip and celery It contains an active principle cicutoxin which in some respects is allied to strychnine and picrotoxin The fool s parsley or lesser hemlock AEthusa cynapium is another member of this group although doubt has been expressed as to whether it is really poisonous The water dropwort Oenanthe crocata is undoubtedly poisonous especially to cattle In man it produces abdominal pain with diarrhoea and vomiting dilated pupils slow pulse and cyanosis delirium insensibility and convulsions The post mortem appearances are not characteristic but the stomach and intestines should be examined for portions of the plant Calabar Bean or Physostigma The bean of Physostigma venenosum contains the alkaloid physostigmine or eserine with the antagonistic alkaloid calabarine Symptoms Vomiting giddiness irregular cardiac action contraction of the pupils paralysis of lower extremities and death from asphyxia Treatment Emetics hypodermic injection of one fifty grain sulphate of atropine repeated if necessary Method of Extraction from the Stomach Use Stas Otto process Test The contraction of the pupil which it causes XL TOBACCO AND LOBELIA Tobacco Nicotiana tabacum owes its poisonous properties to its alkaloid nicotine a volatile oily amber coloured liquid with an acrid taste and ethereal odour soluble in water alcohol ether and chloroform The drug has an intense depressant action on the heart and respiratory centre Symptoms Giddiness fainting nausea and vomiting with syncope muscular tremors stupor stertorous breathing and insensible pupil Death has occurred after seventeen or eighteen pipes at a sitting Post Mortem Appearances Not uniform or characteristic General relaxed condition of muscles engorgement of cerebral and pulmonary vessels Congestion of gastric mucous membrane Treatment Emetics stimulants hypodermic injection of one twenty five grain of strychnine Warmth to the surface by hot bottles hot blankets Method of Extraction from the Stomach Digest the contents of the stomach in cold distilled water and very dilute sulphuric acid strain filter and press residue Evaporate the filtrate to half its bulk digest with alcohol and evaporate alcohol off in a water bath Dissolve residue sulphate of nicotine in water and make solution alkaline with potash then shake with ether in a test tube Remove ether and allow it slowly to evaporate Test resulting alkaloid Tests No change of colour with the mineral acids White deposit with corrosive sublimate Sulphuric acid and bichromate of potassium give a green colour oxide of chromium Precipitate with bichloride of platinum and with carbazotic acid Lobelia Inflata Indian Tobacco Much used in America by the Coffenite practitioners and a valuable remedy for asthma Symptoms Nausea vomiting giddiness cold sweats prostration Headache giddiness tremors insensibility and convulsions XLI HYDROCYANIC ACID Prussic Acid is the most active of poisons The diluted hydrocyanic acid of the Pharmacopoeia contains two per cent of hydrocyanic acid Scheele s four per cent It is a colourless liquid feebly acid with odour of bitter almonds Cyanide of Potassium is largely used in photography and in electro plating and is also poisonous It often contains undecomposed carbonate of potassium which may act as a corrosive poison and cause erosion of the mucous membranes of the lips mouth and stomach Oil of Bitter Almonds used as a flavouring agent may contain when improperly prepared from five to fifteen per cent of the anhydrous acid Symptoms The symptoms usually come on in a few seconds and are of the shortest possible duration There is a sudden gasp for breath possibly a loud cry and the patient drops down dead If the fatal termination is prolonged for a few minutes the symptoms are intense giddiness pallor of the skin dilatation of the pupils laboured and irregular breathing small and frequent pulse followed by insensibility There may be convulsions or tetanic spasms with evacuation of urine and faeces Death results from paralysis of the central nervous system but artificial respiration is useless as the drug promptly arrests the heart s action It also kills the protoplasm of the red blood corpuscles rendering them useless as oxygen carriers Post Mortem Appearances Skin livid pale or violet with bright red patches on the dependent parts The gastro intestinal mucous membrane is bright red in colour owing to the presence of cyanmethaemoglobin Hands clenched nails blue jaws fixed froth about mouth Eyes prominent and glistening odour of acid from body venous system gorged Treatment Empty the stomach by the tube at once and wash it out with a solution of sodium thiosulphate Strong ammonia to the nostrils Stimulants freely brandy chloric ether ammonia sal volatile ad libitum If patient cannot swallow inject hypodermically either brandy or ether Hypodermic injection of one fifty grain atropine Douche to the face alternately hot and cold Death commonly occurs so rapidly that there is no time for treatment Fatal Dose Smallest Half a drachm of the B P acid equal to zero point six grain of the anhydrous Recovery from one two ounce of the B P acid These records are fallacious for in specimens the percentage of anhydrous acid varies enormously Practically one grain of the anhydrous acid is fatal Fatal Period From two to five minutes after a large dose but may be less Method of Extraction from the Stomach Having previously carefully fitted a watchglass to a wide mouthed bottle nearly fill the bottle with the contents of the stomach blood secretions et cetera Place a few drops of a solution of nitrate of silver on the concave surface of the watchglass and cover the mouth of the bottle with it The vapour of hydrocyanic acid if present will form a white precipitate which may be tested Other watchglasses treated with sulphide of ammonium or sulphate of iron and liquor potassae will give the reactions of the acid with appropriate tests This method removes all objections as to foreign admixture If the acid is not at first detected gentle warming of the bottle in a water bath will assist the evolution of the vapour The vapour may be obtained by distillation but this process is open to objections to which the other is not In some cases it becomes changed in the body into formic acid which should therefore be sought for Tests With nitrate of silver a white precipitate insoluble in cold but soluble in boiling nitric acid The precipitate heated evolves cyanogen having an odour of peach blossoms and burning when lighted with a pink flame Liquor potassae and sulphate of iron give a brownish green precipitate which turns to Prussian blue with hydrochloric acid Liquor potassae and sulphate of copper give a greenish white precipitate becoming white with hydrochloric acid Sulphide of ammonium gives sulpho cyanide of ammonium This develops a blood red colour with perchloride of iron bleached by corrosive sublimate XLII ACONITE Aconite Aconitum Napellus monkshood Root and leaves Poisonous property depends upon an alkaloid aconitine Aconite is one of the constituents of saint Jacob s Oil Symptoms Numbness and tingling in mouth throat and stomach giddiness loss of sensation deafness dimness of sight paralysis first of the lower and then of the upper extremities vomiting and shallow respiration Pupils dilated Pulse small irregular finally imperceptible The mind remains unaffected Death often sudden Post Mortem Appearances Venous congestion engorgement of brain and membranes Treatment Emetics stimulants freely Best antidote is sulphate of atropine one fifty grain hypodermically and also strychnine Digitalis also useful Warmth to whole body Patient to make no exertion Fatal Dose Of root or tincture one drachm Fatal Period Average less than four hours Method of Extraction from the Stomach et cetera Extraction from contents of stomach by Stas Otto process It may be found in the urine gives usual alkaloidal reactions but no distinctive chemical test known Tests Chiefly physiological tingling and numbness when applied to tongue or inner surface of cheek Effects on mice et cetera A cadaveric alkaloid or ptomaine has been found in the body possessing many of the actions of aconitine The presence of this substance was suggested in the Lamson trial The Indian aconite Aconitum ferox the Bish poison is much more active than the European variety It contains a large proportion of pseudaconitine and is frequently employed in India not only for the destruction of wild beasts but for criminal purposes Aconitine varies much in activity according to its mode of preparation and the source from which it is derived The most active kind is probably made from A ferox XLIII DIGITALIS All parts of the plant Digitalis purpurea purple foxglove are poisonous Contains the glucoside digitalin and other active principles Symptoms Nausea vomiting purging and abdominal pains Vomited matter grass green in colour Headache giddiness and loss of sight pupils dilated insensitive pulse weak remarkably slow and irregular cold sweat Salivation occasionally or syncope and stupor Death sometimes quite suddenly Post Mortem Appearances Congested condition of brain and membranes inflammation of gastric mucous membrane Treatment Emetics freely infusions containing tannin as coffee tea oak bark galls et cetera Stimulants Hypodermic injection of one one hundred twenty grain of aconitine Method of Extraction from the Stomach et cetera Use Stas Otto process Tests for Digitalin A white substance sparingly soluble in water not changed by nitric acid turns yellow changing to green with hydrochloric acid The minutest trace of digitalin moistened with sulphuric and treated with bromine vapour gives a rose colour turning to mauve This is very delicate but in experienced hands the physiological test is more reliable The chemist who has had no practical experience in pharmacological methods would be wiser to keep to his chemical tests XLIV NUX VOMICA STRYCHNINE AND BRUCINE Nux Vomica consists of the seeds of the Strychnos nux vomica From these strychnine and brucine are obtained The symptoms post mortem appearances and treatment of poisoning by nux vomica are the same as for strychnine Strychnine is a powerful poison and forms the active ingredient of many vermin killers It occurs as a white powder or as colourless crystals with a persistent bitter taste very slightly soluble in water more or less soluble in benzol ether and alcohol Symptoms Sense of suffocation twitchings of muscles followed by tetanic convulsions and opisthotonos each lasting half to two minutes Mental faculties unaffected face congested and anxious eyes staring lips livid much thirst The period of accession of the symptoms varies with the mode of administration of the poison Symptoms as a rule come on soon after food has been taken Patient may die within a few hours from asphyxia or from exhaustion In Tetanus there is usually history of a wound the symptoms come on slowly lockjaw is an early symptom and only later complete convulsions the intervals between the fits are never entirely free from rigidity Death is delayed for some days Post Mortem Appearances Heart empty blood fluid rigor mortis persistent Hands usually clenched feet arched and inverted Congestion of brain spinal cord and lungs Treatment Emetics or stomach pump if the patient is deeply anaesthetized Tannic acid and permanganate of potassium Bromide of potassium one two ounce with chloral thirty grains repeated if necessary Fatal Dose Smallest Quarter of a grain Fatal Period Shortest Ten minutes usually two to four hours Method of Extraction from the Stomach The alkaloid may be separated by the process of Stas Otto Tests Strychnine has a characteristic very bitter taste it imparts this taste to even very dilute solutions it is unaffected by sulphuric acid but gives a purple blue colour changing to crimson and light red when the edge of this solution is touched with dioxide of manganese potassium bichromate ferricyanide of potassium or permanganate of potassium This test is so delicate as to show the one twenty five thousand of a grain of the alkaloid A very minute quantity one five thousand grain in solution placed on the skin of a frog after drying causes tetanic convulsions Brucine This alkaloid found associated with strychnine possesses the same properties though in a less powerful degree Nitric acid gives a blood red colour changed to purple with protochloride of tin XLV CANTHARIDES Cantharides Spanish fly or blistering beetle is the basis of most of the blistering preparations It is sometimes taken as an abortifacient or given as an aphrodisiac but whether it has any such action is open to question It acts as an irritant to the kidneys and bladder and sometimes produces haaematuria and a good deal of temporary discomfort Symptoms Burning sensation in the throat and stomach with salivation pain and difficulty in swallowing Vomiting of mucus mixed with blood Tenesmus diarrhoea the motions containing blood and mucus Dysuria with passage of small amounts of albuminous and bloody urine Peritonitis high temperature quick pulse headache loss of sensibility and convulsions Post Mortem Gastro intestinal mucous membrane inflamed with gangrenous patches Genito urinary tract inflamed Acute nephritis Treatment An emetic of apomorphine demulcent drinks such as barley water white of egg and water linseed tea and gruel but not oils with a hypodermic injection of morphine to allay pain Tests The vomited matter often contains shining particles of the powder The urine will probably be albuminous XLVI ABORTIFACIENTS Emmenagogues are remedies which have the property of exciting the catamenial flow ecbolics or abortives are drugs which excite contraction of the uterus and are supposed to have the power of expelling its contents The vegetable substances commonly reputed to be abortives are ergot savin aloes Hierapicra digitalis colocynth pennyroyal and nutmeg but there is no evidence to show that any drug possesses this property Lead in some parts of the country is a popular abortifacient A medicine may be an emmenagogue without being an ecbolic Permanganate of potassium and binoxide of manganese are valuable remedies for amenorrhoea but will not produce abortion The vegetable substances frequently used as abortives are savin and ergot Savin Juniperus Sabina Leaves and tops of the plant yield an acrid oil having poisonous properties and which has even produced death Symptoms Those of irritant poisons Purging not always present but tenesmus and strangury Post Mortem Appearances Acute inflammation of alimentary canal Green powder found This washed and dried and then rubbed gives odour of savin Test A watery solution of savin strikes deep green with perchloride of iron and if an infusion of the twigs has been taken the twigs may be detected with the microscope The twigs obtained from the stomach dried and rubbed between the finger and thumb will give the odour of savin Ergot Secale Cornutum A parasitic fungus attacking wheat barley oats and rye which is reputed to have the power of causing contraction of unstriped muscular fibre especially that of the uterus Symptoms Lassitude headache nausea diarrhoea anuria convulsions coma Small quantities frequently repeated have in the past produced gangrene of the extremities or anaesthesia of fingers and toes Tests Lake red colour with liquor potassae this liquid filtered gives a precipitate of same colour with nitric acid XLVII POISONOUS FUNGI AND TOXIC FOODS Fungi Of the poisonous mushrooms the Amanita phalloides and the fly agaric or Agaricus muscarius are the most potent The active principle of the former is phallin and of the latter muscarine The Amanita phalloides is distinguished from the common mushroom Agaricus campestris by having permanent white gills and a hollow stem The Agaricus muscarius is bright red with yellow spots Phallin is a toxalbumin which destroys the red blood corpuscles causing the serum to become red in colour and the urine blood stained Fibrin is liberated and thromboses occur especially in the liver The symptoms may be mistaken for phosphorus poisoning or acute yellow atrophy of the liver Muscarine affects the nervous system chiefly Edible fungi have an agreeable taste and smell and are firm in substance Poisonous fungi have an offensive smell and bitter taste are often of a bright colour and soon become pulpy Symptoms These may be of the narcotic or irritant types Usually however there is violent colic with thirst vomiting and diarrhoea mental excitement followed by delirium convulsions coma slow pulse stertorous breathing cyanosis cold extremities and dilated pupils Post Mortem In phallin poisoning the blood remains fluid numerous haemorrhages are present with fatty degeneration of the internal organs Treatment Use the stomach tube to give a solution of permanganate of potash emetics followed by a hypodermic injection of one fifty grain of atropine Transfusion of saline fluid A dose of castor oil would be useful Foods The kinds of food which most frequently produce symptoms of poisoning are pork veal beef meat pies potted and tinned meats sausages and brawn Sausage poisoning is common in Germany It is not necessary that the food should be high to give rise to poisoning It may arise from the use of the flesh of an animal suffering from some disease from inoculation with micro organisms or from the presence of toxalbumoses or ptomaines Many diseases such as diarrhoea enteric fever and cholera and perhaps tuberculosis may be caused by eating infected food Trichiniasis may also be mentioned Tinned fish often gives rise to symptoms of poisoning and shell fish are not uncommonly contaminated with pathogenic micro organisms Mussel poisoning was formerly supposed to be due to the copper in them derived from ships bottoms but it is more probably the result of the formation of a toxine during life and not after decomposition has set in Milk too may give rise to gastro intestinal irritation from the occurrence in it of chemical changes There have been epidemics of poisoning from eating cheese containing tyrotoxicon Ergotism from eating bread made with ergotized wheat is now rare but pellagra from the consumption of mouldy maize and lathyrism due to the admixture with flour of the seeds of certain kinds of vetch are still common in Southern Europe Symptoms The symptoms which result from the ingestion of poisonous meat are often very severe In some cases their appearance is delayed from twenty four to forty eight hours They may resemble those of an infectious disease or those of acute enteritis Usually there are headache anorexia rigors intestinal disturbance pains in the back and limbs and delirium Sometimes the symptoms resemble atropine poisoning a condition due to ptomatropine Treatment Emetics purgatives stimulants with hypodermic injections of strychnine and atropine along with stimulants XLVIII PTOMAINES OR CADAVERIC ALKALOIDS Every medical man before presenting himself to give evidence in a case of suspected poisoning should make himself thoroughly acquainted with recent researches on the subject Ptomaines are for the most part alkaloids generated during the process of putrefaction and they closely resemble many of the vegetable alkaloids veratrine morphine and codeine for example not only in chemical characters but in physiological properties They are probably allied to neurine an alkaloid obtained from the brain and also from the bile Some of them are analogous in action to muscarine the active principle of the fly fungus Some are proteids albumins and globulins Ptomaines may be produced abundantly in animal substances which after exposure under insanitary conditions have been excluded from the air Ptomaines or toxalbumins are sometimes found in potted meats and sausages and are due to organisms the Bacillus botulinus the B enteritidis of Gaertner the B proteus vulgaris or the B aertrycke which is perhaps the most common of all The symptoms produced by the latter are usually vomiting abdominal pain pains in the limbs and cramps diarrhoea vertigo coldness faintness and collapse The symptoms of botulism are dryness of skin and mucous membranes dilatation of pupils paralysis of muscles diplopia et cetera Articles of food most often associated with poisoning are pork ham bacon veal baked meat pie milk cheese mussels tinned meats In a case of suspected poisoning counsel for the defence if he knows his work will probably cross examine the medical expert on this subject and endeavour to elicit an admission that the reactions which have been attributed to a poison may possibly be accounted for on the theory of the formation of a ptomaine There is practically no counter move to this form of attack INDEX Abdomen injuries of twenty nine Abortifacients one
