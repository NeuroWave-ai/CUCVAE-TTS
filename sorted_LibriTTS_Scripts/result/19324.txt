the porcelain works in Sevres France and what the process is of making those beautiful things which come from there How is the name of the town pronounced Can you tell me anything of the history of Mme Pompadour Who was the Dauphin Did you learn anything of Louis XV whilst in France What are your literary habits It is with a great bounding joy that I impart the desired information Sevres is a small village just outside of saint Cloud pronounced San Cloo It is given up to the manufacture of porcelain You go to saint Cloud by rail or river and then drive over to Sevres by diligence or voiture Some go one way and some go the other I rode up on the Seine aboard of a little noiseless low pressure steamer about the size of a sewing machine It was called the Silvoo Play I think The fare was thirty centimes or say three cents After paying my fare and finding that I still had money left I lunched at saint Cloud in the open air at a trifling expense I then took a bottle of milk from my pocket and quenched my thirst Traveling through France one finds that the water is especially bad tasting of the Dauphin at times and dangerous in the extreme I advise those therefore who wish to be well whilst doing the Continent to carry especially in France as I did a large thick set bottle of milk or kumiss with which to take the wire edge off one s whistle whilst being yanked through the Louvre saint Cloud is seven miles west of the center of Paris and almost ten miles by rail on the road to Versailles pronounced Vairsi saint Cloud belongs to the canton of Sevres and the arrondissement of Versailles An arrondissement is not anything reprehensible It is all right You yourself could belong to an arrondissement if you lived in France saint Cloud is on the beautiful hill slope looking down the valley of the Seine with Paris in the distance It is peaceful and quiet and beautiful Everything is peaceful in Paris when there is no revolution on the carpet The steam cars run safely and do not make so much noise as ours do The steam whistle does not have such a hold on people as it does here The adjutant general at the depot blows a little tin bugle the admiral of the train returns the salute the adjutant general says Allons and the train starts off like a somewhat leisurely young man who is going to the depot to meet his wife s mother One does not realize what a Fourth of July racket we live in and employ in our business till he has been the guest of a monarchy of Europe between whose toes the timothy and clover have sprung up to a great height And yet it is a pleasing change and I shall be glad when we as a republic have passed the blow hard period laid aside the ear splitting steam whistle settled down to good permanent institutions and taken on the restful soothful Boston air which comes with time and the quiet self congratulation that one is born in a Bible land and with Gospel privileges and where the right to worship in a strictly high church manner is open to all The Palace of saint Cloud was once the residence of Napoleon I in summer time He used to go out there for the heated term and folding his arms across his stomach have thought after thought regarding the future of France Yet he very likely never had an idea that some day it would be a thrifty republic engaged in growing green peas or pulling a soiled dove out of the Seine now and then to add to the attractions of her justly celebrated morgue Louis XVIII also put up at the Palace in saint Cloud several summers He spelled it palais which shows that he had very poor early English advantages or that he was as I have always suspected a native of Quebec Charles X also changed the bedding somewhat and moved in during his reign He also added a new iron sink and a place in the barn for washing buggies Louis Philippe spent his summers here for a number of years and wrote weekly letters to the Paris papers signed Uno in which he urged the taxpayers to show more veneration for their royal nibs Napoleon III occupied the palais in summer during his lifetime availing himself finally of the use of mister Bright s justly celebrated disease and dying at the dawn of better institutions for beautiful but unhappy France I visited the palais pronounced pallay which was burned by the Prussians in eighteen seventy The grounds occupy nine hundred sixty acres which I offered to buy and fit up but probably I did not deal with responsible parties This part of France reminds me very much of North Carolina I mean of course the natural features Man has done more for France it seems to me than for the Tar Heel State and the cities of Asheville and Paris are widely different The police of Paris rarely get together in front of the court house to pitch horseshoes or dwell on the outlook for the goober crop And yet the same blue ozonic sky if I may be allowed to coin a word the same soft restful dolce frumenti air of gentle genial health and of cark destroying magnetic balm to the congested soul the inflamed nerve and the festering brain are present in Asheville that one finds in the quiet drives of San Cloo with the successful squirt of the mighty fountains of Vairsi and the dark and whispering forests of Fon taine bloo The palais at San Cloo presents a rather dejected appearance since it was burned and the scorched walls are bare save where here and there a warped and wilted water pipe festoons the blackened and blistered wreck of what was once so grand and so gay San Cloo has a normal school for the training of male teachers only I visited it but for some cause I did not make a hit in my address to the pupils until I began to speak in their own national tongue Then the closest attention was paid to what I said and the keenest delight was manifest on every radiant face The president who spoke some English shook hands with me as we parted and I asked him how the students took my remarks He said They shall all the time keep the thinkness what you shall call the recollect of monsieur s speech in preserves so that they shall forget it not continualle We shall all the time say we have not witness something like it since the time we come here and have not so much enjoy ourselves since the grand assassination by the guillotine Come next winter and be with us for one week Some of us will remain in the hall each time At San Cloo I hired of a quiet young fellow about thirty five years of age who kept a very neat livery stable there a sort of victoria and a big Percheron horse with fetlock whiskers that reminded me of the Sutherland sisters As I was in no hurry I sat on the iron settee in the cool court of the livery stable and with my arm resting on the shoulder of the proprietor I spoke of the crops and asked if generally people about there regarded the farmer movement as in any way threatening to the other two great parties He did not seem to know and so I watched the coachman who was to drive me as he changed his clothes in order to give me my money s worth in grandeur One thing I liked about France was that the people were willing at a slight advance on the regular price to treat a very ordinary man with unusual respect and esteem This surprised and delighted me beyond measure and I often told people there that I did not begrudge the additional expense The coachman was also hostler and when the carriage was ready he altered his attire by removing a coarse gray shirt or tunic and putting on a long olive green coachman s coat with erect linen collar and cuffs sewed into the collar and sleeves He wore a high hat that was much better than mine as is frequently the case with coachmen and their employers My coachman now gives me his silk hat when he gets through with it in the spring and fall so I am better dressed than I used to be But we were going to say a word regarding the porcelain works at Sevres It is a modern building and is under government control The museum is filled with the most beautiful china dishes and funny business that one could well imagine Besides the pottery ever since its construction has retained its models and they of course are worthy of a day s study The Sevres blue is said to be a little bit bluer than anything else in the known world except the man who starts a nonpareil paper in a pica town I was careful not to break any of these vases and things and thus endeared myself to the foreman of the place All employes are uniformed and extremely deferential to recognized ability Practically for half a day I owned the place A cattle friend of mine who was looking for a dynasty whose tail he could twist while in Europe and who used often to say over our glass of vin ordinaire which I have since learned is not the best brand at all that nothing would tickle him more than to have a little deal with a crowned head and get him in the door accidentally broke a blue crock out there at Sevres which wouldn t hold over a gallon and it took the best part of a carload of cows to pay for it he told me The process of making the Sevres ware is not yet published in book form especially the method of coloring and enameling It is a secret possessed by duly authorized artists The name of the town is pronounced Save Mme Pompadour is said to have been the natural daughter of a butcher which I regard as being more to her own credit than though she had been an artificial one Her name was Jeanne Antoinette Poisson Le Normand d Etioles Marchioness de Pompadour and her name is yet used by the authorities of Versailles as a fire escape so I am told She was the mistress of Louis XV who never allowed her to put her hands in dishwater during the entire time she visited at his house D Etioles was her first husband but she left him for a gay but rather reprehensible life at court where she was terribly talked about though she is said not to have cared a cent She developed into a marvelous politician and early seeing that the French people were largely governed by the literary lights of that time she began to cultivate the acquaintance of the magazine writers and tried to join the Authors Club She then became prominent by originating a method of doing up the hair which has since grown popular among people whose hair has not like my own been already done up This style of Mme Pompadour s was at once popular with the young men who ran the throttles of the soda fountains of that time and is still well spoken of A young friend of mine trained his hair up from his forehead in that way once and could not get it down again During his funeral his hair which had been glued down by the undertaker became surprised at something said by the clergyman and pushed out the end of his casket The king tired in a few years of Mme Pompadour and wished that he had not encouraged her to run away from her husband She however retained her hold upon the blase and alcoholic monarch by her wonderful versatility and genius When all her talents as an artiste and politician palled upon his old rum soaked and emaciated brain and ennui like a mighty canker ate away large corners of his moth eaten soul she would sit in the gloaming and sing to him Hard Times Hard Times Come Again No More meantime accompanying herself on the harpsichord or the sackbut or whatever they played in those days Then she instituted theatricals giving through the aid of the nobility a very good version of Peck s Bad Boy and Lend Me Five Centimes She finally lost her influence over Looey the XV and as he got to be an old man the thought suddenly occurred to him to reform and so he had Mme Pompadour beheaded at the age of forty two years This little story should teach us that no matter how gifted we are or how high we may wear our hair our ambitions must be tempered by honor and integrity also that pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a plunk CHAD S STORY OF THE GOOSE BY F HOPKINSON SMITH I nodded my head and Chad closed the door

morrow an you can bofe git married next Sunday UNCONSCIOUS HUMOR BY J K WETHERILL Perhaps unconscious humor does not appeal to the more amiable side of our sense of mirth for it excites in us a conceited feeling of superiority over those who are making us laugh but its unexpectedness and infinite variety render it irresistible to a certain class of minds The duly labeled joke follows a certain law and rule whereas no jester could invent the grotesqueries of the unconscious humorist As a humble gleaner after the editorial scythe or to be truly modern I should say mowing machine I have gathered some strange sheaves of this sort of humor Like many provincial newspapers that to which I am attached makes a feature of printing the social happenings in villages of the surrounding country and these out of town correspondents don t do a thing to the English language One of them invariably refers to the social lights of his vicinity as our prominent socialists and describes some individual as happening to an accident To another every festal occasion is a bower of beauty and a scene of fairyland Blue penciling they resent and one of them wrote to complain that a descriptive effort of his had been much altered and deranged The paper also publishes portraits of children and young women and it is in the descriptions accompanying these pictures that the rural correspondent excels himself One wound up his eulogy in an apparently irrepressible burst of enthusiasm She is indeed a tout ensemble A child of six months was described as studious and another correspondent went into details thus Little Willie has only one large blue eye the other having been punched out by his brother with a stick by accident A small child was accredited with a pleasing disposition and a keen juvenile conception The following are some of the descriptive phrases applied to village belles She is perfectly at home on the piano where her executions have attained international celebrity She possesses a mine of repartee and the qualities which have long rendered illustive her noble family Her carriage and disposition are swan like Her eyes can express pathetic pathos but flash forth fiery independence when her country s name is traduced She has a molded arm and her Juno like form glides with a rhythmic move in the soft swell of a Strauss Her chestnut hair gives a rich recess to her lovely fawnlike eyes which shine like a star set in the crown of an angel One writer becomes absolutely incoherent in his admiration and lavishes a mixture of metaphors upon his subject She portrays a picture worthy of a Raphael She dances like the fairies before the heavenly spirits She looks like a celestial goddess from an outburst of morning glories her lovely form would assume a phantomlike flash as she glides the floor as though she were a mystic dream Scarcely less rich in unconscious humor are some of the effusions of those who have literary aspirations A descriptive article contains a reference to a lonely house that stood in silent mutiny Indians who border on civilization an interesting people in their superstitious way infested the vicinity and one of the points of interest was the Wild Man s Leap so called from an Indian who is said to have leaped across to get away from some men who were trying to expatriate him An aspirant made this generous offer I will write you an article every week if you so wish it as I have nothing to do after supper Modest was the request of another concerning remuneration I do not ask for money but would like you to send me a small monkey I already have a parrot But no finer specimen of unconscious humor has ever fallen under the sub editorial eye than The Beautiful Circus Girl In these enterprising days rising young authors sometimes boast in print of their ignorance of grammar and spelling but the author of the aforementioned bit of fiction surpasses them all in that respect It seems only just that such a unique gem should be rescued from the dull obscurity of the waste basket THE BEAUTIFUL CIRCUS GIRL Some years ago the quaint but slow little village of Mariana was all on the qui of eve with excitement Pasted on every tree and sign was announcements of Hall s circus and the aperence of pretty Rose Floid in the pearless feets of tight rope dancing and Seignor Paul Paulo as her attendent All the vilage was agog for in their midst had old Hall and his Wife whome he always spoke of as the Misus taken a small but quaint cotage so as to make quiet and please Rose whose guardien he was In the distanse was seen an advancing teem and mounted on its box driving was W Alexander distinguished as to aperence tallent and that charm money He was of the most patricien aristocrats of the place Placed on the summit of one of those hils that spring up in the most unexpected ways and degrees was the quaint old Tudor mansion of the Alexanders called Waterloo in rememberence of the home of his ancestors which now rests on the banks of the Potomack a legend as to war and romance Though bearing with him all the honners that Cambridg could confere W Alexander was a faverite in the vilage being ever ready with a kind enquiry as to Parent or peny for marbles not forgetting his boyhoods days Though the beau par excelant of the vilage and posessing vast landed estate and a kind retinu he was not haughty Every one was eger to see Rose perform She in her pasage too and frow had won by her sweet manners many likings ere she exhibited her skill The eventful hour of promis came and what a crowd was there Rose came fourth asisted by Paul Paulo His form was molded even as an Apolo and his eger eye was fixed on the bony girl She ballanced her pole saught her equiliberum and every heart was at her desposal not accepting W Alexander Seeing this the dark pashonate eye of the Italian scowled So droped the curtain of the first performance And W Alexander stroled on towards his home heart and head full of the beautiful circus girl thoughts were very conflicting love at first sight We will skip for want of space the exquisite passages descriptive of the mutual love of Rose and W Alexander and pass on to the finale There was a paus a sencation and Rose came fourth to meander in mid air Admeration was at its hight as she swayed too and frow as it were a winged egle from some etherial climb Low a paus the rope snaps and Rose falls to erth a helpless mass of youth and beauty The venerable man of medicin closed her star lit eyes now forever dimed to this world And all knew she had walked the last rope that bound her to this erth What who was her murderer The rope seemed to be cut with some jaged instrument so that when her tiny feat pressed its coils it became her destroyer Suspician pointed at the Italian W Alexander s old Father of sympathy now the strongest entreted our Hero to sale for distent shores there asisted by that balm time and change there assuage his grefe Well came the last evening and with the sadest of hearts and a bunch of sweet violets W Alexander went to bid a long fare well But as he neared the sacred spot his heart seemed deadened Prone on her grave changing the snowy whiteness of the flowers with its crimson die was the body of Paul Paulo Who by his own hand caused his life blood to floe as an attonement UP AND DOWN OLD BRANDYWINE BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY Up and down old Brandywine In the days at s past and gone With a dad burn hook and line And a saplin pole i swawn I ve had more fun to the square Inch than ever any

as I then wuz young F I could sing as I have sung Song ud surely ring dee vine Up and down old Brandywine JONES BY LLOYD OSBOURNE I I could have taken No like a man and would have gone away decently and never bothered her again I told her so straight out in the first angry flush of my rejection but this string business with everything left hanging in the air so to speak made a fellow feel like thirty cents It simply means that I m engaged and you are not I said It s nothing of the kind she returned tearfully You re as free as free Ezra You can go away this moment and never write or anything Her lips trembled as she said this and I confess it gave me a kind of savage pleasure to feel that it was still in my power to hurt her It may sound unkind but still you must admit that the whole situation was exasperating Here was five foot five of exquisite blooming twenty year old American girlhood sending away the man she confessed to care for because forsooth she would not marry before her elder sister I always thought it was beautiful of Freddy she was named Frederica you know to be always so sweet and tender and grateful about Eleanor but sometimes gratitude can be carried altogether too far even if you are an orphan and were brought up by hand Eleanor was thirty four if a day a nice enough woman of course and college bred and cultivated and clever but her long suit wasn t good looks She was tall and bony worshipped genius and all that and played the violin No repeated Freddy I shall never never marry before Eleanor It would mortify her I know it would and make her feel that she herself had failed She s awfully frank about those things Ezra surprisingly frank I don t see why being an old maid is always supposed to be so funny do you It s touching and tragic in a woman who d like to marry and who isn t asked But Eleanor must have had heaps of offers I said surely Just one Well one s something I remarked cheerfully Why didn t she take him then She told me only last night that she was sorry she hadn t Here at any rate was something to chew on I saw a gleam of hope Why shouldn t Eleanor marry the only one and make us all happy That was three years ago said Freddy I have loved you for four I retorted I was cross with disappointment To be dashed to the ground you know just as I was beginning Tell me some more about him I went on I m a plain business man and hang on to an idea like a bulldog once I get my teeth in they stay in for all you may drag at me and wallop me with an umbrella metaphorically speaking of course Tell me his name where he lives and all We were coming back from Colorado and there was some mistake about our tickets They sold our Pullman drawing room twice over to Doctor Jones and his mother and also to ourselves You never saw such a fight and that led to our making friends and his proposing to Eleanor Then why in Heaven s name didn t she it was on the tip of my tongue to say jump at him take him She said she couldn t marry a man who was her intellectual inferior And was he Oh he was a perfect idiot but nice and all that and tremendously in love with her Pity wasn t it The obvious thing to do is to chase him up instantly Where did you say he lived His mother told me he was going to New York to practice medicine But didn t you ever hear from him again I mean was that the end of it all Yes Then you don t even know if he has married since No Nor died No Nor anything at all No What was his first name Wait a moment let me think yes it was Harry Just Harry Jones then New York City Freddy laughed forlornly But he must have had antecedents I cried out There are two ways of doing this Sherlock Holmes business backward and forward you know Let s take Doctor Jones backward As they say in post office forms what was his place of origin New York City He begins there and ends there does he then Yes But how sure are you that Eleanor would marry him if I did manage to find him and bring him back I m not sure at all No but Freddy listen it s important You told me yourself that she I want the very identical words she used Freddy reflected She said she was almost sorry she hadn t accepted that silly doctor That doesn t seem much does it I remarked gloomily Oh from Eleanor it does Ezra She said it quite seriously She always hides her feelings under a veil of sarcastic humor you know You re certainly a very difficult family to marry I said Being an orphan she began Well I m going to find that Jones if I Ezra dear boy you re crazy How could you think for a moment that I m off little girl Good by Wait a second Ezra She rose and went into the next room reappearing with something in her hand She was crying and smiling both at once I took the little case she gave me it was like one of those things that pen knives are put in and looked at her for an explanation It s the h h hindleg of a j j jack rabbit she said shot by a g g grave at the f f full of the moon It s supposed to be l l lucky It was given to me by a naval officer who got drowned It s the only way I can h h help you And thus equipped I started bravely for New York II In the directory I found eleven pages of Joneses three hundred and eighty four Henry Joneses and excluding seventeen dentists eighty seven Doctor Henry Joneses I asked one of the typists in the office to copy out the list and prepared to wade in We were on the eve of a labor war and it was exceedingly difficult for me to get away As the managing partner of Hodge Westoby boxers not punching boxers nor China boxers but just plain American box making boxers I had to bear the brunt of the whole affair and had about as much spare time as you could heap on a ten cent piece I had to be firm conciliatory defiant and tactful all at once and every hour I took off for Jonesing threatened to blow the business sky high It was a tight place and no mistake and it was simply jack rabbit hindleg luck that pulled me through My first Jones was a hoary old rascal above a drug store He was a hard man to get away from and made such a fuss about my wasting his time with idle questions that I flung him a dollar and departed He followed me down to my cab and insisted on sticking in a giant bottle of his Dog Root Tonic I dropped it overboard a few blocks farther on and thought that was the end of it till the whole street began to yell at me and a policeman grabbed my horse while a street arab darted up breathless with the Dog Root Tonic I presented it to him together with a quarter the policeman darkly regarding me as an incipient madman The second Jones was a man of about thirty a nice gentlemanly fellow in a fine office I have usually been an off hand man in business accustomed to quick decisions and very little beating about the bush But I confess I was rather nonplussed with the second Jones How the devil was I to begin His waiting room was full of people and I hardly felt entitled to sit down and gas about one thing and the other till the chance offered of leading up to the Van Coorts So I said I had some queer shooting sensations in the chest In five minutes he had me half stripped and was pounding my midriff in And the questions that man asked He began with my grandparents roamed through my childhood and youth dissected my early manhood and finally came down to coffee and what I ate for breakfast Then it was my turn I asked him as a starter whether he had ever been in Colorado No he hadn t After forty five minutes of being hammered and stethoscoped and punched and holding my breath till I was purple and hopping on one leg he said I was a very obscure case of something with nine syllables At least I won t be positive with one examination he said but kindly come to morrow at nine when I shall be more at leisure to go into the matter thoroughly I paid him ten dollars and went sorrowfully away The third Jones was too old to be my man so was the fourth the fifth had gone away the month before leaving no address the sixth however was younger and more promising I thought this time I d choose something easier than pains in the chest I changed them to my left hand I was going to keep my clothes on anyhow But it wasn t any use Off they came After a decent interval of thumping and grandfathers and what I had for breakfast I managed to get in my question Ever in Colorado Doctor Oh dear me no Another ten dollars and nothing accomplished The seventh Jones was again too old the eighth was a pale hobbledehoy the ninth was a loathsome quack the tenth had died that morning the eleventh was busy the twelfth was a veterinary surgeon the thirteenth was an intern living at home with his widowed sister Colorado No the widowed sister was positive he had never been there The fourteenth was a handsome fellow of about thirty five He looked poor and threadbare and I had a glimpse of a shabby bed behind a screen Patients obviously did not often come his way and his joy at seeing me was pitiful I had meant to try a bluff and get in my Colorado question this time free of charge but I hadn t the heart to do it Slight pains in the head seemed a safe complaint After a few questions he said he would have to make a thorough physical examination No clothes off I protested It s essential he said and went on with something about the radio activity of the brain and the vasomotor centers The word motor made me feel like a sick automobile I begged to keep my clothes on I insisted I promised to come to morrow but it wasn t any good and in a few minutes he was hitting me harder than either of the two before Maybe I was more tender He electrocuted me extra from a switchboard ran red hot needles into my legs and finally after banging me around the room said I was the strongest and wellest man who had ever entered his office There s a lot of make believe in medicine he said but I m one of those poor devils who can t help telling a patient the truth There s nothing whatever the matter with you mister Westoby except that your skin has a slightly abrased look and I seem to notice an abnormal sensitiveness to touch Were you ever in Colorado Doctor I asked while he was good enough to help me into my shirt Oh yes I know Colorado well My heart beat high Some friends of mine were out there three years ago I said Wouldn t it be strange if by any chance the Van Coorts Oh I left Denver when I was fifteen Five dollars The fifteenth Jones was a doctor of divinity the sixteenth was a tapeworm specialist the seventeenth was too old the eighteenth was too old the nineteenth was too old a trio of disappointing patriarchs The twentieth painted out black eyes the twenty first was a Russian who could scarcely speak any English He said he had changed his name from Karaforvochristophervitch to something more suited to American pronunciation He seemed to think that Jones gave him a better chance I sincerely hope it did He told me that all the rest of the Jones family was in Siberia but that he was going to bomb them out The twenty second was a negro The twenty third He was a tall youngish man narrow shouldered rather commonplace looking with beautiful blue eyes and a timid winning deprecatory manner I told him I was suffering from insomnia After raking over my grandfathers again and bringing the family history down by stages to the very moment I was shown into his office he said he should have to ask me to undergo a thorough physical But I was tired of being slapped and punched and breathed on and prodded and was bold enough to refuse point blank I d rather have the insomnia We worked up quite a fuss about it for there was something tenacious in the fellow for all his mild kind gentle ways and I had all I could do to get off by pleading press of business But I wasn t to escape scot free Medical science had to get even somehow He compromised by stinging my eye out with belladonna Have you ever had belladonna squirted in your eye Well don t He was sitting at the table writing out some cabalistic wiggles that stood for bromide of potassium when I remarked casually that it was strange how well I could always sleep in Colorado He laid down the pen with a sigh A wonderful state Colorado I observed To me it s the land of memories he said Sad beautiful irrevocable memories try tea for breakfast do you read Browning Then you will remember that line Oh if I And I insist on your giving up that cocktail before dinner Some very dear friends of mine were once in Colorado I said Morristown people the Van Coorts The Van Coorts Doctor Jones sprang from his chair his thin handsome face flushing with excitement Do you mean to say that you know Eleanor Van Coort he gasped All my life He dropped back into the chair again and mumbled something about cigars I was only to have blank a day In his perturbation I believe he limited me to a daily box He was trying and trying very badly to conceal the emotions I had conjured up They were talking about you only yesterday I went on That is if it was you A Pullman drawing room And a mistake about the tickets he broke out Yes yes it s they all right Talking about me did you say Did Eleanor I mean did Miss Van Coort express She was wondering how she could find you I said You see they re busy getting up a house party and she was running over her men If I only knew where that dear Doctor Jones was she said and then asked me if by any possible chance His fine blue eyes were glistening with all sorts of tender thoughts It was really touching And I was in love myself you know So she has remained unmarried he exclaimed softly Unmarried after all these years She s a very popular girl I said She s had dozens of men at her feet but an unfortunate attachment something that seems to go back to about three years ago has apparently determined her to stay out of the game Doctor Jones dropped his head on his hands and murmured something that sounded like Eleanor Eleanor Then he looked up with one of the most radiant smiles I ever saw on a man s face I hope I m not presuming on a very short acquaintance he said but the fact is why should I not tell you Miss Van Coort was the woman in my life I explained to him that Freddy was the woman in mine Then you ought to have seen us fraternize In twenty minutes I had him almost convinced that Eleanor had loved him all these years But he worried a lot about a mister Wise who had been on the same train and a certain Colonel Hadow who had also paid Eleanor attention Jones was a great fellow for wanting to be sure I pooh poohed them out of the way and gave him the open track Then indeed the clouds rolled away He beamed with joy In his rich gush of friendship he recurred to the subject of my insomnia with a new born enthusiasm He subdivided all my symptoms He dived again into my physical being He consulted German authorities I squirmed and lied and resisted all I could but he said he owed me an eternal debt that could only be liquidated by an absolute cure He wanted to tie me up and shoot me with an X ray He ordered me to wear white socks He had a long terrifying look at a drop of my blood He jerked hairs out of my head to sample my nerve force He said I was a baffling subject but that he meant to make me well if it took the last shot in the scientific locker And he wound up at last by refusing point blank to be paid a cent I waltzed away on air to write an account of the whole affair to Freddy and dictate a plan of operations I was justified in feeling proud of myself Most men would have tamely submitted to their fate instead of chasing up all the Joneses of Jonesville Freddy sent me an early answer a gay happy overflowing little note telling me to try and engage Doctor Jones for a three day house party at Morristown I was to telegraph when he could come and was promised an official invitation from missus Matthewman She was the aunt you know that they lived with one of those old porcelain ladies with a lace cap and a rent roll However I could not do anything for two days for we had reached a crisis in the labor troubles and matters were approaching the breaking point We were threatened with one of those sympathetic strikes that drive business men crazy There was no question at issue between ourselves and our employes but the thing ramified off somewhere to the sugar vacuum boiler riveters union Finally the S V B R U came to a settlement with their bosses and peace was permitted to descend on Hodge Westoby s I took immediate advantage of it to descend myself on Doctor Jones He received me with open arms and an insomniacal outburst He had been reading up he had been seeing distinguished confreres he had been mastering the subject to the last dot and was panting to begin I hated to dampen such friendship and ardor by telling him that I had completely recovered Under the circumstances it seemed brutal but I did it The poor fellow tried to argue with me but I insisted that I now slept like a top It sounded horribly ungrateful Here I was spurning the treasures of his mind and almost insulting him with my disgusting good health I swerved off to the house party Eleanor s delight and so on missus Matthewman s pending invitation the hope that he might have an early date free He listened to it all in silence walking restlessly about the office his blue eyes shining with a strange light He took up a bronze paper weight and gazed at it with an intensity of self absorption I can t go he said Oh but you have to I exclaimed mister Westoby he resumed I was foolish enough to back a friend s credit at a store here He has skipped to Minnesota and I am left with three hundred and four dollars and seventy five cents to pay To take a three days holiday would be a serious matter to me at any time but at this moment it is impossible I gave him a good long look He didn t strike me as a borrowing kind of man I should probably insult him by volunteering Was there ever anything so unfortunate I can t go he repeated with a little choke You may never have another opportunity I said Eleanor is doing a thing I should never have expected from one of her proud and reserved nature The advances of such a woman He interrupted me with a groan If it wasn t for my mother I d throw everything to the winds and fly to her he burst out But I have a mother a sainted mother mister Westoby her welfare must always be my first consideration Is there no chance of anything turning up I said An appendicitis case an outbreak of measles I thought there was a lot of scarlatina just now He shook his head dejectedly Doctor I began again I am pretty well fixed myself I m blessed with an income that runs to five figures If all goes the way it should we shall be brothers in law in six months We are almost relations Give me the privilege of taking over this small obligation I never saw a man so overcome My proposal seemed to tear the poor devil to pieces When he spoke his voice was trembling You don t know what it means to me to refuse he said My self respect my my And then he positively began to weep You said three hundred and four dollars and seventy five cents I believe He waved it from him with a long lean hand I can not do it he said and for God s sake don t ask me to I argued with him for twenty minutes I laid the question before him in a million lights I racked him with a picture of Eleanor so deeply hurt so mortified that in her recklessness and despair she would probably throw herself away on the first man that offered This was his chance I told him the one chance of his life he was letting a piece of idiotic pride wreck the probable happiness of years He agreed with me with moans and weeps He had the candor of a child and the torrential sentiment of a German musician Three hundred and four dollars and seventy five cents stood between him and eternal bliss and yet he waved my pocketbook from him And all the while I saw myself losing Freddy I went away with his no no no still ringing in my ears At the club I found a note from Freddy She pressed me to lose no time missus Matthewman was talking of going to Europe and of course she and Eleanor would have to accompany her Eleanor she said had ordered two new gowns and had brightened up wonderfully Only yesterday she told me she wished that silly doctor would hurry up and come and that you know from Eleanor is almost a declaration Some of my best friends happened to be in the club It occurred to me that poor Nevill was diabetic and that Charley Crossman had been boring everybody about his gout I buttonholed them both and laid my unfortunate predicament before them I said I d pay all the expenses In fact the more they could make it cost the better I d be pleased What roared Nevill put myself in the hands of a young fool so that he may fill his empty pockets with your money Where do I come in Good heavens Westoby you re crazy Think what would happen to me if it came to Doctor Saltworthy s ears He d never have anything more to do with me Charley Crossman was equally rebellious and unreasonable I guess you ve never had the gout he said grimly But Charley old man I pleaded all that you d have to do would be to let him talk to you I don t ask you to suffer for it Just pay that s all pay my money I m awfully easily talked into things said Charley There was never such a mule on the Produce Exchange He d be saying Take this and I m the kind of blankety blank fool that would take it Then I did a mean thing I reminded Crossman of having backed some bills of his big bills too at a time when it was touch and go whether he d manage to keep his head above water Westoby he replied don t think that time has lessened my sense of that obligation I d cut off my right hand to do you a good turn But for heaven s sake don t ask me to monkey with my gout The best I could get out of him was the promise of an anemic servant girl Nevill generously threw in a groom with varicose veins Small contributions but thankfully received Now what you do said Nevill is to go round right off and interview Bishop Jordan He has sick people to burn But I said Jones would get on to it if I deluged him with the misery of the slums That s just where the bishop comes in said Nevill There isn t a man more in touch with the saddest kind of poverty in New York the decent clean shrinking poverty that hides away from all the dead head coffee and doughnuts If I was in your fix I d fall over myself to reach Jordan Yes you try Jordan said Charley who I m sure had never heard of him before Then it s me for Jordan said I I went down stairs and told one of the bell boys to look up the address in the telephone book It seemed to me he looked pale that boy Aren t you well Dan I said I don t know what s the matter with me sir I guess it must be the night work I gave him a five dollar bill and made him write down eighteen ninety two Eighth Avenue on a piece of paper You go and see Doctor Jones first thing I said And don t mention my name nor spend the money on Her Mad Marriage I jumped into a hansom with a pleasant sense that I was beginning to make the fur fly That s a horrible cold of yours Cabby I said as we stopped at the bishop s door and I handed him up a dollar bill That s just the kind of a cold that makes graveyards hum I can t shake it off sir he said despondently Try what I can and it s never no use There s one doctor in the world who can cure anything I said Doctor Henry Jones eighteen ninety two Eighth Avenue I was worse than you two weeks ago and now look at me Take this five dollars and for heaven s sake man put yourself in his hands quick Bishop Jordan was a fine type of modern clergyman He was broad shouldered mentally as well as physically and he brought to philanthropic work the thoroughness care enthusiasm and capacity that would have earned him a fortune in business Bishop I said I ve come to see if I can t make a trade with you He raised his grizzled eyebrows and gave me a very searching look A trade he repeated in a holding back kind of tone as though wondering what the trap was Here s a check for one thousand dollars drawn to your order I went on And here s the address of Doctor Henry Jones eighteen ninety two Eighth Avenue I want this money to reach him via your sick people and that without my name being known or at all suspected May I not ask the meaning of so peculiar a request He s hard up I said and I want to help him It occurred to me that I might make you er a confederate in my little game you know His eyes twinkled as he slowly folded up my check and put it in his pocket I don t want any economy about it Bishop I went on I don t want to make the best use of it or anything of that kind I want to slap it into Doctor Jones till and slap it in quick Would you consider two weeks Oh one please It is understood of course that this young man is a duly qualified and capable physician and that in the event of my finding it otherwise I shall be at liberty to direct your check to other uses Oh I can answer for his being all right Bishop He s thoroughly up to date you know does the X ray act and keeps the pace of modern science You say you can answer for him said the bishop genially Might I inquire who you are I m named Westoby Ezra Westoby managing partner of Hodge Westoby boxers I like boxers said the bishop in the tone of a benediction rising to dismiss me I like one thousand dollar checks too When you have any more to spare just give them a fair wind in this direction I went out feeling that the Episcopal Church had risen fifty per cent in my esteem Bishops like that would make a success of any denomination I like to see a fellow who s on to his job I gave Jones a week to grapple with the new developments and then happened along The anteroom was full and there was a queue down the street like a line of music loving citizens waiting to hear Patti Nice decent looking people with money in their hands I always like to see a cash business don t you I guess it took me an hour to crowd my way up stairs and even then I had to buy a man out of the line Jones was carrying off the boom more quietly than I cared about He wore a curt snappy air I don t know why but I felt misgivings as I shook hands with him Of course I commented on the rush The Lord only knows what s happened to my practice he said The blamed thing has gone up like a rocket It seems to me there must be a great wave of sickness passing over New York just now Everybody s complaining I said This reminded him of my insomnia till I cut him short What s the matter with our going down to the Van Coorts from Saturday to Tuesday I said They haven t given up the hope of seeing you there Doctor and the thing s still open Then I waited for him to jump with joy He didn t jump a bit He shook his head He distinctly said No I told you it was the money side of it that bothered me he explained So it was at the time for of course I couldn t foresee that my practice was going to fill the street and call for policemen to keep order But my dear Westoby after giving the subject a great deal of consideration I have come to the conclusion that it would be too painful for me to revive those those unhappy emotions I was just beginning to recover from I thought you loved her I exclaimed That s why I ve determined not to go he said I have outlived one refusal How do I know I have the strength the determination the hardihood to undergo the agonies of another It seemed a feeble remark to say that faint heart never won fair lady I growled it out more like a swear than anything else I was disgusted with the chump She s the star above me he said and I am crushed by my own presumption Is there any such fool as the man that breaks his heart twice for the impossible But it isn t impossible I cried Hasn t she as far as a woman can hasn t she called you back to her What more do you expect her to do A woman s delicacy forbids her screaming for a man I think Eleanor has already gone a tremendous way in just hinting You may be right he said pathetically but then you may also be wrong The risk is too terrible for me to run It will comfort me all my life to think that perhaps she does love me in secret Do you mean to say you re going to give it all up I roared You needn t get so warm about it he returned After all I have some justification in thinking she doesn t care What on earth do you suppose she invited you for then Well it would be different he said if I had a note from her a flower some little tender reminder of those dear old dead days in the Pullman She s saving up all that for Morristown I said For the first time in our acquaintance Doctor Jones looked at me with suspicion His blue eyes clouded He was growing a little restive under my handling You seem to make the matter a very personal one he observed Well I love Freddy I explained It naturally brings your own case very close to me And then I am so positive that you love Eleanor and that Eleanor loves you Put yourself in my place Doctor Do you mean that you d do nothing to bring two such noble hearts together He seized my hand and wrung it effusively He really did love Eleanor you know The only fault with him was his being so darned humble about it He was eaten up with a sense of his own inferiority And yet I could see he was just tingling to go to Morristown Of course I crowded him all I could but the best I could accomplish was his promise to think it over I hated to leave him wabbling but patients were scuffling at the door and fighting on the stairs The next thing I did was to get Freddy on the long distance phone Freddy I said after explaining the situation you must get Eleanor to telegraph to him direct What s the good of asking what she won t do bubbled the sweet little voice Can t you persuade her I know she won t do it Then you must forge it I said desperately It needn t be anything red hot you know But something tender and sincere Shall be awfully disappointed if you don t come or There was a time when you would not have failed me It s impossible Then he won t budge a single inch I replied Ezra Darling Suppose I just signed the telegram Van Coort The very thing If he misunderstood it I mean if he thought it really came from Eleanor there couldn t be any fuss about it afterward could there And of course you ll send the official invitation from missus Matthewman besides For Saturday Yes Saturday And you ll come Just watch me Ezra are you happy That depends on Jones Oh isn t it exciting I have the ring in my pocket But touch wood won t you Freddy Yes What s the matter with getting some forget me nots and mailing them to Jones in an envelope All right I ll attend to it Eighteen ninety two Eighth Avenue isn t it Be sure it is forget me nots you know Don t mix up the language of flowers and send him one that says I m off with a handsomer man or You needn t come round any more Oh Ezra Eleanor is really getting quite worked up So am I Wouldn t it be perfectly splendid if Switch off quick here s aunt coming Mayn t I even say I love you I daren t say it back Ezra she s calling But do you Yes unfortunately Why unfortun Buzz buzz swizzleum bux bux Aunt had cut us off However short as my talk with Freddy had been it brightened my whole day Late the same afternoon I went back to Doctor Jones I was prepared to find him uplifted but I hadn t counted on his being maudlin The fellow was drunk positively drunk with happiness His tongue ran on like a mill stream I had to sit down and have the whole Pullman car episode inflicted on me a second time I was shown the receipt slip I was shown the telegram from Eleanor I was shown with a whoop the forget me nots Then he was going on Saturday I asked He said he guessed it would take an earthquake to keep him away and a pretty big earthquake too Oh it was a great moment and all the greater because I was tremendously worked up too I saw Freddy floating before me my sweet girlish darling Freddy holding out her arms while Jones gassed and gassed and gassed I left him taking phenacetin for his headache III The house party had grown a little larger than was originally intended On Saturday night we sat down twelve to dinner Doctor Jones and I shared a room together and I must say whatever misgivings I might have had about him wore away very quickly on closer acquaintance In the first place he looked well in evening dress carrying himself with a sort of shy kind air that became him immensely At table he developed the greatest of conversational gifts that of the appreciative and intelligent listener I heard one of the guests asking Eleanor who was that charming young man Freddy and I hugged each other I mean metaphorically of course and gloried in his success In the presence of an admirer such is the mystery of women Eleanor instantly got fifteen points better looking and you wouldn t have known her for the same girl Freddy thought it was the two hundred and fifty dollar gown she wore but I could see it was deeper than that She was thawing in the sunshine of love and I ll do Doctor Jones the justice to say that he didn t hide his affection under a bushel It was generous enough for everybody to bask in and in his pell mell ardor he took us all to his bosom The women loved him for it and entered into a tacit conspiracy to gain him the right of way to wherever Eleanor was to be found In fact he followed her about like a dog and she could scarcely move without stepping on him Sunday was even better One of the housemaids drank some wood alcohol by mistake for vichy water and the resulting uproar redounded to Jones coolness skill and despatch He dominated the situation and well I won t describe it this not being a medical work and the reader probably being a good guesser missus Matthewman remarked significantly that it must be nice to be the wife of a medical man one would always have the safe feeling of a doctor at hand in case anything happened at night Eleanor said it was a beautiful profession that had for its object the alleviation of human pain Freddy jealously tried to get in a good word for boxers but nobody would listen to her except me It was all Jones Jones Jones and the triumphs of modern medicine Altogether he sailed through that whole day with flying colors first with the housemaid and then afterward at church where he was the only one that knew what Sunday after Epiphany it was He made it plainer than ever that he was a model young man and a pattern missus Matthewman compared him to her departed husband and talked about old fashioned courtesy and the splendid men of her youth Everybody fell over everybody else to praise him It was a regular Jones boom People began to write down his address and ask him if he d be free Thursday or what about Friday and started to book seats in advance That evening as I was washing my hands before dinner and cheerfully whistling Hiawatha I became conscious that Jones was lolling back on a sofa at the dark end of the room What particularly arrested my attention was a groan preceded by a pack of heartrending sighs It worried me when everything seemed to be going so well He had every right to be whistling Hiawatha too What s the matter Jones said I He keeled over on the sofa and groaned louder than ever It isn t possible that she s refused you I exclaimed He muttered something about his mother Well what about your mother I said Westoby he returned I guess I was the worst kind of fool ever to put my foot into this house That was nice news wasn t it Just as I was settling in my head to buy that Seventy second Street place and alter the basement into a garage You see old man my mother would never consent to my marrying Eleanor I m in the position of having to choose between her and the woman I love And I owe so much to my mother Westoby She stinted herself for years to get me through college she hardly had enough to eat she Then he groaned a lot more I can t think that your mother a mother like yours Jones would consent to stand between you and your lifelong happiness It s morbid that s what I call it morbid just to dream of such a thing There s Bertha he quavered Great Scott and who s Bertha The girl my mother chose for me two years ago Bertha McNutt you know She d really prefer me not to marry at all but if I must it s Bertha Westoby Bertha or nothing It s too late to say that now old fellow It s not too late for me to go home this very night Well Jones I broke out I can t think you d do such a caddish thing as that Think it over for a minute You come down here you sweep that unfortunate girl off her feet you make love to her with the fury of a stage villain you force her to betray her very evident partiality for you and then you have the effrontery to say Good by I m off My mother he began You simply can not act so dishonorably Jones He sat silent for a little while My mother he started in again finally Surely your mother loves you I demanded That s the terrible part of it Westoby she Pooh She stinted herself to get me through colonel Then why did you ever come here That s just the question I m asking myself now I don t see that you have any right to assume all that about your mother anyway Eleanor Van Coort is a woman of a thousand unimpeachable social position a little fortune of her own accomplished handsome charming sought after why if you managed to win such a girl as that your mother would walk on air No she wouldn t Bertha You re a pretty cheap lover I said I don t set up to be a little tin hero but I d go through fire and water for my girl Good heavens love is love and all the mothers He let out a few more groans Then see here Jones I went on you owe some courtesy to our hostess If you went away to night it would be an insult Whatever you decide to do later you ve simply got to stay here till Tuesday morning Must I he said in the tone of a person who is ordered not to leave the sinking ship A gentleman has to I said He quavered out a sort of acquiescence and then asked me for the loan of a white tie I should have loved to give him a bowstring instead with somebody who knew how to operate it He was a fluff that fellow a tarnation fluff IV It was a pretty glum evening all round Most of them thought that Jones had got the chilly mitt Eleanor looked pale and undecided not knowing what to make of Jones death s head face She was resentful and pitying in turns and I saw all the material lying around for a first class conflagration Freddy was a bit down on me too saying that a smoother method would have ironed out Jones and that I had been headlong and silly She cried over it and wouldn t kiss me in the dark and I was goaded into saying well the course of true love ran in bumps that night There was only one redeeming circumstance and that was my managing to keep Jones and Eleanor apart I mean that I insisted on being number three till at last poor Eleanor said she had a headache and forlornly went up to bed Jones was still asleep when I got up the next morning at six and dressed myself quietly so as not to awake him It was now Monday and you can see for yourself there was no time to spare I gave the butler a dollar and ordered him to say that unexpected business had called me away without warning but that I should be back by luncheon I rather overdid the earliness of it all At least I hove off eighteen ninety two Eighth Avenue at eight fifteen A M I loitered about looked at pawnshop windows gave a careful examination to a forty eight dollar ninety eight cent complete outfit for a four room flat had a chat with a policeman assisted at a runaway advanced a nickel to a colored gentleman in distress had my shoes shined by another helped a child catch an escaped parrot and still it wasn t nine Idleness is a grinding occupation especially on Eighth Avenue in the morning missus Jones was a thin straight backed brisk old lady with a keen tongue and a Yankee faculty for coming to the point I besought her indulgence and laid the whole Eleanor matter before her at least as much of it as seemed wise I appeared in the role of her son s warmest admirer and best friend Surely you won t let Harry ruin his life from a mistaken sense of his duty to you Duty fiddlesticks said she He s going to marry Bertha McNutt But he doesn t want to marry Bertha McNutt Then he needn t marry anybody She seemed to think this a triumphant answer Indeed in some ways I must confess it was But still I persevered It puts me out to have him shilly shallying around like this she said I ll give him a good talking to when he gets back This other arrangement has been understood between missus McNutt and myself for years She was an irritating person I found it not a little difficult to keep my temper with her It s easier to fight dragons than to temporize with them and appeal to their better nature I appealed and appealed She watched me with the same air of interested detachment that one gives to a squirrel revolving in a cage I could feel that she was flattered her sense of power was agreeably tickled my earnestness and despair enhanced the zest of her reiterated refusals I was a very nice young man but her son was going to marry Bertha McNutt or marry nobody Then I tried to draw a lurid picture of his revolt from her apron strings Oh Harry s a good boy she said You can t make me believe that two days has altered his whole character I ll answer for his doing what I want I felt a precisely similar conviction and my heart sank into my shoes At this moment there was a tap at the door and another old lady bounced in She was stout jolly looking and effusive The greetings between the pair were warm and they were evidently old friends But underneath the new comer s gush and noise I was dimly conscious of a sort of gay hostility She was exultant and frightened both at once and her eyes were sparkling Well what do you think she cried out explosively missus Jones lips tightened There was a mean streak in that old woman I could see she was feeling for her little hatchet and was getting out her little gun Bertha exploded the old lady Bertha Mysterious mental processes at once informed me that this was none other than Bertha s mother missus Jones was coolly taking aim I was reminded of that old military dictum Don t shoot till you see the whites of their eyes Bertha vociferated the old lady fiercely Bertha has been secretly married to mister Stuffenhammer for the last three months Another series of kinematographic mental processes informed me that mister Stuffenhammer was an immense catch Twenty thousand dollars a year and her own carriage continued missus McNutt gloatingly You could have knocked me down with a feather Bertha is such a considerate child she insisted on marrying secretly so that she could tone it down by degrees to poor Harry though there was no engagement or anything like that she could not help feeling of course that she owed it to the dear boy to gradually missus Jones never turned a hair or moved a muscle You needn t pity Harry she said I ve just got the good news that he s engaged to one of the sweetest and richest girls in Morristown I jumped for my hat and ran V You never saw anybody so electrified as Jones For a good minute he couldn t even speak It was like bringing a horseback reprieve to the hero on the stage He repeated Stuffenhammer Stuffenhammer in tones that Henry Irving might have envied while I gently undid the noose around his neck I led him under a tree and told him to buck up He did so slowly and surely and then began to ask me agitated questions about proposing He deferred to me as though I had spent my whole life Bluebearding through the social system He wanted to be coached how to do it you know I told him to rip out the words any old words and then kiss her Don t let there be any embarrassing pause I said A girl hates pauses It seems a great liberty he returned It doesn t strike me as r r respectful You try it I said It s the only way I ll be glad when it s over he remarked dreamily Whatever you do keep clear of set speeches I went on Blurt it out no matter how badly but with all the fire and ginger in you He gazed at me like a dead calf Here goes he said and started on a trembling walk toward the house I don t know whether he was afraid or didn t get the chance or what it was but at any rate the afternoon wore on without the least sign of his coming to time I kept tab on him as well as I could checkers with Miss Drayton half an hour writing letters a long talk with the major and finally his getting lost altogether in the shrubbery with an old lady Freddy said the suspense was killing her and was terribly despondent and miserable I couldn t interest her in the Seventy second Street house at all She asked what was the good of working and worrying and figuring and making lists when in all probability it would be another girl that would live there She had an awfully mean opinion of my constancy and was intolerably philosophical and Oh I wouldn t blame you the least little bit if you did go off and marry somebody else She took a pathetic pleasure in loving me losing me and then weeping over the dear dead memory She said nobody ever got what they wanted anyway and might she come when she was old and ugly and faded and weary to take care of my children and be a sort of dear old aunty in the Seventy second Street house I said certainly not and we had a fight right away As we were dressing for dinner that night I took Jones to task and tried to stiffen him up I guess I must have mismanaged it somehow for he said he d thank me to keep my paws out of his affairs and then went into the bath room where he shaved and growled for ten whole minutes I itched to throw a bootjack at him but compromised on doing a little growling myself Afterward we got into our clothes in silence and as he went out first he slammed the door It was a disheartening evening We played progressive uchre for a silly prize and we all got shuffled up wrong and had to stay so Then the major did amateur conjuring till we nearly died I was thankful to sneak out of doors and smoke a cigar under the starlight I walked up and down consigning Jones to well where I thought he belonged I thought of the time I had wasted over the fellow the good money the hopes I was savage with disappointment and when I heard Freddy softly calling me from the veranda I zigzagged away through the trees toward the lodge gate There are moments when a man is better left alone Besides I was in one of those self tormenting humors when it is a positive pleasure to pile on the agony When you re eighty eight per cent miserable it s hell not to reach par I was sore all over and I wanted the balm the consolation to be found in the company of those cold old stars who had looked down in their time on such countless generations of human asses It gave me a wonderful sense of fellowship with the past and future I was reflecting on what an infinitesimal speck I was in the general scheme of things when I heard the footfall of another human speck stumbling through the dark and carrying a dress suit case It was Jones himself outward bound and doing five knots an hour I was after him in a second doing six Jones I cried He never even turned round I grabbed him by the arm He wasn t going to walk away from me like that Where are you going I demanded Home But say stop you can t do that It s too darned rude We don t break up till to morrow I m breaking up now he said But Let go my arm Oh but my dear chap I began Don t you dear chap me We strode on in silence Even his back looked sullen and his face under the gaslights Westoby he broke out suddenly if there s one thing I m sensitive about it is my name Slap me in the face turn the hose on me rip the coat off my back and you d be astounded by my mildness But when it comes to my name I I m a tiger A tiger I repeated encouragingly It all went swimmingly he continued in a tone of angry confidence For five seconds I was the happiest man in the United States I I did everything you said you know and I was dumfounded at my own success S s she loves me Westoby I gazed inquiringly at the dress suit case We don t belong to any common Joneses We re Connecticut Joneses In fact we re the only Joneses and the name is as dear to me as sacred as I suppose that of Westoby is perhaps to you And yet and yet do you know what she actually said to me Said to me holding my hand and and that the only thing she didn t like about me was my name I contrived to get out Good heavens with the proper astonishment I told her that Van Coort didn t strike me as being anything very extra Wouldn t it have been wiser to Oh for myself I d do anything in the world for her But a fellow has to show a little decent pride A fellow owes something to his family doesn t he As a man I love the ground she walks on as a Jones well if she feels like that about it I told her she had better wait for a De Montmorency But she didn t say she wouldn t marry you did she N o o o She didn t ask you to change your name did she N o o o And do you mean to say that just for one unfortunate remark a remark that any one might have made in the agitation of the moment you re deliberately turning your back on her and her broken heart Oh she s red hot too you know over what I said about the Van Coorts She couldn t have realized that you belonged to the Connecticut Joneses I didn t know it I Well it s all off now he said It was a mile to the depot For Jones it was a mile of reproaches scoldings lectures and insults For myself I shall ever remember it as the mile of my life I pleaded argued extenuated and explained My lifelong happiness Freddy the Seventy second Street house were walking away from me in the dark while I jerked unavailingly at Jones coat tails The whole outfit disappeared into a car leaving me on the platform with the ashes of my hopes Of all obstinate mulish pig headed copper riveted I was lucky enough to find Eleanor crying softly to herself in a corner of the veranda The sight of her tears revived my fainting courage I thought of Bruce and the spider and waded in Eleanor I said I ve just been seeing poor Jones off She sobbed out something to the effect that she didn t care No you can t care very much I said or you wouldn t send a man like that a splendid fellow a member of one of the oldest and proudest families of Connecticut to his death Death Well he s off for Japan to morrow They re getting through fifty doctors a week out there at the front They re shot down faster than they can set them up I was unprepared for the effect of this on Eleanor For two cents she would have fainted then and there It s awful to hear a woman moan and clench her teeth and pant for breath Oh Eleanor can t you do anything I am helpless Ezra My pride my woman s pride Oh how can you let such trifles stand between you Think of him out there in his tattered Japanese uniform so far from home so lonely so heartbroken standing undaunted in that rain of steel while Oh Ezra stop I can t bear it I can t bear it Is the love of three years to be thrown aside like an old glove just because Her face was so wild and strained that the lies froze upon my tongue Oh Ezra I could follow him barefooted through the snow if only he He s leaving Grand Central to morrow at ten forty five I said She fumbled at her neck and almost tore away the diamond locket that reposed there Take him this she whispered hoarsely Take it to him at once and say I sent it Say that I beg him to return that my pride crumbles at the thought of his going away so far into danger I put the locket carefully into my pocket And Eleanor try and don t rub him the wrong way about his name Is it worth while There have to be Joneses you know Tell him she burst out tell him oh I never meant to wound him truly I didn t a name that s good enough for him is good enough for me The next morning at nine I pulled up my Porcher Mufflin car before Jones door He was sitting at his table reading a book and he made no motion to rise as I came in He gave me a pale expressionless stare instead such as an ancient Christian might have worn when the call boy told him the lions were ready in the Colosseum Resignation obstinacy and defiance all nicely blended under a turn the other cheek exterior He looked woebegone and his thin handsome face betrayed a sleepless night and a breakfastless morning I could feel that my presence was the last straw to this unfortunate medical camel I threw in a genial remark about the weather and took a seat Jones hunched himself together and squirmed a sad little squirm mister Westoby he said I once made use of a very strong expression in regard to you I said if you remember that I d be obliged if you d keep your paws Don t apologize I interrupted I forgot it long ago You ve taken me up wrong he continued drearily I should like you to consider the remark repeated now Yes sir repeated Oh bosh I exclaimed You have a very tough epidermis he went on Quite the toughest epidermis I have met with in my whole professional career A paper adequately treating your epidermis would make a sensation before any medical society Somehow I couldn t feel properly insulted The whole business struck me as irresistibly comical I lay back in my chair my uninvited chair and roared with laughter I couldn t forbear asking him what treatment he d recommend He pointed to the door and said laconically Fresh air I retorted by laying the diamond locket before him My dear fellow I said as he gazed at it transfixed don t let us go on like a pair of fools Eleanor charged me to give you this and beg you to return I don t believe he heard me at all That flashing trinket was far more eloquent than any words of mine He laid his head in his hands beside it and his whole body trembled with emotion He trembled and trembled till finally I got tired of waiting I poked him in the back and reminded him that my car was waiting down stairs He rose with a strange bewildered air and submitted like a child to be led into the street He had the locket clenched in his hand and every now and then he would glance at it as though unable to believe his eyes I shut him into the tonneau and took a seat beside my chauffeur Let her out James I said James let her out with a vengeance There was a sunny haired housemaid at the Van Coorts and it was a crack new four cylinder car with a direct drive on the top speed Off we went like the wind jouncing poor Jones around the tonneau like a pea in a pill box But he didn t care Was he not seraphically whizzing through space obeying the diamond telegram of love In the gentle whizzle and bang of the whole performance he even ventured to raise his voice in song and I could overhear him behind me adding a lyrical finish to the hum of the machinery It was a walloping run and we only throttled down on the outskirts of Morristown You see I had to coach him about that Japanese war business or else there might be trouble So I leaned over the back seat and gently broke it to him I thought I had managed it rather well I felt sure he could understand I said the absolute need of a little embellishing and Let me out he said I feverishly went on explaining If you don t let me out I ll climb out he said and began to make as good as his word over the tonneau Of course there was nothing for it but to stop the car Jones deliberately descended and headed for New York I ran after him while the chauffeur turned the car round and slowly followed us both It was a queer procession First Jones then I then the car Finally I overtook him Jones I panted Jones He muttered something about Ananias and speeded up But it was an awfully tight place I pleaded Something had to be done you must make allowances it was the first thing that came into my head and you must admit that it worked Jones Didn t she send you the locket Didn t she What a prancing show off matinee fool you ve made me look he burst out I have an old mother to support I have an increasing practice I have already attracted some little attention in my chosen field eye ear and throat A nice figure I d cut traipsing around the battlefields in a kimono and looking for a kindly bullet to lay me low If I were ever tempted by such a thing which God forbid wouldn t I prefer to spread bacilli on buttered toast I never thought of that I said humbly I have known retail liars he went on But I guess you are the only wholesaler in the business When other people are content with ones and twos you get them out in grosses packed for export He went on slamming me like this for miles Anybody else would have given him up as hopeless I don t want to praise myself but if I have one good quality it s staying power I pleaded and argued and expostulated and explained with the determination of a man whose back is to the wall I wasn t going to lose Freddy so long as there was breath in my body However it wasn t the least good in the world Jones was as impervious as sole leather and as unshaken as a marble pillar Then I played my last card I told him the truth Not the whole truth of course but within ten per cent of it About Freddy you know and how she was determined not to marry before her elder sister and how Eleanor s only preference seemed to be for him and how with such a slender clue to work on I had engineered everything up to this point If I have seemed to you intolerably prying and officious I said well at any rate Jones there s my excuse It rests with you to give me Freddy or take her from me Turn back and you ll make me the happiest man alive go forward and and I watched him out of the corner of my eye His tread lost some of its elasticity He was short circuiting inside Positively he began to look sort of sympathetic and human Westoby he said at last in a voice almost of awe when they get up another world s fair you must have a building to yourself You re colossal that s what you are I m only in love I said Well that s the love that moves mountains he said If anybody had told me that I should He stopped irresolutely on the word Oh to think I have to stand for all that rot he bleated I was too wise to say a word I simply motioned James to switch the car around and back up I shooed Jones into the tonneau and turned the knob on him He snuggled back in the cushions and smiled yes smiled with a beautiful blue eyed far away indulgent expression that warmed me like spring sunshine Not that I felt absolutely safe even yet of course I couldn t but still We ran into Freddy and Eleanor at the lodge gates I had already telephoned the former to expect us so as to have everything fall out naturally when the time came We stopped the car and descended Jones and I and he walked straight off with Eleanor while I side stepped with Freddy She and I were almost too excited to talk It was now or never you know and there was an awfully solemn look about both their backs that was either reassuring or alarming we couldn t decide quite which Freddy and I simply held our breath and waited Finally after an age Jones and Eleanor turned still close in talk still solemn and enigmatical and drew toward us very slowly and deliberately When they had got quite close and the tension was at the breaking point Eleanor suddenly made a little rush and with a loud sob threw her arms round Freddy s neck Jones fidgeted nervously about and seemed to quail under my questioning eyes It was impossible to tell whether things had gone right or not I waited for him to speak I saw words forming themselves hesitatingly on his lips he bent toward me quite confidentially Say old man he whispered is there any place around here where a fellow can buy an engagement ring THE

at that peaceful village which for mo than a hundred years has enjoyed the privileges of free government and not only Caartersville but all our section of the State Well what s the matter with Cartersville asked Fitz lighting his cigar Mattah suh Just look at the degradation it fell into hardly ten years ago A Yankee jedge jurisdiction our laws a Yankee sheriff enfo cin em and a Yankee postmaster distributin letters and sellin postage stamps But they were elected all right Colonel and represented the will of the people What people Yo people not mine No my dear Fitz the Administration succeeding the war treated us shamefully and will go down to postehity as infamous The colonel here left his chair and began pacing the floor his indignation rising at every step To give you an idea suh he continued of what we Southern people suffe d immediately after the fall of the Confederacy let me state a case that came under my own observation Coloner Temple Talcott of F okeer County Virginia came into Talcottville one mornin suh a town settled by his ancestors ridin upon his horse or rather a mule belongin to his overseer Colonel Talcott suh belonged to one of the vehy fust families in Virginia He was a son of Jedge Thaxton Talcott and grandson of General Snowden Stafford Talcott of the Revolutionary War Now suh let me tell you right here that the Talcott blood is as blue as the sky and that every gentleman bearin the name is known all over the county as a man whose honor is dearer to him than his life and whose word is as good as his bond Well suh on this mornin Colonel Talcott left his plantation in charge of his overseer he was workin it on shares and rode through his estate to his ancestral town some five miles distant It is true suh these estates were no longer in his name but that had no bearin on the events that followed he ought to have owned them and would have done so but for some vehy ungentlemanly fo closure proceedin s which occurred immediately after the war On arriving at Talcottville the colonel dismounted handed the reins to his servant or perhaps one of the niggers around de do and entered the post office Now suh let me tell you that one month befo the Government contrary to the express wishes of a great many of our leadin citizens had sent a Yankee postmaster to Talcottville to administer the postal affairs of the town No sooner had this man taken possession than he began to be exclusive suh and to put on airs The vehy fust air he put on was to build a fence in his office and compel our people to transact their business through a hole This in itself was vehy gallin suh for up to that time the mail had always been dumped out on the table in the stage office and every gentleman had he ped himself The next thing was the closin of his mail bags at a hour fixed by himself This became a great inconvenience to our citizens who were often late in finishin their correspondence and who had always found our former postmaster willin either to hold the bag over until the next day or to send it across to Drummondtown by a boy to catch a later train Well suh Colonel Talcott s mission to the post office was to mail a letter to his factor in Richmond Virginia on business of the utmost importance to himself namely the raisin of a small loan upon his share of the crop Not the crop that was planted suh but the crop that he expected to plant Colonel Talcott approached the hole and with that Chesterfieldian manner which has distinguished the Talcotts for mo than two centuries asked the postmaster for the loan of a three cent postage stamp To his astonishment suh he was refused Think of a Talcott in his own county town bein refused a three cent postage stamp by a low lived Yankee who had never known a gentleman in his life The colonel s first impulse was to haul the scoundrel through the hole and caarve him but then he remembered that he was a Talcott and could not demean himself and drawin himself up again with that manner which was grace itself he requested the loan of a three cent postage stamp until he should communicate with his factor in Richmond Virginia and again he was refused Well suh what was there left for a high toned Southern gentleman to do Colonel Talcott drew his revolver and shot that Yankee scoundrel through the heart and killed him on the spot And now suh comes the most remarkable part of the story If it had not been for Major Tom Yancey Jedge Kerfoot and myself there would have been a lawsuit Fitz lay back in his chair and roared And they did not hang the colonel Hang a Talcott No suh we don t hang gentlemen down our way Jedge Kerfoot vehy properly charged the coroner s jury that it was a matter of self defense and Colonel Talcott was not detained mo than haalf an hour The colonel stopped unlocked a closet in the sideboard and produced a black bottle labeled in ink Old Cherry Bounce eighteen forty eight You must excuse me gentlemen but the discussion of these topics has quite unnerved me Allow me to share with you a thimbleful Fitz drained the glass cast his eyes upward and said solemnly To the repose of the postmaster s soul LOVE SONNETS OF AN OFFICE BOY BY S E KISER I Oh if you only knowed how much I like To stand here when the old man ain t around And watch your soft white fingers while you pound Away at them there keys Each time you strike It almost seems to me as though you d found So me way while writin letters how to play Sweet music on that thing because the sound Is something I could listen to all day You re twenty five or six and I m fourteen And you don t hardly ever notice me But when you do you call me Willie Gee I wisht I d bundles of the old long green And could be twenty eight or nine or so And something happened to your other beau VI When you re typewritin and that long legged clerk Tips back there on his chair and smiles at you And you look up and get to smilin too I d like to go and give his chair a jerk And send him flyin till his head went through The door that goes out to the hall and when They picked him up he d be all black and blue And you d be nearly busted laughin then But if I done it maybe you would run And hold his head and smooth his hair and say It made you sad that he got dumped that way And I d get h isted out for what I done I wish that he d get fired and you d stay And suddenly I d be a man some day VIII This morning when that homely long legged clerk Come in he had a rose he got somewhere He went and kind of leaned against her chair Instead of goin on about his work And stood around and talked to her a while Because the boss was out and both took care To watch the door and when he left her there He dropped the flower with a sickish smile I snuck it from the glass of water she Had stuck it in and tore it up and put It on the floor and smashed it with my foot When neither him nor her was watchin me I d like to rub the stem acrost his nose And I wish they d never be another rose XIII Last night I dreamed about her in my sleep I thought that her and me had went away Out on some hill where birds sung round all day And I had got a job of herdin sheep I thought that she had went along to keep Me comp ny and we d set around for hours Just lovin and I d go and gather flowers And pile them at her feet all in a heap It seemed to me like heaven bein there With only her besides the sheep and birds And us not sayin anything but words About the way we loved I wouldn t care To ever wake again if I could still Dream we was there forever on the hill XXVII It s over now the blow has fell at last It seems as though the sun can t shine no more And nothing looks the way it did before The glad thoughts that I used to think are past Her desk s shut up to day the lid s locked fast The keys where she typewrote are still her chair Looks sad and lonesome standin empty there I d like to let the tears come if I dast This morning when the boss come in he found A letter that he d got from her and so He read it over twice and turned around And said The little fool s got married Oh It seemed as if I d sink down through the ground And never peep no more I didn t though

THE FAIRPORT ART MUSEUM BY OCTAVE THANET After the war was over the Middle West addressed itself to Culture Perhaps the husbands and brothers and fathers might still be busy making money but the women of the West whose energies and emotions had been mightily roused found life a little tame when there were no more sanitary commissions no more great fairs or little fairs for the soldiers no more intense emotions over printed sheets Then it was that the Woman s Club lifted a modest finger at the passing car of progress and unobtrusively boarded it Fairport was conservative as always but she had no mind to be left behind in the march of feminine fashion She did not rush to extremes but she had women s clubs in eighteen eighty one The chief of these were the Ladies Literary Club and the Spinsters Alliance Both clubs tackled the same great themes of ethics and art and allotted a winter to the literature of a nation except in the case of Greek and Roman literatures which were not considered able to occupy a whole winter apiece so they were studied in company The club possessed a proper complement of officers and their meetings went from house to house They were conducted with artless simplicity in a pleasant conversational manner but with due regard to polite forms and only at a moment of excitement was the chair addressed by her Christian name Naturally the women s clubs were deeply stirred by the first great World s Fair in America But the whole West was moved It turned to art with a joyous ardor the excited happiness of a child that finds a new beauty in the world Why had we not thought of the artistic regeneration of our sordid life before Never mind we would make amends for lost time by spending more money In very truth the years following the Centennial witnessed an extraordinary awakening of worship of beauty almost religious in its fervor Passionate pilgrims ransacked Europe and the Orient a prodigal horde of their captives objects of luxury and of art surged into galleries and museums and households No cold critical taste weeded out these adorable aliens The worst and the best conquered together Our architecture our furniture our household surroundings were metamorphosed as by enchantment And the feature of mark in it all was the unparalleled diffusion of the new faith Not the great cities only the towns the villages the hamlets caught fire Of course Fairport went to Philadelphia and Fairport was converted It followed at once that the women s clubs of the place should serve most zealously at the altar and nothing could be more inevitable than that in course of time there should be a concrete manifestation of zeal Hence the memorable Art Museum the fame of which to this day will revive when there is a meeting of the solid and gray haired matrons who were the light footed girls of the Alliance and the talk falls on the old times The art collection would give its admirers shivers to day but it excited only happy complacency then The mood of the hour was not critical The homes of the Fairport gentry held innumerable oil copies of the great masters of different degrees of merit which they loaned secure of welcome with them came family treasures so long held in reverence that their artistic value coldly considered had been lost to comparison and the gems of accomplished amateurs who painted flowers on china cups or of rising young artists who had not as yet risen beyond the circle of trusting friends in town In general the donors expectation of gratitude was justified but even so early as eighteen eighty one there were limits to artistic credulity and some offerings drove the club president Miss Claudia Loraine and the club secretary Miss Emma Hopkins to the coal hold This was a wee closet under the stairs where the coal scuttles were ranged until they should fare forth to replenish the base burners which warmed the Museum home In real life the name of the Museum s lodgings was Harness Block and mister Harness had proffered the cause of art two empty stores formerly a fish market and a grocery As there was no private office only a wire cage when Miss Hopkins felt the need of frank speech she signaled Claudia to the coal hole She was closeted with her thus on the morning of the second day The subject of the conference was the last assault on the nerves of the committee perpetrated by the Miller twins not in person but with their china The china itself had the outward semblance of ordinary blue earthen ware of a cheap grade but the Miller twins were convinced on the testimony of their dear old minister who never told a lie in his life and who had heard the Millers grandmother say and everybody knows that she was a saint on earth and she was ninety years old at the time and would she be likely to lie almost on her dying bed you might call it her dying bed averred Miss Miller since she was bedridden for two years before her death on that same old four poster bedstead which belonged to her mother and at last died on it that the blue ware had been the property of George the Third had been sold and was on board the ship with the tea which was rifled in Boston Harbor They had insisted in pasting these royal claims upon the china in the blackest and neatest lettering The awkward fact that earthenware does not usually grace a royal board or that the saintly old grandmother mixed up dates and persons in a wonderful way during her latter days made no difference to her loyal descendants Each platter with the black chipping betraying plainly its lowly origin each tea cup mended with cement bore the paper claim pasted securely upon it It took up a whole afternoon said Miss Tina Miller but it s so precious and there might be other blue ware and it might get mixed you ll insure it Miss Hopkins not that money could replace such things but at least Miss Tina Miller always left her sentences in the air seemingly too diffident to complete them once the auditors were assured of their import The Millers kept a tiny little house on a tiny little income but gave of all they had to give themselves without stint They were public spirited women if Fairport ever held any such Although they had neither brothers nor cousins to go to the war they had picked lint and made bandages and trudged with subscription papers and scrimped for weeks to have money to spend at the patriotic fairs In consequence they were deeply respected so respected that it was simply impossible to refuse their unselfish offering of their dearest god I think it just noble of you said Miss Tina Sister and I felt we must help so we brought the King George china and a little pencil head our sister Euphrosyne did The one who died you know I m sorry all your art things aren t in yet No I can t come to morrow I shall be very busy sister may come thank you Both the keen young listeners knew why Miss Tina could not come it was neither more nor less than the admission fee But I ll take care of that said Emma to Claudia in the coal hold Elly is going to give her and Miss Ally each a season ticket Then we re in for the King George china groaned Claudia softly We are said Emma I ve put it in a good but not too good a place and mister Winslow is inspecting it now And he knows about china he s sent lovely things mourned Claudia Oh well he knows about the Miller girls too said Emma smiling I think he ll forgive us You d better go explain urged Claudia and throw in that landscape with the cow that seems to have five legs and belongs to mister Harness Perhaps he ll forgive that too Emma went she was an amiable girl She was not pretty like her sister missus Raimund who had married the great railway man and was a power in Chicago society but there was something in the radiant neatness and good humor of the plain sister which made her pleasant to look upon Winslow s mouth and eyes relaxed at her greeting and he smiled over her official quotation of the Millers claims King George s table H mn which table second or third His eyes twinkled at Emma whose own eyes twinkled back They re awfully good women said she in a kind of compunction None better said he As he passed on with his little son at his side she thought He isn t nearly so grim as I used to think missus Winslow and missus Winter were a few paces behind They halted before the china which missus Winter examined but missus Winslow s weary eyes lingered hardly a moment before they found some other object on which to rest and leave as briefly It is to be hoped this priceless relic won t be damaged in any way said missus Winter Still she bent confidentially toward Emma if such a calamity should occur I know a shop in Chicago where you can get plenty for three dollars and ninety nine cents I hope nothing will happen to it said Emma with stolid reticence missus Winslow had not listened her listless face had been transformed it was illumined now by the loveliest of smiles she half put out her hand as a little boy snuggled up to her silken skirts with a laugh Papa letted me come he said gaily and Peggy s here too there Peggy was attired with great care her long red curls were shining and her eyes sparkled Immediately both children were immersed in the beauties of a collection of rejected models which had been obtained from the patent office and which surely were the most diverting toys imaginable Poor things to them they are most valuable sighed missus Winslow She was making conversation about the Miller china but Johnny Ivan and Peggy not unreasonably conceived that she spoke of the beautiful churns and hayraking wagons and cars and wheeled chairs and the like marvels which Miss Hopkins was amiably explaining for them The least chip would be irreparable I suppose continued missus Winter thousands couldn t pay if one were broken Imagine the feelings of the custodian said Emma I m in a tremble all the time I pity you said missus Winter as the two ladies passed on to missus Winter s great grandmother s blue and white embroidered bedspread Oh Peggy do be careful whispered Johnny Ivan Peggy was sending a velocipede in dizzy circles round the counter Now fate had ordered that at this critical instant the children should be unguarded Miss Hopkins had stepped aside at the call of an agitated lady who had lost one of her art treasures in carriage for the moment there was no one near save a freckled boy in shabby overalls who eyed the toys wistfully from afar He was the same little boy whom Johnny Ivan had bribed with a jack knife to close the gate a few weeks before and he was in the Museum to help his mother the scrub woman of the store Peggy grew more pleased with her play The velocipede described wider and wider gyrations with accelerating speed its keen buzz swelled on the air It ll hit somepin warned Johnny Ivan in an access of fear But Peggy s soul was dauntless to recklessness No it won t she flung back Her shining head was between Johnny and the whirling wheels He thought a most particularly beautiful little swinging gate in peril and tried to swerve the flying thing how it happened neither of the children knew there was a smash a crash and gate and velocipede lay in splinters under a bronze bust The glass of the show case was etched with a sinister gray line Now look what you ve done exclaimed Peggy with the natural irritation of disaster Oh my squeaked the shabby little boy won t you catch it Peggy s anger was swallowed up in fright and sympathy she pushed Johnny Ivan ahead of her That Miss Hopkins is looking cried she get behind these folks down the aisle She propelled the little boy out of the immediate neighborhood of the calamity she forced a wicked deceitful smile alas guile comes easy to her sex and pointed out things to him whispering Look pleasant Don t be so scared They ll never know we did it Already she was shouldering her share in crime with a woman s willingness she said we quite unconsciously but she added and this was of direct volition I did it more n you you were just trying to keep the nasty thing straight I was a heap more to blame Anyhow I guess it ain t so awful bad Just those wooden things Johnny Ivan shook a tragic head even his lips had gone bluish white She said thousands wouldn t repair the damage moaned he You can t make me believe those mean little wooden tricks are worth any thousand dollars volleyed Peggy nevertheless her heart beat faster grown people are so queer Are you sure she meant them Maybe it was those things in the next glass case they re her own things They re some kind of Chinese china and cost a heap Peggy s sturdy womanly wits were rising from the shock And the show case is broked sniffed Johnny Ivan gulping down a sob It ain t broke it s only cracked sides it was cracked a right smart befo But this was a new place I know cause I cut my finger on the other scraping it over Well anyhow I reckon it didn t be much value Peggy insisted I saw that young lady come back Johnny Ivan had switched on to a new track leading to grisly possibilities maybe she ll find it Well we re gone all right Peggy gave an unprincipled giggle Maybe she ll think it was him Then we got to tell moaned Johnny No we ain t He ll run off and so she won t ask him questions But she ll think it s him It ll be mean No it won t It s mean to have somebody else take your blame or your punishment mamma said so The small casuist was too discreet to attack Johnny s oracle she only pouted her pretty lips and quibbled Tain t mean if the people who get blamed are mean themselves like him I don t care how blamed he gets I wouldn t care if he got licked But Johnny s conscience was not so elastic I don t care either he protested I I wouldn t care if he was deaded anxious to propitiate but it would be mean just the same I got to tell papa Peggy I truly have Peggy grew very cross You are just the foolest obsternatest little boy I ever did see she grumbled you re a plumb idiot I d like to slap you Your papa ll be awful mad Johnny Ivan essayed an indifferent mien but his eyes were miserable Say Jo nivan her voice sank to a whisper that curdled his blood were you ever spanked Only Hilma sorter kinder not really spanking you know confessed Johnny with a toss of his head I just made faces at her I didn t cry he bragged Never your mamma or your papa Course not said Johnny with a haughty air but Peggy he said very low were you did Oh my yes Mammy did when I was little I m too big now I m too big too now ain t I I don t know said Peggy Wulf Greiner was licked by teacher and he s thirteen It s whether it s mighty bad you know Johnny Ivan caught his breath and his legs shook under him the horror of his father s licking him came over him cold it was not the pain he had never minded Hilma s sturdy blows and he had let Michael cut a splinter out of his thumb with a pocket knife and never whimpered it was the ignominy the unknown terror of his father s wrath that looked awful to him As he looked down the crowded room and suddenly beheld Winslow s face bent gravely over Miss Hopkins who was talking earnestly he could hardly move his feet Yet he had no thought of wavering I got to tell he said and walked as fast as he could with his white face straight to the group Winslow looked down and saw the two children and one could discover the signals of calamity in their faces Peggy s a fine scarlet and Johnny Ivan s grayish white What s the matter Johnny asked Winslow Johnny s eyelids were glued tight just as they were when he pulled Peggy s tooth he blurted everything out breathlessly I ve done something awful papa It ll cost thousands of dollars Emma Hopkins had considered Winslow an unattractive man of a harsh visage but now as he looked at his little son she changed her mind What did you do son said he quietly his hand found Johnny s brown curls and lay on them a second He didn t do it really it was me Peggy broke in too agitated for grammar I was playing with the little tricks on the table the models sah and I was making the v losipid run round and he was fraid I d break it but I did it really sah And the model fell on to something valuable I see But he wasn t playing with it he was only trying to keep me from breaking Well young lady you two are evidently in the same boat but you aren t a bit sneaky either of you Let s see the wreckage I suppose you got into trouble because you wanted to see how things worked and Johnny as usual couldn t keep out of other folks hot water Where s the ruin The show case is broked too said Johnny Ivan in a woeful small voice But it was cracked before interjected Peggy Winslow looked at her with a little twist That s a comfort said he and you have horse sense my little Southerner I guess you didn t either of you mean any harm Indeed no sah and Johnny was just as good never touched a thing But you see your intentions didn t protect you Distrust good intentions my dears look out for the possible consequences However I think there is one person to blame you haven t mentioned and that is one Josiah C Winslow who let two such giddy young persons explore by themselves Contributory negligence is proved and said Winslow will pay the bill and not kick So saying he took Peggy s warm chubby little fingers in one of his big white hands and Johnny Ivan s cold little palm in the other and nodded a farewell to Emma THE BALLAD OF GRIZZLY GULCH one BY WALLACE IRWIN The rocks are rough the trail is tough The forest lies before As madly madly to the

HARTE I reside at Table Mountain and my name is Truthful James I am not up to small deceit or any sinful games And I ll tell in simple language what I know about the row That broke up our society upon the Stanislow But first I would remark that it is not a proper plan For any scientific man to whale his fellow man And if a member don t agree with his peculiar whim To lay for that same member for to put a head on him Now nothing could be finer or more beautiful to see Than the first six months proceedings of that same society Till Brown of Calaveras brought a lot of fossil bones That he found within a tunnel near the tenement of Jones Then Brown he read a paper and he reconstructed there From those same bones an animal that was extremely rare And Jones then asked the Chair for a suspension of the rules Till he could prove that those same bones was one of his lost mules Then Brown he smiled a bitter smile and said he was at fault It seemed he had been trespassing on Jones s family vault He was a most sarcastic man this quiet mister Brown And on several occasions he had cleaned out the town Now I hold it is not decent for a scientific gent To say another is an ass at least to all intent Nor should the individual who happens to be meant Reply by heaving rocks at him to any great extent Then Abner Dean of Angel s raised a point of order when A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen And he smiled a kind of sickly smile and curled up on the floor And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more For in less time than I write it every member did engage In a warfare with the remnants of a palaeozoic age And the way they heaved those fossils in their anger was a sin Till the skull of an old mammoth caved the head of Thompson in And this is all I have to say of these improper games For I live at Table Mountain and my name is Truthful James And I ve told in simple language what I know about the row That broke up our society upon the Stanislow LOST CHORDS BY EUGENE FIELD One autumn eve when soft the breeze Came sweeping through the lattice wide I sat me down at organ side And poured my soul upon the keys It was perhaps by heaven s design That from my half unconscious touch There swept a passing chord of such Sweet harmony it seemed divine In one soft tone it seemed to say The sweetest words I ever heard Then like a truant forest bird It soared from me to heaven away Last eve I sat at window whence I sought the spot where erst had stood A cord a cord of hick ry wood Piled up against the back yard fence Four dollars cost me it that day Four dollars earned by sweat of brow Where was the cord of hick ry now The thieves had gobbled it away Ah who can ever count the cost Of treasures which were once our own Yet now like childhood dreams

Lippincott s Magazine THE APOSTASY OF WILLIAM DODGE BY STANLEY WATERLOO Billy Dodge rose from a seat near the door and gave the two ladies chairs Kate looked at him and smiled The voice of the speaker seemed far away as she thought of the boy and his enthusiasms Of all the earnest and sincere converts in the Lakeside House none could compare with Master William Dodge the only son of the mistress of the place He might be only eleven years old he might be the most freckled boy in the block but he had received new light and he had his convictions He had listened and he had learned He had learned that if you hold a thought and carry it around with you on a piece of paper and read it from time to time throughout the day it will bring you strength and give you victory in all the affairs of life He thought the matter over much for he had great need He wanted help Of Master William Dodge known as Billy it may be said that in school he had ordinarily more fights on his hands than any other boy of his age and size and it may be said also that as a rule where the chances were anywhere near even he came out on top But doggedly brave as the little freckled villain was he had down in the bottom of his heart an appreciation that some day Jim McMasters might lick him Jim McMasters was a boy only some six months older than Billy of North of Ireland blood than which there is none better a lank scrawny reddish haired youngster freckled almost as profusely as Billy Three times had they met in noble battle and three times had Billy been the conqueror but somehow the spirit of young McMasters did not seem particularly broken nor did he become a serf Billy felt that the air was full of portent and he didn t like it It was just at this time that to Billy came the conviction that by holding the thought he would have what he called the bulge on Jim and having the energy of his convictions he promptly set to the work of getting up texts which he could carry around in his pocket and which would make him just invincible He talked cautiously with Mandy Make as to good watch words in no way revealing his designs and from her secured certain texts which she had herself unconsciously memorized from many hearings of Jowler preachers They were Fight the good fight Never give up He never fails who dies in a good cause Never say die For a time Billy was content with these quotations written in a school boy hand upon brown paper and carried in his left hand trousers pocket but later he discovered that most of the scientists in the house who held a thought themselves prepared their own little bit of manuscript to be carried and read during the day and that the text was made to apply to their special needs Billy after much meditation concluded this was the thing for him and with great travail he composed and wrote out the new texts which he should carry constantly and which should be his bulwark Here they are Ketch hold prompt and hang on Strike from the shoulder A kick for a blow always bestow When you get a good thing keep it keep it When you get a black cat skin it to the tail Only a week later one William Dodge and one Jim McMasters again met in more or less mortal combat and one William Dodge repeating the shorter of his texts as he fought was again the victor Gimme Christian Science he said to himself as he put on his coat after the fray was over Billy Dodge was fast drifting although unconsciously toward a crisis in his religious and worldly experiences At school during the last term and so far in the summer vacation his scheme of fortifying his physical powers with mental stimulants in the form of warlike thoughts had worked well His chief rival for the honors of war an energetic youngster whose name Jim McMasters proclaimed his Irish ancestry he had soundly thrashed more than once since adopting his new tactics So far Billy had found that to hold the thought Ketch hold prompt and hang on while he acted vigorously upon that stirring sentiment meant victory and he had more than once tried the efficacy of Strike from the shoulder under adverse conditions and with success It was during this summer of anxiety to the more important personages of this story that Billy Dodge was called upon to prove the practical value of his belief in the supremacy of mind over matter and although Billy emerged from the trial none the worse for his experience it effected a radical change in his views Jim McMasters returned one summer s day from a short camping excursion in the Michigan woods He had been the only boy in a party of young men and during their spare hours as the members of the fishing party were lying around camp they had instructed Jim in a few of the first principles of the noble science of self defense This unselfish action on the part of his elders was brought about by Jim s bitter complaints of Billy s treatment of himself in a fair fight and by his dire thirst for vengeance And so Jim McMasters came back to the city a dangerous opponent and he looked it Even Billy secure in the prestige of former victories and armed with hidden weapons namely the thoughts he so tenaciously held felt some misgivings when he saw Jim and noted his easy swaggering mien I ve got to lick him again thought Billy and I ve got to be good and ready for him this time I must get a set of thoughts well learned and hold em or I ll be lammed out of my life The youngsters met one day each with his following of admirers in a vacant lot not far from the Lakeside House There was a queer look in Jim s eye when he hailed Billy and there was instant response in language of a violent character from the young disciple of Christian Science As the two stood in a ring of boys each watching the other and alert to catch some advantage of beginning Billy was certainly the most unconcerned and he appeared to advantage He was occupied throughout every nerve and vein of his being first in holding the thought he had fixed upon for this special occasion and second by his plan of attack for Billy made it a point always to take the initiative in a fight As for Jim that active descendant of the Celts failed to exhibit that alarm and apprehension which should appertain to a young gentleman of his age when facing an antagonist who had whaled him repeatedly His face was neither sallow with long dread nor white with present fear before his former conqueror In fact it must be said of him that he capered about in a fashion not particularly graceful He rose upon the ends of his toes and made wild feints which Billy did not understand It was hard under such disquieting circumstances to hold a thought and Billy found himself struggling in mind for equilibrium while he stood forward to the attack He aimed a wild blow at his capering opponent and drove into soundless air only and before he could recover himself the capering opponent had landed on Billy s cheek in a most surprising but altogether unrefreshing manner The concussion made the cheek the color of an old fashioned peony and the jar caused the nose to bleed a little as the astonished Billy staggered back under the impact of a clenched fist Then the real fight began but Billy though he made a strong effort to rally was beaten and he knew or thought he knew why he was beaten It was holding the thought that done it he faltered as he fell after a quick stroke from Jim He lay quiet on the grass and his one wish was to die He fixed his mind resolutely upon this wish but failed to die at once indeed he felt every moment the reviving forces of life throbbing through his tough young body How could he look up and face his victorious foe He decided rather to continue his efforts to die and forthwith stiffened out into such rigidity as can be observed only in the bodies of those who have been dead forty eight hours This manoeuver frightened the lads around him See here said Johnny Flynn Billy s hurt bad an we ought to do something He looks dead whimpered little Davy Runnion the smallest boy present and he ran off to tell Jim McMasters who stood at ease at a short distance arranging his disordered dress The victor faltered as he looked upon Billy s stiffened limbs We must take him home he said ruefully Four boys lifted Billy two at his shoulders two at his feet In the center he sagged slightly despite his silent efforts to be rigidity itself The small procession was preceded by a rabble of white faced small boys while the rear was guarded by Jim McMasters meditating on the reflection that victory might be too dearly bought Just as they reached the front steps of missus Dodge s house and were beginning the tug up toward the door Jim burst into a loud bawl and this so much disconcerted the youngsters who were carrying Billy that they almost dropped him on the white door stone Johnny Flynn gave a mighty ring at the door bell and then fled down the steps and ran to the street corner where he stood one foot in the air ready to run when the door opened The neat maid who answered the bell gave a little shriek when she saw Billy s inanimate form The boys pushed by her dumped their burden upon the big hall sofa and rushed out before any questions could be asked It was plain enough however that Billy had got the worst of the fight And sure enough he deserves it mentally pronounced the servant maid as she ran to call her mistress missus Dodge gave a dismal shriek when she saw Billy She sent the maid for doctor Gordon and sat down on the sofa with Billy s head in her lap This was ignominious and Billy decided to live He opened his eyes and in a faint voice asked for water When the man of medicine arrived he ordered the vanquished to bed In the goodness of his heart pitying the household of women he even carried Billy upstairs and assisted in undressing him The doctor noticed during this process various small folded papers flying out of Billy s pockets but he did not know their meaning It was left for Cora and Pearl later in the day to pick them up and examine them Alas for Billy s faith In his own boyish handwriting were his inspiring thoughts Never say die Ketch hold prompt et cetera Billy turned his face to the wall with a groan as the twins laid the slips of paper on his pillow That evening after Billy had held a long session of sweet silent thought for he could not sleep and had eaten a remarkably good supper he opened his mind to his mother No more of these for me he began brushing the texts from his bed onto the floor Of what Willy questioned missus Dodge No more holdin the thought and all that said Billy I m through Had too much That s what did me up If I hadn t been trying to think that blamed thought I d a seen Jim a comin But Willy expostulated missus Dodge you must hold fast Hold nothin said Billy He arose and sat up very straight in the bed I tell you I am goin to have no more nonsense Gimme quinine hell a gold basis and capital punishment That s my platform from this on I m goin to look up a good Sunday school to morrow in a church with a steeple on it and a strict regular minister and all the fixin s Remember mother after this I travel on my muscle weekdays and keep Sunday like a clock The twins picked up the scattered thoughts from the floor Billy was lying in his mother s room and their eyes were big with wonder Burn em commanded Billy Then on second thought he relented slightly Keep em yourself if you want to he said to the twins Holdin the thought may be all right for girls but with boys it don t work SO WAGS THE WORLD BY ANNE WARNER With apologies to Samuel Pepys Esquire February first My birthday and I exceedingly merry thereat having in divers friends and much good wine beside two pasties and more of all than we could eat and drink had we been doubled Afterwards to the play house and a very good play and hence to a supper the which most hot and comforting with a butt of brandy and divers cocktails and they being very full did make great sport and joke me that I had never taken a wife to which replied neatly saying that for my part in my twenties did feel myself too young and in my thirties did never chance upon one comely and to my taste at which great applause and pretty to see me bow to right and left although in mortal fear lest something give way I being grown heavier of late and the quality of cloth suffering from the New York Custom House The applause being over did continue my speech and say that in my forties had had little time to think of aught but my own personal affairs but that now being come to my fifties was well disposed to share them and they did all drink to that and smash their glasses with right good cheer prophesying my marriage and drinking long life to Her and me and Lord but it did like me to hear speak of Her the which brought tears to mine eyes considering that they did speak of my wife and so did weep freely and they with me My mind then a blank but home in some shape and the maid did get me to my room and what a head this morning Misliketh me much to bethink me how I did comport myself but a man is fifty but once To mine office where did buy and sell as usual February third Comes H Nevil in a glass coach to take me to drive and did talk much of his niece she being fresh from France and of a good skin and fair voice Was of a great joy to ride in a glass coach and pleasant to look constantly out backward but great rattling and do think my modest brougham sufficeth me well but H Nevil very disdainful of the brougham and saith a man is known by the company he keepeth the which strange in mine eyes we being alone together in the coach but did go with him to a horse dealer s To mine office as usual and there did buy and sell February eighth To dine with H Nevil and his wife and she a monstrous pleasant lady and the dinner good only the wine poor and my vest too tight which vastly misliked me I being loth to grow stout and yet all at odds with my belts the which trying me sadly for I do pay my tailor as many do not And the niece a striking fine girl modest and not raising her eyes the which much to my taste and drinking only lambs wool and at cards knowing not tierce from deuce H Nevil making great ado over my new coach did have it out with pride and we to the Country Club for a late supper the which well cooked but my vest much tighter and so home and to bed Railway stocks risen two points February twentieth Did take a box at the Play and ask H Nevil his wife and niece and a supper afterwards and pretty to see how miss did refuse mine eyes and hardly speak two words the which greatly to my admiration and after supper did lead her to the coach and press her hand with curious effect to mine own hair the which strange and prickly and home and much thinking on the merry talk at my birthday before sleep Stocks falling somewhat March nineteenth Much agitated and all trembling and of a cold sweat The Lord have mercy and me all unwitting until in some strange way do find myself today betrothed the which I do heartily pray to be for the good of all concerned although expensive and worse to come No heart for stocks but the same arising April sixteenth Do find the being betrothed more to my taste than anticipated and tell H Nevil he shall be remembered with pointers when the market turns again We to the park to drive each afternoon and many admiring of her beauty she desiring often to drive but I firm in refusing for I will be master in my own house Comes one Lasselle and makes a great tale of a mine and I with no time for him but do set the office boy to look him up in Bradstreet These be busy days with a corner on parsnips May tenth The business of being director in Lasselle s mine ended this day and to a great dinner that he giveth in my honor and my portrait on all the cards the which pleaseth me mightily and I all complimented and congratulationed and sly hints on my approaching marriage to the which I all smiles for Lord the thing being done one must be of good courage Quotations low beshrew them June seventh the Mountains Married this day and to do in a turmoil wheat being all a rage and me forced to go home to dress before noon Did scarce know where I was with Extras being cried outside the church window and H Nevil giving the bride away and on the wrong side of the market by my advice The bride hystericky in the carriage and at the station wept so that I was fair beside myself Did bethink me to kiss her in the train but small comfort to either What will become of my affairs I know not this place being all without stock reports and I half mad and with naught to pass the time Comes my wife as I write and will have the key to her largest trunk the same it doth appear is lost the which on discovery she layeth at my door and weepeth afresh Did strive to cheer her but with a heavy heart August tenth This do be the hottest summer in many years and lest I forget to set it down more mad dogs than can well be handled My wife very hystericky and forever in a smock and declareth she would be dead and married life a delusion the which opinion I take small issue with having my hands full of business and Lasselle forever at my heels with our affair of the mine not to speak of H Nevil which waileth continually over how he was caught short in the month of June Beshrew me if I repent not of June on mine own behalf but am determined to live properly and so have despatched a messenger to my cousin Sarah Badminton asking that she come to keep mine house August twentieth Comes Sarah Badminton this day and Lord but a plain woman being flat like unto a board from her heels up unto her head but curiously shaped in and out in front Still she do seem a worthy jade and good at heart and ever attentive when I will to converse and sitteth with me of a breakfast my wife being ever asleep till ten Last night to the Play where comes Lasselle and makes very merry and telleth jokes the which of great amusement to my wife while I find no mirth therein Later to supper at the coffee house and my wife exceedingly witty and me all of a wonder at the change in her in public and on reflection do find it passing strange that one ugly like Mistress Badminton will effort her to be gracious at home while one so handsome as my wife sleeps ever To my office where did buy and sell as usual September sixteenth My wife not well and strangely indisposed towards me yawning unduly and complaining that life is dull yet gay enough for others and of a great joy over riding horseback with Lasselle Last night did chide her in bed for upwards of an hour and misliked me greatly when I had done to find that she slept for some while before Will have the doctor to her for there be surely something amiss in a woman who is not happy with me To my office and H Nevil all excitement over his margins October twenty ninth Returned this day from a trip to the Coast and find my wife no better although the doctor hath been with her each day She saith the doctor adviseth quiet until spring Comes missus Badminton her face all awry and will that I go with her to Carlsbad and my affairs so many as never was and never any lover of the sea That which causeth me great vexation that I have a wife and say flatly to missus Badminton to ask the doctor if he can not take her to Carlsbad any money being wiser than to travel with oats where they be now and chicken feed going up to beat the band at which the good woman raiseth her hands aloft and maketh such demonstration that I clean out of patience and basted her with the fire shovel the same being not courteous but sadly necessary to all appearance November sixth My wife most nervous and there being no peace with Her did discuss the same with Lasselle to day and although unmarried yet did sympathize much and advise for me with a right good will telling me of a place in southern France where he hath been and the same beyond all else for the nerves only lonely but that not so bad since he proposeth going there this winter himself and can see after my wife somewhat the which greatly to my relief and so home and did discourse thereon with Mistress Badminton the which drew a long face and plain to see was dead against the plan the which putting me in a fine temper with what a woman hath for brains Wheat rising and A B C going down comes H Nevil short to borrow the which crowneth my fury his niece being so far from making me happy and he being the cause of all But did indorse two notes for him and so home and to bed with a bad grace and glad that my wife has betaken herself to another room December ninth From the dock and my wife do be gone and now we may look for some peace the which sad enough needed December tenth Comes H Nevil all distraught to say that it is about at the clubs that my wife will have a divorce and marry the doctor on the which hearing I much annoyed and summon missus Badminton who denyeth the doctor but asserteth Lasselle whereupon we in a great taking and much brandy and soda but at last reflection and do decide not to sue but to pity Lasselle for of a verity she be forever out of temper and flounceth when questioned To mine office and D E going up comes H Nevil to borrow again the gall of which doth take me greatly January seventeenth Am all of a taking for that the papers in my wife s divorce do be filed into me this day and great to do when I learn that the cause she declareth is Sarah Badminton a woman as little comely as never was and mine own cousin Verily the ways of a wife be past understanding April eleventh Free this day and being free comes missus Badminton weeping and declareth she be ruined if I marry her not next the which doth so overcome me that ere I have time to rally she hath kissed me and called me hers To my office with a heavy heart having no assurance of how this second marriage will turn out and little hope but seeing H Nevil with a long face did refuse to give him any inside information the which led to his going under about noon to my great joy for it was he who did get me in this marrying habit February first My birthday and Lord what eating and drinking the which being good beyond compare my wife staying in the pantry to keep the whole in trim and all my friends discoursing on my joy the which is truly great she being so plain that a man will never look at her and so loving that she adoreth me come smiles come frowns But that which doth astonish me much is that H Nevil telleth me that she that was once my wife is of exceeding content with Lasselle a piece of news which I can scarce credit comparing him with myself But so wags the world THE PAINTERMINE three BY KENYON COX Its innocence deserves no jibe

hear of the Mulligan ball the Mulligan ball so fine Where we formed in ranks and danced on planks and swung em along the line Where the first Four Hundred of the town moved at the music s call There was never a ball in the world at all like the famous Mulligan ball Town was a bit of a village then and never a house or shed From street to street and beat to beat was higher than Mulligan s head And never a theater troup came round to liven us spring or fall And so Mulligan s wife she says says she Plaze God I ll give a ball And she did God rest her and save her too I m liftin to her my hat And never a ball at all at all was half as fine as that Never no invitations sent nothin like that at all But the whole Four Hundred combed their hair and went to the Mulligan ball And Take yer places says Mulligan an dance till you shake the wall And I led missus Mulligan off as the lady that gave the ball And we whirled around till we shook the ground with never a stop at all And I kicked the heels from my boots please God at the famous Mulligan ball Mulligan jumped till he hit the roof and the head of him went clean through it The shingles fell on the floor pell mell Says Mulligan Faith I knew it But we kept right on when the roof was gone with never a break at all We danced away till the break o day at the famous Mulligan ball But the best of things must pass away like the flowers that fade and fall And it s fifty years as the records say since we danced at Mulligan s ball And the new Four Hundred never dance like the Mulligans danced at all And I m longing still though my hair is gray for a ball like Mulligan s ball And I drift in dreams to the old time town and I hear the fiddle sing And Mulligan sashays up and down till the rafters rock and ring Suppose if I had a woman s eye maybe a tear would fall For the old time fellows who took the prize at the famous Mulligan ball

5802_66347_000001_000000	train-clean-360	BY JOHN KENDRICK BANGS
none	none	 Good morning Doctor said the Idiot as Capsule M D entered the dining room I am mighty glad you ve come I ve wanted for a long time to ask you about this music cure that everybody is talking about and get you if possible to write me out a list of musical nostrums for every day use I noticed last night before going to bed that my medicine chest was about run out 
5802_66347_000002_000004	train-clean-360	There s nothing but one quinine pill and a soda mint drop in it and if there s anything in the music cure I don t think I ll have it filled again 
none	none	I prefer Wagner to squills and compared to the delights of Mozart Hayden and Offenbach those of paregoric are nit Still rambling eh vouchsafed the Doctor
5802_66347_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 You ought to submit your tongue to some scientific student of dynamics 
none	none	I am inclined to think from my own observation of its ways that it contains the germ of perpetual motion
5802_66347_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I will consider your suggestion replied the Idiot 
none	none	Meanwhile let us consult harmoniously together on the original point Is there anything in this music cure and is it true that our Medical Schools are hereafter to have conservatories attached to them in which aspiring young M D s are to be taught the materia musica in addition to the materia medica I had heard of no such idiotic proposition returned the Doctor
5802_66347_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 And as for the music cure I don t know anything about it 
none	none	Haven t heard everybody talking about it and doubt the existence of any such thing outside of that mysterious realm which is bounded by the four corners of your own bright particular cerebellum 
5802_66347_000005_000003	train-clean-360	What do you mean by the music cure 
none	none	Why the papers have been full of it lately explained the Idiot The claim is made that in music lies the panacea for all human ills It may not be able to perform a surgical operation like that which is required for the removal of a leg and I don t believe even Wagner ever composed a measure that could be counted on successfully to eliminate one s vermiform appendix from its chief sphere of usefulness but for other things like measles mumps the snuffles or indigestion it is said to be wonderfully efficacious What I wanted to find out from you was just what composers were best for which specific troubles
5802_66347_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll have to go to somebody else for the information said the Doctor 
none	none	I never heard of the theory and as I said before I don t believe anybody else has barring your own sweet self
5802_66347_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I have seen a reference to it somewhere put in mister Whitechoker coming to the Idiot s rescue 
none	none	As I recall the matter some lady had been cured of a nervous affection by a scientific application of some musical poultice or other and the general expectation seems to be that some day we shall find in music a cure for all our human ills as the Idiot suggests Thank you mister Whitechoker said the Idiot gratefully I saw that same item and several others besides and I have only told the truth when I say that a large number of people are considering the possibilities of music as a substitute for drugs I am surprised that Doctor Capsule has neither heard nor thought about it for I should think it would prove to be a pleasant and profitable field for speculation Even I who am only a dabbler in medicine and know no more about it than the effects of certain remedies upon my own symptoms have noticed that music of a certain sort is a sure emollient for nervous conditions
5802_66347_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 For example said the Doctor 
none	none	Of course we don t doubt your word but when a man makes a statement based upon personal observation it is profitable to ask him what his precise experience has been merely for the purpose of adding to our own knowledge Well said the Idiot the first instance that I can recall is that of a Wagner Opera and its effects upon me For a number of years I suffered a great deal from insomnia I could not get two hours of consecutive sleep and the effect of my sufferings was to make me nervous and irritable 
5802_66347_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Suddenly somebody presented me with a couple of tickets for a performance of Parsifal and I went 
none	none	It began at five o clock in the afternoon For twenty minutes all went serenely and then the music began to work I fell into a deep and refreshing slumber The intermission came and still I slept on Everybody else went home dressed for the evening part of the performance had their dinner and returned Still I slept and continued so to do until midnight when one of the gentlemanly ushers came and waked me up and told me that the performance was over 
5802_66347_000011_000010	train-clean-360	I rubbed my eyes and looked about me 
5802_66347_000011_000011	train-clean-360	It was true the great auditorium was empty and was gradually darkening 
5802_66347_000011_000012	train-clean-360	I put on my hat and walked out refreshed having slept from five twenty until twelve or six hours and forty minutes straight 
5802_66347_000011_000013	train-clean-360	That was one instance 
none	none	Two weeks later I went again this time to hear Die Goetherdammerung The results were the same only the effect was instantaneous The curtain had hardly risen before I retired to the little ante room of the box our party occupied and dozed off into a fathomless sleep 
5802_66347_000011_000017	train-clean-360	I didn t wake up this time until nine o clock the next day the rest of the party having gone off without awakening me as a sort of joke 
none	none	Clearly Wagner according to my way of thinking then deserves to rank among the most effective narcotics known to modern science I have tried all sorts of other things sulfonal trionel bromide powders and all the rest and not one of them produced anything like the soporific results that two doses of Wagner brought about in one instant and best of all there was no reaction No splitting headache or shaky hand the next day but just the calm quiet contented feeling that goes with the sense of having got completely rested up You run a dreadful risk however said the Doctor with a sarcastic smile
5802_66347_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 The Wagner habit is a terrible thing to acquire mister Idiot 
5802_66347_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 That may be said the Idiot 
none	none	Worse than the sulfonal habit by a great deal I am told but I am in no danger of becoming a victim to it while it costs from five to seven dollars a dose In addition to this experience I have also the testimony of a friend of mine who was cured of a frightful attack of the colic by Sullivan s Lost Chord played on a Cornet 
5802_66347_000013_000003	train-clean-360	He had spent the day down at Asbury Park and had eaten not wisely but too copiously 
none	none	Among other things that he turned loose in his inner man were two plates of Lobster Salade a glass of fresh cider and a saucerful of pistache ice cream He was a painter by profession and the color scheme he thus introduced into his digestive apparatus was too much for his artistic soul He was not fitted by temperament to assimilate anything quite so strenuously chromatic as that and as a consequence shortly after he had retired to his studio for the night the conflicting tints began to get in their deadly work and within two hours he was completely doubled up The pain he suffered was awful Agony was bliss alongside of the pangs that now afflicted him and all the palliatives and pain killers known to man were tried without avail and then just as he was about to give himself up for lost an amateur cornetist who occupied a studio on the floor above began to play the Lost Chord 
5802_66347_000013_000008	train-clean-360	A counter pain set in immediately 
none	none	At the second bar of the Lost Chord the awful pain that was gradually gnawing away at his vitals seemed to lose its poignancy in the face of the greater suffering and physical relief was instant As the musician proceeded the internal disorder yielded gradually to the external and finally passed away entirely leaving him so far from prostrated that by one A M he was out of bed and actually girding himself with a shotgun and an Indian Club to go upstairs for a physical encounter with the cornetist And you reason from this that Sullivan s Lost Chord is a cure for Cholera morbus eh sneered the Doctor It would seem so said the Idiot While the music continued my friend was a well man ready to go out and fight like a warrior but when the cornetist stopped the colic returned and he had to fight it out in the old way In these episodes in my own experience I find ample justification for my belief and that of others that some day the music cure for human ailments will be recognized and developed to the full Families going off to the country for the summer instead of taking a medicine chest along with them will go provided with a music box with cylinders for mumps measles summer complaint whooping cough chicken pox chills and fever and all the other ills the flesh is heir to 
5802_66347_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Scientific experiment will demonstrate before long what composition will cure specific ills 
5802_66347_000015_000004	train-clean-360	If a baby has whooping cough an anxious mother instead of ringing up the Doctor will go to the piano and give the child a dose of Hiawatha 
none	none	If a small boy goes swimming and catches a cold in his head and is down with a fever his nurse an expert on the accordeon can bring him back to health again with three bars of Under the Bamboo Tree after each meal Instead of dosing kids with cod liver oil when they need a tonic they will be set to work at a mechanical piano and braced up on Narcissus There ll Be a Hot Time In The Old Town To Night will become an effective remedy for a sudden chill 
5802_66347_000015_000008	train-clean-360	People suffering from sleeplessness can dose themselves back to normal conditions again with Wagner the way I did 
none	none	Tchaikowski to be well Tshaken before taken will be an effective remedy for a torpid liver and the man or woman who suffers from lassitude will doubtless find in the lively airs of our two step composers an efficient tonic to bring their vitality up to a high standard of activity 
5802_66347_000015_000010	train-clean-360	Nothing in it 
none	none	Why Doctor there s more in it that s in sight to day that is promising and suggestive of great things in the future than there was of the principle of gravitation in the rude act of that historic pippin that left the parent tree and swatted Sir Isaac Newton on the nose And the Drug Stores will be driven out of business I presume said the Doctor
5802_66347_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 No said the Idiot 
none	none	They will substitute music for drugs that is all Every man who can afford it will have his own medical phonograph or music box and the drug stores will sell cylinders and records for them instead of quinine carbonate of soda squills paregoric and other nasty tasting things they have now 
5802_66347_000017_000003	train-clean-360	This alone will serve to popularize sickness and instead of being driven out of business their trade will pick up 
5802_66347_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 And the Doctor 
5802_66347_000018_000001	train-clean-360	And the Doctor s gig and all the appurtenances of his profession what becomes of them demanded the Doctor 
none	none	We ll have to have the Doctor just the same to prescribe for us only he will have to be a musician but the gig I m afraid that will have to go said the Idiot
5802_66347_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 And why pray asked the Doctor 
5802_66347_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Because there are no more drugs must the physician walk 
5802_66347_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Not at all said the Idiot 
none	none	But he d be better equipped if he drove about in a piano organ or if he preferred an auto on a steam calliope THE OCTOPUSSYCAT four BY KENYON COX I love Octopussy his arms are so long There s nothing in nature so sweet as his song Tis true I d not touch him no not for a farm If I keep at a distance he ll do me no harm Footnote four From Mixed Beasts by Kenyon Cox Copyright nineteen oh four by Fox Duffield company THE BOOK CANVASSER ANONYMOUS He came into my office with a portfolio under his arm Placing it upon the table removing a ruined hat and wiping his nose upon a ragged handkerchief that had been so long out of the wash that it was positively gloomy he said mister I m canvassing for the National Portrait Gallery very valuable work comes in numbers fifty cents apiece contains pictures of all the great American heroes from the earliest times down to the present day Everybody subscribing for it and I want to see if I can t take your name Now just cast your eyes over that he said opening his book and pointing to an engraving That s lemme see yes that s Columbus Perhaps you ve heard sumfin about him The publisher was telling me to day before I started out that he discovered no was it Columbus that dis oh yes Columbus he discovered America was the first man here He came over in a ship the publisher said and it took fire and he stayed on deck because his father told him to if I remember right and when the old thing busted to pieces he was killed Handsome picture ain t it Taken from a photograph all of em are done especially for this work His clothes are kinder odd but they say that s the way they dressed in them days Look at this one Now isn t that splendid That s William Penn one of the early settlers I was reading t other day about him When he first arrived he got a lot of Indians up a tree and when they shook some apples down he set one on top of his son s head and shot an arrow plump through it and never fazed him They say it struck them Indians cold he was such a terrific shooter Fine countenance hasn t he face shaved clean he didn t wear a moustache I believe but he seems to have let himself out on hair Now my view is that every man ought to have a picture of that patriarch so s to see how the fust settlers looked and what kind of weskets they used to wear See his legs too Trousers a little short maybe as if he was going to wade in a creek but he s all there Got some kind of a paper in his hand I see Subscription list I reckon Now how does that strike you There s something nice That I think is is that a a yes to be sure Washington you recollect him of course Some people call him Father of his Country George Washington Had no middle name I believe He lived about two hundred years ago and he was a fighter I heard the publisher telling a man about him crossing the Delaware River up yer at Trenton and seems to me if I recollect right I ve read about it myself He was courting some girl on the Jersey side and he used to swim over at nights to see her when the old man was asleep The girl s family were down on him I reckon He looks like a man to do that don t he He s got it in his eye If it d been me I d gone over on a bridge but he probably wanted to show off afore her some men are so reckless you know Now if you ll conclude to take this I ll get the publisher to write out some more stories and bring em round to you so s you can study up on him I know he did ever so many other things but I ve forgot em my memory s so awful poor Less see Who have we next Ah Franklin Benjamin Franklin He was one of the old original pioneers I think I disremember exactly what he is celebrated for but I think it was a flying a oh yes flying a kite that s it The publisher mentioned it He was out one day flying a kite you know like boys do nowadays and while she was a flickering up in the sky and he was giving her more string an apple fell off a tree and hit him on the head then he discovered the attraction of gravitation I think they call it Smart wasn t it Now if you or me d a ben hit it d just made us mad like as not and set us a ravin But men are so different One man s meat s another man s pison See what a double chin he s got No beard on him either though a goatee would have been becoming to such a round face He hasn t got on a sword and I reckon he was no soldier fit some when he was a boy maybe or went out with the home guard but not a regular warrior I ain t one myself and I think all the better of him for it Ah here we are Look at that Smith and Pocahontas John Smith Isn t that gorgeous See how she kneels over him and sticks out her hands while he lays on the ground and that big fellow with a club tries to hammer him up Talk about woman s love There it is for you Modocs I believe anyway some Indians out West there somewheres and the publisher tells me that Captain Shackanasty or whatever his name is there was going to bang old Smith over the head with a log of wood and this here girl she was sweet on Smith it appears and she broke loose and jumped forward and says to the man with a stick Why don t you let John alone Me and him are going to marry and if you kill him I ll never speak to you as long as I live or words like them and so the man he give it up and both of them hunted up a preacher and were married and lived happy ever afterward Beautiful story isn t it A good wife she made him too I ll bet if she was a little copper colored And don t she look just lovely in that picture But Smith appears kinder sick evidently thinks his goose is cooked and I don t wonder with that Modoc swooping down on him with such a discouraging club And now we come to to ah to Putnam General Putnam he fought in the war too and one day a lot of em caught him when he was off his guard and they tied him flat on his back on a horse and then licked the horse like the very mischief And what does that horse do but go pitching down about four hundred stone steps in front of the house with General Putnam lying there nearly skeered to death Leastways the publisher said somehow that way and I once read about it myself But he came out safe and I reckon sold the horse and made a pretty good thing of it What surprises me is he didn t break his neck but maybe it was a mule for they re pretty sure footed you know Surprising what some of these men have gone through ain t it Turn over a couple of leaves That s General Jackson My father shook hands with him once He was a fighter I know He fit down in New Orleans Broke up the rebel legislature and then when the Ku Kluxes got after him he fought em behind cotton breastworks and licked em till they couldn t stand They say he was terrific when he got real mad hit straight from the shoulder and fetched his man every time Andrew his fust name was and look how his hair stands up And then here s John Adams and Daniel Boone and two or three pirates and a whole lot more pictures so you see it s cheap as dirt Lemme have your name won t you HER VALENTINE BY RICHARD HOVEY What send her a valentine Never I see you don t know who she is I should ruin my chances forever My hopes would collapse with a fizz I can t see why she scents such disaster When I take heart to venture a word I ve no dream of becoming her master I ve no notion of being her lord All I want is to just be her lover She s the most up to date of her sex And there s such a multitude of her No wonder they call her complex She s a bachelor even when married She s a vagabond even when housed And if ever her citadel s carried Her suspicions must not be aroused She s erratic impulsive and human And she blunders as goddesses can But if she s what they call the New Woman Then I d like to be the New Man I m glad she makes books and paints pictures And typewrites and hoes her own row And it s quite beyond reach of conjectures How much further she s going to go When she scorns in the L road my proffer Of a seat and hangs on to a strap I admire her so much I could offer To let her ride up on my lap Let her undo the stays of the ages That have cramped and confined her so long Let her burst through the frail candy cages That fooled her to think they were strong She may enter life s wide vagabondage She may do without flutter or frill She may take off the chains of her bondage And anything else that she will She may take me off for example And she probably does when I m gone I m aware the occasion is ample That s why I so often take on I m so glad she can win her own dollars And know all the freedom it brings I love her in shirt waists and collars I love her in dress reform things I love her in bicycle skirtlings Especially when there s a breeze I love her in crinklings and quirklings And anything else that you please I dote on her even in bloomers If Parisian enough in their style In fact she may choose her costumers Wherever her fancy beguile She may box she may shoot she may wrestle She may argue hold office or vote She may engineer turret or trestle And build a few ships that will float She may lecture all lectures but curtain Make money and naturally spend If I let her have her way I m certain She ll let me have mine in the end THE WELSH RABBITTERN five BY KENYON COX This is a very fearsome bird Who sits upon men s chests at night With horrid stare his eyeballs glare He flies away at morning s light

Martyrs and paid By the great guns moaned Watson as he placed his hands to his brow and swooned right in the middle of the street THE COQUETTE A Portrait BY JOHN G SAXE You re clever at drawing I own

5796-66357-0000	train-other-500	THE WEDDIN BY JENNIE BETTS HARTSWICK Well it s over it s all over bein the last to leave I know that and I declare I m that
none	none	 full of all the things we had to eat that John and me won t want any supper for a good hour yet so I just ran in to tell you about it while it s on top of my mind It s an everlastin shame you had to miss it One thing though you ll get a trayful of the good things sent in to you I shouldn t wonder I know there s loads left for I happened to slip out to the kitchen for a drink of water I was that dry after all those salty nuts and I didn t want to trouble em and I saw just heaps of things standin round Most likely you ll get a good large plate of cake not just a pinchin little mite of a piece in a box The boxes is real pretty though and they did look real palatial all stacked up on a table by the front door with a strange colored man in white gloves like a pall bearer to hand em to you 
5796-66357-0001	train-other-500	How did I get two of em Why it just
none	none	 happened that way You see when I was leavin I missed my sun shade and I laid my box down on the hatrack stand while I went upstairs to look for it I went through all the rooms and just when I d about given it up why there it was right in my hand all the time Wasn t it foolish 
5796-66357-0002	train-other-500	And when I came downstairs I found I d clean forgot where I d laid that box of cake I hunted
none	none	 everywhere and then I just had to tell the man how twas so he handed me another one and I was just walkin out the front door when would you believe it if there wasn t the 
5796-66357-0003	train-other-500	other one just as innocent on the hatrack stand where I had laid it So now I have three of em countin John s I just can t seem to realize that Eleanor Jamison is married at last can you
5796-66357-0004	train-other-500	She took her time if ever anybody did They
none	none	 do say she was real taken with that young college professor with the full beard and spectacles that visited there last summer and then to think that after all she went and married a man with a smooth face He wears glasses though that s one point in common 
5796-66357-0005	train-other-500	Eleanor s gone off a good deal lately don t you think so You hadn t noticed
none	none	 it 
5796-66357-0006	train-other-500	But then you never was any great hand at noticin I ve noticed you weren t Why the other day when I was there offerin to help em get ready for the weddin I noticed that she looked real worn
none	none	 and there was two or three little fine lines in her eye corners not real wrinkles of course 
5796-66357-0007	train-other-500	but we all know that lines is a forerunner Her hair s beginnin to turn too I noticed that comin out of church last Sunday I dare say her knowing this made her less particular than she d once have been and after all marryin any husband is a good deal like buyin a new black silk dress pattern
5796-66357-0008	train-other-500	an awful risk You may look at it on both sides and hold it up to the light and pull it to see if it ll fray and try if it ll spot but you can t be sure what it ll do till after you ve worn it a spell
5796-66357-0009	train-other-500	There s one advantage to the dress pattern though you can make em take it back if you mistrust it won t wear if you haven t cut into it that is but when you ve got a husband why you ve got him to have and to hold for better and worse and good and all
none	none	 Yes I m comin to the weddin I declare when I think how careless Eleanor is about little things I can t help mistrusting what kind of a housekeeper she ll turn out Why when John s and my invitation came it was only printed to the church there wasn t any reception card among it Now I ve supplied Eleanor s folks with butter and eggs and spring chickens for 
5796-66357-0010	train-other-500	thirty years and I d just have gone anyway for I knew it was a mistake but John held out that twasn t that they didn t mean to have us to the house part so to settle it I went right over and told em
5796-66357-0011	train-other-500	I told Eleanor she mustn t feel put out about it we was all mortal and if it hadn t been for satisfyin John I d never have let her know how careless she d been of course I d made allowance a weddin is upsettin to the intellect and so twas all right
5796-66357-0012	train-other-500	I had a real good view of the ceremony but twasn t their fault that I had it just happened that way When John
none	none	 and me got there I asked the young man at the door he was a yusher and a stranger to me to give us a front seat 
5796-66357-0013	train-other-500	but he said that all the front places was reserved for the relations of the bride and groom and then I noticed that they d tied off the middle aisle about seven pews back with white satin ribbons and
none	none	 a big bunch of pink roses 
5796-66357-0014	train-other-500	It seemed real impolite to invite folks to a weddin and then take the best seats themselves Well just then I happened to feel my shoelacin gettin loose and I stepped to one side to fix it and when I got up from stoopin
5796-66357-0015	train-other-500	and my gloves on and buttoned I had to take em off to tie my shoe and straightened John s cravat for him why
none	none	 there was the families on both sides just goin in Of course we had to follow right along behind em 
5796-66357-0016	train-other-500	and when we came up to the ribbons
none	none	 would you believe it the big bow just untied itself or seemed to I heard afterward it was done by somebody pullin a invisible wire 
5796-66357-0017	train-other-500	and we all walked through and took seats I made John go into the pew ahead of me so s I could get out without disturbin anybody if I should have a headache or feel faint When John
none	none	 found we was settin with the family he was right close up against Eleanor s mother he was for gettin up and movin back But I just whispered to him John Appleby 
5796-66357-0018	train-other-500	do sit still I hear the bridal party comin
none	none	 Of course I didn t just hear em but I was sure they d be along in a minute and I knew it wouldn t do to move our seats anyway as if we weren t satisfied with em The church was decorated beautiful Eleanor s folks must have cleaned out their green house to put into it besides tons of greens from the city 
5796-66357-0019	train-other-500	Pretty near the whole of Wrenville was there and I must say the church was a credit to the Wrenville dressmakers I could pick out all their different fits without any trouble There was Arabella Satterlee s
5796-66357-0020	train-other-500	she shapes her backs like the top of a coffin or sometimes they remind me more of a kite
none	none	 and Sallie Ann Hodd s she makes em square and old missus Tucker s 
5796-66357-0021	train-other-500	you can always tell hers by the way the armholes draw she makes the minister s wife s But they d
none	none	 every one of em done their level best and I was proud of em 
5796-66357-0022	train-other-500	Well when the organ
none	none	 it had been playin low and soft all the time changed off into the weddin march and the bridesmaids eight of em marched up the aisle behind the eight yushers I tell you Miss Halliday it was a sight They was all in pink gauzy stuff I happened to feel one of em as she went by but I couldn t tell what twas made of it seemed dreadful flimsy and big flat hats all made of roses on their heads and carryin bunches pf long stemmed roses so big that they had to hold em in their arms like young babes Eleanor came behind em all walkin with her father He always was a small built man and with her long trail and her veil spreadin out so why I declare you couldn t hardly see him 
5796-66357-0023	train-other-500	I whispered to John that they looked more as if Eleanor was goin to give her pa away than him her Eleanor s dress was elegant only awful plain It was made in New York at Greenleaf s
none	none	 I know because when I was upstairs lookin for my sunshade I told you about that didn t I I happened to get into Eleanor s room by mistake and there was the box it came in right on the bed before my eyes 
5796-66357-0024	train-other-500	Well when they was all past I kept lookin round me for the groom and wonderin how I had come to miss him when all at once John nudged me and there he was right in front of me and the minister beginnin to marry em
5796-66357-0025	train-other-500	and where he had sprung from I can t tell you this livin minute
none	none	 Came in from the vestry did he Well now I never would have thought of that Well when they was most married the most ridiculous thing happened You see Eleanor s father in steppin back after givin her away had put his foot right down on her trail and never noticed and when it came time for the prayer Eleanor pulled and pulled they was to kneel down on two big white satin cushions in front of em but her pa never budged just stood there with his eyes shut and his head bowed as devout as anything and before Eleanor could stop him her husband he was most her husband anyway had kneeled right down on to the cushion with his eyes shut too I suppose and the minister had to pray over em that way I could see Eleanor s shoulders shakin under her veil and of course it was ridiculous if it hadn t been so solemn And then they all marched down the aisle with the bride and groom leadin the procession Eleanor s veil was put back and I noticed that she was half laughin yet and her cheeks were real pink and her eyes sort of bright and moist she looked real handsome Good gracious Miss Halliday don t ever tell me that s six o clock And I haven t told a thing about the presents and who was there and Eleanor s clothes and what they had to eat why they didn t even use their own china ware They had a colored caterer from New York and he brought everything all the dishes and table cloths and spoons and forks besides the refreshments I know because just after he came I happened to carry over my eleven best forks John broke the dozenth tryin to pry the cork out of a bottle of raspberry vinegar the year we was married I never take a fork to pry with and offered to loan em for the weddin but they didn t need em so I just stayed a minute or two in the butler s pantry and then went home but I saw the caterer unpackin There I knew I d stay too long There s John comin in the gate after me I must go this blessed minute THE THOMPSON STREET POKER CLUB SOME CURIOUS POINTS IN THE NOBLE GAME UNFOLDED BY HENRY GUY CARLETON When mister Tooter Williams entered the gilded halls of the Thompson Street Poker Club Saturday evening it was evident that fortune had smeared him with prosperity He wore a straw hat with a blue ribbon an expression of serene content and a glass amethyst on his third finger whose effulgence irradiated the whole room and made the envious eyes of mister Cyanide Whiffles stand out like a crab s Besides these extraordinary furbishments mister Williams had his mustache waxed to fine points and his back hair was precious with the luster and richness which accompany the use of the attar of Third Avenue roses combined with the bear s grease dispensed by basement barbers on that fashionable thoroughfare In sharp contrast to this scintillating entrance was the coming of the Reverend mister Thankful Smith who had been disheveled by the heat discolored by a dusty evangelical trip to Coney Island and oppressed by an attack of malaria which made his eyes bloodshot and enriched his respiration with occasional hiccoughs and that steady aroma which is said to dwell in Weehawken breweries The game began at eight o clock and by nine and a series of two pair hands and bull luck mister Gus Johnson was seven dollars and a nickel ahead of the game and the Reverend mister Thankful Smith who was banking was nine stacks of chips and a dollar bill on the wrong side of the ledger mister Cyanide Whiffles was cheerful as a cricket over four winnings amounting to sixty nine cents Professor Brick was calm and mister Tooter Williams was gorgeous and hopeful and laying low for the first jackpot which now came It was mister Whiffles s deal and feeling that the eyes of the world were upon him he passed around the cards with a precision and rapidity which were more to his credit than the I O U from mister Williams which was left over from the previous meeting Professor Brick had nine high and declared his inability to make an opening mister Williams noticed a dangerous light come into the Reverend mister Smith s eye and hesitated a moment but having two black jacks and a pair of trays opened with the limit I liffs yo jess tree dollahs Toot said the Reverend mister Smith getting out the wallet and shaking out a wad mister Gus Johnson who had a four flush and very little prudence came in mister Whiffles sighed and fled mister Williams polished the amethyst thoroughly examining a scratch on one of its facets adjusted his collar skinned his cards stealthily glanced again at the expression of the Reverend mister Smith s eye and said he would Jess jess call mister Whiffles supplied the wants of the gentleman from the pack with the mechanical air of a man who had lost all hope in a hereafter mister Williams wanted one card the Reverend mister Smith said he d take about three and mister Gus Johnson expressed a desire for a club if it was not too much trouble mister Williams caught another tray and being secretly pleased led out by betting a chip The Reverend mister Smith uproariously slammed down a stack of blue chips and raised him seven dollars mister Gus Johnson had captured the nine of hearts and so retired mister Williams had four chips and a dollar left I sees dat seven he said impressively an I humps it ten mo Whar s de c lateral queried the Reverend mister Smith calmly but with aggressiveness in his eye mister Williams sniffed contemptuously drew off the ring and deposited it in the pot with such an air as to impress mister Whiffles with the idea that the jewel must have been worth at least four million dollars Then mister Williams leaned back in his chair and smiled Whad yer goin ter do asked the Reverend mister Smith deliberately ignoring mister Williams s action mister Williams pointed to the ring and smiled Liff yo ten dollahs On whad Dat ring Dat ring Yezzah mister Williams was still cool Huh The Reverend mister Smith picked the ring up examined it scientifically with one eye closed dropped it several times as if to test its soundness and then walked across and rasped it several times heavily on the window pane Whad yo doin dat for excitedly asked mister Williams A double rasp with the ring was the Reverend mister Smith s only reply Gimme dat jule back demanded mister Williams The Reverend mister Smith was now vigorously rubbing the setting of the stone on the floor Leggo dat sparkler said mister Williams again The Reverend mister Smith carefully polished off the scratches by rubbing the ring a while on the sole of his foot Then he resumed his seat and put the precious thing back into the pot Then he looked calmly at mister Williams and leaned back in his chair as if waiting for something Is yo satisfied said mister Williams in the tone used by men who have sustained a deep injury Dis is pokah said the Reverend mister Thankful Smith I rised yo ten dollahs said mister Williams pointing to the ring Did yer ever saw three

his coat hat vest suspenders and scarfpin heaped them on the table and then sat down and glared at the Reverend mister Smith mister Smith rolled up the coat put on the hat threw his own out of the window gave the ring to mister Whiffles jammed the suspenders into his pocket and took in the vest chips and money Dis yar s buglry yelled mister Williams The Reverend mister Smith spread out four

BAILEY It was just after the funeral The bereaved and subdued widow enveloped in millinery gloom was seated in the sitting room with a few sympathizing friends There was that constrained look so peculiar to the occasion observable on every countenance The widow sighed How do you feel my dear said her sister Oh I don t know said the poor woman with difficulty restraining her tears But I hope everything passed off well Indeed it did said all the ladies It was as large and respectable a funeral as I have seen this winter said the sister looking around upon the others Yes it was said the lady from next door I was saying to missus Slocum only ten minutes ago that the attendance couldn t have been better the bad going considered Did you see the Taylors asked the widow faintly looking at her sister They go so rarely to funerals that I was surprised to see them here Oh yes the Taylors were all here said the sympathizing sister As you say they go but a little they are so exclusive I thought I saw the Curtises also suggested the bereaved woman droopingly Oh yes chimed in several They came in their own carriage too said the sister animatedly And then there were the Randalls and the Van Rensselaers missus Van Rensselaer had her cousin from the city with her and missus Randall wore a very black heavy silk which I am sure was quite new Did you see Colonel Haywood and his daughters love I thought I saw them but I wasn t sure They were here then were they Yes indeed said they all again and the lady who lived across the way observed The Colonel was very sociable and inquired most kindly about you and the sickness of your husband The widow smiled faintly She was gratified by the interest shown by the Colonel The friends now rose to go each bidding her good by and expressing the hope that she would be calm Her sister bowed them out When she returned she said You can see my love what the neighbors think of it I wouldn t have had anything unfortunate to happen for a good deal But nothing did The arrangements couldn t have been better I think some of the people in the neighborhood must have been surprised to see so many of the uptown people here suggested the afflicted woman trying to look hopeful You may be quite sure of that asserted the sister I could see that plain enough by their looks Well I am glad there is no occasion for talk said the widow smoothing the skirt of her dress And after that the boys took the chairs home and the house was put in order CASEY AT THE BAT BY ERNEST LAWRENCE THAYER It looked extremely rocky for the Mudville nine that day The score stood four to six with just an inning left to play And so when Cooney died at first and Burrows did the same A pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game A straggling few got up to go leaving there the rest With that hope that springs eternal within the human breast For they thought if only Casey could get one whack at that They d put up even money with Casey at the bat But Flynn preceded Casey and so likewise did Blake But the former was a pudding and the latter was a fake So on that stricken multitude a death like silence sat For there seemed but little chance of Casey s getting to the bat But Flynn let drive a single to the wonderment of all And the much despised Blaikie tore the cover off the ball And when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred There was Blaikie safe on second and Flynn a hugging third Then from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell It bounded from the mountain top and rattled in the dell It struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat For Casey mighty Casey was advancing to the bat There was ease in Casey s manner as he stepped into his place There was pride in Casey s bearing and a smile on Casey s face And when responding to the cheers he lightly doffed his hat No stranger in the crowd could doubt twas Casey at the bat Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip Defiance glanced in Casey s eye a sneer curled Casey s lip And now the leather covered sphere came hurtling through the air And Casey stood a watching it in haughty grandeur there Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped That ain t my style said Casey Strike one the umpire said From the benches black with people there went up a muffled roar Like the beating of the storm waves on a stern and distant shore Kill him Kill the umpire shouted some one in the stand And it s likely they d have killed him had not Casey raised his hand With a smile of Christian charity great Casey s visage shone He stilled the rising tumult he bade the game go on He signaled to the pitcher and once more the spheroid flew But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said Strike two Fraud cried the maddened thousands and the echo answered Fraud But the scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed They saw his face grow stern and cold they saw his muscles strain And they knew that Casey wouldn t let that ball go by again The sneer is gone from Casey s lip his teeth are clenched with hate He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate And now the pitcher holds the ball and now he lets it go And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey s blow Oh somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright The band is playing somewhere and somewhere hearts are light And somewhere men are laughing and somewhere children shout But there is no joy in Mudville mighty Casey has struck out THE MARTYRDOM OF mister STEVENS eight BY HERBERT QUICK Pietro Th offense it seemeth me Is one that by mercy s extremest stretch Might be o erpassed Cosimo Never Pietro never The Brotherhood s honor untouchable Is touch d thereby We build our labyrinth Of sacred words and potent spells and all The deep involved horrors of our craft Its entrance hedg d about with dreadful oaths And every step in thridding it made dank By dripping terror and out seeping awe Shall it be said that e en Ludovico May break our faith and live Never say I Vision of Cosimo The Bellevale lodge of the Ancient Order of Christian Martyrs held its meetings in the upper story of a tall building mister Alvord called for Amidon at eight and took him up all his boldness in the world of business replaced by wariness in the atmosphere of mystery As he and his companion went into an anteroom and were given broad collars from which were suspended metal badges called jewels he felt a good deal like a spy They walked into the lodge room where twenty five or thirty men with similar jewels sat smoking and chatting All seemed to know him but much to his relief before he could be included in the conversation the gavel fell certain ones with more elaborate jewels and more ornate collars than the rest took higher backed and more highly upholstered chairs at the four sides of the room another stood at the door and still another in complete uniform with sword and belt began hustling the members to seats The Deacon Militant said the wielder of the gavel will report if all present are known and tested members of our Dread and Mystic Conclave All Most Sovereign Pontiff responded the Deacon Militant who proved to be the man in the uniform save certain strangers who appear within the confines of our sacred basilica Let them be tested commanded the Sovereign Pontiff and if brethren welcomed if spies executed Amidon started and looked about for aid or avenue of escape Seeing none he warily watched the Deacon Militant That officer walking in the military fashion which as patristic literature teaches was adopted by the early Christians and turning square corners as was the habit of saint Paul and the Apostles received whispered passwords from the two or three strangers and with a military salute announced that all present had been put to the test and welcomed Then for the first time remembering that he was not among the strangers so far as known to the lodge Amidon breathed freely and rather regretted the absence of executions Bring forth the Mystic Symbols of the Order was the next command The Mystic Symbols were placed on a stand in the middle of the room and turned out to be a gilt fish about the size of a four pound bass a jar of human bones and a rolled up scroll said to contain the Gospels The fish as explained by the Deacon Militant typified a great many things connected with early Christianity and served always as a reminder of the password of the order The relics in the jar were the bones of martyrs The scroll was the Book of the Law Amidon was becoming impressed the solemn and ornate ritual and the dreadful symbols sent shivers down his inexperienced and unfraternal spine Breaking in with uninitiated eyes as he had done now seemed more and more a crime There was an Opening Ode which was so badly sung as to mitigate the awe and an order of business solemnly gone through Under the head Good of the Order the visiting brethren spoke as if it were a class meeting and they giving testimony one of them very volubly reminding the assembly of the great principles of the order and the mighty work it had already accomplished in ameliorating the condition of a lost and wandering world Amidon felt that he must have been very blind in failing to note this work until it was thus forced on his notice but he made a mental apology By the way Brassfield said mister Slater during a recess preceding the initiation of candidates you want to give Stevens the best you ve got in the Catacombs scene Will you make it just straight ritual or throw in some of those specialities of yours Stevens Catacombs gasped Amidon specialties I I wish you could have been here when I was put through went on mister Slater I don t see how any one but a professional actor or a person with your dramatic gifts can do that part at all it s so sort of ripping and and intense you know I look forward to your rendition of it with a good deal of pleasurable anticipation You don t expect me to do it do you asked Amidon Why who else was the counter question We can t be expected to play on the bench the best man in Pennsylvania in that part can we Come Brassfield said the Sovereign Pontiff get on your regalia for the Catacombs We are about to begin Oh say now said Amidon trying to be off hand about it you must get somebody else What s that Some one else Very likely we shall Very likely thus the Sovereign Pontiff with fine scorn Come the regalia and no nonsense I I may be called out at any moment urged Amidon amidst an outcry that seemed to indicate a breach with the Martyrs then and there There are reasons why Edgington took him aside Is there any truth in this story said he that you have had some trouble with Stevens and discharged him Oh that Stevens gasped Amidon as if the whole discussion had hinged on picking out the right one among an army of Stevenses Yes it s true and I can t help confer this Edgington whispered to the Sovereign Pontiff and the announcement was made that in the Catacombs scene Brother Brassfield would be excused and Brother Bulliwinkle substituted I know I never in any plane of consciousness saw any of this or knew any of these things thought Florian It is incredible Conviction however was forced on him by the fact that he was now made to don a black domino and mask and to march carrying a tin headed spear with a file of similar figures to examine the candidate who turned out to be the discharged Stevens sitting in an anteroom foolish and apprehensive and looking withal much as he had done in the counting room He was now asked by the leader of the file in a sepulchral tone several formal questions among others whether he believed in a Supreme Being Stevens gulped and said Yes He was then asked if he was prepared to endure any ordeal to which he might be subjected and warned unless he possessed nerves of steel he had better turn back for which measure there was yet time Stevens in a faint voice indicated that he was ready for the worst and desired to go on Then all except Amidon in awesome accents intoned Be brave and obedient and all may yet be well and they passed back into the lodge room Amidon was now thoroughly impressed and wondered whether Stevens would be able to endure the terrible trials hinted at Clad in a white robe typifying innocence and marching to minor music played upon a piano Stevens was escorted several times around the darkened room stopping from time to time at the station of some officer to receive highly improving lectures Every time he was asked if he were willing to do anything or believed anything he said Yes Finally with the Scroll of the Law in one hand and with the other resting on the Bones of Martyrs surrounded by the brethren whose drawn swords and leveled spears threatened death he repeated an obligation which bound him not to do a great many things and to keep the secrets of the order To Amidon it seemed really awful albeit somewhat florid in style and when Alvord nudged him at one passage in the obligation he resented it as an irreverence Then he noted that it was a pledge to maintain the sanctity of the family circle of brother Martyrs and Alvord s reference of the night before to the obligation as affecting his association with the strawberry blonde took on new and fearful meaning Stevens seemed to be vibrating between fright and a tendency to laugh as the voice of some well known fellow citizen rumbled out from behind a deadly weapon He was marched out to the same minor music and the first act was ended The really esoteric part of it Amidon felt was to come as he could see no reason for making a secret of these very solemn and edifying matters Stevens felt very much the same way about it and was full of expectancy when informed that the next degree would test his obedience He highly resolved to obey to the letter The next act disclosed Stevens hoodwinked and the room light He was informed that he was in the Catacombs familiar to the early Christians and must make his way alone and in darkness following the Clue of Faith which was placed in his hands This Clue was a white cord similar to the sort used by masons in the building trades He groped his way along by it to the station of the next officer who warned him of the deadly consequences of disobedience Thence he made his way onward holding to the Clue of Faith until he touched a trigger of some sort which let down upon him an avalanche of tinware and such light and noisy articles which frightened him so that he started to run and was dexteriously tripped by the Deacon Militant and a spearman and caught in a net held by two others A titter ran about the room Obey thundered the Vice Pontiff and all will be well Stevens resumed the Clue At the station of the next officer to whom it brought him the nature of faith was explained to him and he was given the password Ichthus whispered so that all in that part of the room could hear the interdicted syllables But he was adjured never never to utter it unless to the Guardian of the Portal on entering the lodge to the Deacon Militant on the opening thereof or to a member when he Stevens should become Sovereign Pontiff Then he was faced toward the Vice Pontiff and told to answer loudly and distinctly the questions asked him What is the lesson inculcated in this Degree asked the Vice Pontiff from the other end of the room Obedience shouted Stevens in reply What is the password of this Degree Ichthus responded Stevens A roll of stage thunder sounded deafeningly over his head The piano was swept by a storm of bass passion and deep cries of Treason Treason echoed from every side Poor Stevens tottered and fell into a chair placed by the Deacon Militant He saw the enormity of the deed of shame he had committed He had told the password You have all heard this treason said the Sovereign Pontiff in the deepest of chest tones a treason unknown in all the centuries of the past What is the will of the conclave I would imprecate on the traitor s head said a voice from one of the high backed chairs the ancient doom of the Law Doom doom said all in unison holding the oo in a most blood curdling way Pronounce doom One fate and one alone pronounced the Sovereign Pontiff can be yours Brethren let him forthwith be encased in the Chest of the Clanking Chains and hurled from the Tarpeian Rock to be dashed in fragments at its stony base Amidon s horror was modified by the evidences of repressed glee with which this sentence was received Yet he felt a good deal of concern as they brought out a great chest threw the struggling Stevens into it slammed down the ponderous lid and locked it Stevens kicked at the lid but said nothing The members leaped with joy A great chain was brought and wrapped clankingly about the chest Let me out now yelled the Christian Martyr Let me out damn you Doom do o o oom roared the voices and said the Sovereign Pontiff in impressive tones Proceed with the execution Now the chest was slung up to a hook in the ceiling and gradually drawn back by a pulley until it was far above the heads of the men the chains meanwhile clanking continually against the receptacle from which came forth a stream of smothered profanity Hurl him down to the traitor s death shouted the Sovereign Pontiff The chest was loosed and swung like a pendulum lengthwise of the room down almost to the floor and up nearly to the ceiling The profanity now turned into a yell of terror The Martyrs slapped one another s backs and grew blue in the face with laughter At a signal a light box was placed where the chest would crush it which it did with a sound like a small railway collision the chest was stopped and the lid raised Let the body receive Christian burial said the Sovereign Pontiff Our vengeance ceases with death This truly Christian sentiment was received with universal approval Death seemed to all a good place at which to stop Brethren said the Deacon Militant as he struggled with the resurgent Stevens there seems some life here Methinks the heart beats and The remainder of the passage from the ritual was lost to Amidon by reason of the fact that Stevens had placed one foot against the Deacon s stomach and hurled that august officer violently to the floor Let every test of life be applied said the Sovereign Pontiff Perchance some higher will than ours decrees his preservation Take the body hence for a time if possible restore him to life and we will consider his fate The recess which followed was clearly necessary to afford an opportunity for the calming of the risibilities of the Martyrs The stage too had to be reset Amidon s ethnological studies had not equaled his reading in belles lettres and he was unable to see the deep significance of these rites from an historical standpoint and that here was a survival of those orgies to which our painted and skin clad ancestors devoted themselves in spasms of religious frenzy gazed at by the cave bear and the mammoth The uninstructed Amidon regarded them as inconceivable horse play While thus he mused Stevens who was still hoodwinked and being greatly belectured on the virtue of Faith and the duty of Obedience reentered on his ordeal He was now informed by the officer at the other end of the room that every man must ascend into the Mountains of Temptation and be tested before he could be pronounced fit for companionship with Martyrs Therefore a weary climb heavenward was before him and a great trial of his fidelity On his patience daring and fortitude depended all his future in the Order He was marched to a ladder and bidden to ascend I said the Deacon Militant upon this companion stair will accompany you But there was no other ladder and the Deacon Militant had to stand upon a chair Up the ladder labored Stevens but though he climbed manfully he remained less than a foot above the floor The ladder went down like a treadmill as Stevens climbed it was an endless ladder rolled down on Stevens side and up on the other The Deacon Militant from his perch on the chair encouraged Stevens to climb faster so as not to be outstripped With labored breath and straining muscles he climbed the Martyrs rolling on the floor in merriment all the more violent because silent Amidon himself laughed to see this strenuous climb so strikingly like human endeavor which puts the climber out of breath and raises him not a whit except in temperature At the end of perhaps five minutes when Stevens might well have believed himself a hundred feet above the roof he had achieved a dizzy height of perhaps six feet on the summit of a stage property mountain where he stood beside the Deacon Militant his view of the surrounding plain cut off by papier mache clouds and facing a foul fiend to whom the Deacon Militant confided that here was a candidate to be tested and qualified Whereupon the foul fiend remarked Ha ha and bade them bind him to the Plutonian Thunderbolt and hurl him down to the nether world The thunderbolt was a sort of toboggan on rollers for which there was a slide running down presumably to the nether world above mentioned The hoodwink was removed and Stevens looked about him treading warily like one on the top of a tower the great height of the mountain made him giddy Obediently he lay face downward on the thunderbolt and yielded up his wrists and ankles to fastenings provided for them They re not going to lower him with those cords are they It was a stage whisper from the darkness which spake thus Oh I guess it s safe enough said another in the same sort of agitated whisper Safe was the reply I tell you it s sure to break Some one stop em To the heart of the martyred Stevens these words struck panic But as he opened his mouth to protest the catastrophe occurred There was a snap and the toboggan shot downward Bound as he was the victim could see below him a brick wall right across the path of his descent He was helpless to move it was useless to cry out For all that as he felt in imagination the crushing shock of his head driven like a battering ram against this wall he uttered a roar such as from Achilles might have roused armed nations to battle And even as he did so his head touched the wall there was a crash and Stevens lay safe on a mattress after his ten foot slide surrounded by fragments of red and white paper which had lately been a wall He was pale and agitated and generally done for but tremendously relieved when he had assured himself of the integrity of his cranium This he did by repeatedly feeling of his head and looking at his fingers for sanguinary results As Amidon looked at him he repented of what he had done to this thoroughly maltreated fellow man After the Catacombs scene which was supposed to be impressive and some more of the secret work everybody crowded about Stevens now invested with the collar and jewel of Martyrhood and laughed and congratulated him as on some great achievement while he looked half pleased and half bored Amidon with the rest greeted him and told him that after his vacation was over he hoped to see him back at the office That was a fine exemplification of the principles of the Order said Alvord as they went home What was said Amidon Hiring old Stevens back answered Alvord You ve got to live your principles or they don t amount to much Suppose some fellow should get into a lodge asked Amidon who had never been initiated Well said Alvord there isn t much chance of that I shouldn t dare to say You can t tell what the fellows would do when such sacred things were profaned you know You couldn t tell what they might do Footnote eight From Double Trouble It should be explained that mister Amidon is suffering from dual consciousness and in his other state is known as Eugene Brassfield As the supposed Brassfield he has gone while in his Amidon state of consciousness to a meeting of the lodge to which as Brassfield he belongs THE WILD BOARDER nine BY KENYON COX His figure s not noted for grace You

and around His burning bosom buttoned it with stars Here will I lay me on the velvet grass That is like padding to earth s meager ribs And hold communion with the things about me Ah me how lovely is the golden braid That binds the skirt of night s descending robe The thin leaves quivering on their silken threads Do make a music like to rustling satin As the light breezes smooth their downy nap Ha what is this that rises to my touch So like a cushion Can it be a cabbage It is it is that deeply injured flower Which boys do flout us with but yet I love thee Thou giant rose wrapped in a green surtout Doubtless in Eden thou didst blush as bright As these thy puny brethren and thy breath Sweetened the fragrance of her spicy air But now thou seemest like a bankrupt beau Stripped of his gaudy hues and essences And growing portly in his sober garments Is that a swan that rides upon the water O no it is that other gentle bird Which is the patron of our noble calling I well remember in my early years When these young hands first closed upon a goose I have a scar upon my thimble finger Which chronicles the hour of young ambition My father was a tailor and his father And my sire s grandsire all of them were tailors They had an ancient goose it was an heirloom From some remoter tailor of our race It happened I did see it on a time When none was near and I did deal with it And it did burn me O most fearfully It is a joy to straighten out one s limbs And leap elastic from the level counter Leaving the petty grievances of earth The breaking thread the din of clashing shears And all the needles that do wound the spirit For such a pensive hour of soothing silence Kind Nature shuffling in her loose undress Lays bare her shady bosom I can feel With all around me I can hail the flowers That sprig earth s mantle and yon quiet bird That rides the stream is to me as a brother The vulgar know not all the hidden pockets Where Nature stows away her loveliness But this unnatural posture of the legs Cramps my extended calves and I must go Where I can coil them in their wonted fashion THE OLD SETTLER His Reasons for Thinking there is Natural Gas in Deep Rock Gulley BY ED MOTT I

THE TALKING HORSE BY JOHN T McINTYRE Upon a fence across the way was posted a twenty four sheet block stand and along the top in big red letters it read H Wellington Sheldon Presents Then followed the names of a half dozen famous operatic stars Bat Scranton sat regarding it silently for a long time but after he had placed himself behind his third big cigar he joined in the talk In fifteen years dubbing about this great and glorious said he I never run across a smoother piece of goods than old Cap Sheldon To see him now in his plug hat frock coat and white English whiskers you d spot him as the main squeeze in a prosperous bank He s doing the Frohman stunt too and Bat nodded toward the poster and he handles it with exceeding grace When I see him after the curtain falls upon a bunch of Verdi or Wagner stuff come out and bow his thanks to a house full of the town s swellest and throw out a little spiel with an aristocratic accent I always think of the time when I first met him Were any of you ever in Langtry Ohio Well never take a chance on it if there is anywhere else to go It s a tank town with a community of seven hundred of the tightest wads that ever sunk a dollar into the toe of a sock There was a fair going on in the place and I blew in there one September day my turn just then was taking orders for crayon portraits of rural gentlemen with horny hands and plenty of chin fringe I figure it out that about sixty per cent of the parlors in the middle west are adorned with one or more of these works of art but Langtry Ohio would not listen to the proposition for a moment as soon as they discovered that I wasn t giving the stuff away they sort of lost interest in me and mine so I began to study the time table and kick off the preliminary dust of the burg preparatory to seeking a new base of operations As I made my way to the station I caught my first glimpse of Cap Sheldon He had a satchel hanging from around his neck and was winsomely wrapping ten dollar notes up with small cylinders of soap and offering to sell them at one dollar a throw How are they going says I Not at all says he There s nothing to it that I can see The breed and seed of Solomon himself must have camped down in this section they are the wisest lot I ever saw herd together Instead of chewing straws and leaning over fences after the customary and natural manner of ruminates they pike around with a calm cold blooded sagacity that is truly awesome It s me to pull out as soon as I can draw expenses The next time Cap dawned upon my vision was a year afterward down in Georgia He was doing the ballyho oration in front of a side wall circus in a mellifluous style that was just dragging the tar heels up to the entrance It s a little better than the Ohio gag says he but I ve seen better at that I had a good paying faro outfit in Cincinnati since I met you but the police got sore because I wouldn t cut the takings in what they considered the right place so they closed me up During the next five years I met Cap in every section of the country and handling various propositions In San Francisco I caught him in the act of selling toy balloons on a street corner in Chicago he was disposing of old line life insurance with considerable effect at a county fair somewhere in Iowa I ran across him as he gracefully manipulated the shells But Cap did not break permanently into the show business until he coupled up with the McClintock in Milwaukee Mac was an Irish Presbyterian and was proud of it he came out of the Black North and was the most acute harp mentally that I had ever had anything to do with The Chosen People are not noted for commercial density but a Jew could enter Mac s presence attired in the height of fashion and leave it with only his shoe strings and a hazy recollection as to how the thing was done Now when a team like Cap and Mac took to pulling together there just naturally had to be something doing They began with a small show under canvas and their main card was a twenty foot boa constrictor which they billed as Mighty Mardo Then they had a boy with three legs one of which they neglected to state was made of wood also a blushing damsel with excess embonpoint to the extent of four hundred pounds With this outfit they campaigned for one season in the fall they bought a museum in saint Louis and settled themselves as impresarios Now in my numerous meetings with Cap I had never thought to ask his name so when I saw an ad in the Clipper stating that Sheldon McClintock was in need of a good full toned lecturer that doubled in brass I just sat me down in my ignorance and dropped them a line They sent me a ticket to where I was sidetracked up in Michigan and I hurried down Oh it s you is it says Cap as I piked into the ten by twelve office and announced myself Well I ve heard you throw a spiel and think you ll do But I didn t know that you played brass What s your instrument Now I had a faint sentiment from the beginning that this clause in their bill of requirements would get me into trouble for I knew no more about band music than a he goat knows about the book of common prayer I do the cymbals says I What snorts Cap rearing up I thought you wrote that you played brass Well says I ain t cymbals brass It must have been my cold nerve that won Cap s regard for he placed me as curio hall lecturer and advertising man at twenty a week The museum of Sheldon McClintock proved to be a great notch More fake freaks were thought out worked up and exhibited during the course of that winter season than I would care to count Then there was a small theater attached in which they put on very bad specialties and where painful voiced young men and women warbled sentimental ballads about their childhood homes and stuff of that character These got about ten dollars a week and had to do about thirty turns a day they lived in their make up and got so accustomed to grease paint before the end of their engagements that they felt only half dressed without it The trick made money and in about a year McClintock cut loose and went into a patent promoting scheme Shortly afterward the first continuous house was opened in saint Louis and the novelty of the thing was a body blow to Cap He made a good fight but lost money every day and at last he imparted to me in confidence that if business did not improve he could see himself getting out the shells and limbering up on them preparatory to going out and facing the world once more The bank will stand for three hundred thousand dollars worth more of my checks says he and after they re used up I m done He began to cut down expenses with the reckless energy of a man who saw the poor house looming ahead for him the results was that his bad shows grew worse and the attendance wasn t enough to dust off the seats The biggest item of expense about the place was Mighty Mardo the boa constrictor his diet was live rabbits and a twenty foot snake with a body as thick as a four inch pipe can dispose of good and plenty of them when he takes the notion Cap began to feed him live rats and the mighty one soon began to show the effects of it He ll die on you says I to Cap one day Let him says he the rabbits stay cut out One day a fellow came along with a high schooled horse that he wanted to sell He had more use for ready money just then than he had for the nag so he offered to put it in cheap But Cap waved him away I ll need the money to buy meals with before long says he to the fellow so tempt me not to my going hungry This little incident seemed to make the old man feel bad he locked himself up in the office for four hours or so communing with his inner self but when he came out he was looking bright and gay Say says he I ve changed my mind and just bought that horse I didn t see the man come back says I I made the deal over the phone says Cap Then he pushes a thick wad of penciled stuff at me Here s some truck I want you to take over to the printing house he goes on When it s out and up the brute will be well known I takes a look over the copy and my hat was lifted two inches straight off my head The first one read something like this ADMIRAL THE TALKING HORSE TALKS LIKE A HUMAN BEING VOCAL ORGANS DEVELOPED LIKE THOSE OF A MAN HEAR HIM SING THE BASS SOLO DOWN IN THE DEPTHS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ANY ONE PROVING THESE CLAIMS FAKE IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE Reads good don t it asks Cap sort of beaming through his nose pinzes But give a look at the others The next one was as bad as the first ADMIRAL THE HORSE WHO RECITES THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN A DEEP BASS VOICE AND WITH PERFECT ENUNCIATION I didn t hear the fellow say the skate could do that kind of stuff says I just a bit dazed after looking over a lot more of it He only handed it to me as a sort of last card says Cap and that s what made me change my mind about buying him Get five thousand twelve sheets in yellow and red ten thousand three sheets fifteen thousand block one sheets with cut of the horse And you can place an order for as many black and white dodgers as they can turn out between this and the end of the week It s a big card and we re going into it up to our eyebrows If I had had time to consider anything but hustling I might have thought the thing was a fake But it was the old man s game and I left him to do the worrying I threw rush orders into the printers and soon had the presses banging away on the stuff desired Next day Cap started a four inch double column notice in every paper in town I hired an army of distributers and began to put out the dodgers as they came hot off the bat then I got a couple of Guinea bands put them in open wagons done up with painted muslin announcements and sent them forth to tear off the melody and otherwise delight the eye and ear of the town As the big stuff came off the press it was slapped up on every blank wall and fence in the city that wasn t under guard and when the job was finished saint Louis fairly glared with it If there was a person who hadn t heard of the Talking Horse by the end of the week they must have been deaf dead or in jail The nag was to make his first appearance on Monday and the last sheet of paper had been put up and the last hand bill disposed of by Saturday afternoon How does she look says Cap to me when I came in Great says I If they ain t tearing the place down to get in on Monday why my bump of prophecy has a dent in it Let em come says Cap looking very much tickled We need the money and we ain t turning nobody away The horse has reached town and will be brought around to morrow morning so you make it a point to be on hand to let it and the handler in I was around bright and early on Sunday morning and along comes the horse He was got up in the swellest horse stuff I ever saw beaded blankets of plush and silk with his name embroidered on them and all that kind of goods The handler was a husky with one lamp and a bad one at that Where do I put him says he On the top floor says I We ve got planks on the stairs and a rigging fixed to haul him up by When we got him safely landed and the glad coverings off I looked him over His intellect must sort of tell on him don t it asks I Why he is some under weight says the fellow in charge He don t look over bright to me I goes on He never does on Sundays the husky comes back It s sort of an off day with him Then I went out to lunch and stayed about two hours when I got back I found a gang of cops and things buzzing all over the place Cap was in the office his plug hat on the back of his head and a cigar in his mouth What s the trouble says I Had a hell of a time around here says he I was called up on the phone and got down as soon as I could Just take an observation of that fellow over there The fellow referred to was the handler of the Talking Horse His left arm was done up in splints and bandaged from finger tips to shoulder and he had a clump of reporters around him about six feet thick What hit him asks I About everything on the top floor says Cap solemnly The Talking Horse is dead Mighty Mardo broke out of his showcase about an hour ago took a couple of half hitches around the Admiral and crushed him to death Go way says I Sure thing says Cap Come up stairs and have a look We went up and did so The place was a wreck the horse was the deadest I ever saw and the constrictor was still twined about him Why the snake s passed out too says I Cap folds his hands meekly across his breast in a resigned sort of way Yes says he he too was killed in the dreadful struggle He must have went straight for the Admiral as soon as he got loose The handler was down in the office alone when the uproar started he came jumping upstairs six steps to the jump and when he sees Mardo putting in that bunch of body holds on his intelligent charge why he took a hand The result was a dead snake for me and a crippled wing for him When I got here Doc Forbes was tying him up Cap goes on rather sorrowful like and when I sees what s happened I know that I m a ruined man So I phones for the police and reporters to come down and view my finish From the way he talked I expected to see him carted home before the hour was up but he wasn t As soon as the newspaper fellows cleared out with all the facts of the case in their note books Cap sends for a fellow and puts him right to work fixing up the horse and snake so s they ll keep and then lays them out Next morning the newspapers slopped over with scare headlines telling of the battle According to their way of looking at it the struggles in the arena of old Rome were scared to death in comparison and modern times did not come anywhere near showing a parallel of the combat between the terrible constrictor and the horse with the human voice The result of this was that when the time came to open the doors at noon we had to have a squad of police to keep the mob from blocking traffic for squares around Cap had changed and doubled the size of his ads over night The horse was done up in a big black coffin covered with flowers and the lid with his name age and wonderful accomplishment engraved upon a plate stood beside him The remains of Mighty Mardo stuffed with baled hay and excelsior were embracing the dead Admiral with monster coils and the crowds came gazed and marveled then they went forth to tell their friends that they might come and do likewise For weeks the coin came into the box like a spring freshet in the hill country and Cap must have kept the bank working after hours at any rate he sat around and smoked with a smile so angelic that to look at him one wondered how he could wear it and not drift away into the ethereal blue It was a good month before the thing lost its pulling power and when it stopped Cap had planted the stake that boosted him into the company he now keeps and set him to handling voices that cost thousands of simoleons an hour When all was over I found time to take the husky with the damaged fin out and throw a few drinks into him Then he told me the whole story The old man didn t think you could do the thing justice if you were wise says he so he kept you out This ain t the horse the fellow offered to sell him at all He bought it at a bazar for ten dollars the day before I brought it around When you went out for lunch Cap he comes in We done for the plug in a minute and as Mighty Marda was all but gone on account of his rat diet we finished him too Then we wrecked the place up some took a couple of turns about the horse with Mardo called in Doc Forbes who stood in to fix up the fictitious fracture and then rung in the show Yes observed Bat thoughtfully after a pause I ve made up my mind that H Wellington Sheldon is a wise plug THE OWL CRITIC BY JAMES T FIELDS Who stuffed that white owl No one spoke in the shop The barber was busy and he couldn t stop The customers waiting their turns were all reading The Daily the Herald the Post little heeding The young man who blurted out such a blunt question Not one raised a head or even made a suggestion And the barber kept on shaving Don t you see mister Brown Cried the youth with a frown How wrong the whole thing is How preposterous each wing is How flattened the head is how jammed down the neck is In short the whole owl what an ignorant wreck tis I make no apology I ve learned owl eology I ve passed days and nights in a hundred collections And can not be blinded to any deflections Arising from unskilful fingers that fail To stuff a bird right from his beak to his tail Mister Brown Mister Brown Do take that bird down Or you ll soon be the laughing stock all over town And the barber kept on shaving I ve studied owls And other night fowls And I tell you What I know to be true An owl can not roost With his limbs so unloosed No owl in this world Ever had his claws curled Ever had his legs slanted Ever had his bill canted Ever had his neck screwed Into that attitude He can t do it because Tis against all bird laws Anatomy teaches Ornithology preaches An owl has a toe That can t turn out so I ve made the white owl my study for years And to see such a job almost moves me to tears mister Brown I m amazed You should be so gone crazed As to put up a bird In that posture absurd To look at that owl really brings on a dizziness The man who stuffed him don t half know his business And the barber kept on shaving Examine those eyes I m filled with surprise Taxidermists should pass Off on you such poor glass So unnatural they seem They d make Audubon scream And John Burroughs laugh To encounter such chaff Do take that bird down Have him stuffed again Brown And the barber kept on shaving With some sawdust and bark I could stuff in the dark An owl better than that I could make an old hat Look more like an owl Than that horrid fowl Stuck up there so stiff like a side of coarse leather In fact about him there s not one natural feather Just then with a wink and a sly normal lurch The owl very gravely got down from his perch Walked round and regarded his fault finding critic Who thought he was stuffed with a glance analytic And then fairly hooted as if he should say Your learning s at fault this time anyway Don t waste it again on a live bird I pray I m an owl you re another Sir Critic good day And the barber kept on shaving THE MOSQUITO BY WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT Fair insect that with thread like legs spread out And blood extracting bill and filmy wing Dost murmur as thou slowly sail saint about In pitiless ears fall many a plaintive thing And tell how little our large veins should bleed Would we but yield them to thy bitter need Unwillingly I own and what is worse Full angrily men listen to thy plaint Thou gettest many a brush and many a curse For saying thou art gaunt and starved and faint Even the old beggar while he asks for food Would kill thee hapless stranger if he could I call thee stranger for the town I ween Has not the honor of so proud a birth Thou com saint from Jersey meadows fresh and green The offspring of the gods though born on earth For Titan was thy sire and fair was she The ocean nymph that nursed thy infancy Beneath the rushes was thy cradle swung And when at length thy gauzy wings grew strong Abroad to gentle airs their folds were flung Rose in the sky and bore thee soft along The south wind breathed to waft thee on thy way And danced and shone beneath the billowy bay Calm rose afar the city spires and thence Came the deep murmur of its throng of men And as its grateful odors met thy sense They seemed the perfumes of thy native fen Fair lay its crowded streets and at the sight Thy tiny song grew shriller with delight At length thy pinion fluttered in Broadway Ah there were fairy steps and white necks kissed By wanton airs and eyes whose killing ray Shone through the snowy veils like stars through mist And fresh as morn on many a cheek and chin Bloomed the bright blood through the transparent skin Sure these were sights to tempt an anchorite What do I hear thy slender voice complain Thou wailest when I talk of beauty s light As if it brought the memory of pain Thou art a wayward being well come near And pour thy tale of sorrow in mine ear What say saint thou slanderer rouge makes thee sick And China Bloom at best is sorry food And Rowland s Kalydor if laid on thick Poisons the thirsty wretch that bores for blood Go twas a just reward that met thy crime But shun the sacrilege another time That bloom was made to look at not to touch To worship not approach that radiant white And well might sudden vengeance light on such As dared like thee most impiously to bite Thou shouldst have gazed at distance and admired Murmured thy admiration and retired Thou rt welcome to the town but why come here To bleed a brother poet gaunt like thee Alas the little blood I have is dear And thin will be the banquet drawn from me Look round the pale eyed sisters in my cell Thy old acquaintance Song and Famine dwell Try some plump alderman and suck the blood Enriched by generous wine and costly meat On well filled skins sleek as thy native mud Fix thy light pump and press thy freckled feet Go to the men for whom in ocean s halls The oyster breeds and the green turtle sprawls There corks are drawn and the red vintage flows To fill the swelling veins for thee and now The ruddy cheek and now the ruddier nose Shall tempt thee as thou flittest round the brow And when the hour of sleep its quiet brings No angry hand shall rise to brush thy wings

With Tiddle iddle iddle iddle Bum Bum MY FIRST CIGAR BY ROBERT J BURDETTE Twas just behind the woodshed One glorious summer day Far o er the hills the sinking sun Pursued his westward way And in my safe seclusion Removed from all the jar And din of earth s confusion I smoked my first cigar It was my first cigar It was the worst cigar Raw green and dank hide bound and rank It was my first cigar Ah bright the boyish fancies Wrapped in the smoke wreaths blue My eyes grew dim my head was light The woodshed round me flew Dark night closed in around me Black night without a star Grim death methought had found me And spoiled my first cigar It was my first cigar A six for five cigar No viler torch the air could scorch It was my first cigar All pallid was my beaded brow The reeling night was late My startled mother cried in fear My child what have you ate I heard my father s smothered laugh It seemed so strange and far I knew he knew I knew he knew I d smoked my first cigar It was my first cigar A give away cigar I could not die I knew not why It was my first cigar Since then I ve stood in reckless ways I ve dared what men can dare I ve mocked at danger walked with death I ve laughed at pain and care I do not dread what may befall Neath my malignant star No frowning fate again can make Me smoke my first cigar I ve smoked my first cigar My first and worst cigar Fate has no terrors for the man Who s smoked his first cigar SHONNY SCHWARTZ BY CHARLES FOLLEN ADAMS Haf you seen mine leedle Shonny Shonny Schwartz Mit his hair so soft und yellow Und his face so blump und

CAPTAIN A Story of Steamboat Life on the Mississippi BY SOL SMITH Does any one remember the Caravan She was what would now be considered a slow boat then eighteen twenty seven she was regularly advertised as the fast running et cetera Her regular trips from New Orleans to Natchez were usually made in from six to eight days a trip made by her in five days was considered remarkable A voyage from New Orleans to Vicksburg and back including stoppages generally entitled the officers and crew to a month s wages Whether the Caravan ever achieved the feat of a voyage to the Falls Louisville I have never learned if she did she must have had a time of it It was my fate to take passage in this boat The Captain was a good natured easy going man careful of the comfort of his passengers and exceedingly fond of the game of brag We had been out a little more than five days and we were in hopes of seeing the bluffs of Natchez on the next day Our wood was getting low and night coming on The pilot on duty above the other pilot held three aces at the time and was just calling out the Captain who went it strong on three kings sent down word that the mate had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord The worthy Captain excused himself to the pilot whose watch was below and the two passengers who made up the party and hurried to the deck where he soon discovered by the landmarks that we were about half a mile from a woodyard which he said was situated right round yonder point But muttered the Captain I don t much like to take wood of the yellow faced old scoundrel who owns it he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than any one else however there s no other chance The boat was pushed to her utmost and in a little less than an hour when our fuel was about giving out we made the point and our cables were out and fastened to trees alongside of a good sized wood pile Hallo Colonel How d ye sell your wood this time A yellow faced old gentleman with a two weeks beard strings over his shoulders holding up to his armpits a pair of copperas colored linsey woolsey pants the legs of which reached a very little below the knee shoes without stockings a faded broad brimmed hat which had once been black and a pipe in his mouth casting a glance at the empty guards of our boat and uttering a grunt as he rose from fastening our spring line answered Why Capting we must charge you three and a quarter THIS time The d l replied the Captain captains did swear a little in those days what s the odd quarter for I should like to know You only charged me three as I went down Why Capting drawled out the wood merchant with a sort of leer on his yellow countenance which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold wood s riz since you went down two weeks ago besides you are awar that you very seldom stop going down when you re going up you re sometimes obleeged to give me a call becaze the current s aginst you and there s no other woodyard for nine miles ahead and if you happen to be nearly out of fooel why Well well interrupted the Captain we ll take a few cords under the circumstances and he returned to his game of brag In about half an hour we felt the Caravan commence paddling again Supper was over and I retired to my upper berth situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the Captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent We jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate How does that wood burn inquired the Captain of the mate who was looking on at the game Tisn t of much account I reckon answered the mate it s cottonwood and most of it green at that Well Thompson Three aces again stranger I ll take that X and the small change if you please It s your deal Thompson I say we d better take three or four cords at the next woodyard it can t be more than six miles from here Two aces and a bragger with the age Hand over those V s The game went on and the paddles kept moving At eleven o clock it was reported to the Captain that we were nearing the woodyard the light being distinctly seen by the pilot on duty Head her in shore then and take in six cords if it s good see to it Thompson I can t very well leave the game now it s getting right warm This pilot s beating us all to smash The wooding completed we paddled on again The Captain seemed somewhat vexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the last woodyard three and a quarter but soon again became interested in the game From my upper berth there were no staterooms then I could observe the movements of the players All the contention appeared to be between the Captain and the pilots the latter personages took it turn and turn about steering and playing brag one of them almost invariably winning while the two passengers merely went through the ceremony of dealing cutting and paying up their anties They were anxious to learn the game and they did learn it Once in a while indeed seeing they had two aces and a bragger they would venture a bet of five or ten dollars but they were always compelled to back out before the tremendous bragging of the Captain or pilot or if they did venture to call out on two bullits and a bragger they had the mortification to find one of the officers had the same kind of a hand and were more venerable Still with all these disadvantages they continued playing they wanted to learn the game At two o clock the Captain asked the mate how we were getting on Oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising This wood seems rather better than that we took in at Yellow Face s but we re nearly out again and must be looking out for more I saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail Yes yes replied the Captain ring the bell and ask em what s the price of wood up here I ve got you again here s double kings I heard the bell and the pilot s hail What s your price for wood A youthful voice on the shore answered Three and a quarter D net ejaculated the Captain who had just lost the price of two cords to the pilot the strangers suffering some at the same time three and a quarter again Are we never to get to a cheaper country Deal sir if you please better luck next time The other pilot s voice was again heard on deck How much have you Only about ten cords sir was the reply of the youthful salesman The Captain here told Thompson to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game The pilots here changed places When did they sleep Wood taken in the Caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual Day at length dawned The brag party broke up and settlements were being made during which operation the Captain s bragging propensities were exercised in cracking up the speed of his boat which by his reckoning must have made at least sixty miles and would have made many more if he could have procured good wood It appears the two passengers in their first lesson had incidentally lost one hundred and twenty dollars The Captain as he rose to see about taking in some good wood which he felt sure of obtaining now that he had got above the level country winked at his opponent the pilot with whom he had been on very bad terms during the progress of the game and said in an undertone Forty apiece for you and I and James the other pilot is not bad for one night I had risen and went out with the Captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs There was just fog enough to prevent the vision taking in more than sixty yards so I was disappointed in my expectation We were nearing the shore for the purpose of looking for wood the banks being invisible from the middle of the river There it is exclaimed the Captain stop her Ding ding ding went the big bell and the Captain hailed Hallo the woodyard Hallo yourself answered a squeaking female voice which came from a woman with a petticoat over her shoulders in place of a shawl What s the price of wood I think you ought to know the price by this time answered the old lady in the petticoat it s three and a qua a rter and now you know it Three and the d l broke in the Captain What have you raised on your wood too I ll give you three and not a cent more Well replied the petticoat here comes the old man he ll talk to you And sure enough out crept from the cottage the veritable faded hat copperas colored pants yellow countenance and two weeks beard we had seen the night before and the same voice we had heard regulating the price of cottonwood squeaked out the following sentence accompanied by the same leer of the same yellow countenance Why darn it all Capting there is but three or four cords left and since it s you I don t care if I do let you have it for three as you re a good customer After a quick glance at the landmarks around the Captain bolted and turned in to take some rest The fact became apparent the reader will probably have discovered it some time since that we had been wooding all night at the same woodyard WHEN THE ALLEGASH DRIVE GOES THROUGH BY HOLMAN F DAY We re spurred with the spikes in our soles There is water a swash in our boots Our hands are hard calloused by peavies and poles And we re drenched with the spume of the chutes We gather our herds at the head Where the axes have toppled them loose And down from the hills where the rivers are fed We harry the hemlock and spruce We hurroop them with the peavies from their sullen beds of snow With the pickpole for a goadstick down the brimming streams we go They are hitching they are halting and they lurk and hide and dodge They sneak for skulking eddies they bunt the bank and lodge And we almost can imagine that they hear the yell of saws And the grunting of the grinders of the paper mills because They loiter in the shallows and they cob pile at the falls And they buck like ugly cattle where the broad dead water crawls But we wallow in and welt em with the water to our waist For the driving pitch is dropping and the drouth is gasping Haste Here a dam and there a jam that is grabbed by grinning rocks Gnawed by the teeth of the ravening ledge that slavers at our flocks Twenty a month for daring Death for fighting from dawn to dark Twenty and grub and a place to sleep in God s great public park We roofless go with the cook s bateau to follow our hungry crew A billion of spruce and hell turned loose when the Allegash drive goes through My lad with the spurs at his heel Has a cattle ranch bronco to bust A thousand of Texans to wheedle and wheel To market through smother and dust But I with the peavy and pole Am driving the herds of the pine Grant to my brother what suits his soul But no bellowing brutes in mine He would wince to wade and wallow and I hate a horse or steer But we stand the kings of herders he for There and I for Here Though he rides with Death behind him when he rounds the wild stampede I will chop the jamming king log and I ll match him deed for deed And for me the greenwood savor and the lash across my face Of the spitting spume that belches from the back wash of the race The glory of the tumult where the tumbling torrent rolls With half a hundred drivers riding through with lunging poles Here s huzza for reckless chances Here s hurrah for those who ride Through the jaws of boiling sluices yeasty white from side to side Our brawny fists are calloused and we re mostly holes and hair But if grit were golden bullion we d have coin to spend and spare Here some rips and there the lips of a whirlpool s bellowing mouth Death we clinch and Time we fight for behind us gasps the Drouth Twenty a month bateau for a home and only a peep at town For our money is gone in a brace of nights after the drive is down But with peavies and poles and care free souls our ragged and roofless crew Swarms gayly along with whoop and song when the Allegash drive goes through End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Wit and Humor of America Volume VI of X by Various END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WIT AND HUMOR OF This file should
