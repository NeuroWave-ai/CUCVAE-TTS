agent at Chazy Junction came out of his little house at daybreak shivered a bit in the chill morning air and gave an involuntary start as he saw a private car on the sidetrack There were two private cars to be exact a sleeper and a baggage car and mister Judkins knew the three o clock train must have left them as it passed through Ah said he aloud the nabobs hev arrove Who are the nabobs asked a quiet voice beside him Again mister Judkins started he even stepped back a pace to get a better view of the stranger who had approached so stealthily through the dim light that the agent was unaware of his existence until he spoke Who be you he demanded eyeing the man suspiciously Never mind who I am retorted the other in a grumpy tone the original question is who are the nabobs See here young feller this ain t no place fer tramps observed mister Judkins frowning with evident displeasure Chazy Junction s got all it kin do to support its reg lar inhabitants You ll hev to move on The stranger sat down on a baggage truck and eyed the private car reflectively He wore a rough gray suit baggy and threadbare a flannel shirt with an old black tie carelessly knotted at the collar a brown felt hat with several holes in the crown and coarse cowhide shoes that had arrived at the last stages of usefulness You would judge him to be from twenty five to thirty years of age you would note that his face was browned from exposure that it was rather set and expressionless but in no way repulsive His eyes dark and retrospective were his most redeeming feature yet betrayed little of their owner s character mister Judkins could make nothing of the fellow beyond the fact that he was doubtless a tramp and on that account most unwelcome in this retired neighborhood Even tramps were unusual at Chazy Junction The foothills were sparsely settled and the inhabitants too humble to be attractive to gentlemen of the road while the rocky highways tortuous and uneven offered no invitation to the professional pedestrian You ll hev to move on repeated the agent more sternly I can t replied the other with a smile The car I was er attached to has come to a halt The engine has left us and here we are I and the nabobs Be n ridin the trucks eh No rear platform Very comfortable it was and no interruptions The crazy old train stopped so many times during the night that I scarcely woke up when they sidetracked us here and the first thing I knew I was abandoned in this wilderness As it grew light I began to examine my surroundings and discovered you Glad to meet you sir You needn t be Don t begrudge me the pleasure I implore you I can t blame you for being gruff and unsociable were you otherwise you wouldn t reside at at he turned his head to read the half legible sign on the station house at Chazy Junction I m familiar with most parts of the United States but Chazy Junction gets my flutters Why oh why in the world did it happen mister Judkins scowled but made no answer He was wise enough to understand he was no match in conversation for this irresponsible outcast who knew the great world as perfectly as the agent knew his junction He turned away and stared hard at the silent sleeper the appearance of which was not wholly unexpected You haven t informed me who the nabobs are nor why they choose to be sidetracked in this forsaken stone quarry remarked the stranger eyeing the bleak hills around him in the growing light of dawn The agent hesitated His first gruff resentment had been in a manner disarmed and he dearly loved to talk especially on so interesting a subject as the nabobs He knew he could astonish the tramp and the temptation to do so was too strong to resist It s the great John Merrick who s got millions to burn but don t light many bonfires he began not very graciously at first Two years ago he bought the Cap n Wegg farm over by Millville an Where s Millville inquired the man Seven mile back in the hills The farm ain t nuthin but cobblestone an pine woods but How big is Millville Quite a town Eleven stores an houses sides the mill an a big settlement buildin up at Royal where the new paper mill is jest started Royal s four mile up the Little Bill Hill But about the nabob mister Merrick I think you called him Yes John Merrick He bought the Cap n Wegg place an spent summer fore last on it him an his three gals as is his nieces Oh three girls Yes Clever gals too Stirred things up some at Millville I kin tell you stranger Lib ral an good natured but able to hold their own with the natives We missed em last year but t other day I seen ol Hucks that keeps their house for em he n his wife an Hucks said they was cumin to spend this summer at the farm an he was lookin fer em any day The way they togged up thet farmhouse is somethin won erful I m told Hain t seen it myself but a whole carload o furnitoor an then some more was shipped here from New York an Peggy McNutt over t Millville says it must a cost a for tun The tramp nodded somewhat listlessly I feel quite respectable this morning having passed the night as the guest of a millionaire he observed mister Merrick didn t know it of course or he would have invited me inside Like enough answered the agent seriously The nabob s thet reckless an unaccountable he s likely to do worse ner that That s what makes him an his gals interestin nobody in quarries How about breakfast friend Judkins That s my business an not yourn My missus never feeds tramps Rather ungracious to travelers eh Ef you re a traveler go to the hoe tel yonder an buy your breakfas like a man Thank you I may follow your advice The agent walked up the track and put out the semaphore lights for the sun was beginning to rise over the hills By the time he came back a colored porter stood on the platform of the private car and nodded to him Folks up yit asked Judkins Dressing seh Goin ter feed em in there Not dis mohnin Dey ll breakfas at de hotel Carriage here yit Not yit I s pose ol Hucks ll drive over for em said the agent Dey s spectin some one seh As fer me I gotta live heah all day an it makes me sick teh think of it Heh retorted the agent scornfully you won t git sick You re too well paid fer that The porter grinned and just then a little old gentleman with a rosy cheery face pushed him aside and trotted down the steps Mornin Judkins he cried and shook the agent s hand What a glorious sunrise and what crisp delicious air Ah but it s good to be in old Chazy County again The agent straightened up his face wreathed with smiles and cast an I told you so glance toward the man on the truck But the stranger had disappeared CHAPTER II THE INVASION OF MILLVILLE Over the brow of the little hill appeared a three seated wagon drawn by a pair of handsome sorrels and in a moment the equipage halted beside the sleeper Oh Thomas Hucks you dear dear Thomas cried a clear eager voice and out from the car rushed Miss Patricia Doyle to throw her arms about the neck of the old stoop shouldered and white haired driver whose face was illumined by a joyous smile Glad to see ye Miss Patsy right glad ndeed child returned the old man But others were waiting to greet him pretty Beth De Graf and dainty Louise Merrick not Louise Merrick any longer though but bearing a new name she had recently acquired and demure Mary Patsy s little maid and an old friend of Thomas Hucks and Uncle John with his merry laugh and cordial handshake and finally a tall and rather dandified young man who remained an interested spectator in the background until mister Merrick seized and dragged him forward Here s another for you to know Thomas said the little millionaire This is the other half of our Louise mister Arthur Weldon and by and by you can judge whether he s the better half or not The aged servant hat in hand made a respectful bow to mister Weldon His frank eyes swept the young man from head to foot but his smile was the same as before Miss Louise is wiser ner I be said the old fellow simply I m safe to trust to her jedgment I guess There was a general laugh at this and they began to clamber aboard the wagon and to stow away beneath the seats the luggage the colored porter was bringing out Stop at the Junction House Thomas said mister Merrick as they moved away Nora has the breakfast all ready at home sir replied Thomas Good for Nora But we can t fast until we reach home eight good miles of jolting so we ll stop at the Junction House for a glass of missus Todd s famous milk Very good sir Is anyone coming for our trunks and freight There s half a car of truck to be carted over Ned s on the way sir and he ll get the liveryman to help if he can t carry it all The Junction House was hidden from the station by the tiny hill as were the half dozen other buildings tributary to Chazy Junction As the wagon drew up before the long piazza which extended along the front of the little frame inn they saw a man in shabby gray seated at a small table with some bread and a glass of milk before him It was their unrecognized guest of the night the uninvited lodger on the rear platform but he did not raise his eyes or appear to notice the new arrivals missus Todd Hey missus Todd called Uncle John Anybody milked the cow yet A frowsy looking woman came out all smiles and nodded pleasantly at the expectant group in the wagon Behind her loomed the tall lean form of Lucky Todd the proprietor who was serious as a goat which animal he closely resembled in feature Breakfas all round mister Merrick asked the woman Not this time missus Todd Nora has our breakfast waiting for us But we want some of your delicious milk to last us to the farm Las night s milkin s half cream by this time she rejoined as she briskly reentered the house The man at the table held out his empty glass Here fill this up he said to Lucky Todd The somber faced proprietor turned his gaze from the Merrick group to the stranger eyed him pensively a moment and then faced the wagon again The man in gray got up placed the empty glass in Todd s hand whirled him around facing the door and said sternly More milk The landlord walked in like an automaton and a suppressed giggle came from the girls in the wagon Uncle John was likewise amused and despite the unknown s frazzled apparel the little millionaire addressed him in the same tone he would have used toward an equal Don t blame you sir Nobody ever tasted better milk than they have at the Junction House The man who had resumed his seat stood up took off his hat and bowed But he made no reply Out came missus Todd accompanied by another frowsy woman Between them they bore a huge jug of milk a number of thick glasses and a plate of crackers The crackers come extry mister Merrick said the landlady but seein as milk s cheap I thought you might like em The landlord now came out and placed the stranger s glass about half filled with milk on the table before him The man looked at it frowned and tossed off the milk in one gulp More he said holding out the glass Todd shook his head Ain t no more he declared His wife overheard him and pausing in her task of refilling the glasses for the rich man s party she looked over her shoulder and said Give him what he wants Lucky The landlord pondered Not fer ten cents Nancy he protested The feller said he wanted ten cents wuth o breakfas an by Joe he s had it Milk s cheap remarked missus Todd It s crackers as is expensive these days Fill up his glass Lucky Why is your husband called Lucky missus Todd inquired Patsy who was enjoying the cool creamy milk Cause he got me to manage him I guess was the laughing reply Todd ain t much count nless I m on the spot to order him round The landlord came out with the glass of milk but paused before he set it down Let s see your money he said suspiciously It seemed to the girls who were curiously watching the scene that the tramp flushed under his bronzed skin but without reply he searched in a pocket and drew out four copper cents which he laid upon the table After further exploration he abstracted a nickel from another pocket and pushed the coins toward the landlord Nother cent said Todd Continued search seemed for a time hopeless but at last in quite an unexpected way the man produced the final cent and on receiving it Todd set down the milk Anything more yer honor he asked sarcastically Yes you might bring me the morning paper was the reply Everyone except Todd laughed frankly at this retort Uncle John put two silver dollars in missus Todd s chubby hand and told Thomas to drive on I dunno remarked old Hucks when they were out of earshot whether that feller s jest a common tramp or a workman goin over to the paper mill at Royal Jedgin from the fact as he had money I guess he s a workman Wrong Thomas quite wrong said Beth seated just behind him Did you notice his hands No Miss Beth They were not rough and the fingers were slender and delicate That s the mark of a cracksman said Arthur Weldon with a laugh If there are any safes out here that are worth cracking I d say look out for the gentleman His face isn t bad at all remarked Patsy reflectively Isn t there any grade between a workman and a thief Of course asserted mister Merrick in his brisk way This fellow shabby as he looked might be anything from a strolling artist to a gentleman down on his luck But what s the news Thomas How are Ethel and Joe mister an missus Wegg is quite comf t ble sir thank you replied old Hucks with a show of eagerness Miss Ethel s gran ther ol Will Thompson he s dead you know an the young folks hev fixed up the Thompson house like a palace Guess ye d better speak to em about spendin so much money mister Merrick I m fraid they may need it some day Don t worry They ve a fine income for life Thomas and there will be plenty to leave to their children if they have any But tell me about the mill at Royal Where is Royal anyhow Four mile up the Little Bill Creek sir where the Royal Waterfall is A feller come an looked the place over las year an said the pine forest would grind up inter paper an the waterfall would do the grindin So he bought a mile o forest an built a mill an they do say things is hummin up to the new settlement There s more n two hundred hands a workin there a ready Goodness me cried Patsy this thing must have livened up sleepy old Millville considerably Not yet said Hucks shaking his head The comp ny what owns the mill keeps a store there for the workmen an none of em come much to Millville Our storekeepers is madder n blazes about it but fer my part I m glad the two places is separated Why asked Louise They re a kinder tough lot I guess Turnin pine trees inter paper mus be a job thet takes more muscle than brains I don t see how it s done at all It s simple enough said mister Merrick First the wood is ground into pulp and then the pulp is run through hot rollers coming out paper It s a mighty interesting process so some day we will all go to Royal and see the paper made But not just yet Uncle remarked Patsy Let s have time to settle down on the farm and enjoy it Oh how glad I am to be back in this restful sleepy jumping off place of the world again Isn t it delightful Arthur Weldon Did you ever breathe such ozony delicious mountain air And do you get the fragrance of the pine forests and the the The bumps asked Arthur as the wagon gave a jolt a bit more emphatic than usual yes Patsy dear I get them all but I won t pass judgment on Millville and Uncle John s farm just yet Are we most there We re to have four whole months of it sighed Beth That ought to enable us to renew our youth after the strenuous winter Rubbish said Uncle John You haven t known a strenuous moment my dears and you re all too young to need renewals anyhow But if you can find happiness here my girls our old farm will become a paradise These three nieces of mister Merrick were well worth looking at Louise the eldest was now twenty entirely too young to be a bride but having decided to marry Arthur Weldon the girl would brook no interference and having a will of her own overcame all opposition Her tall slender form was exceedingly graceful and willowy her personality dainty and refined her temperament under ordinary conditions essentially sweet and agreeable In crises Louise developed considerable character in strong contrast with her usual assumption of well bred composure That the girl was insincere in little things and cultivated a polished manner to conceal her real feelings is undeniable but in spite of this she might be relied upon to prove loyal and true in emergencies Patricia Doyle was more than two years the junior of her cousin Louise and very unlike her Patsy s old father Major Gregory Doyle said she wore her heart on her sleeve and the girl was frank and outspoken to a fault Patsy had no figure to speak of being somewhat dumpy in build nor were her piquant features at all beautiful Her nose tipped at the end her mouth was broad and full lipped and her complexion badly freckled But Patsy s hair was of that indescribable shade that hovers between burnished gold and sunset carmine Fiery red she was wont to describe it and most people considered it very justly one of her two claims to distinction Her other admirable feature was a pair of magnificent deep blue eyes merry mischievous and scintillating as diamonds Few could resist those eyes and certain it is that Patsy Doyle was a universal favorite and won friends without a particle of effort The younger of the three nieces Elizabeth De Graf was as beautiful a girl as you will often discover one of those rarely perfect creations that excite our wonder and compel admiration as a beautiful picture or a bit of statuary will Dreamy and reserved in disposition she lacked the graciousness of Louise and Patsy s compelling good humor yet you must not think her stupid or disagreeable Her reserve was really diffidence her dreamy expressionless gaze the result of a serious nature and a thoughtful temperament Beth was quite practical and matter of fact the reverse of Patsy s imaginative instincts or Louise s affected indifference Those who knew Beth De Graf best loved her dearly but strangers found her hard to approach and were often repulsed by her unresponsive manner Underneath all the girl was a real girl with many splendid qualities and Uncle John relied upon Beth s stability more than on that of his other two nieces Her early life had been a stormy and unhappy one so she was but now developing her real nature beneath the warmth of her uncle s protecting love Topping the brow of a little hill the wagon came to a smooth downward grade where the road met the quaint old bridge that spanned Little Bill Creek beside which stood the antiquated flour and feed mill that had given Millville its name The horses were able to maintain their brisk trot across the bridge and through the main street of the town which was merely a cluster of unimposing frame buildings that lined either side of the highway for the space of an ordinary city block Then they were in the wilds again and rattling over another cobblestone trail This ere country s nuth n but pine woods n cobblestones sighed old Hucks as the horses subsided to a walk Lor knows what would a happened to us without the trees They saves our grace so s to speak I think the scenery is beautiful observed Patsy It s so different from other country places Not much farming around here I imagine said Arthur Weldon More than you d think sir replied Thomas There s certain crops as thrives in stony land an a few miles north o here towards Huntingdon the soil s mighty rich n productive Things ain t never as bad as they seem in this world sir he added turning his persistently smiling face toward the young man mister Merrick sat beside the driver on the front seat The middle seat was occupied by Patsy and Beth between whom squeezed little Mary the maid Louise and Arthur had the back seat A quarter of a mile beyond the town they came to a sort of lane running at right angles with the turnpike and down this lane old Hucks turned his team It seemed like a forbidding prospect for ahead of them loomed only a group of tall pines marking the edge of the forest yet as they came nearer and made a little bend in the road the Wegg farm suddenly appeared in view The house seemed so cozy and homelike set upon its green lawn with the tall pines for a background that the girls who knew the place well exclaimed with delight and Arthur who now saw it for the first time nodded his head approvingly Uncle John was all excitement over the arrival at his country home An old fashioned stile was set in a rail fence which separated the grounds from the lane and Hucks drew up the wagon so his passengers could all alight upon the step of the stile Patsy was out at a bound Louise followed more deliberately assisted by her boy husband and Beth came more sedately yet But Uncle John rode around to the barn with Thomas being eager to see the cows and pigs and poultry with which the establishment was liberally stocked The house was of two stories the lower being built of cobblestones and the upper of pine slabs but it had been artistically done and the effect was delightful It was a big rambling dwelling and mister Merrick had furnished the old place in a lavish manner so that his nieces would lack no modern comfort when they came there to spend a summer On the porch stood an old woman clothed in a neat gingham dress and wearing a white apron and cap Her pleasant face was wreathed in smiles as she turned it toward the laughing chattering group that came up the path Patsy spied her and rushed up to give old Nora a hug and kiss and the other two girls saluted the blind woman with equal cordiality for long ago she had won the love and devotion of all three Arthur who had heard of Nora pressed her hand and told her she must accept him as another of her children and then she asked for mister Merrick and ran in to get the breakfast served For although blind old Nora was far from being helpless and the breakfast she had prepared in anticipation of their arrival was as deliciously cooked as if she had been able to use her eyes as others did CHAPTER III THE DAWN OF A GREAT ENTERPRISE The great enterprise was sprung on mister Merrick the very morning following his arrival at the farm Breakfast was over and a group had formed upon the shady front lawn where chairs benches and hammocks were scattered in profusion Well Uncle how do you like it asked Louise Are you perfectly comfortable and happy now we ve escaped so far from the city that its humming life is a mere memory Happy as a clam responded Uncle John leaning back in his chair with his feet on a foot rest If I only had the morning paper there would be nothing else to wish for The paper That s what that queer tramp at the Junction House asked for remarked Beth The first thought of even a hobo was for a morning paper I wonder why men are such slaves to those gossipy things Phoo cried Patsy we re all slaves to them Show me a person who doesn t read the daily journals and keep abreast of the times and I ll show you a dummy Patsy s right remarked Arthur Weldon The general intelligence and cosmopolitan knowledge of the people are best cultivated by the newspapers The superiority of our newspapers has been a factor in making us the greatest nation on earth for we are the best informed My what big words exclaimed Louise It is quite true said Uncle John soberly that I shall miss our daily paper during our four months retirement in these fascinating wilds It s the one luxury we can t enjoy in our country retreat Why not asked Patsy with startling abruptness while a queer expression as of an inspiration stole over her bright face Chump said Beth drily you know very well why not Patsy Doyle Mooley cows and the fourth estate don t intermingle so to speak They can be made to though declared Patsy Why hasn t some one thought of it before Uncle John girls I propose we start a daily paper Louise laughed softly Beth s lip curled and Arthur Weldon cast an amused glance at the girl but Uncle John stared seriously into Patsy s questioning blue eyes How he asked in a puzzled tone If anything could interest this eccentric little millionaire more than the usual trend of events it was an original proposition of this sort He loved to do things that other people had not attempted nor even thought of He hated conversational platitudes and established conventions and his nieces had endeared themselves to him more by their native originality and frank disregard of ordinary feminine limitations than in any other way It was generally conceded that Patsy was his favorite because she could advance more odd suggestions than the other girls and this niece had a practical aptitude for carrying out her whimsical ideas that had long since won her uncle s respect Not that she could outdo mister Merrick in eccentricity that was admitted to be his special province in which he had no rival but the girl was so clever a confederate that she gave her erratic uncle much happiness of the sort he most appreciated Therefore this seemingly preposterous proposition to establish a daily paper on a retired country farm did not strike the old gentleman as utterly impossible and anything within the bounds of possibility was sure to meet his earnest consideration especially when it was proposed by one of his favorite nieces How responded Patsy why it s easy enough Uncle We ll buy a press hire a printer and Beth and Louise will help me edit the paper I m sure I can exhibit literary talents of a high order once they are encouraged to sprout Louise writes lovely poetry and stories of human interest and Beth I can t write even a good letter asserted that young lady but I d dearly love to edit a newspaper Of course agreed Louise we all would And I think we could turn out a very creditable paper for Millville But wouldn t it cost a lot of money That isn t the present question replied Uncle John The main thing is do you girls want to be tied down to such a task Every day in the week all during our summer holiday Why you ve made our whole lives a holiday Uncle John interrupted Patsy and we ve been so coddled and swamped with luxuries that we are just now in serious danger of being spoiled You don t want three spoiled nieces on your hands do you And please make allowance for our natural impetuosity and eagerness to be up and doing We love the farm but our happiness here would be doubled if we had some occupation to keep us busy and this philanthropic undertaking would furnish us with no end of fun even while we were benefiting our fellow man All jabber dear exclaimed Beth I admit the fun but where does the philanthropy come in Don t you see asked Patsy Both Uncle John and that tramp we encountered have met on common ground to bewail the lack of a daily newspaper in our midst to speak in journalistic parlance At the paper mill at Royal are over two hundred workmen moaning in despair while they lose all track of the world s progress At Huntingdon not five miles distant are four or five hundred people lacking all the educational advantages of an up to date or is down to date proper press And Millville good gracious What would sleepy Millville folks think of having a bright newsy metropolitan newspaper left on their doorsteps every morning or evening as the case may be H m said Uncle John I scent a social revolution in the wilds of Chazy County Let s start it right away cried Patsy The Millville Tribune 
1472_285314_000018_000003	train-clean-360	What do you say 
none	none	girls Why Tribune asked Louise Because we three will run it and we re a triumvirate the future tribunal of the people in this district Very good said Uncle John nodding approval A clever idea Patsy But it s all nonsense sir observed Arthur Weldon in astonishment Have you any idea of the details of this thing you are proposing None whatever said the little millionaire That s the beauty of the scheme Arthur it may lead us into a reg lar complicated mix up and the joy of getting untangled ought to repay us for all our bother Perhaps so if you ever untangle said the young man smiling at the whimsical speech Then he turned to his young bride Do you want to go into this thing Louise he asked Of course I do she promptly replied It s the biggest thing in the way of a sensation that Patsy s crazy brain has ever evolved and I ll stand by the Millville Tribune to the last You mustn t forget Arthur that I shall be able to publish all my verses and stories which the Century and Harpers so heartlessly turned down And Beth Oh I m in it too declared Beth There s something so delightfully mysterious and bewildering in the idea of our editing and printing a daily paper here in Millville that I can hardly wait to begin the experiment It s no experiment whatever asserted Patsy boldly The daily newspaper is an established factor in civilization and whatever man has done man can do an adage that applies equally to girls Have you any notion of the cost of an outfit such as is required to print a modern daily asked Arthur Oh two or three hundred perhaps but You re crazy child That wouldn t buy the type Nevertheless began Patsy argumentatively but her uncle stopped her You needn t figure on that he said hastily The outfit shall be my contribution to the enterprise If you girls say you re anxious and willing to run a newspaper I ll agree to give you a proper start Oh thank you Uncle Of course we re willing It is all absolutely settled so far as we are concerned said Patsy firmly How long will it take to get the things here Uncle mister Merrick considered a moment There s a long distance telephone over at Cotting s General Store in town he said I ll drive over and get Major Doyle on the wire and have him order the stuff sent out at once Oh no protested Patsy don t tell daddy of this plan please He d think we were all fit subjects for the lunatic asylum Major Doyle wouldn t be far wrong in that conclusion suggested Arthur I d like to surprise him by sending him the first copy of the Millville Tribune added the major s daughter Then said mister Merrick I ll call up Marvin my banker He ll perhaps attend to the matter more understandingly and more promptly than the major would Tell Hucks to harness Joe to the buggy Patsy and I ll go at once We ll all go exclaimed Beth Of course added Louise we are all equally interested in this venture So Patsy had old Hucks hitch Joe to the surrey and the three girls accompanied their uncle in his drive to town leaving Arthur Weldon shaking his head in a deprecating way but fully realizing that no protest of his would avail to prevent this amazing undertaking That old man is as much a child as Beth or Patsy he reflected It puzzles me to explain how he made all those millions with so little worldly wisdom CHAPTER IV THE WAY INTO PRINT Sam Cotting s General Store at Millville divided importance with Bob West s hardware store but was a more popular loafing place for the sparse population of the tiny town The post office was located in one corner and the telephone booth in another and this latter institution was regarded with much awe by the simple natives Once in awhile some one would telephone over to the Junction on some trivial business but the long distance call was never employed except by the nabobs the local name for John Merrick and his nieces or by the manager of the new mill at Royal who had extended the line to his own office in the heart of the pine forest So when Uncle John and the girls entered Cotting s store and the little gentleman shut himself up in the telephone booth a ripple of excitement spread throughout the neighborhood Skim Clark the youthful hope of the Widow Clark who run the Emporium happened to be in the store and he rushed out to spread the news that the nabob s talkin to New Yoruk This information demanded immediate attention Marshall McMahon McNutt familiarly known as Peggy McNutt because he had once lost a foot in a mowing machine and who was alleged to be a real estate agent horse doctor fancy poultry breeder and palmist and who also dabbled in the sale of subscription books life insurance liniment and watermelons quickly slid off his front porch across the way and sauntered into Cotting s to participate in the excitement Seth Davis the blacksmith dropped his tools and hurried to the store and the druggist three doors away a dapper gentleman known as Nib Corkins hurriedly locked his door and attended the meeting Presently the curious group was enlarged by the addition of Nick Thome the liveryman Lon Taft a carpenter and general man of all work and Silas Caldwell the miller the latter a serious individual who had jest happened to come acrost from the mill in the nick o time Sam Cotting being himself of great local importance had never regarded with favor the rivalry of the nabob but he placed stools near the telephone booth for the three girls who accepted the courtesy with a graciousness that ought to have disarmed the surly storekeeper They could not fail to be amused at the interest they excited and as they personally knew every one of the town people they pleasantly nodded to each arrival and inquired after their health and the welfare of their families The replies were monosyllables Millville folks were diffident in the presence of these city visitors and while they favored the girls with rather embarrassing stares their chief interest was centered on the little man in the telephone booth who could plainly be seen through the glass door but might not be heard however loudly he shouted Talkin to New Yoruk was yet a marvelous thing to them and much speculation was exchanged in low tones as to the probable cost of such a conversation as mister Merrick was now indulging in Costs a dollar to connect ye know remarked Peggy McNutt to Ned Long Bet a cookie he s runnin the blame bill up to two dollars with all this chinnin Why can t th ol nabob write a letter like common folks an give his extry cash to the poor Meanin you Peggy asked Nib Corkins with a chuckle He might do wuss ner that retorted Peggy Lor knows I m poor enough You don t ketch me a talkin to New York at a dollar a throw Nib do ye Meantime mister Merrick had succeeded in getting mister Marvin of the banking house of Isham Marvin company on the wire Do me a favor Marvin he said Hunt up the best supply house and have them send me a complete outfit to print a daily newspaper Everything must be modern you know and don t let them leave out anything that might come handy Then go to Corrigan the superintendent of the railroad and have him send the freight up here to Chazy Junction by a special engine for I don t want a moment s delay and the regular freight takes a week or so Charge everything to my account and impress upon the dealer the need of haste Understand all that Marvin I think I do sir was the reply but that s a pretty big order mister Merrick The outfit for a modern daily will cost a small fortune Never mind send it along Very well But you d better give me some details How big a newspaper do you want to print Hold the wire and I ll find out said Uncle John Then he opened the door of the booth and said Patsy how big a thing do you want to print How big Oh let me see Four pages will do won t it Louise Plenty I should say for this place answered Louise And how many columns to a page asked Uncle John Oh six or seven That s regular I guess Make it six proposed Beth That will keep us busy enough All right said Uncle John and closed the door again This conversation was of the most startling nature to the assembled villagers who were all trying to look unconcerned and as if they d jest dropped in but were unable to dissemble their curiosity successfully Of course much of this interchange of words between the man in the booth and the girls outside was Greek to them all but to print and columns and pages could apply only to one idea which while not fully grasped was tremendously startling in its suggestion The Merrick party was noted for doing astonishing things in the past and evidently in the words of Peggy McNutt they were up to some blame foolishness that ll either kill this neighborhood or make it talked about It s too dead a ready to kill responded Nick Thorne gloomily Even the paper mill four mile away ain t managed to make Millville wiggle its big toe Don t you worry over what the nabob ll do Peggy he couldn t hurt nuthin if he tried The door opened again and mister Merrick protruded a puzzled countenance He wants to know about a stereotype plant Patsy What ll I tell him Patsy stared Louise and Beth shook their heads If it belongs to the the thing we want Uncle have em send it along said Patsy in desperation All right A few minutes later the little man again appealed to them How ll we run the thing girls steam or electricity Patsy s face was a blank Beth giggled and Louise frowned Of course it ll have to be run suggested mister Merrick but how That s the question I I hadn t given that matter thought admitted Patsy What do you think Uncle He considered holding open the door while he thoughtfully regarded the silent but interested group of villagers that eagerly hung upon every word that passed Cotting called mister Merrick how do they run the paper mill at Royal Lectricity Lectricity sir answered half a dozen at once They develops the power from the Royal Waterfall of the Little Bill explained Cotting with slow and pompous deliberation mister Skeelty he tol me they had enough lectric ty to light up the whole dum country fer ten mile in all directions sides a runnin of the mill Who s Skeelty Manager o the mill sir an part owner he says Has he a telephone Yes mister Merrick Thank you mister Merrick shut the door and called up Skeelty Five minutes of bargaining settled the question and he then connected with mister Marvin again and directed him to have the presses and machinery equipped to run by electricity Thinking he had now given the banker all the commissions he could attend to with celerity Uncle John next called up Major Doyle and instructed his brother in law to send four miles of electric cable with fittings and transformers and a crew of men to do the work and not to waste a moment s time in getting them to Millville What in blazes are ye up to now John inquired the major on receiving this order None of your business Gregory Obey orders Going to light the farm and turn night into day persisted the major This is Patsy s secret and I m not going to give it away said mister Merrick Attend to this matter promptly Major and you ll see the result when you come to us in July for your vacation Having attended to all the requirements of the projected Millville Tribune as he thought mister Merrick called the operator for the amount of his bill and paid it to Sam Cotting three dollars and eighty cents The sum fairly made the onlookers gasp and as the Merrick party passed out Silas the miller said solemnly Don t anybody tell me talk is cheap arter this John Merrick may be a millionaire but ef he keeps this thing up long he ll be a pauper Thet s my prophe sigh Yer off yer base Si said McNutt Joe Wegg tol me once thet the nabob s earnin s on his money were more n he could spend ef he lays awake nights a doin it Joe says it keeps pilin up on him till sometimes it drives him nigh desp rit I hed an idee I d ask him to shuck off some of it onter me I could stan the strain all right an get plenty o sleep too Ye won t hev no call to stan it Peggy pre dcted Lon Tait Milyunhairs may spend money foolish but they don t never give none away I ve done sev ral odd jobs fer mister Merrick but he s never give me more n jest wages Well said McNutt with a sigh while he s in easy reach there orter be some sort o pickings fer us an it s our duty to git all we can out n him short o actoo al robbery What do ye s pose this new deal means boys Sounds like printin somethin don t it P raps it s some letterheads fer the Wegg Farm suggested Nib Corkins These Merricks do everything on a big scale Four pages an six columns to a page asked Cotting scornfully Sounds to me more like a newspaper folks There was a moment s silence during which they all stared at the speaker fearfully Then said Skim Clark in his drawling halting way Ef thet s the case an there s goin ter be a newspaper here in Millville we may as well give up the struggle fer the town ll be ruined CHAPTER V DIVIDING THE RESPONSIBILITY The rest of that day and a good share of the night was devoted to an earnest consultation concerning the proper methods of launching the Millville Daily Tribune We must divide the work said Patsy so that all will have an equal share of responsibility Louise is to be the literary editor and the society editor That sounds like a good combination There is no society here objected Louise Not as we understand the term perhaps replied Miss Doyle but every community however small believes it is a social center and so it is to itself If there is a dance or a prayer meeting or a christening or illness it must be recorded in our local columns If Bob West sells a plow we ve got to mention the name of the farmer who bought it if there s a wedding we ll make a double header of it if a baby is born we will will Print its picture in the paper Eh Uncle John This from Beth Of course said mister Merrick You must print all the home news as well as the news of the world How are you going to get the news of the world asked Arthur How How That was my question Private wire from New York said mister Merrick as the girls hesitated how to meet this problem I ll arrange with the telegraph company to morrow to have an extension of the wire run over from Chazy Junction Then we ll hire an operator a girl of course to receive the news in the office of the paper But who will send us the news asked Beth The Associated Press I suppose or some news agency in New York I ll telegraph to morrow to Marvin to arrange it Arthur whistled softly This newspaper is going to cost something he murmured Uncle John looked at him with a half quizzical half amused expression That s what Marvin warned me yesterday when I ordered the equipment said he He told me that before I got through with this deal it would run up into the thousands And he added that Millville wasn t worth it And what did you say to that Uncle John asked Beth In that case I said I would be sure to get some pleasure and satisfaction out of your journalistic enterprise My last financial statement showed a frightful condition of affairs In spite of Major Doyle s reckless investments of my money and and the little we manage to give to deserving charities I m getting richer every day When a small leak like this newspaper project occurs it seems that Fortune is patting me on the back I ve no idea what a respectable newspaper will cost but I hope it will cost a lot for every dollar it devours makes my mind just that much easier Arthur Weldon laughed In that case sir said he I can make no further protest But I predict you will find the bills eh eh entirely satisfactory You mentioned an office just now Uncle observed Louise Must we have a business office To be sure mister Merrick replied We must find a proper location where we can install the presses and all the type and machinery that go to making up a newspaper I hadn t thought of this before but it is a serious matter my dears We may have to build a place Oh that would take too long entirely said Patsy Can t we put it in the barn Uncle What would happen to the horses and cows No we ll take a look over Millville and see what we can find there You won t find much predicted Beth I can t think of a single unoccupied building in the town Then we ll put it in a tent declared Patsy Don t borrow trouble advised Uncle John Wait till we ve gone over the ground together Our truck will require a pretty big place for Marvin said one freight car wouldn t hold all the outfit He s going to send two cars anyhow Have him fill up the second with print paper proposed Arthur Ah that s another thing I hadn t thought of said mister Merrick How big a daily edition will you print Patsy Let s see pondered the girl There are about two hundred at Royal say four hundred at Huntingdon at Millville about about Say fifteen said Uncle John that s six hundred and fifteen and And the farmers of course There must be at least a hundred and fifty of em in the county so that makes seven hundred and seventy five copies a day Wait a moment cried Arthur somewhat bewildered by this figuring Do you suppose every inhabitant man woman and child will subscribe for your paper Patsy blushed Why no of course not she acknowledged frankly How many do you think will subscribe Arthur Remember it s to be a great newspaper Four pages of six columns each Plenty big enough for Millville he said thoughtfully My advice girls is to print a first edition of about four hundred copies and distribute the papers free in every house within a radius of five or six miles from Millville These will be samples and after the people have had a chance to read them you can ask them to subscribe By the way what will you charge for subscription How much Uncle asked Patsy appealingly A penny paper is the most popular he said regarding her with merry twinkling eyes Say thirty cents a month or three fifty a year That s as much as these poor people can stand I think so too replied the girl seriously But it seems to me a penny paper isn t dignified pouted Louise I had intended to print all my poems in it and I m sure that ought to make it worth at least five cents a copy That will make it worth more my dear commented Uncle John but frequently one must sell property for less than it s actually worth You must remember these people have not been used to spending much money on literature and I imagine you ll have to coax them to spend thirty cents a month Many of the big New York papers are sold for a penny and without any loss of dignity either Do you think we can make it pay on that basis Uncle asked Beth Uncle John coughed to gain time while he thought of a suitable reply That my dear he informed his niece will depend upon how many subscribers you can get Subscribers and advertisers are necessary to make any paper pay Advertisers Of course said practical Beth Every merchant in Millville and Huntingdon will naturally advertise in our paper and we ll make the major get us a lot from New York Oh said Patsy I see So that difficulty is settled Arthur smiled but held his peace Uncle John s round face was growing merrier every minute Patsy do you think we shall make any money from this venture asked Louise We ought to if we put our hearts and souls into the thing was the reply But before we divide any profits we must pay back to Uncle John the original investment We don t especially care to make any profit do we inquired Beth It s fun for us you know and a a great educational experience and and a fine philanthropy and all that We don t need the money so if the paper pays a profit at a cent a copy we d better cut down the price Don t do that yet advised Uncle John soberly There will be expenses that as yet you don t suspect and a penny for a paper is about as low as you can go What s to be my position on the staff Patsy asked Beth turning to her cousin You re a good mathematician Beth so I propose you act as secretary and treasurer and keep the books No that s too mechanical no bookkeeping for me I want something literary Then you can be sporting editor Goodness Patsy There will be no sporting news in Millville There will be a ball game occasionally and I saw some of the men pitching quoits yesterday But this is to be a newspaper reflecting the excitement of the entire world Beth and all the telegraphic news of a sporting character you must edit and arrange for our reading columns Oh yes and you ll take care of the religious items too We must have a Sunday Sermon by some famous preacher Uncle We ll print that every Saturday so those who can t go to church may get as good a talk as if they did and perhaps a better one That will be fine he agreed How about murders crimes and divorces All barred Nothing that sends a cold chill down your back will be allowed in our paper These people are delightfully simple we don t want to spoil them Cut out the cold chills and you ll spoil your newspaper suggested Arthur People like to read of other folks horrors for it makes them more contented with their own lot in life False philosophy sir cried Fatsy firmly You can t educate people by retailing crimes and scandals and the Millville Tribune is going to be as clean as a prayer book if I m to be managing editor Is that to be your office dear asked Louise I think so I ve a heap of executive ability and I m running over with literary eh eh literary discrimination In addition to running the thing I ll be the general news editor because I m better posted on newspaper business than the other girls How does that happen inquired Louise wonderingly Why I I read the papers more than you or Beth And I ve set myself to master every detail of the business No more crocheting or fancy work no novel reading no gossipy letter writing From this day on we must attend strictly to business If we re to become journalist girls we must be good ones better than the ordinary so that Uncle John may point to us with pride and the columns of the Millville Daily Tribune will be quoted by the New York and Chicago press Only in that way can we become famous throughout the world Pass me the bonbons dear sighed Louise It s a high ambition isn t it A very laudable ambition added Uncle John approvingly I hope my clever nieces will be able to accomplish it How about pictures asked Beth Modern newspapers are illustrated and have cartoons of the leading events of the day Can t we buy those things somewhere asked Patsy appealing to Uncle John again There isn t an artist among us of any account and we shall be too busy to draw pictures We must hire an artist said mister Merrick adding the item to his memoranda I ll speak to Marvin about it All these details were beginning to bewilder the embryo journalists It is quite possible that had not Uncle John placed his order for presses and type so promptly the girls might have withdrawn from the proposition but the die was now cast and they were too brave perhaps too stubborn to back down at this juncture I realize said Patsy slowly and with a shake of her flaming head that we have undertaken an important venture Our new enterprise is a most serious one girls for there is nothing greater or grander in our advanced age than the daily newspaper no power so tremendous as the Power of the Press Yes the press must be powerful or it wouldn t print clearly remarked Beth We are to become public mentors to the simple natives of Chazy County continued Patsy warming up to her subject and speaking oratorically We shall be the guiding star of the er er the benighted citizens of Millville and Huntingdon We must lead them in politics counsel them in the management of their farms and educate them to the great World Movements that are constantly occurring Let s put all that rot in our prospectus said Louise looking at her cousin admiringly Can you remember it Patsy or had I better write it down now I like that about teaching the farmers how to run their farms it s so practical You wait said Patsy unflinchingly I ll write em an editorial that will make their eyes roll But it won t do a bit of harm for you and Beth to jot down all the brilliant thoughts you run across for the benefit of our subscribers We haven t any subscribers yet remarked Beth placidly I ll overcome that defect said Uncle John I want to subscribe right now for ten copies to be mailed to friends of mine in the city who who need educating I ll pay in advance and collect of my friends when I see em This was certainly encouraging and Patsy smiled benignantly I ll take five more yearly subscriptions said Arthur Oh but you re going to be on the staff cried Patsy Am I Certainly I ve been thinking over our organization and while it is quite proper for three girls to run paper there ought to be a man to pose as the editor in chief That ll be you Arthur But you won t print my name Oh yes we shall Don t groan sir it s no disgrace Wait till you see the Millville Tribune Also we shall print our own names in that case giving credit to whom credit is due The announcement will run something like this Arthur Weldon General Manager and Editor in Chief P Doyle General News Editor L Merrick Weldon Society and Literary Editor E DeGraf Sporting Editor Secretary and Treasurer You see by using our initials only no one will ever suspect we are girls The Millville people may said Arthur slyly and perhaps the disguise will be penetrated by outsiders That will depend on the paper I don t like that combination of sporting editor and secretary and treasurer objected Beth It isn t the usual thing in journalism I m sure Suppose you call me Editor of Special Features and let it go at that Have we any special features asked Louise Oh yes said Arthur there s Beth s eyebrows Patsy s nose and Do be sensible cried Patsy This isn t a joking matter sir Our newspaper will have plenty of special features and Beth s suggestion is a good one It sounds impressive You see Arthur we ve got to use you as a figurehead but so you won t loaf on your job I ve decided to appoint you Solicitor of Advertising and Subscriptions Thank you my dear he said grinning in an amused way You and Louise who still like to be together can drive all over the county getting subscriptions and you can write letters on our new stationery to all the big manufacturers of soaps and breakfast foods and beauty powders and to all the correspondence schools and get their advertisements for the Tribune If you get a good many we may have to enlarge the paper Don t worry Miss Doyle I ll try to keep within bounds And so they went on laying plans and discussing details in such an earnest way that Uncle John became as enthusiastic as any of them and declared in no uncertain tone that the Millville Daily Tribune was bound to be a howling success After the girls had retired for the night and the men sat smoking together in Uncle John s own room Arthur said Tell me sir why you have encouraged this mad project The little millionaire puffed his pipe in silence a moment Then he replied I m educating my girls to be energetic and self reliant I want to bring out and develop every spark of latent ability there is in them Whether the Millville Tribune succeeds or fails is not important it will at least keep them busy for a time along new lines and tax their best resources of intellect and business ability In other words this experience is bound to do em good and in that way I figure it will be worth all it costs and more I like the originality of the idea I m pleased with the difficulties I see looming ahead I m quite sure my girls will rise to every occasion and prove their grit He paused to knock the ashes from his pipe I m worth a lot of money Arthur he continued meekly and some day these three girls will inherit immense fortunes It is my duty to train them in all practical business ways to take care of their property I follow your line of reasoning sir observed Arthur Weldon but this absurd journalistic venture is bound to result in heavy financial loss I know it my boy I m sure of it But can t you see that the lesson they will learn will render them more cautious in making future investments I m going to supply a complete newspaper outfit to the last detail and give em a good running start Then I shall sit back and watch results If they lose money on running expenses as they surely will they ll first take it out of their allowances then sell their jewelry and finally come to me for help See The lesson will be worth while Arthur and aside from that think of the fun they ll have CHAPTER VI mister SKEELTY OF THE MILL 
1472_285314_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The next morning they drove to town again passing slowly up the street of the little village to examine each building that might be a possible location for a newspaper office 
1472_285314_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Here is a map that Patsy drew of Millville which gives a fair idea of its arrangement 
1472_285314_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Illustration Village Street 
1472_285314_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Counting the dwellings there were exactly twelve buildings and they all seemed occupied 
1472_285314_000005_000000	train-clean-360	When they reached the hardware store opposite Cotting s mister West the proprietor was standing on the broad platform in front of it 
1472_285314_000005_000001	train-clean-360	In many respects Bob West was the most important citizen of Millville 
none	none	Tall and gaunt with great horn spectacles covering a pair of cold gray eyes he was usually as reserved and silent as his neighbors were confiding and talkative 
1472_285314_000005_000003	train-clean-360	A widower of long standing without children or near relatives he occupied a suite of well appointed rooms over the hardware store and took his meals at the hotel 
none	none	Before mister Merrick appeared on the scene West had been considered a very wealthy man as it was known he had many interests outside of his store but compared with the multi millionaire old Bob had come to be regarded more modestly although still admitted to be the village s warmest citizen 
1472_285314_000005_000005	train-clean-360	He was an authority in the town too and a man of real importance 
1472_285314_000006_000000	train-clean-360	mister Merrick stopped his horse to speak with the hardware man an old acquaintance 
1472_285314_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 West said he my girls are going to start a newspaper in Millville 
1472_285314_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The merchant bowed gravely perhaps to cover the trace of a smile he was unable to repress 
1472_285314_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 It s to be a daily paper you know continued mister Merrick and it seems there s a lot of machinery in the outfit 
1472_285314_000009_000001	train-clean-360	It ll need quite a bit of room in other words and we re looking for a place to install it 
1472_285314_000010_000000	train-clean-360	West glanced along the street up one side and down the other and then shook his head negatively 
1472_285314_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Plenty of land but no buildings said he 
1472_285314_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 You might buy the old mill and turn it into a newspaper office 
none	none	Caldwell isn t making much of a living and would be glad to sell out
1472_285314_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 It s too dusty and floury said Patsy 
1472_285314_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 We d never get it clean I m sure 
none	none	What s in that shed of yours asked Uncle John pointing to a long low building that adjoined the hardware store 
1472_285314_000014_000000	train-clean-360	West turned and looked at the shed reflectively 
1472_285314_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 That is where I store my stock of farm machinery he said 
none	none	There s very little in there now for it s a poor season and I didn t lay in much of a supply 
1472_285314_000015_000002	train-clean-360	In fact I m pretty well cleaned out of all surplus stock 
1472_285314_000015_000003	train-clean-360	But next spring I shall need the place again 
1472_285314_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Good cried mister Merrick 
1472_285314_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 That solves our problem 
1472_285314_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Has it a floor 
1472_285314_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes an excellent one but only one small window 
1472_285314_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 We can remedy that declared Uncle John 
none	none	Here s the proposition West Let us have the shed for six months at the end of which time we will know whether the Millville Tribune is a success or not 
1472_285314_000018_000002	train-clean-360	If it is we ll build a fine new building for it if it don t seem to prosper we ll give you back the shed 
none	none	What do you say 
1472_285314_000019_000000	train-clean-360	West thought it over 
none	none	There is room on the rear platform for all the farm machinery I now have on hand 
1472_285314_000020_000001	train-clean-360	All right mister Merrick I ll move the truck out and give you possession 
1472_285314_000020_000002	train-clean-360	It won t make a bad newspaper office 
1472_285314_000020_000003	train-clean-360	But of course you are to fit up the place at your own expense 
1472_285314_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you very much sir exclaimed Uncle John 
1472_285314_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll set Lon Taft at work at once 
1472_285314_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Where can he be found 
1472_285314_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Playing billiards at the hotel usually 
1472_285314_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I suppose he is there now 
1472_285314_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Very good I ll hunt him up 
1472_285314_000023_000001	train-clean-360	What do you think of our newspaper scheme West 
1472_285314_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The old merchant hesitated 
1472_285314_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Then he said slowly 
1472_285314_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Whatever your charming and energetic nieces undertake sir will doubtless be well accomplished 
none	none	The typical country newspaper groans under a load of debt and seldom gets a fair show to succeed but in this case there will be no lack of money and why that settles the question I think 
1472_285314_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Money is the keystone to success 
1472_285314_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 mister West said Louise with dignity we are depending chiefly on the literary merit of our newspaper to win recognition 
1472_285314_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course of course said he hastily 
1472_285314_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 Put me down as a subscriber please and rely upon my support at all times 
1472_285314_000027_000002	train-clean-360	It is possible young ladies nay quite probable I should say that your originality and genius will yet make Millville famous 
1472_285314_000028_000000	train-clean-360	That speech pleased Uncle John and as the hardware merchant bowed and turned away mister Merrick said in his cheeriest tones He s quite right my dears and we re lucky to have found such a fine roomy place for our establishment 
none	none	Before we go after the carpenter to fix it up I must telephone to Marvin about the things we still need 
1472_285314_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Over the long distance telephone mister Marvin reported that he had bought the required outfit and it was even then being loaded on the freight cars 
1472_285314_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve arranged for a special engine he added and if all goes well the freight will be on the sidetrack at Chazy Junction on Monday morning 
none	none	The dealer will send down three men to set up the presses and get everything in running order 
1472_285314_000030_000002	train-clean-360	But he asks if you have arranged for your workmen 
1472_285314_000030_000003	train-clean-360	How about it mister Merrick have you plenty of competent printers and pressmen at Millville 
1472_285314_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 There are none at all was the reply 
none	none	Better inquire how many we will need Marvin and send them down here 
1472_285314_000031_000002	train-clean-360	And by the way hire women or girls for every position they are competent to fill 
none	none	This is going to be a girls newspaper so we ll have as few men around as possible
1472_285314_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I understand sir 
1472_285314_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Uncle John ordered everything he could think of and told his agent to add whatever the supply man thought might be needed 
1472_285314_000033_000001	train-clean-360	This business being accomplished he found Lon Taft at the hotel and instructed the carpenter to put rows of windows on both sides of the shed and to build partitions for an editorial office and a business office at the front 
1472_285314_000034_000000	train-clean-360	This was the beginning of a busy period especially for poor Uncle John who had many details to attend to personally 
none	none	The next morning the electricians arrived and began stringing the power cables from the paper mill to the newspaper office 
1472_285314_000034_000002	train-clean-360	This rendered it necessary for mister Merrick to make a trip to Royal to complete his arrangement with mister Skeelty the manager 
1472_285314_000034_000003	train-clean-360	He drove over with Arthur Weldon in the buggy four miles of hill climbing over rough cobble stones into the pine forest 
none	none	Arriving there the visitors were astonished at the extent of the plant so recently established in this practically unknown district The great mill where the wood pulp was made was a building constructed from pine slabs and cobblestones material gathered from the clearing in which it stood but it was quite substantial and roomy 
1472_285314_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Adjoining the mill was the factory building where the pulp was rolled into print paper Surrounding these huge buildings were some sixty small dwellings of the bungalow type for the use of the workmen built of rough boards but neat and uniform in appearance 
none	none	Almost in the center of this group stood the extensive storehouse from which all necessary supplies were furnished the mill hands the cost being deducted from their wages 
1472_285314_000035_000004	train-clean-360	The electric power plant was a building at the edge of Royal Waterfall the low and persistent roar of which was scarcely drowned by the rumble of machinery 
1472_285314_000035_000005	train-clean-360	Finally at the edge of the clearing nearest the mills stood the business office and to this place mister Merrick and Arthur at once proceeded 
1472_285314_000036_000000	train-clean-360	They found the office a busy place 
none	none	Three or four typewriters were clicking away operated by sallow faced girls and behind a tall desk were two bookkeepers in one of whom Uncle John recognized with mild surprise the tramp he had encountered at Chazy Junction on the morning of his arrival 
1472_285314_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The young fellow had improved in appearance having discarded his frayed gray suit for one of plain brown khaki such as many of the workmen wore a supply being carried by the company s store He was clean shaven and trim and a gentlemanly bearing had replaced the careless half defiant attitude of the former hobo 
1472_285314_000036_000003	train-clean-360	It was evident he remembered meeting mister Merrick for he smiled and returned the nabob s nod 
1472_285314_000037_000000	train-clean-360	mister Skeelty had a private enclosed office in a corner of the room 
1472_285314_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Being admitted to this sanctum the visitors found the manager to be a small puffy individual about forty five years of age with shrewd beadlike black eyes and an insolent assumption of super importance 
1472_285314_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Skeelty interrupted his task of running up columns of impressive figures to ask his callers to be seated and opened the interview with characteristic abruptness 
1472_285314_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 You re Merrick eh 
1472_285314_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I remember 
1472_285314_000038_000002	train-clean-360	You want to buy power and we have it to sell 
1472_285314_000038_000003	train-clean-360	How much will you contract to take 
1472_285314_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know just how much we need answered Uncle John 
1472_285314_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 We want enough to run a newspaper plant at Millville and will pay for whatever we use 
1472_285314_000039_000002	train-clean-360	I ve ordered a meter as you asked me to do and my men are now stringing the cables to make the connection 
1472_285314_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Pah a newspaper 
1472_285314_000040_000001	train-clean-360	How absurd said mister Skeelty with scornful emphasis Your name Merrick is not unknown to me 
1472_285314_000040_000002	train-clean-360	It stands for financial success I understand but I ll bet you never made your money doing such fool things as establishing newspapers in graveyards 
1472_285314_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Uncle John looked at the man attentively 
1472_285314_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall refrain from criticising your conduct of this mill mister Skeelty he quietly observed nor shall I dictate what you may do with your money provided you succeed in making any 
1472_285314_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The manager smiled broadly as if the retort pleased him 
1472_285314_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Give an take sir that s my motto he said 
1472_285314_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 But you prefer to take 
1472_285314_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I do was the cheerful reply 
1472_285314_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll take your paper for instance if it isn t too high priced 
none	none	In case it is we will present you with a subscription said Uncle John But that reminds me as a part of our bargain I want you to allow my nieces or any representative of the Millville Tribune to take subscriptions among your workmen 
1472_285314_000048_000000	train-clean-360	mister Skeelty stared at him a moment 
1472_285314_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Then he laughed 
1472_285314_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 They re mostly foreigners mister Merrick who haven t yet fully mastered the English language 
1472_285314_000049_000001	train-clean-360	But he added thoughtfully a few among them might subscribe if your country sheet contains any news of interest at all 
none	none	This is rather a lonely place for my men and they get dissatisfied at times All workmen seem chronically dissatisfied and their women constantly urge them to rebellion Already there are grumblings and they claim they re buried alive in this forlorn forest 
1472_285314_000049_000005	train-clean-360	Don t appreciate the advantages of country life you see and I ve an idea they ll begin to desert pretty soon 
none	none	Really a live newspaper might do them good especially if you print a little socialistic drivel now and then Again he devoted a moment to thought and then continued Tell you what I ll do sir I ll solicit the subscriptions myself and deduct the price from the men s wages as I do the cost of their other supplies But the Company gets a commission for that of course
1472_285314_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a penny paper said Uncle John 
1472_285314_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 The subscription is only thirty cents a month 
1472_285314_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Delivered 
1472_285314_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose so 
1472_285314_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I ll pay you twenty cents and keep the balance for commission That s fair enough 
1472_285314_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well mister Skeelty 
none	none	We re after subscriptions more than money just now 
1472_285314_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Get all you can at that rate 
1472_285314_000055_000000	train-clean-360	After signing a contract for the supply of electrical power whereby he was outrageously robbed but the supply was guaranteed mister Merrick and Arthur returned to the farm 
1472_285314_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 That man said Louise s young husband referring to the manager of the paper mill is an unmitigated scoundrel sir 
1472_285314_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I won t deny it replied mister Merrick 
none	none	It occurs to me he is hiring those poor workmen at low wages and making a profit on all their living necessities which he reserves the right of supplying from his own store 
1472_285314_000057_000002	train-clean-360	No wonder the poor fellows get dissatisfied 
none	none	CHAPTER VII THE SKETCH ARTIST During the next three days so many things happened at Millville that the natives were in a panic of excitement Not only was electricity brought from the paper mill but a telegraph wire was run from Chazy Junction to Bob West s former storage shed and a telephone gang came along and placed a private wire with long distance connections in the new newspaper office The office itself became transformed as full o winders as a hothouse exclaimed Peggy McNutt with bulging eyes and neat partitions were placed for the offices There was no longer any secret as to the plans of the nabobs it was generally understood that those terribly aggressive girls were going to inflict a daily paper on the community Some were glad and some rebelled but all were excited A perpetual meeting was held at Cotting s store to discuss developments for something startling occurred every few minutes It s a outrage this thing commented young Skim Clark despondently They re tryin to run mother out o business an she a widder with me to look after Most o the business at the Emporium is done in newspapers an magazines an sich so these gals thought they d cut under an take the business away from her Can t the Widder Clark sell the new paper then asked the blacksmith I dunno Hadn t thought o that said Skim But the price is to be jus one cent an we ve ben gittin five cents fer all the outside papers Where s the profit comin from on one cent I d like to know Why we make two or three cents on all the five cent papers As fer that remarked the druggist we ll get a cheap paper if it s any good an that s somethin to be thankful for Twon t be any good asserted Skim Ma says so But no one except McNutt was prepared to agree with this prediction The extensive plans in preparation seemed to indicate that the new paper would be fully equal to the requirements of the populace On Monday when the news spread that two big freight cars had arrived at the Junction and Nick Thorne began working three teams to haul the outfit to Millville the rest of the town abandoned all business other than watching the arrival of the drays Workmen and machinists arrived from the city and began unpacking and setting up the presses type cases and all other paraphernalia every motion being watched by eager faces that lined the windows These workmen were lodged at the hotel which had never entertained so many guests at one time in all its past history The three girls even more excited and full of awe than the townspeople were at the office early and late taking note of everything installed and getting by degrees a fair idea of the extent of their new plaything It almost takes my breath away Uncle said Patsy You ve given the Tribune such a splendid start that we must hustle to make good and prove we are worthy your generosity I sat up last night and wrote a poem for the first page of the first number announced Louise earnestly Poems don t go on the first page observed Patsy but they re needed to fill in with What s it about dear It s called Ode to a Mignonette answered Louise It begins this way Wee brown blossom humble and sweet Content on my bosom lying Who would guess from your quiet dress The beauty there is lying Under the rust Hm said Patsy I don t see as there s any beauty under the rust at all There s no beauty about a mignonette anyhow suspected or unsuspected She means fragrance suggested Beth Change it to The fragrance there is lying under the rust That ll fix it all right Louise It doesn t seem right even then remarked Uncle John If the fragrance lies under the rust it can t be smelt can it I did not anticipate all this criticism said Louise with an air of injured dignity None of the big publishing houses that returned my poems ever said anything mean about them they merely said they were not available However as this poem has not made a hit with the managing editor I ll tear it up and write another Don t do that begged Patsy Save it for emergencies We ve got to fill twenty four columns every day remember By Wednesday night the equipment was fully installed and the workmen departed leaving only Jim McGaffey an experienced pressman and Lawrence Doane familiarly called Larry who was to attend to the electrotyping and make up The press was of the best modern construction and folded cut and counted the papers automatically with a capacity for printing three thousand copies an hour And at that rate observed Patsy It will run off our regular edition in eight minutes Aside from the newspaper press there were two job presses and an assortment of type for printing anything that might be required from a calling card to a circus poster A third man who came from the city Thursday morning was to take charge of the job printing and assist in the newspaper work Three girls also arrived pale faced sad eyed creatures who were expert typesetters Uncle John arranged with missus Kebble the landlady at the hotel to board all the help at moderate charge It had been decided after much consultation to make the Tribune a morning paper At first it was feared this would result in keeping the girls up nights but it was finally arranged that all the copy they furnished would be turned in by nine o clock and Miss Briggs the telegraph editor would attend to anything further that came in over the wires The advantages of a morning edition were obvious You ll have all day to distribute a morning paper Arthur pointed out whereas an evening paper couldn t get to your scattered subscribers until the next morning Miss Briggs upon whom they were to rely so greatly proved to be a woman of tremendous energy and undoubted ability She was thirty five years of age and had been engaged in newspaper work ever since she was eighteen Bright and cheerful of even temper and shrewd comprehension Miss Briggs listened to the eager explanations of the three girls who had undertaken this queer venture and assured them she would assist in making a newspaper that would be a credit to them all She understood clearly the conditions that inexperience was backed by ample capital and unpractical ideas by unlimited enthusiasm This job may not last long she told herself but while it does it will be mighty amusing I shall enjoy these weeks in a quiet country town after the bustle of the big city So here were seven regular employees of the Millville Daily Tribune already secured and the eighth was shortly to appear Preparations were well under way for a first edition on the Fourth of July and the office was beginning to hum with work when one afternoon a girl strolled in and asked in a tired voice for the managing editor She was admitted to Patsy s private room where Beth and Louise were also sitting and they looked upon their visitor in undisguised astonishment She was young perhaps not over twenty years of age Her face bore marks of considerable dissipation and there was a broad scar underneath her right eye Her hair was thin straggling and tow colored her eyes large deep set and of a faded blue The girl s dress was as queer and untidy as her personal appearance for she wore a brown tailored coat a short skirt and long buttoned leggings A round cap of the same material as her dress was set jauntily on the back of her head and over her shoulder was slung a fiat satchel of worn leather There was little that was feminine and less that was attractive about the young woman and Patsy eyed her with distinct disfavor Tommy sent me here said the newcomer sinking wearily into a chair I m hired for a month on good behavior with a chance to stay on if I conduct myself in a ladylike manner I ve been working on the Herald you know but there was no end of a row last week and they fired me bodily Any booze for sale in this town It is a temperance community answered Patsy stiffly Hooray for me There s a chance I ll keep sober In that case you ve acquired the best sketch artist in America Oh Are you the artist then asked Patsy with doubtful intonation I don t like the word I m not a real artist just a cartoonist and newspaper hack Say it s funny to see me in this jungle isn t it What joy I ll have in astonishing the natives I s pose a picture s a picture to them and Art an impenetrable mystery What sort of stuff do you want me to turn out I I m not sure you ll do said Miss Doyle desperately I we that is we are three quite respectable young women who have under taken to edit the Millville Daily Tribune and the people we have secured to assist us are all all quite desirable in their way So ahem so That s all right remarked the artist composedly I don t know that I blame you I can see very well the atmosphere is not my atmosphere When is the next train back to New York At four o clock I believe I ll engage a nice upholstered seat in the smoking car But I ve several hours to loaf and loafing is my best stunt Isn t this a queer start for girls like you looking around the den critically I wonder how you got the bug and what ll come of it It s so funny to see a newspaper office where everything is brand new and eminently respectable Do you mind my lighting a cigarette This sort of a deal is quite interesting to an old timer like me but perhaps I owe you an apology for intruding I had a letter from Tommy and one from a big banker Marvin I guess his name is She drew two letters from her satchel and tossed them on the desk before Patsy They re no good to me now she added Where s your waste basket The managing editor feeling embarrassed by the presence of the artist opened the letters The first was from mister Marvin Uncle John s banker saying After much negotiation I have secured for you the best newspaper illustrator in New York and a girl too which is an added satisfaction For months I have admired the cartoons signed Het in the New York papers for they were essentially clever and droll Miss Hewitt is highly recommended but like most successful artists is not always to be relied upon I m told if you can manage to win her confidence she will be very loyal to you The other letter was from the editor of a great New York journal In giving you Hetty he said I am parting with one of our strongest attractions but in this big city the poor girl is rapidly drifting to perdition and I want to save her if possible before it is too late She has a sweet lovable nature a generous heart and a keen intellect but these have been so degraded by drink and dissipation that you may not readily discover them My idea is that in a country town away from all disreputable companionship the child may find herself and come to her own again Be patient with her and help her all you can Her wonderful talent will well repay you even if you are not interested in saving one of God s creatures Silently Patsy passed the letters to Beth and Louise After reading them there was a new expression on the faces they turned toward Hetty Hewitt Forgive me said Patsy abruptly I I think I misjudged you I was wrong in saying what I did No you were quite right She sat with downcast eyes a moment musing deeply Then she looked up with a smile that quite glorified her wan face I d like to stay you know she said humbly I m facing a crisis just now and on the whole I d rather straighten up If you feel like giving me a chance I I d like to see if I ve any reserve force or whether the decency in me has all evaporated We ll try you and I m sure you have lots of reserve force Hetty cried Patsy jumping up impulsively to take the artist s soiled thin hand in her own Come with me to the hotel and I ll get you a room Where is your baggage Didn t bring it I wasn t sure I d like the country or that you d care to trust me In New York they know me for what I m worth and I get lots of work and good advice mixed with curses We ll send for your trunk said Patsy leading the girl up the street No it s in hock But I won t need it With no booze to buy I can invest my earnings in wearing apparel What a picturesque place this is Way back in the primitive no hint of those namby pamby green meadows and set rows of shade trees that make most country towns detestable rocks and boulders boulders and rocks and the scraggly pines for background The wee brook has gone crazy What do you call it Little Bill Creek I m going to stab it with my pencil Where it bumps the rocks it s obstinate and pig headed where it leaps the little shelves of slate it s merry and playful where it sweeps silently between the curving banks it is sulky and resentful The Little Bill has moods bless its heart Moods betoken character Patsy secured for Hetty a pleasant room facing the creek Where will you work at the office or here she asked In the open I guess I ll run over the telegraph news to get a subject for the day s cartoon and then take to the woods Let me know what other pictures you want and I ll do em on the run I m a beast to work Arthur Weldon in his capacity as advertising manager wrote to all the national advertisers asking their patronage for the Millville Daily Tribune The letters were typewritten by the office stenographer on newly printed letterheads that Fitzgerald the job printer had prepared Some of the advertisers were interested enough in Arthur s novel proposition to reply with questions as to the circulation of the new paper where it was distributed and the advertising rates The voting man answered frankly that they had twenty seven subscribers already and were going to distribute four hundred free copies every day for a time as samples with the hope of increasing the subscription list I am not sure you will derive any benefit at all from advertising in our paper he added but we would like to have you try it and you can pay us whatever you consider the results warrant To his astonishment the advertisements arrived a great many from very prominent firms who accepted his proposal with amusement at his originality and a desire to help the new venture along Our square statement of facts has given us a good start he told the girls I m really amazed at our success and it s up to you to make a paper that will circulate and make trade for these trustful advertisers With the local merchants the results were less satisfying Bob West put in a card advertising his hardware business and Nib Corkins cautiously invested a half dollar to promote his drug store and stock of tarnished cheap jewelry but Sam Cotting said everybody knew what he had for sale and advertising wouldn t help him any Arthur drove to Huntingdon with Louise and while the society editor picked up items her husband interviewed the merchants The Huntingdon people were more interested in the new paper than the Millville folk and Arthur quoted such low prices that several advertisements were secured Two bright boys of this thriving village were also employed to ride over to Millville each morning get a supply of Tribunes and distribute a sample copy to every house in the neighborhood Fitz set up the ads in impressive type and the columns of the first edition began to fill up days before the Fourth of July arrived Louise had a story and two poems set in type and read over the proofs dozens of times with much pride and satisfaction while Beth prepared an article on the history of baseball and the probable future of our national game They did not see much of their artist during the first days following her arrival but one afternoon she brought Patsy a sketch and asked Who is this Patsy glanced at it and laughed gleefully It was Peggy McNutt the fish eyed pooh bah of Millville who was represented sitting on his front porch engaged in painting his wooden foot This was one of McNutt s recognized amusements He kept a supply of paints of many colors and every few days appeared with his rudely carved wooden foot glistening with a new coat of paint and elaborately striped Sometimes it would be blue with yellow stripes then green with red stripes and anon a lovely pink decorated with purple One drawback to Peggy s delight in these transformations was the fact that it took the paint a night and a day to dry thoroughly and during this period of waiting he would sit upon his porch with the wooden foot tenderly resting upon the rail a helpless prisoner Some folks he would say likes pretty neckties an some wears fancy socks but fer my part I d ruther show a han some foot ner anything It don t cost as much as wearin socks an neckties an it s more artistic like Hetty had caught the village character in the act of striping the wooden foot and his expression of intense interest in the operation was so original and the likeness so perfect from the string suspenders and flannel shirt to the antiquated straw hat and faded and patched overalls that no one would be likely to mistake the subject The sketch was entitled The Village Artist and Patsy declared they would run it on an inside page just to make the Millville people aware of the power of the press Larry made an etching of it and mounted the plate for a double column picture The original sketch Patsy decided to have framed and to hang it in her office CHAPTER VIII THE MILLVILLE DAILY TRIBUNE The first edition of the Millville Daily Tribune certainly proved it to be a wonderful newspaper The telegraphic news of the world s doings received and edited by the skillful Miss Briggs was equal to that of any metropolitan journal the first page cartoon referring to the outbreak of a rebellion in China was clever and humorous enough to delight anyone but the local news and literary page were woefully amateurish and smacked of the schoolgirl editors who had prepared them Perhaps the Chazy County people did not recognize these deficiencies for the new paper certainly created a vast amount of excitement and won the praise of nearly all who read it On the eventful night of the Tribune s first run our girls were too eager to go home and await its appearance so they remained at the office to see the birth of their enterprise and as it was the night preceding the Fourth of July Uncle John gave an exhibition of fireworks in front of the newspaper office to the delight of the entire population The girl journalists however were not so greatly interested in fireworks as in the birth of their fascinating enterprise Wearing long gingham aprons they hovered over the big table where the forms were being locked up and watched anxiously every movement of the workmen It was exceedingly interesting to note how a column of the first page was left open until the last so that copy hot from the wire of the very latest news might be added before going to press Finally at exactly two o clock the forms were locked placed upon the bed of the press and McGaffey a sour faced individual whose chief recommendation was his ability as a pressman began to make ready for the run Outside the brilliantly lighted windows which were left open for air congregated a wondering group of the Millville people many of whom had never been up so late before in all their lives But the event was too important to miss The huge complicated press had already inspired their awe and they were eager to see it work as it printed the new paper The girls tolerated this native curiosity with indulgent good humor and at midnight even passed out sandwiches to the crowd a supply having been secured for the workmen These were accepted silently and as they munched the food all kept their eyes fixed upon the magicians within There was a hitch somewhere McGaffey muttered naughty words under his breath and plied wrenches and screwdrivers in a way that brought a thrill of anxiety approaching fear to every heart The press started half a dozen times only to be shut down abruptly before it had printed a single impression McGaffey counseled with Larry who shook his head Fitzgerald the job printer examined the machinery carefully and again McGaffey screwed nuts and regulated the press Then he turned on the power the big cylinder revolved the white paper reeled out like a long ribbon and with a rattle and thump the first copy of the Millville Daily Tribune was deposited cut and folded upon the table placed to receive it Patsy made a rush for it but before she could reach the table half a dozen more papers had been piled above it and gathering speed the great press hummed busily and the pile of Tribunes grew as if by magic Patsy grabbed the first dozen and handed them to Beth for they were to be reserved as souvenirs Then running back to the table she seized a bunch and began distributing them to the watchers outside the window The natives accepted them eagerly enough but could not withdraw their eyes from the marvelous press which seemed to possess intelligence almost human Each of the three girl journalists now had a copy in hand scanning it with boundless pride and satisfaction It realized completely their fondest hopes and they had good cause to rejoice Then Uncle John who ought to have been in bed and sound asleep at this uncanny hour of night came bouncing in accompanied by Arthur Weldon Each made a dive for a paper and each face wore an expression of genuine delight The roar of the press made conversation difficult but mister Merrick caught his nieces in his arms by turn and gave each one an ecstatic hug and kiss Suddenly the press stopped What s wrong McGaffey demanded Patsy anxiously Nothing miss Edition off that s all What the entire four hundred are printed Four twenty five I run a few extrys And now a shriek of laughter came from the windows as the villagers slowly opening the papers they held came upon the caricature of Peggy McNutt The subject of the cartoon had with his usual aggressiveness secured the best standing room available and his contemplative protruding eyes were yet fixed upon the interior of the workroom But now his curiosity aroused he looked at the paper to see what his neighbors were laughing at and his expression of wonder slowly changed to a broad grin He straightened up looked triumphantly around the circle and exclaimed By gum folks this ere paper s going to be a go I didn t take no stock in it till now but them fool gals seem to know their business an I ll back em to the last ditch CHAPTER IX TROUBLE Of course the girls exhausted their store of effusions on the first two or three papers A daily eats up copy very fast and the need to supply so much material began to bewilder the budding journalists There was not sufficient local news to keep them going but fortunately the New York news service supplied more general news than they could possibly use and besides mister Marvin foreseeing this dilemma had sent on several long stout boxes filled with plate matter which meant that a variety of stories poems special articles and paragraphs of every sort had been made into stereotyped plates of column width which could be placed anywhere in the paper where a space needed to be filled This material having been prepared by skilled writers was of excellent character so that the paper gained in its class of contents as the girlish contributions began to be replaced by plates The nieces did not abandon writing however and all three worked sedulously to prepare copy so that at least one column of the Tribune each day was filled with notes from their pens Subscriptions came in freely during those first days for farmers and villagers alike were proud of their local daily and the price was so low that no one begrudged the investment But Uncle John well knew that if every individual in the county subscribed and the advertising patronage doubled the income would fall far short of running expenses Saturday night when the pay roll had to be met the girls consulted together seriously In spite of the new subscriptions received a deficiency must be supplied and they quietly advanced the money from their private purses This was no great hardship for each had an ample allowance from Uncle John as well as an income from property owned in her own name It s only about thirty dollars apiece said Patsy I guess we can stand that until until more money begins coming in On Saturday evening there was an invasion of workmen from Royal many of whom we re rough foreigners who came to Millville in search of excitement as a relief from their week s confinement at the pine woods settlement at the mill Skeelty who thought he knew how to manage these people allowed every man at the close of work on Saturday to purchase a pint of whiskey from the company store charging an exorbitant price that netted a huge profit There was no strong drink to be had at Millville so the workmen brought their bottles to town carousing on the way and thought it amusing to frighten the simple inhabitants of the village by their rude shouts and ribald songs This annoyance had occurred several times since the establishment of the mill and Bob West had protested vigorously to mister Skeelty for giving his men whiskey and turning them loose in a respectable community but the manager merely grinned and said he must keep the boys satisfied at all hazards and it was the business of the Millville people to protect themselves if the workmen became too boisterous On this Saturday evening the girls were standing on the sidewalk outside the printing office awaiting the arrival of Arthur with the surrey when a group of the Royal workmen appeared in the dim light swaggering three abreast and indulging in offensive language Uncle John s nieces withdrew to the protection of the doorway but a big bearded fellow in a red shirt discovered them and lurching forward pushed his evil countenance in Patsy s face calling to his fellows in harsh tones that he had found a partner for a dance An instant later he received a swinging blow above the ear that sent him sprawling at full length upon the sidewalk and a quiet voice said Pardon me ladies it seemed necessary All three at once recognized the supposed tramp whom they had seen the morning of their arrival but whom Uncle John had reported to be one of the bookkeepers at the paper mill The young fellow had no time to say more for the downfall of their comrade brought a shout of rage from the group of workmen numbering nearly a dozen and with one accord they rushed upon the man who had dared champion the defenseless girls Beth managed to open the door of the office through which Patsy and Louise slipped instantly but the younger girl always cool in emergencies held the door ajar while she cried to the young man Quick sir come inside Really he had no time to obey just then With his back to the door he drove his fists at his assailants in a dogged persistent way that felled three more of them before the others drew away from his stalwart bows By that time Larry and Fitzgerald who had been summoned by Louise rushed from the office armed with iron bars caught up at random both eager for a fight The workmen seeing the reinforcements beat a retreat carrying their sadly pommeled comrades with them but their insulting language was not restricted until they had passed out of hearing Then the young man turned bowed gravely to the girls who had now ventured forth again and without waiting to receive their thanks marched calmly down the street When Arthur reached home with the girls mister Merrick was very indignant at his report of the adventure He denounced Skeelty in unmeasured terms and declared he would find a way to protect Millville from further invasion by these rough and drunken workmen There was no Sunday paper so the girlish editors found the morrow a veritable day of rest They all drove to Hooker s Falls to church and returned to find that old Nora had prepared a fine chicken dinner for them Patsy had invited Hetty Hewitt in whom she was now greatly interested to dine with them and to the astonishment of all the artist walked over to the farm arrayed in a new gown having discarded the disreputable costume in which she had formerly appeared The new dress was not in the best of taste and its loud checks made dainty Louise shudder but somehow Hetty seemed far more feminine than before and she had moreover washed herself carefully and tried to arrange her rebellious hair This place is doing me good she confided to her girl employers after dinner when they were seated in a group upon the lawn I m getting over my nervousness and although I haven t drank a drop stronger than water since I arrived I feel a new sort of energy coursing through my veins Also I eat like a trooper not at night as I used to but at regular mealtime And I m behaving quite like a lady Do you know I wouldn t be surprised to find it just as amusing to be respectable as to to be the other thing You will find it far more satisfactory I m sure replied Patsy encouragingly What most surprises me is that with your talent and education you ever got into such bad ways Environment said Hetty That s what did it When I first went to New York I was very young A newspaper man took me out to dinner and asked me to have a cocktail I looked around the tables and saw other girls drinking cocktails so I took one That was where I turned into the rocky road People get careless around the newspaper offices They work under a constant nervous strain and find that drink steadies them for a time By and by they disappear others take their places and they are never heard of again except in the police courts I knew a girl society editor of a big paper who drew her five thousand a year at one time She got the cocktail habit and a week or so ago I paid her fine for getting pinched while intoxicated She was in rags and hadn t a red cent That set me thinking and when Tommy fired me from his paper and said the best he could do was to get me a job in the country it seemed as if my chance to turn over a new leaf had arrived I ve turned it she added with a pathetic sigh but whether it ll stay turned or not is a question for the puzzle page Haven t you a family to look after you or for you to look after asked Beth No Brother and I were left orphans in a Connecticut town and he went out West to Chicago and promised to send for me Must have forgot that promise I guess for I ve never heard of Dan since I could draw pictures so I went to New York and found a job Guess that s my biography and it isn t as interesting as one of Hearst s editorials either Hetty seemed pleased and grateful to note the frank friendliness of her girlish employers in whom she recognized the admirable qualities she had personally sacrificed for a life of dissipation In the privacy of her room at the hotel she had read the first copy of the Millville Tribune and shrieked with laughter at the ingenuous editorials and schoolgirl essays Then she grew sober and thoughtful envying in her heart the sweetness and simplicity so apparent in every line Here were girls who possessed something infinitely higher than journalistic acumen they were true women with genuine womanly qualities and natures that betrayed their worth at a glance as do ingots of refined gold What would not this waif from the grim underworld of New York have given for such clear eyes pure mind and unsullied heart I don t know as I can ever swim in their pond Hetty reflected with honest regret but there s a chance I can look folks square in the eye again and that wouldn t be so bad Monday morning when Patsy Louise and Beth drove to their office Miss Briggs said nonchalantly McGaffey s gone Gone Gone where asked Patsy Back to New York Caught a freight from the Junction Saturday night Isn t he coming back inquired Beth Here s a letter he left said Miss Briggs They read it together It was very brief Climate don t suit me No excitement I ve quit McGaffey I suppose said Patsy with indignation he intended to go all the while and only waited for his Saturday pay Miss Briggs nodded She was at the telegraph instrument What shall we do asked Louise Can anyone else work the press I ll find out said Patsy marching into the workroom Neither Fitz nor Larry would undertake to run the press They said the machine was so complicated it required an expert and unless an experienced pressman could be secured the paper must suspend publication Here was an unexpected dilemma one that for a time dazed them These things always happen in the newspaper business remarked Miss Briggs when appealed to Can t you telegraph to New York for another pressman Yes but he can t get here in time said Patsy There s no Monday train to Chazy Junction at all and it would be Wednesday morning before a man could possibly arrive To shut down the paper would ruin it for everyone would think we had failed in our attempt and it might take us weeks to regain public confidence I know said Miss Briggs composedly A paper never stops Somehow or other it always keeps going even if the world turns somersaults and stands on its head You ll find a way I m sure But the bewildered girls had no such confidence They drove back to the farm to consult with Uncle John and Arthur Let s take a look at that press my dears said mister Merrick I m something of a mechanic myself or was in my young days and I may be able to work this thing until we can get a new pressman I ll help you said Arthur Anyone who can run an automobile ought to be able to manage a printing press So they went to the office took off their coats and examined the press but the big machine defied their combined intelligence Uncle John turned on the power The cylinder groaned swung half around and then the huge wooden nippers came down upon the table with a force that shattered them to kindlings At the crash mister Merrick involuntarily shut down the machine and then they all stood around and looked gloomily at the smash up and wondered if the damage was irreparable Couldn t we print the paper on the job press asked the little millionaire turning to Fitzgerald In sections sir replied Fitz grinning Half a page at a time is all we can manage but we might be able to match margins so the thing could be read We ll try it said Uncle John Do your best my man and if you can help us out of this bog you shall be amply rewarded Fitz looked grave Never knew of such a thing being done sir he remarked but that s no reason it s impossible Twill be a horror of a make up added Larry who did not relish his part in the experiment Uncle John put on his coat and went into the front office followed by Arthur and the girls in dismal procession A man to see the manager announced Miss Briggs nodding toward a quiet figure seated on the waiting bench The man stood up and bowed It was the young bookkeeper from the paper mill who had so bravely defended the girls on Saturday night Uncle John regarded him with a frown I suppose Skeelty has sent you to apologize he said No sir Skeelty is not in an apologetic mood replied the man smiling He has fired me What for Interfering with his workmen The boys didn t like what I did the other night and threatened to strike unless I was put in the discard And now asked Uncle John looking curiously at the man I m out of work and would like a job sir What can you do Anything That means nothing at all I beg your pardon Let me say that I m not afraid to tackle anything Can you run a power printing press Yes sir Ever had any experience The young man hesitated I m not sure he replied slowly but I think I have This statement would not have been encouraging under ordinary circumstances but in this emergency Uncle John accepted it What is your name he asked Another moment s hesitation Call me Smith please First name The man smiled Thursday he said All his hearers seemed astonished at this peculiar name but mister Merrick said abruptly Follow me Thursday Smith The man obeyed and the girls and Arthur trotted after them back to the pressroom Our pressman has deserted us without warning explained mister Merrick None of our other employees is able to run the thing If you can master it so as to run off the paper tonight the job is yours Thursday Smith took off his jacket a cheap khaki affair and rolled up his sleeves Then he carefully looked over the press and found the damaged nippers Without a word he picked up a wrench released the stub ends of the broken fingers gathered the pieces in his hand and asked Where is there a carpenter shop Can you operate this press asked mister Merrick Yes sir The carpenter shop is a little shanty back of the hotel You ll find Lon Taft there Smith walked away and mister Merrick drew a long breath of relief That s good luck he said You may quit worrying now my dears Are you sure he s a good pressman Uncle No but he is sure I ve an idea he wouldn t attempt the thing otherwise mister Merrick returned to the farm while Arthur drove Louise over to Huntingdon to gather items for the paper and Patsy and Beth sat in the office arranging copy In an hour Smith came back with new nippers which he fitted to the steel frame Then he oiled the press started it going a few revolutions to test its condition and handled the machinery so dexterously and with such evident confidence that Larry nodded to Fitz and muttered He ll do McGaffey knowing he was about to decamp had not kept the press very clean but Thursday Smith put in the afternoon and evening removing grease polishing and rubbing until the huge machine shone resplendent The girls went home at dinner time but they sent Arthur to the office at midnight to see if the new pressman was proving capable The Tuesday morning Tribune greeted them at the breakfast table and the presswork was remarkably clean and distinct CHAPTER X THURSDAY SMITH In a day or so mister Merrick received a letter from mister Skeelty the manager of the paper mill He said I understand you have employed one of my discharged workmen who is named Thursday Smith My men don t want him in this neighborhood and have made a strong protest I therefore desire you to discharge the fellow at once and in case you refuse to accede to this reasonable demand I shall shut off your power mister Merrick replied Shut off the power and I ll sue you for damages My contract with you fully protects me Permit me a request in turn that you mind your own business The Millville Tribune will employ whomsoever it chooses Uncle John said nothing to the girls concerning this correspondence nor did he mention it to the new pressman On Wednesday Larry and Fitz sent in their resignations to take effect Saturday night They told Patsy who promptly interviewed them that the town was altogether too slow for men accustomed to the city but to Smith they admitted they feared trouble from the men at the mill I talked with one of the mill hands last night said Larry and they re up to mischief If you stay here my boy you d better watch out for it s you they re after in the first place and Skeelty has told em he wouldn t be annoyed if they wiped out the whole newspaper plant at the same time Thursday nodded but said nothing He began watching the work of the two men with comprehensive care When mister Merrick came down to the office during the forenoon to consult with his nieces about replacing the two men who had resigned Smith asked him for a private interview Come into the office said Uncle John When the man found the three girl journalists present he hesitated but mister Merrick declared they were the ones most interested in anything an employee of the paper might have to say to his principals I am told sir Thursday began that the people at the mill have boycotted this paper They ve cancelled all their subscriptions replied Beth but as they had not paid for them it won t hurt us any It seems the trouble started through your employing me resumed the young man so it will be best for you to let me go Never cried mister Merrick firmly Do you suppose I ll allow that rascal Skeelty to dictate to us for a single minute Not by a jug full And the reason the men dislike you is because you pounded some of them unmercifully when they annoyed my girls Where did you learn to use your fists so cleverly Smith I don t know sir Well you have earned our gratitude and we re going to stand by you I don t mind a bit of a row when I m on the right side of an argument Do you Not at all sir but the young ladies They re pretty good fighters too so don t worry Thursday was silent a moment Then he said Fitzgerald and Doane tell me they re going to quit Saturday It is true replied Patsy I m sorry for they seem good men and we may have trouble replacing them They are not needed here Miss Doyle said Smith There isn t a great deal of electrotyping to do or much job printing More than half the time the two men are idle It s the same way with my own job Three hours a day will take care of the press and make the regular run If you will permit me I am sure I can attend to all the work unaided They looked at one another in amazement How about the make up asked Uncle John I can manage that easily sir I ve been watching the operation and understand it perfectly And you believe you can do the work of three men Three men were unnecessary in a small plant like this sir Whoever sent them to you did not understand very well your requirements I ve been watching the compositors too and your three girls are one too many Two are sisters and can set all the type very easily I recommend that you send the other back to New York They considered this advice seriously I think mister Smith is right observed Patsy The girls have not seemed busy at all and spend most of their time laughing and talking together It will cut down expenses a lot said Beth and I m sure we ought to be able to run this paper more economically than we have been doing Uncle John looked at the man thoughtfully Where did you learn the printing business he asked I I don t know sir What offices have you worked in I cannot tell you that sir You seem to answer all my questions with the statement that you don t know asserted mister Merrick with an annoyed frown Is there any reason you should refuse to tell us of your former life None whatever sir Who are you Smith I I don t know sir mister Merrick was getting provoked This obstinacy is not likely to win our confidence he said Under the circumstances I think we ought to know something more about you before we allow you to undertake so much responsibility You seem a bright able young man and I ve no doubt you understand the work you re about to undertake but if we have no knowledge of your antecedents you may cause us considerable future trouble Smith bowed his head and his cheeks flamed red I have no knowledge of my antecedents to confide to you sir he said in a low voice Uncle John sighed regretfully and turned away but Patsy looked at the man with new interest Won t you please explain that a little more fully she gently inquired I am quite willing to tell all I know said he but that is very little I assure you Two years ago last May on the morning of Thursday the twenty second I awoke to find myself lying in a ditch beside a road Of my life previous to that time I have no knowledge whatever The three girls regarded him with startled eyes Uncle John turned from the window to examine the young man with new interest Were you injured he asked My right ankle was sprained and I had a cut under my left eye you can see the scar still You have no idea how you came there Not the slightest I did not recognize the surrounding country I had no clear impression as to who I was There was a farmhouse a quarter of a mile away I limped to it and they gave me some breakfast I found I was fifty six miles from New York The farmer had heard of no accident there was no railway nearer than six miles the highway was little used I told the good people my story and they suspected me of being drunk or crazy but did not credit a single word I said That was but natural said Uncle John After breakfast I took stock of myself In my pockets I found a twenty dollar bill and some silver I wore a watch and chain and a ring set with a good sized diamond My clothing seemed good but the ditch had soiled it I had no hat nor could the farmer find one when I sent him back to look for it My mind was not wholly a blank I seemed to have a fair knowledge of life and when the farmer mentioned New York the city seemed familiar to me But in regard to myself my past history even my name I was totally ignorant All personal consciousness dated from the moment I woke up in the ditch How wonderful exclaimed Louise And you haven t solved the mystery yet after two years asked Patsy No Miss Doyle I hired the farmer to drive me to the railway station where I took the train to New York I seemed to know the city but no recollection guided me to home or friends I went to a small hotel took a room and began to read all the newspapers seeking to discover if anyone was reported missing The sight of automobiles led me to conceive the theory that I had been riding in one of those machines along a country road when something threw me out My head might have struck a stump or stone and the blow rendered me insensible Something in the nature of the thing or in my physical condition deprived me of all knowledge of the past Since then I have read of several similar cases The curious thing about my own experience was that I could find no reference to my disappearance in any way nor could I learn of any automobile accident that might account for it I walked the streets day after day hoping some acquaintance would accost me I waited patiently for some impulse to direct me to my former haunts I searched the newspapers persistently for a clue but nothing rewarded me After spending all my money and the proceeds of my watch and diamond I began to seek employment but no one would employ a man without recommendations or antecedents I did not know what work I was capable of doing So finally I left the city and for more than two years I have been wandering from one part of the country to another hoping that some day I would recognize a familiar spot I have done odd jobs at times but my fortunes went from bad to worse until of late I have become no better than the typical tramp How did you secure employment as a book keeper for Skeelty asked Uncle John I heard a new mill had started at Royal and walked up there to inquire for work The manager asked if I could keep books and I said yes Have you ever kept books before Not that I know of but I did it very well I seemed to comprehend the work at once and needed no instruction Often during these two years I have encountered similar curious conditions I sold goods in a store and seemed to know the stocks I worked two weeks in a telegraph office and discovered I knew the code perfectly I ve shod horses for a country blacksmith wired a house for electric lights and compounded prescriptions in a drug store Whatever I have undertaken to do I seem able to accomplish and so it is hard for me to guess what profession I followed before my memory deserted me You did not retain any position for long it seems remarked Uncle John No I was always impatient to move on always hoping to arrive at some place so familiar that my lost memory would return to me The work I have mentioned was nearly all secured during the first year After I became seedy and disreputable in appearance people were more apt to suspect me and work was harder to obtain Why did you come to Millville asked Louise You brought me here he answered with a smile I caught a ride on your private car when it left New York not caring much where it might take me When I woke up the next morning the car was sidetracked at Chazy Junction and as this is a section I have never before explored I decided to stay here for a time That is all of my story I believe Quite remarkable declared mister Merrick emphatically The girls too had been intensely interested in the strange recital You seem educated said Patsy thoughtfully therefore you must have come from a good family That does not seem conclusive replied Thursday Smith deprecatingly although I naturally hope my family was respectable I have been inclined to resent the fact that none of my friends or relatives has ever inquired what became of me Are you sure they have not I have watched the papers carefully In two years I have followed several clues A bricklayer disappeared but his drowned body was finally found a college professor was missing but he was sixty years of age a young man in New York embezzled a large sum and hid himself I followed that trail although regretfully but the real embezzler was caught the day I presented myself in his place Perhaps the most curious experience was in the case of a young husband who deserted his wife and infant child She advertised for him he had disappeared about the time I had found myself so I went to see her What was the result asked Beth She said I was not her husband but if he failed to come back I might take his place provided I would guarantee to support her During the laugh that followed Thursday Smith went back to his work and an animated discussion concerning his strange story followed He seems honest said Louise but I blame a man of his ability for becoming a mere tramp He ought to have asserted himself and maintained the position in which he first found himself How inquired Patsy At that time he was well dressed and had a watch and diamond ring If he had gone to some one and frankly told his story he could surely have obtained a position to correspond with his personality But instead of this he wasted his time and the little capital he possessed in doing nothing that was sensible It is easy for us to criticise the man remarked Beth and he may be sorry now that he did not act differently But I think in his place I should have made the same attempt he did to unravel the mystery of his lost identity So much depended upon that It s all very odd and incomprehensible said Uncle John I wonder who he can be I suppose he calls himself Thursday because that was the day he first found himself observed Patsy Yes and Smith was the commonest name he could think of to go with it The most surprising thing added their uncle is the fact that a man of his standing was not missed or sought for Perhaps suggested Louise he had been insane and escaped from some asylum Then how did he come to be lying in a ditch questioned Patsy and wouldn t an escaped maniac be promptly hunted down and captured I think so agreed mister Merrick For my part I m inclined to accept the man s theory that it was an automobile accident Then what became of the car or of the others in it It s no use said Beth shaking her head gravely If Thursday Smith who is an intelligent young man couldn t solve the mystery himself it isn t likely we can do so We know as much as he does as far as that is concerned said Patsy and our combined intelligence ought at least to equal his I m sorry for the poor man and wish we might help him to come to his own again They all agreed to this sentiment and while the girls attended to their editorial duties they had the amazing story of Thursday Smith uppermost in their minds When the last copy had been placed in the hands of Miss Briggs and they were driving to the farm at a little after six o clock they renewed the interesting discussion Just before reaching the farm Hetty Hewitt came out of the wood just in front of them She was clothed in her short skirt and leggings and bore a fishing rod and a creel What luck asked Patsy stopping the horse Seven trout answered the artist I might have caught more but the poor little creatures squirmed and struggled so desperately that I hadn t the heart to destroy any more of them Won t you take them home for mister Merrick s breakfast Patsy looked at the girl musingly Jump in Hetty she said I m going to take you with us for the night The day s fishing has tired you there are deep circles under your eyes and that stuffy old hotel isn t home like Jump in Hetty flushed with pleasure but hesitated to accept the invitation I I m not dressed for You re all right said Beth supporting her cousin s proposition We ll lend you anything you need Do come Miss Hewitt added Louise Hetty sighed then smiled and finally climbed into the surrey In New York she said as they started on I ve sometimes hobnobbed with editors but this is somewhat different In what way asked Patsy casually You re not real journalists you know and Why aren t we journalists asked Louise For a moment Hetty was puzzled how to reply You are doing very good editorial work she said mendaciously but after all you are only playing at journalism The real journalist as I know him is a Bohemian a font of cleverness running to waste a reckless tender hearted jolly careless ne er do well who works like a Trojan and plays like a child He is very sophisticated at his desk and very artless when he dives into the underworld for rest and recreation He lives at high tension scintillates burns his red fire without discrimination and is shortly extinguished You are not like that You can t even sympathize with that sort of person But I can for I m cut from a remnant of the same cloth Scintillate all you want to Hetty cried Patsy with a laugh but you re not going to be extinguished For we the imitation journalists have taken you under our wings There s no underworld at Millville and the only excitement we can furnish just now is a night with us at the old farm That replied Hetty is indeed a real excitement You can t quite understand it perhaps but it s so so very different from what I m accustomed to Uncle John welcomed the girl artist cordially and under his hospitable roof the waif soon felt at ease At dinner the conversation turned upon Thursday Smith and his peculiar experience Beth asked Hetty if she knew the man Yes replied the girl I ve seen him at the office and we ve exchanged a word or two But he boards with Thorne the liveryman and not at the hotel You have never seen him before you met him here Never I wonder said Louise musingly if he is quite right in his mind All this story may be an hallucination you know He s a very clever fellow asserted Hetty and such a loss of memory is by no means so uncommon as you think Our brains are queer things mine is I know and it doesn t take much to throw their machinery out of gear Once I knew a reporter who was worried and over worked He came to the office one morning and said he was George Washington the Commander of the Continental Army In all other ways he was sane enough and we humored him and called him General At the end of three months the idea quit him as suddenly as it had come on and he was not only normal but greatly restored in strength of intellect through the experience Perhaps some of the overworked brain cells had taken a rest and renewed their energy It would not surprise me if some day Thursday Smith suddenly remembered who he was Footnote This anecdote is true Author In the meantime said Uncle John I m going to make an effort to discover his identity In what way Uncle asked Patsy I ll set Fogerty who is a clever detective at work No man can disappear from his customary haunts without leaving some sort of a record behind him and Fogerty may be able to uncover the mystery in a short time Then we ll lose our pressman declared Beth for I m positive that Thursday Smith was a person of some importance in his past life CHAPTER XI THE HONER BLE OJOY BOGLIN One morning while Patsy was alone in her office busied over her work the door softly opened and a curious looking individual stood before her He was thin in form leathery skinned and somewhat past the middle age of life His clothing consisted of a rusty black Prince Albert coat rusty trousers to match which were carefully creased cowhide shoes brilliant with stove polish a tall silk hat of antiquated design and a frayed winged collar decorated with a black tie on which sparkled a large diamond attached to a chain He had chin whiskers of a sandy gray color and small gray eyes that were both shrewd and suspicious in expression He stood in the doorway a moment attentively eyeing the girl while she in turn examined him with an amusement she could not quite suppress Then he said speaking in a low diffident voice I m lookin for the editor I am the editor asserted Patsy Really It is quite true He seemed disconcerted a moment striving to regain his assurance Then he took out a well worn pocketbook and from its depths abstracted a soiled card which leaning forward he placed carefully upon the table before Patsy She glanced at it and read honorable Ojoy Boglin Hooker s Falls Chazy County Oh said she rather surprised are you mister Boglin I am the Honer ble Ojoy Boglin miss he replied dwelling lovingly upon the Honer ble I have not had the honor of your acquaintance said she deciding she did not like her visitor What is your business please The honorable Ojoy coughed Then he suddenly remembered he was in the presence of a lady and took off his hat Next he slid slowly into the vacant chair at the end of the table First he began I want to compliment you on your new paper It s a good thing and I like it It s what s been needed in these ere parts a long time and it s talked about all over Chazy County Thank you said the editor briefly for the praise was given in a perfunctory way that irritated her The only other papers in this senatorial deestric which covers three counties continued the visitor in impressive tones air weeklies run by political mud slingers that s bought up by the Kleppish gang What is the Kleppish gang she asked wonderingly The supporters o that rascal Colonel Kleppish who has been occupyin my berth for goin on eight years he said with fierce indignation I fear I do not understand remarked Patsy really bewildered What was your berth which Colonel Kleppish has has usurped See that Honer ble on the card I do That means I were senator state senator which makes any common man honer ble accordin to law which it s useless to dispute I were elected fer this deestric which covers three counties he said proudly an I served my country in that capacity Oh I see But you re not state senator now No Kleppish beat me for the nomination after I d served only one term Why Eh Why did he git the nomination Cause he bought up the newspapers the country weeklies and set them to yellin graft He made em say I went into office poor and in two years made a fortune Did you asked the girl He shuffled in his seat I ain t used to talkin politics with a girl he admitted but seein as you re the editor of this paper a daily by Jupe you ve probably got a head on you and understand that a man don t get into office for his health There s a lot of bother in servin your country and a man oughter be well paid for it I did jest like the others do like Kleppish is doin right now but the reg lar voters don t understand politics and when the howl went up about graft backed by Kleppish s bought up newspapers they turned me down cold I ve been eight years watchin for a chance to get in again an now I ve got it This is very interesting I m sure remarked Patsy but our paper doesn t go much into local politics mister Boglin and I m very busy to day Honer ble Ojoy Boglin he said correcting her but he did not take the hint to leave Patsy picked up her pencil as if to resume her work while he eyed her with a countenance baffled and uncertain Presently he asked Has Kleppish got this paper too No she coldly replied I thought I d likely head him off you being so new See here Editor I am Miss Doyle sir Glad to know you Miss Doyle What I was about to remark is this The election for senator comes up agin in September and I want this paper to pull for me Bein as it s a daily it s got more power than all of Kleppish s weeklies put together and if you work the campaign proper I ll win the nomination hands down This is a strong Republican deestric and to git nominated on the Republican ticket is the same as an election So what I want is the nomination What do you say Patsy glared at him and decided that as far as appearances went he was not a fit candidate for any office however humble But she answered diplomatically I will inquire into the condition of politics in this district mister Boglin and try to determine which candidate is the most deserving Having reached a decision the Millville Tribune will espouse the cause of the best man if it mentions local politics at all The honorable Ojoy gave a dissatisfied grunt That means in plain words he suggested that you ll give Kleppish a chance to bid against me But I need this paper and I m willin to pay a big price for it Let Kleppish go and we ll make our dicker right now on a lib ral basis It s the only way you can make your paper pay I ve got money Miss Doyle I own six farms near Hooker s Falls which is in this county and six hundred acres of good pine forest and I m director in the Bank of Huntingdon with plenty of money out on interest Also I own half the stock in the new paper mill at Royal You do she exclaimed I thought mister Skeelty Skeelty s the head man of course he said He came to me about the mill proposition and I went in with him I own all the forest around Royal Bein manager and knowin the business Skeelty stood out for fifty one shares of stock which is the controllin interest but I own all the rest and the mill s makin good money People don t know I m in that deal and of course this is all confidential and not to be talked about Very well sir But I fear you have mistaken the character of our paper said Patsy quietly We are quite independent mister Boglin and intend to remain so even if we can t make the paper pay In other words the Millville Daily Tribune can t be bought He stared in amazement then scratched his ear with a puzzled air Such talk as that means somethin he asserted gropingly but what it means blamed if I know Newspapers never turn money down unless they re a ready bought or have got a grouch of their own Say he suddenly cried as an inspiration struck him you ain t got anything agin the mill at Royal or agin Skeelty have you I have sir declared Patsy raising her head to frown discouragingly upon the Honer ble Ojoy mister Skeelty is acting in a very disagreeable manner He has not only boycotted our paper and refused to pay for the subscriptions he engaged but I understand he is encouraging his workmen to annoy the Millville people and especially this printing office Well durn Skeelty ejaculated mister Boglin greatly discomposed by this statement But I ll fix all that Miss Doyle he added eagerly Skeelty s my partner and he s got to do what I say or I ll make trouble for him You dicker with me for the support of your paper and I ll guarantee a hundred subscriptions from Royal and get you an apology from Skeelty and a promise he ll behave an keep his men to home And all that s outside the price I ll agree to pay Patsy s eyes were full of scorn I won t dicker with you an instant she firmly declared I don t know Colonel Kleppish or what his character is but I m very sure he s the better man and that the people have made no mistake in electing him in your place No respectable candidate for office would attempt to buy the support of a newspaper and I advise you to change the wording on your card Instead of Honorable it should read Dishonorable Ojoy Boglin Good day sir mister Boglin s face turned white with rage He half rose from his seat but sat down again with a vicious snarl I ve coaxed so far young woman he said grimly but I guess it s time I showed my hand You ll either run this paper in my interest or I ll push Skeelty on to make the town too hot to hold you I ve got power in this county even if I ain t senator and you ll feel that power if you dare oppose me Take your choice girl either to make good money out o this campaign or be run out of town neck an crop It s up to you to decide In thirty seconds said Patsy her face as white as was Boglin s I shall ring this bell to summon my men to throw you out The Honer ble Ojoy slowly rose and put on his hat Look out he said warningly I will snapped Patsy This ain t the end of it girl There are ten seconds left she said He picked up his card turned his back and walked out leaving his opponent trembling betwixt agitation and righteous indignation A few moments later Bob West came in and looked at the girl editor curiously Ojoy Boglin has been here he said The Honer ble Ojoy if you please answered Patsy with a laugh that bordered on hysteria The hardware man nodded his eyes reading her face You were quite right to turn him down he asserted It was the only thing to do responded the girl wondering how he knew But Boglin is a dangerous man resumed West Look out for him Miss Doyle Yes he told me to do that and I will said she more quietly He is Skeelty s partner And you re not afraid of him Why should I be mister West He smiled I m justice of the peace here If there s a hint of trouble from Boglin or Skeelty come directly to me Thank you mister West I will With this he nodded cheerfully and went away CHAPTER XII MOLLY SIZER S PARTY The people of Chazy County were very proud of the Millville Tribune the only daily paper in that section of the state It was really a very good newspaper if small in size and related the news of the day as promptly as the great New York journals did Arthur Weldon had not been very enthusiastic about the paper at any time although he humored the girls by attending in a good natured way to the advertising hiring some of the country folk to get subscriptions and keeping the books He was a young man of considerable education who had inherited a large fortune safely invested and therefore had no need through financial necessity to interest himself in business of any sort He allowed the girls to print his name as editor in chief but he did no editorial work at all amusing himself these delightful summer days by wandering in the woods where he collected botanical specimens or sitting with Uncle John on the lawn where they read together or played chess Both the men were glad the girls were happy in their work and enthusiastic over the success of their audacious venture Beth was developing decided talent as a writer of editorials and her articles were even more thoughtful and dignified than were those of Patsy The two girls found plenty to occupy them at the office while Louise did the reportorial work and flitted through Millville and down to Huntingdon each day in search of small items of local interest She grew fond of this work for it brought her close to the people and enabled her to study their characters and peculiarities Her manner of approaching the simple country folk was so gracious and winning that they freely gave her any information they possessed and chatted with her unreservedly Sometimes Louise would make her rounds alone but often Arthur would join her for an afternoon drive to Huntingdon and it greatly amused him to listen to his girl wife s adroit manner of pumping the natives About halfway to Huntingdon was the Sizer Farm the largest and most important in that vicinity Old Zeke Sizer had a large family five boys and three girls and they were noted as quite the most aggressive and disturbing element in the neighborhood Old Zeke was rude and coarse and swore like a trooper so his sons could not be expected to excel him in refinement Bill Sizer the eldest was a hard drinker and people who knew him asserted that he never drew a sober breath The other sons were all quarrelsome in disposition and many a free fight was indulged in among them whenever disputes arose They were industrious farmers though and the three girls and their mother worked from morning till night so the farm prospered and the Sizers were reputed to be well off Molly the eldest girl had attracted Louise who declared she was pretty enough to arrest attention in any place Indeed this girl was a raving beauty in her buxom countrified way and her good looks were the pride of the Sizer family and the admiration of the neighbors The other two were bouncing merry girls rather coarse in manner as might be expected from their environment but Molly perhaps fully conscious of her prettiness assumed certain airs and graces and a regal deportment that brought even her big brutal brothers to her feet in adoration The Sizers were among the first subscribers to the Millville Tribune and whenever Louise stopped at the farmhouse for news the family would crowd around her ignoring all duties and volunteer whatever information they possessed For when they read their own gossip in the local column it gave them a sort of proprietary interest in the paper and Bill had once thrashed a young clerk at Huntingdon for questioning the truth of an item the Sizers had contributed One day when Louise and Arthur stopped at the farm Mollie ran out with an eager face to say that Friday was her birthday and the Sizers were to give a grand party to celebrate it We want you to come over an write it up missus Weldon said the girl They re comin from twenty mile around fer the dance an we ve got the orchestry from Malvern to play for us Pop s goin to spend a lot of money on refreshments an it ll be the biggest blow out Chazy County ever seen I think I can write up the party without being present Mollie suggested Louise No you come over I read once in a novel how an editor come to a swell party an writ about all the dresses an things said what everybody wore you know I m goin to have a new dress an if ever thing s described right well we ll buy a lot of papers to send to folks we know in Connecticut Well said Louise with a sigh I ll try to drive over for a little while It is to be Saturday you say Yes the birthday s Friday and the dance Saturday night rain or shine An you might bring the chief editor your husband an try a dance with us It wouldn t hurt our reputation any to have you folks mingle with us on this festive occasion she added airily They had a good laugh over this invitation when it was reported at mister Merrick s dinner table and Patsy insisted that Louise must write up the party It will be fun to give it a double head and a big send off she said Write it up as if it were a real society event dear and exhaust your vocabulary on the gowns You ll have to invent some Frenchy names to describe those I guess for they ll be wonders and we ll wind up with a list of those present So on Saturday evening Arthur drove his wife over to the Sizer farm and long before they reached there they heard the scraping of fiddles mingled with shouts and boisterous laughter It was a prohibition district to be sure but old Sizer had imported from somewhere outside the dry zone a quantity of liquors more remarkable for strength than quality and with these the guests had been plied from the moment of their arrival Most of them were wholly unused to such libations so by the time Arthur and Louise arrived the big living room of the farmhouse presented an appearance of wild revelry that was quite deplorable Molly welcomed them with wild enthusiasm and big Bill her adoring brother demanded in a loud voice if Arthur did not consider her the Belle of Chazy County They ain t a stunner in the state as kin hold a candle to our Molly he added and then with uncertain gait he left the reporters with the promise to bring em a drink Come Louise said Arthur quietly let s get out of here He drew her to the door and as a dance was just starting they managed to escape without notice What a disgraceful scene cried Louise when they were on their way home and to think of such a shocking carousal being held in good old Chazy County where morals are usually irreproachable I shall not mention the affair in the Tribune at all But Patsy who had a managing editor s respect for news of any sort combatted this determination and begged Louise to write up Molly Sizer s party without referring to its deplorable features It isn t policy to offend the Sizers she said for although they are coarse and common they have shown a friendly spirit toward the paper Moreover the enmity of such people which would surely result from our ignoring the birthday party would keep us in hot water So Louise though reluctantly wrote up the party and the manuscript was sent over to Miss Briggs Sunday afternoon so it would get a place in Monday morning s Tribune Uncle John had the paper at breakfast on Monday and he gave an amused laugh as his eye caught the report of the Sizer party This is a good one on you Louise he exclaimed You say that Miss Molly looking more lovely than ever in her handsome new gown greeted her guests with a roughish smile A what demanded Louise horrified A roughish smile Oh that s a mistake she said glancing at the item What I said was a roguish smile but there s been a typographical error which Miss Briggs must have overlooked in reading the proof Nevertheless remarked Arthur the statement isn t far wrong Everything was rough including the smiles as far as I noted that remarkable gathering But see here cried Patsy that s a dreadful mistake That spoils all the nice things you said about the girl Louise I hope the Sizers won t notice it But the Sizers did and were frantic with rage over what they deemed was a deliberate insult to Molly Several young men who had come from distances to attend the birthday party had stayed over Sunday at the farmhouse where the revelry still continued in a fitful way due to vain attempts to relieve racking headaches by further libations Monday morning found the dissipated crew still the guests of the Sizers and when big Bill slowly spelled out the assertion made by the Tribune that his sister had a roughish smile loud cries of indignation arose Molly first cried and then had hysterics and screamed vigorously Bill swore vengeance on the Millville Tribune and all connected with it while the guests gravely asserted it was a low down measly trick which the Sizers ought to resent They all began drinking again to calm their feelings and after the midday dinner Bill Sizer grabbed a huge cowhide whip and started to Millville to lick the editor to a standstill A wagonload of his guests accompanied him and Molly pleaded with her brother not to hurt missus Weldon I won t but I ll cowhide that fresh husband of hers declared Bill He s the editor the paper says so and he s the one I m after CHAPTER XIII BOB WEST INTERFERES It was unfortunate that at that time Thursday Smith had gone up the electric line toward Royal to inspect it In the office were Patsy Hetty Hewitt who was making a drawing Arthur Weldon engaged upon his books and finally seated in an easy chair from which he silently watched them work old Bob West the hardware man Louise and Beth had driven over to the Junction to write up an accident one of the trainmen having caught his hand in a coupling between two freight cars Bob West often dropped into the office which was next door to his own place of business but he was a silent man and had little to say on these visits In his early days he had wandered pretty much over the whole world and he could relate some interesting personal adventures if he chose In this retired village West was the one inhabitant distinguished above his fellows for his knowledge of the world In his rooms over the store where few were ever invited he had a fine library of unusual books and a rare collection of curios gathered from foreign lands It was natural that such a man would be interested in so unique an experiment as the Millville Tribune and he watched its conduct with curiosity but a constantly growing respect for the three girl journalists No one ever minded when he came into the office nodded and sat down Sometimes he would converse with much freedom at other times the old gentleman remained an hour without offering a remark and went away with a brief parting nod It was West who first saw through the window the wagonload of men from the Sizer farm come dashing up the street at a gallop Instinctively perhaps he knew trouble was brewing but he never altered his expression or his attitude even when the wagon stopped at the printing office and the passengers leaped out In marched Bill Sizer at the head of his following cowhide in hand Patsy her face flushing scarlet stood up and faced the intruders Stand back girl cried Sizer in a fierce tone it s that coward editor I m after pointing his whip with trembling hand at Arthur My sister Molly may be rough an hev a rough smile but I ll be dinged ef I don t skin the man thet prints it in a paper Good fer you Bill murmured his friends approvingly Arthur leaned back and regarded his accuser in wonder The big table littered with papers was between them Come out o there ye measly city chap an take yer medicine roared Bill swinging his whip I ll larn ye to come inter a decent neighborhood an slander its women Come outer there West had sat quietly observing the scene Now he inquired in composed tones What s the trouble Bill Trouble Trouble West Why this lyin scroundrel said in his paper thet our Molly had a rough smile That s the trouble Did he really say that asked West Course he did Printed it in the paper for all to read That s why I ve come to cowhide the critter within an inch o his life Good fer you Bill cried his friends encouragingly But wait a moment commanded West as the maddened half drunken young farmer was about to leap over the table to grasp his victim you re not going at this thing right Bill Sizer Why ain t I Bob West Because answered West in calm even tones this insult is too great to be avenged by a mere cowhiding Nothing but blood will wipe away the dreadful stain on your sister s character Oh mister West cried Patsy horrified by such a statement Eh Blood said Bill stupefied by the suggestion Of course returned West You mustn t thrash mister Weldon you must kill him A delighted chorus of approval came from Sizer s supporters All right then said the bully glaring around I I ll kill the scandler Hold on counselled West seizing his arm This affair must be conducted properly otherwise the law might cause us trouble No murder mind you You must kill Weldon in a duel A a what A duel gasped Sizer To be sure That s the way to be revenged Hetty he added turning to the artist who alone of the observers had smiled instead of groaned at the old gentleman s startling suggestion will you kindly run up to my rooms and get a red leather case that lies under the shell cabinet Thank you my dear Hetty was off like a flash During her absence an intense silence pervaded the office broken only by an occasional hiccough from one of mister Sizer s guests Patsy was paralyzed with horror and had fallen back into her chair to glare alternately at Bob West and the big bully who threatened her cousin s husband Arthur was pale and stern as he fixed a reproachful gaze on the hardware merchant From Miss Briggs little room could be heard the steady click click of the telegraph instrument But the furious arrival of the Sizer party had aroused every inhabitant of Millville and with one accord they dropped work and rushed to the printing office By this time the windows were dark with groups of eager faces that peered wonderingly through the screens the sashes being up and listened to the conversation within While Hetty was gone not a word was spoken but the artist was absent only a brief time Presently she reentered and laid the red leather case on the table before Bob West The hardware man at once opened it displaying a pair of old fashioned dueling pistols with long barrels and pearl handles There was a small can of powder some bullets and wadding in the case and as West took up one of the pistols and proceeded to load it he said in an unconcerned voice I once got these from an officer in Vienna and they have been used in more than a score of duels I was told One of the pistols I can t tell which it is has killed a dozen men so you are going to fight with famous weapons Both Arthur and Bill Sizer as well as the groups at the window watched the loading of the pistols with fascinated gaze Bob s a queer ol feller whispered Peggy McNutt to the blacksmith who stood beside him This dool is just one o his odd fancies Much he keers ef they kills each other er not mister West cried Patsy suddenly rousing from her apathy I ll not allow this shameful thing A duel is no better than murder and I m sure there is a law against it True returned West ramming the bullet into the second pistol it is quite irregular and er illegal I believe Perhaps I shall go to jail with whichever of the duelists survives but you see it is a point of honor with us all Molly Sizer has seemingly been grossly maligned in your paper and the editor is responsible Are you a good shot Bill I I guess so stammered Sizer That s good Weldon I hear is an expert with the pistol Arthur did not contradict this statement although he was positive he could not hit a barn at twenty yards Now then are we ready staid West rising Come with me gentlemen What ye goin to do Bob asked Sizer anxiously I ll explain replied the hardware man leading the way to the street Everyone followed him and the crowd at the windows joined the group outside Of course you mustn t shoot in the main street for you might hit some one or break windows but back of this row of buildings is a lane that is perfectly clear You will stand back to back in the center of the block and then at my word you will each march to the end of the block and pass around the buildings to the lane As soon as you come in sight of one another you are privileged to fire and I suppose Bill Sizer will try to kill you mister Weldon on the spot and therefore you will try to kill him first But look a here Bob cried Sizer it ain t right fer him to take a shot at me You said fer me to kill him but ye didn t say nuth n about his shootin at me That s all right Bill returned West You re in the right and the right ought to win But you must give the man a chance for his life you know That weren t in the bargain It is now by the laws of dueling He he might shoot me urged Bill It isn t likely Although he s a dead shot you have right on your side and you must be sure to fire as soon as you get within good range It won t be considered murder it will only be a duel and the law will deal lightly with you That s right Bill asserted one of Sizer s friends Bob West s a justice o the peace himself an he orter know I do know declared West gravely He placed Arthur Weldon and Bill Sizer back to back in the middle of the street and handed each a pistol Now then said he you both understand the rules which I have explained and the spectators will bear witness that whatever happens this affair has been conducted in a regular manner with no favor shown to either You are both brave men and this duel will vindicate your honor If you are fortunate enough to survive you will be heroes and all your differences will be wiped off the slate But as one or both may fall we the citizens of Millville hereby bid you a solemn and sad farewell Impressed by this speech Sizer s friends began to shake hands with him All ready called West One two three go At the word the two back to back started for the opposite ends of the little street and at once the crowd made a rush between the buildings to gain the rear where they might witness the shooting in the lane when the duelists met Arthur had been thinking seriously during these proceedings and had made up his mind it was in no degree his duty to be bored full of holes by a drunken countryman like Bill Sizer just because there had been a typographical error in the Millville Tribune So when he got to the end of the street instead of turning into the lane he made for the farm holding the long dueling pistol gingerly in his hand and trotting at a good pace for home Footsteps followed him In sudden panic he increased his run but the other was faster A heavy hand grasped his shoulder and swung him around while old Bob West panting for Breath exclaimed Stop you fool stop The other one is running The other one echoed Arthur wonderingly Of course Bill Sizer was sure to run he s a coward as all bullies are Quick Weldon save the day and your reputation or I ll never stand your friend again Arthur understood now He turned and ran back faster than he had come swung into the lane where the crowd was cautiously peering from the shelter of the buildings and waving his pistol in a reckless way that made Bob West shudder he cried out Where is he Where s Sizer Why don t he show up and be shot like a man No Sizer appeared He was even then headed cross lots for home leaving his friends to bemoan his cowardice As for Arthur the crowd gave him a cheer and condemned his opponent s conduct in no measured terms They were terribly disappointed by Big Bill s defection for while not especially bloodthirsty they hated to see the impending tragedy turn out a farce In the printing office Patsy was laughing hysterically as her horror dissolved and allowed her to discover the comic phase of the duel She literally fell on Arthur s neck as he entered but the next moment pushed him away to face the hardware merchant I beg your pardon mister West said she with twinkling eyes I suspected you of being a cold blooded ruffian when you proposed this duel but I now see that you understand human nature better than the whole caboodle of us put together Arthur thank mister West for saving you from a flogging I do indeed said Arthur fervently CHAPTER XIV THE DANGER SIGNAL By this time the Tribune had become the pride of all Millville yet the villagers could not quite overcome their awe and wonder at it Also the newspaper was the pride of the three girl journalists who under the tutelage of Miss Briggs were learning to understand the complicated system of a daily journal Their amateurish efforts were gradually giving way to more dignified and readable articles Beth could write an editorial that interested even Uncle John her severest critic Louise showed exceptional talent for picking up local happenings and making news notes of them while Patsy grabbed everything that came to her net locals editorials telegraphic and telephone reports from all parts of the world and skillfully sorted edited and arranged them for the various departments of the paper It was mighty interesting to them all and they were so eager each morning to get to work that they could scarcely devote the proper time to old Nora s famous breakfasts We made a mistake Uncle said Patsy to mister Merrick in starting the Tribune in the wrong place In a few weeks we must leave it and go back to the city whereas had we established our paper in New York Then it never would have been heard of interrupted practical Beth In New York Patsy dear we would become the laughing stock of the town I shudder when I think what a countrified paper we turned out that first issue But we are fast becoming educated declared Patsy I m not ashamed of the Tribune now even in comparison with the best New York dailies Beth laughed but Uncle John said judicially For Millville it s certainly a marvel I get the world news more concisely and more pleasantly from its four pages than when I wade through twenty or thirty of the big pages of a metropolitan newspaper You are doing famously my dears I congratulate you But we are running behind dreadfully suggested Arthur the bookkeeper even since Thursday Smith enabled us to cut down expenses so greatly The money that comes in never equals what we pay out How long can you keep this up girls They made no reply nor did Uncle John discuss the financial condition of the newspaper He was himself paying some heavy expenses that did not appear on the books such as the Associated Press franchise the telegraph bills and the electric power but he was quite delighted to take care of these items and regretted he had not assumed more of the paper s obligations He knew the expenses were eating big holes in the incomes of his three nieces yet they never complained nor allowed their enthusiasm to flag mister Merrick who had tested these girls in more ways than one was watching them carefully and fully approved their spirit and courage under such trying conditions Major Doyle Patsy s father when the first copy of the Millville Tribune was laid on his desk in the city was astounded at the audacity of this rash venture When he could command his temper to write calmly he sent a letter to mister Merrick which read Taken altogether John you re the craziest bunch of irresponsibles outside an asylum No wonder you kept this folly a secret from me until you had accomplished your nefarious designs The Millville Daily Tribune is a corker and no mistake for our Patsy s at the head of your lunatic gang I ll go farther and say the paper s a wonder I believe it is the first daily newspaper published in a town of six inhabitants that has ever carried the Associated Press dispatches But allow me to ask why The lonely inhabitants of the desert of Chazy County don t need a daily or a weekly or a monthly A semi annual would about hit their gait and be more than they deserve So I ve decided it s merely a silly way to spend money and an easy way too I ll be bound Oblige me by explaining this incomprehensible eccentricity To this a mild protest for the major Uncle John replied Dear Major Doyle Yours received Have you no business of your own to attend to Affectionately yours John Merrick The major took the hint He made no further complaint but read the paper religiously every day gloating over Patsy s name as managing editor and preserving the files with great care He really enjoyed the Millville Tribune and as his summer vacation was shortly due he anticipated with pleasure a visit to the farm and a peep at the workings of our Patsy s famous newspaper The other girls he ignored If Patsy was connected with the thing her adoring parent was quite sure she was responsible for all the good there was in it The paper printed no mention of the famous duel But Hetty made a cartoon of it showing the lane with its fringe of spectators Arthur Weldon standing manfully to await his antagonist and big Bill Sizer in the distance sprinting across the fields in the direction of home This cartoon was highly prized by those who had witnessed the adventure and Peggy McNutt pinned it on the wall of his real estate office beside the one Hetty had made of himself Bill Sizer promptly stopped the paper that being the only vengeance at hand and when Bob West sent a boy to him demanding the return of the pistol Bill dispatched with the weapon the following characteristic note which he had penned with much labor Bob west sir you Beet me out uv my Reeveng and Made me look like a bag uv Beens but I will skware this Thing sum da and yu and that edyter hed better Watch out i don t stand fer no Throwdown like that Wm Sizer However the bully received scant sympathy even from his most intimate friends and his prestige in the community was henceforth destroyed Arthur did not crow for his part He told the girls frankly of his attempt to run away and evade the meeting which sensible intention was only frustrated by Bob West s interference and they all agreed he was thoroughly justified The young man had proved to them his courage years before and none of the girls was disposed to accuse him of cowardice for not wishing to shoot or be shot by such a person as Bill Sizer A few days following the duel another incident occurred which was of a nature so startling that it drove the Sizer comedy from all minds This time Thursday Smith was the hero Hetty Hewitt it seems was having a desperate struggle to quell the longings of her heart for the allurements of the great city She had been for years a thorough Bohemienne frequenting cafes theatres and dance halls smoking and drinking with men and women of her class and by degrees losing every womanly quality with which nature had generously endowed her But the girl was not really bad She was essentially nervous and craved excitement so she had drifted into this sort of life because no counteracting influence of good had been injected into her pliable disposition None that is until the friendly editor for whom she worked anticipating her final downfall had sought to save her by sending her to a country newspaper He talked to the girl artist very frankly before she left for Millville and Hetty knew he was right and was truly grateful for the opportunity to redeem herself The sweet girl journalists with whom she was thrown in contact were so different from any young women she had heretofore known and proved so kindly sympathetic that Hetty speedily became ashamed of her wasted life and formed a brave resolution to merit the friendship so generously extended her But it was hard work at first She could get through the days easily enough by wandering in the woods and taking long walks along the rugged country roads but in the evenings came the insistent call of the cafes the cheap orchestras vaudeville midnight suppers and the like She strenuously fought this yearning and found it was growing less and less powerful to influence her But her nights were yet restless and her nerves throbbing from the effects of past dissipations Often she would find herself unable to sleep and would go out into the moonlight when all others were in bed and prowl around with the cats as she expressed it until the wee hours of morning Often she told Patsy she wished there was more work she could do The drawings required by the paper never occupied her more than a couple of hours each day Sometimes she made one of her cleverest cartoons in fifteen or twenty minutes Can t I do something else she begged Let me set type or run the ticker I can receive telegrams fairly well or even write a column of local comment I m no journalist so you ll not be envious But Patsy shook her head Really Hetty there s nothing else you can do and your pictures are very important to us Rest and enjoy yourself and get strong and well You are improving wonderfully in health since you came here Often at midnight Hetty would wander into the pressroom and watch Thursday Smith run off the edition on the wonderful press which seemed to possess an intelligence of its own so perfectly did it perform its functions At such times she sat listlessly by and said little for Thursday was no voluble talker especially when busied over his press But a certain spirit of comradeship grew up between these two and it was not unusual for the pressmen after his work was finished and the papers were neatly piled for distribution to the carriers at daybreak to walk with Hetty to the hotel before proceeding to his own lodgings in the little wing of Nick Thorne s house which stood quite at the end of the street To be sure the hotel adjoined the printing office with only a vacant lot between but Hetty seemed to appreciate this courtesy and would exchange a brief good night with Smith before going to her own room Afterward she not infrequently stole out again because sleep would not come to her and then the moon watched her wanderings until it dipped behind the hills On the night we speak of Hetty had parted from Thursday Smith at one o clock and crept into the hallway of the silent barnlike hotel but as soon as the man turned away she issued forth again and walked up the empty street like a shadow Almost to Thompson s Crossing she strolled deep in thought and then turned and retraced her steps But when she again reached the hotel she was wide eyed as ever so she passed the building thinking she would go on to Little Bill Creek and sit by the old mill for a time The girl was just opposite the printing office when her attention was attracted by a queer grating noise as if one of the windows was being pried up She stopped short a moment and then crept closer to the building Two men were at a side window of the pressroom which they had just succeeded in opening As Hetty gained her point of observation one of the men slipped inside but a moment later hastily reappeared and joined his fellow At once both turned and stole along the side of the shed directly toward the place where the girl stood Her first impulse was to run but recollecting that she wore a dark gown and stood in deep shadow she merely flattened herself against the building and remained motionless The men were chuckling as they passed her and she recognized them as mill hands from Royal Guess that ll do the job said one in a low tone If it don t nothin will was the reply They were gone then stealing across the road and beating a hasty retreat under the shadows of the houses Hetty stood motionless a moment wondering what to do Then with sudden resolve she ran to Thorne s house and rapped sharply at the window of the wing where she knew Thursday Smith slept She heard him leap from bed and open the blind What is it he asked It s me Thursday Hetty she said Two men have just broken into the pressroom through a window They were men from Royal and they didn t steal anything but ran away in great haste I I m afraid something is wrong Thursday Even while she spoke he was rapidly dressing Wait he called to her In a few moments he opened the door and joined her Without hesitation he began walking rapidly toward the office and the girl kept step with him He asked no questions whatever but us soon as she had led him to the open window he leaped through it and switched on an electric light An instant later he cried aloud in a voice of fear Get out Hetty Run for your life Run yourself Thursday if there s danger she coolly returned But he shouted Run run run in such thrilling compelling tones that the girl shrank away and dashed across the vacant lot to the hotel before she turned again in time to see Smith leap from the window and make a dash toward the rear He was carrying something something extended at arms length before him and he crossed the lane and ran far into the field before stooping to set down his burden Now he was racing back again running as madly as if a troop of demons was after him A flash cleft the darkness a deep detonation thundered and echoed against the hills the building against which Hetty leaned shook as if an earthquake had seized it and Thursday Smith was thrown flat on his face and rolled almost to the terrified girl s feet where he lay motionless Only the building saved her from pitching headlong too but as the reverberations died away to be followed by frantic screams from the rudely wakened population of Millville Hetty sank upon her knees and turned the man over so that he lay face up He opened his eyes and put up one hand Then he struggled to his feet trembling weakly and his white face smiled into the girl s anxious one That was a close call dear he whispered but your timely discovery saved us from a terrible calamity I I don t believe there is much harm done as it is Hetty made no reply She was thinking of the moments he had held that deadly Thing in his hands while he strove to save lives and property from destruction The inevitable crowd was gathering now demanding in terrified tones what had happened Men women and children poured from the houses in scant attire all unnerved and fearful crying for an explanation of the explosion Keep mum Hetty said Smith warningly It will do no good to tell them the truth She nodded realizing it was best the villagers did not suspect that an enemy of the newspaper had placed them all in dire peril Dynamite she asked in a whisper Yes a bomb But for heaven s sake don t mention it Suddenly a man with a lantern discovered a great pit in the field behind the lane and the crowd quickly surrounded it From their limited knowledge of the facts the explosion seemed unaccountable but there was sufficient intelligence among them to determine that dynamite had caused it and dug this gaping hole in the stony soil Bob West glanced at the printing office which was directly in line with the explosion then he cast a shrewd look into the white face of Thursday Smith but the old hardware merchant merely muttered under his breath something about Ojoy Boglin and shook his head determinedly when questioned by his fellow villagers Interest presently centered in the damage that had been done Many window panes were shattered and the kitchen chimney of the hotel had toppled over but no person had been injured and the damage could easily be repaired While the excitement was at its height Thursday Smith returned to his room and went to bed but long after the villagers had calmed down sufficiently to seek their homes Hetty Hewitt sat alone by the great pit staring reflectively into its ragged depths Quaint and curious were the thoughts that puzzled the solitary girl s weary brain but prominent and ever recurring was the sentence that had trembled upon Thursday Smith s lips It was a close call dear The close call didn t worry Hetty a particle it was the last word of the sentence that amazed her That and a new and wonderful respect for the manliness of Thursday Smith filled her heart to overflowing CHAPTER XV A CLEVER IDEA Neither Thursday nor Hetty allowed a word to escape concerning the placing of the bomb in the Tribune office but the explosion was public knowledge and many were bothering their heads to explain its meaning John Merrick when he heard the news looked very grave and glanced uneasily into the unconscious faces of his three beloved nieces A man of much worldly experience in spite of his simple ingenuous nature the little man began carefully piecing together parts of the puzzle Thursday Smith s defense of the girl journalists whereby he had severely pounded some of the workmen who had insulted them had caused the man to be denounced by the colony at Royal mister Skeelty the manager had demanded that Smith be discharged by mister Mirrick and being refused had threatened to shut off the power from the newspaper plant Skeelty dared not carry out this threat for fear of a lawsuit but his men who had urged the matter of Smith s discharge upon their manager were of the class that seeks revenge at any cost At this juncture Ojoy Boglin Skeelty s partner and the owner of all the pine forest around Royal had become the enemy of the newspaper and was aware of the feeling among the workmen A word from Boglin backed by Skeelty s tacit consent would induce the men to go to any length in injuring the Millville Tribune and all concerned in its welfare Considering these facts mister Merrick shrewdly suspected that the dynamite explosion had been the work of the mill hands yet why it was harmlessly exploded in a field was a factor that puzzled him exceedingly He concluded from what information he possessed that they had merely intended this as a warning which if disregarded might be followed by a more serious catastrophe The idea that such a danger threatened his nieces made the old gentleman distinctly nervous There were ways to evade further molestation from the lawless element at the mill The honorable Ojoy could be conciliated Thursday Smith discharged or the girls could abandon their journalistic enterprise altogether Such alternatives were mortifying to consider but his girls must be protected from harm at any cost While he was still considering the problem the girls and Arthur having driven to the office as usual Joe Wegg rode over from Thompson s Crossing on his sorrel mare for a chat with his old friend and benefactor It was this same young man still a boy in years who had once owned the Wegg Farm and disposed of it to mister Merrick Joe was something of a mechanical genius and when his father died longed to make his way in the great world But after many vicissitudes and failures he returned to Chazy County to marry Ethel Thompson his boyhood sweetheart and to find that one of his father s apparently foolish investments had made him rich Ethel was the great granddaughter of the pioneer settler of Chazy County Little Bill Thompson from whom the Little Bill Creek and Little Bill Mountain had been named It was he who first established the mill at Millville so in marrying a descendant of Little Bill Thompson Joe Wegg had become quite the most important resident of Chazy County and the young man was popular and well liked by all who knew him After the first interchange of greetings Joe questioned mister Merrick about the explosion of the night before and Uncle John frankly stated his suspicions I m sorry said Joe they ever started that mill at Royal Falls Most of the workmen are foreigners and all of them rude and reckless They have caused our quiet law abiding people no end of trouble and anxiety already It is becoming a habit with them to haunt Millville on Saturday nights when they are partly intoxicated and they ve even invaded some of the farmhouses and frightened the women and children I ve talked to Bob West about it and he has promised to swear in Lon Taft and Seth Davis as special constables to preserve order but he admits we are quite helpless to oppose such a gang of rowdies I ve also been to see mister Skeelty to ask him to keep his men at home but he answered gruffly that he had no authority over his employees except during working hours and not much authority even then Skeelty doesn t seem the right man to handle those fellows observed mister Merrick thoughtfully but as he owns the controlling interest in his company and Boglin is fully as unreasonable we cannot possibly oust him from control If the men determined to blow up all Millville with dynamite I m sure Skeelty would not lift a finger to prevent it No he s deathly afraid of them and that s a fact said Joe They sat in silence a while Your report of Skeelty s threat to cut off your electric power said young Wegg reminds me of a plan I ve had in mind for some time I find I ve too much time on my hands mister Merrick and I cannot be thoroughly happy unless I m occupied Ethel s farms are let on shares and I m a drone in the world s busy hive But we re anchored here at Millville so I ve been wondering what I could do to improve the place and keep myself busy It has seemed to me that the same rush of water in Little Bill Creek that runs the dynamos at Royal is in evidence to a lesser extent at the old milldam What would you think of my putting in an electric plant at the mill and lighting both Millville and Huntingdon as well as all the farmhouses Not a bad idea Joe said Uncle John approvingly Electric lights have a civilizing influence continued the young man I m quite sure all the farmers between here and Huntingdon would use them at a reasonable price I can also run a line to Hooker s Falls and one to Chazy Junction Plenty of poles can be cut from our pine forests and the wires will be the chief expense I may not make money at first but I ll play pretty nearly even and have something to do Do you think you could furnish enough power for our printing office asked mister Merrick Yes and a dozen factories besides I ve an idea the thing may bring factories to Millville Then get at it Joe and build it quick I ve a notion we shall have an open rupture with Skeelty before long Joe Wegg smiled You re going to accuse me sir of asking advice after I ve made up my mind said he but the fact is I have bought the mill of Silas Caldwell already He s been wanting to dispose of the property for some time Good exclaimed Uncle John Also I I ve ordered a dynamo and machinery It all ought to be here in a few days Better yet cried mister Merrick You ve relieved my mind of a great weight Joe Now about Thursday Smith said the young man Don t you think it would be policy for you to let him go mister Merrick No He s a clever fellow I can use him at my lighting plant Thank you Joe but that wouldn t help any As long as he s in Millville he will be an object of vengeance to those anarchistic mill hands The only way to satisfy them in to drive Smith out of town and I ll be hanged if I ll do it He hasn t done anything wrong and I m interested in the fellow s curious history I ve put his case in the hands of a famous New York detective Fogerty with instructions to discover who he is and I can t let a lot of rowdies force me to abandon the man for no reasonable cause Don t blame you sir said Joe If it wasn t this Thursday Smith some other would incur the hatred of the Royal workmen and as they re disposed to terrorize us we may as well fight it out on this line as any other The whole county will stand by you sir The only thing I dread is possible danger to my girls Keep em away from the office evenings advised Joe During the day they are perfectly safe If anything happens it will be at night and while the newspaper office may some time go flying skyward the girls will run no personal danger whatever Maybe so Joe How queer it is that such a condition should exist in Millville a little forgotten spot in the very heart of civilization and the last place where one might expect excitement of this sort But I won t be cowed I won t be driven or bullied by a pack of foreign hounds I assure you If Skeelty can t discipline his men I will In furtherance of which assertion mister Merrick went to town and wired a message to the great Fogerty CHAPTER XVI LOCAL CONTRIBUTION We hear considerable of the conventional people of this world but seldom meet with them for as soon as we begin to know a person we discover peculiarities that quite remove him from the ranks of the conventional if such ranks exist at all The remark of the old Scotch divine to his good wife Everybody s queer but thee and me Nancy and sometimes I think thee a little queer sums up human nature admirably We seldom recognize our own queerness but are prone to mark the erratic temperaments of others and this is rather more comfortable than to be annoyed by a consciousness of our personal deficits The inhabitants of a country town are so limited in their experiences that we generally find their personal characteristics very amusing No amount of scholastic learning could have rendered the Millville people sophisticated for contact with the world and humanity is the only true educator but as a matter of fact there was little scholastic learning among them with one or two exceptions and the villagers as a rule were of limited intelligence Every one was really a character and Uncle John s nieces who all possessed a keen sense of humor enjoyed the oddities of the Millvillites immensely A humorous situation occurred through a seemingly innocent editorial of Beth on authorship In the course of her remarks she said A prominent author is stated to have accumulated a large fortune by writing short stories for the newspapers and magazines He is said to receive ten cents a word and this unusual price is warranted by the eager demand for his stories of which the reading public is very fond However the unknown author does not fare so badly The sum of from thirty to fifty dollars usually remitted for a short story pays the beginner a better recompense for the actual time he is engaged upon the work than any other occupation he might undertake This was seriously considered the morning it appeared in the Tribune by Peggy McNutt and Skim Clark as they sat in the sunshine on the former s little front porch Peggy had read it aloud in his laborious halting way and Skim listened with growing amazement Thirty dollars he cried thirty to fifty fer a short story Great Snakes Peggy I m goin into it Heh Goin into what asked Peggy raising his eyes from the paper I kin write a story declared Skim confidently Ye kin Skim It s a cinch Peggy Mother keeps all the magazines an paper novils an we allus reads em afore we sells em I ve read the gol durndest lot o truck ye ever heard of so I m posted on stories in general ral I ll write one an sell it to the Millville Tribune Do ye s pose they ll give me the thirty er the fifty Peggy Anywheres between they says But one feller gits ten cents a word Whew I know but he s a big one which I ain t just now I ll take even the thirty if I hev to I would Skim advised Peggy nodding approval But make em put yer photygraf in the paper besides Say it ll be a big thing fer Millville to turn out a author I didn t think it were in you Skim Why it hadn t struck me afore replied the youth modestly I ve ben hankerin to make money without knowin how to do it I tell ye Peggy it pays to read the newspapers This one s give me a hint how to carve out a future career an I ll write a story as ll make them girl edyturs set up an take notice Make it someth n bout Injuns suggested Peggy I ain t read a Injun story fer years No they re out o fashion observed Skim loftily What folks want now is a detective story Feller sees a hole in a fence an says Ha there s ben a murder Somebody asks what makes him think so an the detective feller says takin out a magnifie in glass Thet hole s a bullet hole an the traces o blood aroun the edges shows the bullet went through a human body afore it went through the fence Then says some one where s the body That says the detective is what we mus diskiver So the story goes on to show how the body were diskivered an who did the murderin By Jupe thet s great cried Peggy admiringly Skim ye re a wonder Ma allus said I were good fer somethin but she couldn t tell what It s story writin declared Peggy Say Skim I put ye onter this deal don t I git a rake off on thet fifty dollars Not a cent said Skim indignantly Ye didn t tell me to write a story I said myself as I could do it An I know where to use the money Peggy ev ry dollar of it whether it s thirty er fifty Peggy sighed I writ a pome once he said Wonder ef they d pay fer a pome What were it like asked Skim curiously It went someth n this way said Peggy I sigh Ter fly Up high In the sky But my Wings is shy So I mus cry Good bye Ter fly in Shoo said Skim disdainfully Thet ain t no real pome Peggy It makes rhymes don t it All but the las line Mebbe it does replied Skim with assumption of superior wisdom but it don t mean nuth n It would ef I got paid fer it observed Peggy Skim went home to his mother s tiny Emporium took some note paper out of stock opened a new bottle of ink and sat down at the sitting room table to write his story The Widow Clark looked in and asked what he meant by squanderin profits that way Shet up mar Gi me elbow room said her dutiful son I m writin a fifty dollar story fer the Tribune Fifty dollars Thirty anyhow mebbe fifty replied Skim What s a good name fer a detective mar The widow sat down and wiped her damp hands on her apron looking upon her hopeful with an expression of mingled awe and pride Kin ye do it Skim she asked softly I s pose I kin turn out one a day by hard work he said confidently At thirty a day the lowes price thet s a hunderd n eighty a week seven hunderd n twenty a month or over eight thousan dollars a year I got it all figgered out It s lucky fer me the nabobs is rich or they couldn t stan the strain Now mar ef ye want to see yer son a nabob hisself some day jes think up a good name fer a detective Sherholmes Locke she said after some reflection No this ere story s got ter be original I thought o callin him Suspectin Algernon Detectives is allus suspectin something Algernon s high toned mused the widow Let it go at that Skim All that day and far into the evening he sat at his task pausing now and then for inspiration but most of the time diligently pushing his pen over the strongly lined note paper and hopelessly straying from the lines Meantime missus Clark walked around on tiptoe so as not to disturb him and was reluctant even to call him to his meals in the kitchen When Skim went to bed his story had got into an aggravating muddle but during the next forenoon he managed to bring it to a triumphant ending When I git used to the thing mar he said I kin do one a day easy I had to be pertickler over this one it bein the first The widow read the story carefully guessing at the words that were hopelessly indistinct My but it s a thriller Skim she said with maternal enthusiasm but ye don t say why he killed the girl That don t matter so long s he did it The spellin don t allus seem quite right she added doubtfully I guess the spellin s as good as the readin ll be he retorted with evident irritation I bet I spell as well as any o the folks thet takes the paper And some words I can t make out Oh the edytur ll fix that Say air ye tryin to queer my story mar Do ye set up to know more n I do about story writin No she said I ain t talented Skim an you be What I orter hev he continued reflectively is a typewriter When I git two er three hunderd ahead perhaps I ll buy one secondhand Kin ye buy one thet ll spell Skim she asked as she made a neat roll of the manuscript and tied a pink hair ribbon around it Skim put on a collar and necktie and took his story across to the newspaper office I got a conter bution fer the paper he said to Patsy who asked him his business What something original Skim she asked in surprise Ye ve hit it right Miss Doyle it s a story Oh A detective story Dear me Then you ll have to see missus Weldon who is our literary editor Louise who was sitting close by looked up and held out her hand for the beribboned roll I don t jes know remarked Skim as he handed it across the table whether it s a thirty dollar deal er a fifty Having forgotten Beth s editorial Louise did not understand this remark but she calmly unrolled Skim s manuscript and glanced at the scrawled heading with an amused smile Suspecting Algernon she read aloud It were a dark and teedjus night in the erly springtime while the snow were falling soft over the moon litt lanskape Why Skim how came you to write this It were the money he said boldly I kin do one a day like this at thirty dollers apiece an never feel the wear an tear Patsy giggled but Louise stared with a wondering puzzled expression at the crabbed writing the misspelled words and dreadful grammar Indeed she was a little embarrassed how to handle so delicate a situation I m afraid we cannot use your story mister Clark she said gently and remembering the formula that usually accompanied her own rejected manuscripts she added This does not necessarily imply a lack of merit in your contribution but is due to the fact that it is at present unavailable for our use Skim stared at her in utter dismay Ye mean ye won t take it he asked with trembling lips We have so much material on hand just now that we cannot possibly purchase more she said firmly but feeling intensely sorry for the boy It may be a good story It s the bes story I ever heard of declared Skim But we have no place for it in the Millville Tribune she added handing him back the roll Skim was terribly disappointed Never for a single moment had he expected sech a throwdown as this Seems to me like a bunco game he muttered savagely First ye say in yer blamed ol paper a story s wuth thirty to fifty dollars an then when I bring ye a story ye won t pay a red cent fer it Stories suggested Louise are of various qualities depending on the experience and talent of the author An excellent story is often refused because the periodical to which it is offered is overstocked with similar material Such conditions are often trying Skim I ve had a good many manuscripts rejected myself But the boy would not be conciliated I ll send it to Munsey s thet s what I ll do an then you ll be durn sorry he said almost ready to cry Do urged Louise sweetly And if they print it mister Clark I ll agree to purchase your next story for fifty dollars All right the fifty s mine I got witnesses mind ye and he flounced out of the room like an angry schoolboy Oh Louise exclaimed Patsy reproachfully why didn t you let me see the thing It would have been better than a circus Poor boy said the literary editor with a sigh I didn t want to humiliate him more than I could help I wonder if he really will have the audacity to send it to Munsey s And now the door opened to admit Peggy McNutt who had been watching his chance to stump across to the printing office as soon as Skim left there For Peggy had reasoned not unjustly that if Skim Clark could make a fortune as an author he Marshall McMahon McNutt had a show to corral a few dollars in literature himself After lying awake half the night thinking it over he arose this morning with the firm intention of competing with Skim for the village laurels He well knew he could not write a shuddery detective story such as Skim had outlined but that early poem of his which the boy had seemed to regard so disdainfully was considered by Peggy a rather clever production He repeated it over and over to himself dwelling joyously on its perfect rhyme until he was convinced it was a good poem and that Skim had enviously slandered it So he wrote it out in big letters on a sheet of foolscap and determined to offer it to them newspaper gals I got a pome Miss Patsy he said with unusual diffidence for he was by no means sure the gals would not agree with Skim s criticism What Another contributor she exclaimed playfully Has the whole town suddenly turned literary Peggy No jest me n Skim Skim says my pome s no good but I sort o like it myself Let me see it said Patsy ignoring this time the literary editor who was glad to be relieved of the responsibility of disappointing another budding author Peggy handed over the foolscap and Patsy eagerly read the pome Listen Louise Listen Beth she called delightedly Here is certainly a real pome and on aviation the latest fad SKY HIGH BY MARSHALL MCMAHON MCNUTT of Millville dealer in Real Estate Spring Chickens c one I sigh Too fly Up high In the sky two But my Wings air shy And so I cry A sad goodby Too fly Ing A chorus of hilarious laughter followed the reading and then Patsy wiped her eyes and exclaimed Peggy you are not only a poet but a humorist This is one of the best short poems I ever read It s short cause I run out o rhymes admitted Peggy But it s a gem what there is of it Don t dear remonstrated Louise don t poke fun at the poor man Poke fun Why I m going to print that poem in the Tribune as sure as my name s Patricia Doyle It s too good for oblivion I dunno remarked Peggy uncertainly whether it s wuth fifty dollars er about About forty nine less said Patsy A poem of that length brings about fifty cents in open market but I ll be liberal You shall have a whole dollar and there it is solid cash Thank ye returned Peggy pocketing the silver It ain t what I expected but But what sir But it s like findin it for I didn t expect nuth n I wish I could do more of em at the same price but I did thet pome when I were young an hed more ambition I couldn t think of another like it to save my neck I am glad of that Peggy One of this kind is all a paper dare print We mustn t get too popular you know I s pose you ll print my name as the one what did it he inquired anxiously I shall print it just as it s written advertisement and all She did and Peggy bought two extra copies at a cent apiece He framed all three and hung one in his office one in the sitting room and a third in his bedroom where he could see it the first thing when he wakened each morning His fellow villagers were very proud of him in spite of the knocking of the Clarks Skim was deeply mortified that Peggy s bum pome had been accepted and his own masterly composition turned down cold The widow backed her son and told all the neighbors that Peggy never hed the brains to write thet pome an the chances air he stole it from the Malvern Weekly Journal Them gal edyturs wouldn t know she added scornfully they s as ignerunt as Peggy is mostly A few days later McNutt entered the printing office with an air of great importance Goodness me I hope you haven t done it again Peggy cried Patsy in alarm No I got fame enough What I want is to hev the wordin on my business cards changed said he What ll it cost What change do you wish made asked Patsy examining the sample card Instead of Marshall McMahon McNutt dealer in Real Estate an Spring Chickens I want to make it read dealer in Real Estate Spring Chickens an Poetry What ll it cost Miss Patsy Nothing she said her eyes dancing We ll do that job free of charge Peggy CHAPTER XVII THE PENALTIES OF JOURNALISM Two strange men appeared in Millville keen intelligent looking fellows and applied to Joe Wegg for jobs Having received a hint from mister Merrick Joe promptly employed the strangers to prepare the old mill for the reception of the machinery for the lighting plant and both of them engaged board at the hold Thursday said Hetty as she watched the pressman that night there s a New York detective here two of them I think How do you know I recognized one of them who used to prowl around the city looking for suspicious characters They say they ve come to work on the new electric plant but I don t believe it Thursday worked a while in silence mister Merrick must have sent for them he suggested Yes I think he suspects about the bomb He ought to discharge me said Thursday No he s man enough to stand by his guns I like mister Merrick He didn t become a millionaire without having cleverness to back him and I imagine he is clever enough to thwart Skeelty and all his gang Perhaps I ought to go of my own accord said Thursday Don t do that When you ve found a friend like mister Merrick stick to him I imagine those detectives are here to protect you as well as the printing plant It won t be so easy to set a bomb the next time Smith looked at her with a smile There was a glint of admiration in his eyes You re not a bad sleuth yourself Hetty he remarked No detective could have acted more wisely and promptly than you did that night It was an accidental discovery Thursday Sometimes I sleep That was a good deal of conversation for these two to indulge in Hetty was talkative enough at times and so was Thursday Smith when the humor seized him but when they were together they said very little The artist would stroll into the pressroom after the compositors had finished their tasks and watch the man make up the forms lock them place them on the press and run off the edition Then he would glance over the paper while Thursday washed up and put on his coat after which he accompanied her to the door of her hotel and with a simple good night proceeded up the street to his own lodging There are surprises in the newspaper business as our girl journalists were fast discovering It was a real calamity when Miss Briggs who had been primarily responsible for getting the Millville Daily Tribune into proper working order suddenly resigned her position They had depended a great deal on Miss Briggs so when the telegraph editor informed them she was going back to New York they were positively bewildered by her loss Questions elicited the fact that the woman was nervous over the recent explosion and looked for further trouble from the mill hands She also suspected the two recent arrivals to be detectives and the town was so small and so absolutely without police protection that she would not risk her personal safety by remaining longer in it Perhaps I m homesick she added It s dreadfully lonely here when I m not at work and for that reason I ve tried to keep busy most of the time Really I m astonished to think I ve stood this isolation so long but now that my mind is made up I m going and it is useless to ask me to remain They offered her higher wages and mister Merrick himself had a long talk with her but all arguments were unavailing What shall we do Thursday asked Patsy in despair None of us understands telegraphy Hetty Hewitt does he suggested Hetty I m afraid if I asked her to assume this work she also would leave us No she ll stay he said positively But she can t edit the telegraph news Suppose she took the messages who would get the night news in shape for the compositors My uncle would not like to have me remain here until midnight but even if he would permit it I have not yet mastered the art of condensing the dispatches and selecting just such items as are suitable for the Tribune I ll do that Miss Doyle promised Smith I ve been paying especial attention to the work of Miss Briggs for I had an idea she was getting uneasy And I can take all the day messages too If Hetty will look after the wires evenings I can do the rest of the telegraph editor s work and my own too Good gracious Thursday exclaimed Patsy you ll be running the whole paper presently No I can t do the typesetting But if the Dwyer girls stick to their job and they seem quite contented here I ll answer for the rest of the outfit I m glad the Dwyer girls seem contented she answered but I m afraid to depend upon anyone now except you He liked that compliment but said nothing further After consulting with Louise and Beth Patsy broached the subject to Hetty and the artist jumped at the opportunity to do something to occupy her leisure time The work brought her in contact with Thursday Smith more than ever and when Miss Briggs departed bag and baggage for New York the paper suffered little through her defection Newspaper folk remarked Major Doyle who was now at the farm enjoying his vacation and worshipping at the shrine of the managing editor in the person of his versatile daughter are the most unreliable of any class in the world So I ve often been told and I believe it They come and go by fits and starts and it s a wonder the erratic rascals never put a paper out of business But they don t You never heard of a newspaper that failed to appear just because the mechanical force deserted and left it in the lurch By hook or crook the paper must be printed and it always is So don t worry mavourneen when your sallow faced artist and your hobo jack of all trades desert you there ll still be a way to keep the Millville Tribune going and therefore the world will continue to whirl on its axis I don t believe Thursday will ever desert and Hetty likes us too well to leave us in the lurch but suppose those typesetters take a notion to flit Then said matter of fact Beth we ll fill the paper with ready made plate stuff and telegraph for more compositors That s it agreed the major Those people are always to be had But don t worry till the time comes As me grandfather the commodore once said Never cross a bridge till ye come to it It wasn t your grandfather who originated that remark said Uncle John It was sir I defy you to prove otherwise I m not certain you ever had a grandfather and he wasn t a commodore anyhow Sir cried the major glaring at his brother in law I have his commission somewhere laid away Never mind said Patsy cheerfully for these fierce arguments between her father and uncle who were devotedly attached to one another never disturbed her in the least the Tribune s running smoothly just now and the work is keeping us delightfully busy I think that never in my life have I enjoyed myself more than since I became a journalist Is the thing paying dividends inquired the major Arthur laughed I ve just been figuring up the last month s expenditures and receipts said he The first month didn t count for we were getting started And what s the result asked the Major Every paper we send out for one cent costs us eighty eight cents to manufacture There was a painful silence for a time broken by the major s suggestive cough I hope said the old soldier solemnly that the paper s circulation is very small The smallest of any daily paper in all the civilized word sir declared the bookkeeper Of course remarked Louise with dignity that is what distinguishes it We did not undertake this publication to make money and it does not cost us more than we are willing to pay for the exceptional experiences we are gaining The major raised his eyebrows Arthur whistled softly Uncle John smiled but with one accord they dropped the disagreeable subject CHAPTER XVIII OPEN WARFARE Joe Wegg s machinery and dynamos arrived promptly and the electric plant was speedily installed at the old mill So energetically had the young man supervised his work that poles and wires were all in place as far up the road as Thompson s Crossing and a branch line run to the Wegg Farm by the time the first test was made All Millville celebrated that first night when its streets shone resplendent under the glare of electric lights There was a public bonfire near the mill speeches were made and afterward mister Merrick served a free supper to the villagers in the hall over Sam Cotting s General Store where the girls assisted in waiting upon the guests and everybody was happy and as hilarious as the fumes of good coffee could make them More speeches were made in the hall and one of these was by Peggy McNutt who had painted his wooden foot blue with red stripes in honor of the occasion He said according to the report afterward printed in the Tribune Feller Citizens This ere town s bloomin like a new mown rose I ll bet anybody anything there ain t another town in Ameriky what s gone ahead like we hev in the past few months that s jest past Applause If I do say it myself we re the mos eh the mos eh progressioning community in in this community Our community hes put out a daily paper what s a credit to to our community especially the poetry we ve got a paper mill at Royal what makes paper fer New Yoruk an now to cap the climate our community hes lighted our community with lectric lights fit fer Lundon New Yoruk Canada or or or our community Laughter and cries of Cut out the community Peggy No Never feller citizens will I cut out a community what s done so much fer our our community If I do say it myself the eyes of the com of the world is upon us an I m proud of the things that s ben did by our feller citizens with my full approval in this ere this ere er community Cheers and a sandwich which last offering was received by mister McNutt in his back hair as he turned to descend from the rostrum Joe Wegg is reported to have said Neighbors this electric plant is no plaything It is going to give you all better light at no more cost to you than kerosene But it will do more than that it will run machinery of all kinds better than steam will You ve seen electricity running the newspaper press and the same current has operated the big paper mills at Royal Here in this audience is a gentleman from Connecticut who has accepted my invitation to look over our village with a view to building a factory here using the power I shall hereafter be able to furnish I am in correspondence with two other manufacturers whom I hope to induce to locate in Millville Enthusiastic cheers Job Fisher who used to live at Malvern is planning to start a lumber mill to cut the pine just north of here so you see we are about to arouse from our long sleep and have a great future before us if we keep wide awake Another item of news merits your attention Bartlett has sold sixty acres of his farm to doctor Adam Matthews for many years a prominent physician of Boston who is going to build a good house on the land and become a citizen of Millville We ve always had to go to Huntingdon for a doctor but now doctor Matthews has promised to look after the health of the Millville people although he has retired from city practice More people will come here from time to time attracted by our enterprise and the rugged beauty of our county real estate will become more valuable trade will prosper and every one of the old inhabitants will find opportunities to make money Great applause A general discussion followed concerning the doin s of Joe Wegg and the prophecies he had made Opinion seemed divided as to whether the promised boom was desirable for Millville or not Some of the good villagers were averse to personal activity and feared the new order of things might disturb their comfort in others a mild ambition had been awakened But while they feasted at mister Merrick s expense and gravely canvassed the situation the newly installed electric lights suddenly failed Darkness fell upon the assemblage and there was an awed hush until Sam Cotting lighted the old reliable kerosene lamps Joe Wegg was as much astonished as anyone There has been an accident to the machinery he said to mister Merrick I ll run over to the mill and see what has happened I will go with you said Arthur Weldon and Major Doyle also decided to accompany the young man Uncle John and his three nieces remained in the hall and mister Merrick took occasion to make a little speech in which he explained that a hitch in the working of the electric plant was liable to happen at first but after a few days the dynamos could be fully depended upon He had scarcely finished this explanation when Arthur came running back into the hall in much excitement He approached mister Merrick and said in a low voice The machinery is all right sir Some one has cut the wires Cut the wires Yes Joe thinks it s the work of the mill hands The wires are cut in all directions and several of the men from Royal have been seen loitering around by Cox and Booth the detectives The girls overheard this assertion and Patsy exclaimed I m going to the office to make sure our power hasn t been tampered with The meeting broke up at once and the villagers trooped out to investigate mister Merrick and Arthur walked with the girls to the printing office where they found Thursday Smith and Hetty working by the light of tallow candles The power is off said Smith quietly Then the wire from Royal has also been cut said Patsy What shall we do His paper must come out to morrow morning in spite of anything and everything Do you know who cut the wires inquired Thursday We think the mill hands must have done it Not with Skeelty s consent I ll be bound said mister Merrick The manager is too fearful of a damage suit to play any tricks A cut wire may be repaired suggested the pressman and even as he spoke Joe Wegg came in accompanied by the two detectives and the major Cox has interviewed one of the workmen from Royal said Joe and the fellow says there s a strike at the mill and everything is closed down Skeelty is barricaded in his office building wild with fear for the men have captured the company s store and helped themselves to the stock of liquors The man Cox spoke with who seems to be a well disposed fellow predicts all kinds of trouble and perhaps rioting before this thing is ended They listened to this report in amazement I conjecture said the major that the rascally manager has given his men too much leeway He s encouraged them in mischief until they ve taken the bit between their teeth and turned against even their master I have no personal acquaintance with the villain but I imagine it serves him right But dear me cried Patsy wringing her hands what ll become of the paper It s nearly ten o clock now Thursday turned to Joe Wegg Can t we connect our supply wire with your new plant so as to use your power he asked Easily An hour s work will serve to make the connection But unless we watch the wire every minute those fellows will cut it again The town s full of the rascals and they re not exactly sober either Watch the wire that s the idea said Uncle John It s only a short distance to the mill and I m sure the villagers will volunteer for this duty Of course said Joe Major Doyle will you mount guard over my men at the dynamos to see they re not interfered with while I look after the wire Sure enough it ll remind me of the old war times said the major readily Where is Arthur asked Louise We left him at the mill They left the office at once Joe to get his line men at work and the major to join Weldon in guarding the dynamos One of the detectives went with mister Wegg but the other whose name was Booth remained to guard the printing office mister Merrick now proposed that he take the girls home Patsy and Beth refused to leave until the emergency was past when the major and Arthur could drive them to the farm but Louise was tired and went with Uncle John in his buggy the surrey being left for the rest of the party to use Arthur ran over for a moment to say everything was quiet at the mill and he did not think there would be any further trouble and the report considerably reassured them CHAPTER XIX A MERE MATTER OF REVENGE Hetty and Thursday continued to work on the paper We ll have everything ready by the time the line is connected said the artist Then it will be but a few moments work to run off the edition Patsy and Beth held candles for them for the electric lights had been cut off with the power so seeing them all busily engaged Arthur Weldon decided to return to the mill to join the Major Booth sat in the front office near the door and in the darkness Arthur nearly stumbled over him Going away sir asked the man Yes I ll see if I can be of any assistance at the mill Be careful Those workmen have been drifting into town in squads the last few minutes and most of them are reckless with drink I ll watch out said Arthur In the middle of the road a group of mill hands conversed excitedly in some foreign tongue but they paid no attention to Weldon as he passed them Others joined them presently and one began a harangue in a loud voice to which they listened eagerly Then Bob West slipped across from the hardware store and ran against the detective in the doorway of the printing office Who s this he demanded holding the man in a firm grip Booth sir Good I could not recognize you in this darkness Are you armed Yes Then you and I will defend this door Who is inside The pressman Thursday Smith and three of the girls The compositors No they ve gone to the hotel Miss Doyle Miss DeGraf and Hetty Hewitt West went into the hack room which was faintly illumined by candles stuck here and there The girls and Smith were all bending over the imposing stone where the forms of the paper were being made up Here said West taking a revolver from his pocket and laying it on the table I m afraid there may be an attack on this office in a few minutes for I understand the language of those strikers and have been listening to them If any of the mill hands attempt to break into this room don t be afraid to shoot Why should the men wish to attack us sir asked Patsy wonderingly There are several reasons They re after Smith for one thing They ve an old grudge against him to settle Aside from the mere matter of revenge I overheard one of them telling his friends to smash the press and keep the paper from coming out and mister Boglin would pay them well for the job Smith carelessly thrust the revolver into his hip pocket The paper will come out if mister Wegg gives us the power he said Can you let me have a revolver mister West asked Hetty Could you use it I think so He looked at her a moment and then took a second revolver from his pocket I ve robbed my hardware stock he said with a smile But I advise you girls to keep your hands off the thing unless a crisis arises I don t imagine the gang will get past me and Booth at the entrance but if any stragglers come your way Smith has authority to drive them back I m justice of the peace and I hereby appoint you all special officers of the law He said this lightly fearing to alarm the girls unnecessarily and then passed through the doorway and joined Booth at the front The telephone rang and Patsy answered it How soon will the forms be ready asked Arthur s voice In ten minutes perhaps five she answered We ll have the power on in ten minutes more Tell Smith not to lose an instant s time in running off the edition for we don t know how long we can keep the line open The strikers are threatening us even now All right called Patsy just give us the power for a few minutes and we ll be through for to night She went back to Thursday and reported There may be a few typographical errors and I m afraid it s a bad make up he remarked but I ll have the thing on the press in five minutes With mallet and shooting stick he tightened the quoins then lifted the heavy iron frames filled with type and slid them onto the bed of the press They gave him all the light the flickering candles afforded as he adjusted the machinery and all were bending over the press when a low distant growl was heard rising slowly to a frenzied shout A revolver popped another followed by wild cries from the street The girls grew a little pale but Thursday Smith put his hand on the lever of the press and said All right The moment they give us the current we re ready to run Patsy straightened up with a sigh of relief then gave a low cry as the screens of the two windows of the pressroom were smashed in and through the openings men began to tumble into the room At once Hetty confronted them with leveled revolver and the sight caused them to hesitate Out o the way you women called a burly fellow who wore a green sweater and an oilskin hat we don t want to hurt you if we can help There s the one we re after He pointed a finger at Thursday Smith You can t have him retorted Beth half shielded behind the militant Hetty This is private property and you re trespassing Unless you go away at once you will suffer the consequences This defense seemed to surprise them for they fell back a little toward the windows At that moment with a low rumble the press started moving slowly at first but gradually acquiring speed The sight aroused the resentment of the invaders Stop that press yelled their spokesman excitedly Stop it Smith or we ll put both you and the machine out of business Thursday paid no attention to anything but his press The huge cylinder of white paper was unrolling passing under the platen and emerging at the other end as neatly folded copies of the Millville Daily Tribune With a roar of rage the big fellow leaped forward but at the action a shot rang out and he fell headlong almost at the foot of the press Beth and Patsy turned their heads an instant to glance at Hetty The artist s face was white and set her eyes sparkled brilliantly she held the still smoking weapon in readiness for another shot But the men were awed by the fall of their leader They watched Beth leap to the platform beside Thursday Smith and draw his revolver from his pocket where he had placed it Hetty s courage had inspired her and Beth had handled pistols before The men read the determined eyes fixed upon them they noted Smith s indifference to their threats The defenders of the press and pressman were only girls but they were girls evidently not afraid to shoot No advance was made and the tableau was dramatic Smith watched his press with undivided attention and it clattered away at full speed until the frail building shook with its powerful steady motion Then suddenly it began to slow down The power was off and the machine came to an abrupt stop Thursday stepped from the platform and looked at the index of the counter Four hundred and sixty three Twenty two short Miss Doyle he announced That ll do Thursday He came to her side then facing the sullen glowering group of mill hands Boys said he it won t do you any good to interfere with us to night The paper for to morrow morning is already printed and Ojoy Boglin isn t a big enough man to stop it now or ever Better go back to Royal and settle your troubles with Skeelty for if you stay here the citizens of Millville are in the mood to shoot you down like dogs They stood undecided a moment but the argument had evidently struck home What s the matter with Harris asked one pointing to the motionless form of the man in the green sweater Is he dead I suppose so answered Thursday coolly but he stooped to examine Hetty s victim rolling him over so that his face was upward No he isn t hurt much I m sorry to say The bullet glanced off his forehead and stunned him that s all Take the brute if you want him and go They obeyed in silence Several stepped forward and raised the unconscious Harris bearing him to the window where they passed him to those without Then they also retreated through the windows and the room was cleared Only then did Hetty and Beth venture to lower their weapons Oh dear cried Patsy in a low agitated voice I m so glad you didn t kill him Hetty I m not returned the artist doggedly He deserved death at the least and by killing him I d have cheated the gallows Then she glanced around at the horrified faces of her friends and burst into tears CHAPTER XX DEFENDING THE PRESS In the front room Bob West and the detective were having a busy time At the first rush they each fired a shot over the heads of the mob merely to let them know the place was guarded In the darkness it was impossible for the strikers to tell how many armed men confronted them so they fell back a little but formed a cordon around the entire building From the printing office to the old mill was a distance of only a few hundred feet and every able bodied inhabitant of Millville except Peggy McNutt and Sara Cotting who had discreetly disappeared at the first sign of danger was assisting Joe Wegg to protect the electric cable he was trying to connect The men from Royal were scattered all along the line peering through the dim light to discover a vulnerable point of attack but deterred from interfering by the determination of the stalwart defenders Mobs are invariably cowardly and this one composed of the lowest strata of mixed American and foreign laborers was no exception to the general rule However when word was finally passed along from the mill that the dynamo was running and supplying power to the printing press a howl of rage went up and a sudden rush was made for the line the attack concentrating at one point The defenders promptly grouped themselves in front of the threatened pole and Seth Davis the blacksmith wielding a heavy sledge hammer did valiant service clearing a space around him with little difficulty Joe Wegg Arthur Weldon Cox the detective Lon Taft Nick Thome and even little Skim Clark were all in the melee fighting desperately for time to enable Thursday Smith to work his press using whatever cudgels they had been able to pick up to keep the assailants from the pole Slowly however they were forced back by superior numbers until finally one of the mill hands clambered up the pole and cut the wire Never mind said Arthur to Joe as they retreated fighting toward the printing office I think they ve had time to run off the edition provided Smith was ready with the forms The mob was by this time in an ugly mood and the nearer Joe and Arthur edged toward the printing office the more numerous their enemies became The Millville people were getting rather the worst of the scrimmage when out rushed Thursday Smith swinging a stout iron bar he had taken from the press and with this terrible weapon he struck out so vigorously that the diversion in their favor enabled the retreating villagers to gain the office where Booth and Bob West fired several shots that effectually checked the mob Stand back ye villains cried a loud voice as Major Doyle marched calmly down the road from the mill how dare ye interfere with a gentleman One of the leaders confronted him menacingly The major slapped his face with the flat of his hand and then kicked the fellow in the shins Didn t I say to get out o my way he roared and to the surprise of everyone even the major perhaps they fell hack and allowed him to walk leisurely into the printing office Having succeeded in their primary attempt to cut the wire and finding the determined band of defenders more dangerous than they had thought the workmen retreated in the direction of Royal where there was more to be gained by rioting than in Millville When at last the town was clear of them Arthur who was considerably battered and bruised but pleased with the triumphant ending of the adventure drove the girls and the major to the farm They urged Hetty to accompany them but she declared she was not a bit nervous and preferred to sleep at the hotel I think the trouble is over for to night said West and all agreed with him Cox and Booth decided to sleep in the printing office and after the girls had driven away with their escorts and the villagers had dispersed to their homes Thursday put on his coat and walked to the hotel with Hetty All that row was about me he remarked disconsolately But they didn t get you said Hetty triumph in her voice No He did not mention her bravery or the loyal support of Beth and Patsy but after a moment he added I m not worth defending How do you know asked Hetty It occurs to me mister Smith that you are as much a stranger to yourself as to us That is true And in emergencies you are not averse to defending others Of course Miss DeGraf and her cousin wanted the paper printed at all hazards I don t blame them for that but I She hesitated You simply stood by a comrade Thank you Hetty Good night Thursday Will you be able to sleep to night I m going straight to bed The rumpus has quieted my nerves Good night then In the early morning mister Merrick was awakened by a red glare that flooded his bedroom Going to the window he found the sky at the north full of flame He threw on his bathrobe and went to the door of Arthur Weldon s room arousing the young man with a rap on the panels The settlement at Royal is burning he reported Arthur came out very weary and drowsy for he had not been asleep long and the strenuous work of the night had tired him Let it burn he said glancing through a window at the lurid light of the conflagration We couldn t be of any use going over there and after all it isn t our affair to relieve Skeelty Then he told Uncle John of the riot in the village for the old gentleman had been sound asleep when the party returned to the farm The blaze is the work of those crazy strikers I suppose said mister Merrick It looks from here as if they had set fire to their own homes as well as to the paper mills and office and store buildings It will be fortunate if the forest does not also burn Don t worry sir advised Arthur We ll discover the extent of the fire by daylight For my part I m going back to bed and it will be well for you to follow my example Another item for the paper whispered a soft voice and there was Patsy beside them at the window mister Merrick sighed I had no idea so much excitement could possibly happen at Millville said he If this keeps on we ll have to go back to New York for quiet But let us get to bed my dear for to morrow is likely to be a busy day for us all CHAPTER XXI THE COMING OF FOGERTY The homeless mill hands flocked to Chazy Junction next day from whence a freight train distributed them over other parts of the country The clearing at Royal Falls was now a heap of charred embers for every one of the cheap rough board buildings had been consumed by the fire Skeelty had watched the destruction of his plant with feelings of mingled glee and disgust He was insured against loss and his rash workmen who had turned upon him so unexpectedly had accidentally settled the strike and their own future by starting the fire during their drunken orgies There being no longer a mill to employ them they went elsewhere for work rather glad of the change and regretting nothing As for the manager he stood to lose temporary profits but was not wholly displeased by the catastrophe Transportation of his manufactured products had been so irregular and undefendable that even while he watched the blaze he determined to rebuild his plant nearer the main line of a railway for many such locations could be found where the pine was as plentiful as here At dawn he entered the hotel at Millville with his arms full of books and papers which he had succeeded in saving from the fire and securing a room went directly to bed It was afternoon when he awoke and after obtaining a meal he strolled out into the village and entered the newspaper office Here s an item for your paper he said to Patsy who was busy at her desk The mills at Royal will never be rebuilt and Millville has lost the only chance it ever had of becoming a manufacturing center The whole settlement which belonged to Boglin and myself went up in smoke and I m willing to let it go at that I shall collect the insurance make myself good and if anything s left over that fool Boglin is welcome to it I admit I made a mistake in ever allowing him to induce me to build at Royal Boglin owned the land and I used his money so I gave up to him but I m through with the honer ble ass now Put it all in the paper it ll make him feel good You might add that I m taking the evening train for New York shaking the dust of your miserable village from my feet for good and all Thank you sir said Patsy brightly the Millville people will appreciate their good luck I m sure Skeelty hung around the town for awhile sneering at the new electric light plant and insolently railing at any of the natives who would converse with him Then he hired Nick Thorne to drive him over to Chazy Junction and that was the last Millville ever saw of him During this day Joe Wegg s men succeeded in repairing all the wires which had been tampered with and in making a proper and permanent connection of the cable to the printing office That evening the village was again brilliantly lighted and thereafter the big dynamos whirled peacefully and without interruption The girls had a busy day as Uncle John had predicted for all the exciting incidents of the evening and night before had to be written up and the next day s paper teemed with news of a character to interest all its readers Beth s editorial declared the neighborhood well rid of the paper mill which had been of little advantage but had caused no end of annoyance because of the rough and mischievous character of the workmen employed In this statement nearly everyone agreed with her Several had been wounded in the riot of the eventful evening but none seriously injured The workmen took away their damaged comrades and Lon Taft drove over to Huntingdon and had his head sewed up by the doctor Other villagers suffered mere bruises but all who engaged in the fight posed as heroes and even Peggy McNutt who figured as not present told marvelous tales of how he had worsted seven mill hands in a stand up fight using only his invincible fists The following forenoon the liveryman at the Junction brought to Millville a passenger who had arrived by the morning train a quiet boyish looking man with a shock of brick red hair and a thin freckled face He was driven directly to the Merrick farm where Uncle John received him cordially but with surprise and at once favored the new arrival with a long interview in his private room The girls who had not yet gone to the office awaited somewhat impatiently the result of this conference for they already knew the red headed youth to be the great Fogerty admitted by even his would be rivals the king of New York detectives Also they knew that Uncle John had employed him some time ago to ferret out the mystery of the identity of Thursday Smith and the fact of Fogerty s presence indicated he had something to report However when mister Merrick came out of the private room his usually cheery countenance wore a troubled expression Fogerty was invariably placid and inscrutable so no explanation could be gleaned from his demeanor Ready for town my dears asked Uncle John Yes the surrey is waiting answered Louise Then go along and Fogerty and I will join you at the office presently I want to confer with the major and Arthur before before taking any steps to What s the news Uncle demanded Patsy impatiently You shall know in good time Who is Thursday Smith By and by dear Don t bother me now But that reminds me you are to say nothing to to Thursday about mister Fogerty s arrival Treat him Thursday you know just as you have always done for the present at least Whatever we determine on in regard to this man during our conference we must not forget that he has acted most gallantly since he came to Millville We really owe him a debt of gratitude With this somewhat incomprehensible statement the girls were forced to content themselves Feeling quite helpless they drove to the office and left the men to settle the fate of Thursday Smith The pressman was now the man of all work about the modest but trim little publishing plant He attended to whatever job printing came in made the etchings from Hetty s drawings cast the stereotypes made up the forms and operated the press But aside from this mechanical work Smith took the telegraphic news received by Hetty edited and condensed it and wrote the black letter headings over the various items All this with a general supervision over the girl compositors kept the man busy from daybreak to midnight In spite of this the Tribune was essentially a girls paper since Thursday Smith was the only man employed on it not counting the dummy editor Arthur Weldon who did nothing but keep the books and found this not an arduous task Hetty at Miss Briggs desk attended the telegraph instrument and long distance telephone receiving news over both wires and still found time to draw her daily cartoons and additional humorous sketches which she worked in whenever the mood seized her The typesetting was done by the Dwyer sisters a colorless pair but quite reliable while the reportorial and editorial work was divided between Louise Beth and Patsy none of whom shirked a single duty Indeed they had come to love this work dearly and were enthusiastic over the Tribune which they fondly believed was being watched with envious admiration by all the journalistic world This belief was not wholly due to egotism Their exchanges both city and country had shown considerable interest in the Millville Experiment as they called it and only a few days before the leading journal of a good sized city had commented at length on the girls newspaper and after indulging in some humorous remarks concluded quite seriously with the statement that its evident sincerity clean contents and typographical neatness render the Millville Daily Tribune worthy a better setting than the somnolent country village whose census is too low to be officially recorded But that s all right said Patsy smiling at the praise we d never have dared to start a newspaper anywhere else because a journal that will do for Millville might not make a hit if it bumped against experienced competition We were woefully ignorant when we began a few weeks ago commented Beth glancing with pride at her latest editorial which she thought had caught the oracular tone of the big city newspapers And we re not expert journalists even yet added Louise with a sigh We ve improved to be sure but I imagine there is still lots of room for improvement One trouble said Patsy is that every inhabitant of Millville wants to see his or her name in print every day whether he or she has done anything worthy of publication or not If the name isn t printed we ve made an enemy and if it is the paper is sure to suffer more or less ridicule That is quite true my dear responded Louise the reporter I ve said everything about every one of them that has ever happened or threatened to happen since we started the paper and it is driving me crazy to discover anything more about these stupid natives that will do to print Hetty had overheard this conversation and now looked up with a smile Has your local happenings column been prepared for to morrow missus Weldon she inquired No I m about to start out to unearth some items replied Louise wearily Let me do it for you I ve an hour or so to spare and I won t need to leave my desk suggested the artist It is my duty you know Hetty and I ve no right to evade it Evade it for to day Go home and rest I ll do your column for to morrow and after the vacation you can tackle the thrilling situations with better courage Thank you Hetty But I won t go home I ll wait here to see Fogerty Fogerty exclaimed the artist with a start of surprise Do you mean the detective Yes said Louise regretting she had inadvertently mentioned the name But what is there now to detect asked Hetty suspiciously Our troubles seem ended with the burning of the mill and the flitting of Skeelty and his workmen Louise hardly knew how to reply but Patsy who trusted the queer girl artist said quite frankly There remains the mystery of Thursday Smith to fathom you know Hetty flushed and an indignant look swept over her face What right has anyone to solve that mystery she asked defiantly Isn t that Thursday Smith s own business Perhaps returned Patsy somewhat amused but Smith hasn t been able to discover who he is or was rather and seems really anxious to know Hetty bent over her desk for a time Then she looked up and her thin features were white and drawn with anxiety When you discover who Thursday Smith is said she the Millville Tribune will lose its right bower Why Before his accident or whatever it was that made him lose his memory he was an unusual man a man of exceptional ability You know that We are all inclined to admit it answered Patsy But what then Men of ability declared Hetty slowly are of two classes the very successful who attain high and honorable positions or the clever scoundrels who fasten themselves like leeches on humanity and bleed their victims with heartless unconcern What will you gain if you unmask the past of Thursday Smith You uncover a rogue or a man of affairs and in either case you will lose your pressman Better leave the curtain drawn Miss Doyle and accept Thursday Smith as he is There was so much good sense in this reasoning that all three girls were impressed and began to regret that Uncle John had called Fogerty to untangle the skein But it was now too late for such repentance and after all they were curious to discover who their remarkable employee really was Even while the awkward silence that had fallen upon the group of girls continued the door opened to admit Uncle John Fogerty Major Doyle and Arthur Weldon Except for the detective they were stern faced and uncompromising CHAPTER XXII UNMASKED Quintus Fogerty was as unlike the typical detective as one could imagine Small in size slight and boyish his years could not readily be determined by the ordinary observer His face was deeply furrowed and lined yet a few paces away it seemed the face of a boy of eighteen His cold gray eyes were persistently staring but conveyed no inkling of his thoughts His brick red hair was as unkempt as if it had never known a comb yet the attire of the great detective was as fastidiously neat as if he had dressed for an important social function Taken altogether there was something mistrustful and uncanny about Fogerty s looks and his habit of eternally puffing cigarettes rendered his companionship unpleasant Yet of the man s professional ability there was no doubt mister Merrick and Arthur Weldon had had occasion to employ him before with results that justified their faith in him The detective greeted the young ladies with polite bows supplemented by an aimless compliment on the neatness of their office Never would have recognized it as a newspaper sanctum said he in his thin piping voice No litter no stale pipes lying about no cursing and quarreling no excitement whatever The editorial room is the index to the workshop I ll see if the mechanical department is kept as neatly He opened the door to the back room passed through and closed it softly behind him mister Merrick made a dive for the door and followed Fogerty What s the verdict Arthur asked Louise curiously Why I I believe the verdict isn t rendered yet he hastily replied and followed mister Merrick into the pressroom Now then cried Patsy grabbing the major firmly you ll not stir a step sir until you tell us the news What news Patricia Inquired the old gentleman blandly Who was Thursday Smith The identical individual he is now said the Major Don t prevaricate sir Who was he What did he do What is his right name Is it because you are especially interested in this man my dear or are ye simply consumed with feminine curiosity Be good Daddy Tell us all about it said Patsy coaxingly The man Thursday then was likely enough the brother of Robinson Crusoe s man Friday Major you re trifling Or mayhap an ex president of the United States or forby the senator from Oklahoma Belike he was once minister to Borneo an came home in a hurry an forgot who he was But John Merrick will be wanting me He escaped and opened the door Then with his hand on the knob he turned and added Why don t ye come in me journalistic investigators and see the fun for yerselves I suspect there s an item in store for ye Then he went in and they took the hint and entered the pressroom in a fluttering group Fogerty stood with his hands in his pockets intently watching the Dwyer girls set type while at his elbow mister Merrick was explaining in a casual voice how many m s were required to make a newspaper column In another part of the long room Arthur Weldon was leaning over a table containing the half empty forms as if critically examining them Smith arrayed in overalls and jumper was cleaning and oiling the big press A daily newspaper said the major loudly as he held up a warning finger to the bevy of nieces behind whom Hetty s pale face appeared means a daily grind for all concerned in it There s no vacation for the paper no hyphens no skipping a day or two if it has a bad cold it s the tyrant that leads its slaves by the nose metaphorically and has no conscience Just as regularly as the world rolls round the press rolls out the newspaper and human life or death makes little difference to either of the revolutionists While he spoke the Major led the way across the room to the stereotyping plant which brought his party to a position near the press Smith glanced at them and went on with his work It was not unusual to have the pressroom thus invaded Presently Fogerty strolled over smoking his eternal cigarette and stood watching the pressman as if interested in the oiling of the complicated machine Smith feeling himself under observation glanced up again in an unconcerned way and as he faced the detective Fogerty gave a cleverly assumed start and exclaimed Good God Instantly Thursday Smith straightened up and looked at the man questioningly Fogerty stretched out his hand and said as if in wonder Why Melville old man what are you doing here We wondered what had become of you all these months Shake hands my boy I m glad I ve found you Smith leaned against the press and stared at him with dilated eyes Everyone in the room was regarding the scene with intense but repressed excitement What s wrong Harold continued Fogerty as if hurt by the other s hesitation to acknowledge their acquaintance You haven t forgotten me have you I m McCormick you know and you and I have had many a good time together in the past Smith passed his hand across his forehead with a dazed gesture What name did you call me sir he asked Melville Harold Melville of East Sixty sixth street I m sure I m right There can t be two like you in the world you know Thursday Smith stepped down from the platform and with a staggering gait walked to a stool on which he weakly sank He wiped the beads of perspiration from his forehead and looked at Fogerty with a half frightened air And you are McCormick he faltered Of course Smith stared a moment and then shook his head It s no use he said despairingly I can t recall a single memory of either Harold Melville or or his friend McCormick Pardon me sir I must confess my mind is absolutely blank concerning all my life previous to the last two years Until this moment I I could not recall my own name H m muttered Fogerty you recall it now don t you No You tell me my name is Melville and you seem to recognize me as a man whom you once knew I accept your statement in good faith but I cannot corroborate it from my own knowledge That s queer retorted Fogerty his cold eyes fixed upon the man s face Let me explain please said Smith and related his curious experience in practically the same words he had employed when confiding it to mister Merrick I had hoped he concluded that if ever I met one who knew me formerly or heard my right name mentioned my memory would come back to me but in this I am sorely disappointed Did you know me well sir Pretty well answered the detective after a slight hesitation Then tell me something about myself Tell me who I was Here in public asked Fogerty with a suggestive glance at the spectators who had involuntarily crowded nearer Smith flushed but gazed firmly into the faces surrounding him Why not he returned These young ladies and mister Merrick accepted me without knowledge of my antecedents They are entitled to as full an explanation as as I am You place me Melville in a rather embarrassing position declared Fogerty This is a queer case the queerest in all my experience Better let me post you in a private interview Smith trembled a bit from nervousness but he persisted in his demand These people are entitled to the truth said he Tell us frankly all you know about me and do not mince words whatever the truth may be Oh it s not so bad announced the detective with a shrug or at least it wouldn t be in New York among your old aristocratic haunts But here in a quiet country town among these generous and simple hearted folks who have befriended you the thing is rather difficult to say Say it commanded Smith I will Many New Yorkers remember the firm of Melville Ford the cleverest pair of confidence men who ever undertook to fleece the wealthy lambs of the metropolis Confidence men gasped Smith in a voice of horror Yes putting it mildly You were both jolly good fellows and made a host of friends You were well groomed rode in automobiles frequented good clubs and had a stunning establishment on Sixty sixth street where you entertained lavishly You could afford to for there was where you fleeced your victims But it wasn t so very bad as I said You chose the wealthy sons of the super rich who were glad to know such popular men about town as Harold Melville and Edgar Ford When one set of innocents had been so thoroughly trimmed that they compared notes and began to avoid you you had only to pick up another bunch of lambs for New York contains many distinct flocks of the species As they could afford to lose none of them ever complained to the police although the Central Office had an eye on you and knew your methods perfectly Finally you made a mistake or rather Ford did for he was not as clever as you were He brought an imitation millionaire to your house a fellow who was putting up a brazen front on the smallest sort of a roll You won his money and he denounced you getting away with a pack of marked cards for evidence At this you both took fright and decided on a hasty retreat Gathering together your plunder which was a royal sum I m convinced you and Ford jumped into a motor car and vanished from New York The balance of your history I base on premise Ford has been located in Chicago where with an ample supply of money he is repeating his New York operations but Harold Melville has never been heard of until this day I think the true explanation is easily arrived at Goaded by cupidity and perhaps envy of your superior talents Ford took advantage of the situation and finding the automobile speeding along a deserted road knocked you on the head tumbled you out of the car and made off with your combined winnings The blow had the effect not so uncommon as you think of destroying your recollection of your past life and you have for two years been wandering in total ignorance of what caused your affliction During this recital Smith sat with his eyes eagerly fixed upon the speaker s face dwelling upon every word At the conclusion of the story he dropped his face in his hands a moment visibly shuddering Then again he looked up and after reading the circle of pitying faces confronting him he bravely met mister Merrick s eyes Sir he said in a voice that faltered in spite of his efforts to render it firm you now know who I am When I first came to you I was a mere irresponsible hobo a wandering tramp who had adopted the name of Thursday Smith because he was ignorant of his own but who had no cause to be ashamed of his manhood To day I am discovered in my true guise As Harold Melville the disreputable trickster I am not fit to remain in your employ to associate with honest men and women You will forgive my imposition I think because you know how thoroughly ignorant I was of the truth but I will impose upon you no longer I am sorry sir for I have been happy here but I will go thanking you for the kindly generosity that prompted you to accept me as I seemed to be not as I am He rose his face showing evidence of suffering and bowed gravely Hetty Hewitt walked over and stood by his side laying her hand gently upon his arm But Thursday Smith did not know John Merrick very well The little gentleman had silently listened observing meanwhile the demeanor of the accused and now he smiled in his pleasant whimsical way and caught Smith s hand in both his own Man man he cried you re misjudging both me and yourself I don t know this fellow Melville You don t know him either But I do know Thursday Smith who has won my confidence and by his manly acts and I ll stand by him through thick and thin I am Harold Melville the gambler the confidence man You re nothing of the sort you re just Thursday Smith and no more responsible for Harold Melville than I am Hooray exclaimed Patsy Doyle enthusiastically Uncle s right Thursday You re our friend and the mainstay of the Millville Daily Tribune We shall not allow you to desert us just because you ve discovered that your your ancestor wasn t quite respectable That s it exactly asserted Beth It s like hearing a tale of an ancestor Thursday or of some member of your family who lived before you You cannot be responsible in any way for another man s wickedness As I look at it said Louise reflectively you are just two years old Thursday and innocent of any wrongdoing before that day you first found yourself There s no use our considering Melville at all added Uncle John cheerfully I m sorry we ever heard of him except that in one way it clears up a mystery Thursday Smith we like you and trust you Do not doubt yourself because of this tale I ll vouch for your fairness and integrity Forget Melville who has never really existed so far as any of us are concerned be yourself and count on our friendship and regard which Thursday Smith has fairly won Hetty was crying softly her cheek laid against Thursday s sleeve The man stood as if turned to stone but his cheeks were flushed his eyes sparkling and his head proudly poised Fogerty lighted a fresh cigarette watching the scene with an imperturbable smile Suddenly Smith awoke to life He half turned looked wonderingly at Hetty and then folded her thin form in his arms and pressed a kiss on her forehead Fogerty coughed Uncle John jerked out his handkerchief and blew his nose like a bugle call The major s eyes were moist for the old soldier was sympathetic as a child But Patsy a little catch in her voice impulsively put her arms around the unashamed pair and murmured I m so glad Hetty I m so glad Thursday But dear me aren t we going to have any paper to morrow morning That relieved the tension and everybody laughed Thursday released Hetty and shook Uncle John s hand most gratefully Then they all wanted to shake hands and did until it came to Fogerty s turn But now Smith drew back and looked askance at the detective I do not know you mister McCormick he said with dignity My name s not McCormick it s Fogerty said the other without malice I was simply testing your memory by claiming to be an old friend Personally I never knew Harold Melville but I m mighty glad to make Thursday Smith s acquaintance and will consider it an honor if you ll shake my hand Smith was too happy to refuse He took Fogerty s hand CHAPTER XXIII THE JOURNALISTS ABDICATE mister Merrick told Thursday Smith in an apologetic way how he had hired Fogerty to unravel the mystery of his former life and how the great detective had gone to work so intelligently and skillfully that with the aid of a sketch Hetty had once made of the pressman and which mister Merrick sent on he had been able to identify the man and unearth the disagreeable details of his history Thursday was too humble by this time and too grateful besides to resent Uncle John s interference He admitted that after all it was better he should know the truth I ve nothing to bother me now but the future he said and with God s help I mean to keep the name of Thursday Smith clean and free from any reproach After the interview he went about his duties as before and Hetty sat down at her desk and took the telegraphic news that came clicking over the wire as if nothing important in her life had occurred But the girl journalists were all excitement and already were beginning to plan the things they might do to Make Hetty and Thursday happier Cox and Booth had gone away and mister Merrick thanked Fogerty for his skillful service and gave him a fat check It s a mighty interesting case sir declared the detective and I m as glad as any of you that it has ended so comfortably Whatever Melville might have been and his record is a little worse than I related it there s no doubt of Thursday Smith s honesty He s a mighty fine fellow and Fate played a proper trick when she blotted out his unscrupulous mind and left him as innocent as an unborn babe He will do well in his new life I m sure and that girl of his Hetty Hewitt I ve know of her reckless ways for years has also redeemed herself and turned out a regular brick All of which mister Merrick is unusual in real life more s the pity and therefore it makes even a cold blooded detective feel good to witness it mister Merrick smiled benignantly and Fogerty drove over to the Junction to catch his train After luncheon Patsy while arranging her galley proofs inquired of Louise for the local column Hetty said she d attend to it was the reply but we are all upset to day and things are at sixes and sevens The column is all prepared Miss Doyle announced Hetty Where is it Thursday has made it ready for the press It s illustrated she confessed I d rather you wouldn t see it until the paper is out if you can trust me To be sure said Patsy That s one responsibility I m relieved of anyhow The paper was a bit uneven in appearance next morning but when Patsy came down to breakfast she found both Uncle John and the major roaring with laughter over Hetty s locals The first item stated that missus Thorne took tea at Sam Cotting s last evening the Cottings being notoriously inhospitable and the picture showed missus Thorne a sour faced woman departing from the store with a package of tea Then came the announcement that Eph Hildreth got shot at West s hardware store and there was a picture of West weighing out a pound of buckshot for his customer The next item said Our distinguished fellow citizen Marshall Peggy McNutt was discovered unconscious on his front porch at three p m The drawing of McNutt was one of the best of the series It was his habit to snooze in an easy chair on his porch every afternoon and Hetty depicted the little man with both feet meat and wood on the rail his mouth open and eyes shut while lusty snores were indicated by radiating lines and exclamation points The Widow Clark s cow occupied the next square being tethered to a stake while Skim approached the animal with pail and milking stool Below the drawing were the words mister Skimton Clark cowward A few other local hits were concluded by a picture of honorable Ojoy Boglin shaking his fist at mister Skeelty who held a package of money in his grasp labeled insurance Below was the simple legend O Joy The artist s cleverness became the subject of conversation at the breakfast table and Arthur remarked You won t be able to hold Hetty in Millville long Her talent enables her to draw big salaries in New York and it isn t likely she will consent to bury herself in this little town I m not so sure said Patsy If we can hold Thursday Smith we can hold Hetty you know We won t need to hold either of them for long observed Beth for in another three weeks or so we must leave here and return to the city when of course the Millville Daily Tribune must suspend publication I ve been thinking of that said Uncle John So have I declared Patsy For a long time I was puzzled what to do for I hated dreadfully to kill our dear Tribune after we ve made it such a nice paper Yet I knew very well we couldn t stay here all winter and run it But last night I had an inspiration Thursday will marry Hetty I suppose and they can both stay here and run the Tribune They are doing most of the work now If Uncle John agrees we will sell out to them on easy terms Good gracious Patsy chuckled the major wherever can the poor things borrow money to keep going Do you want to load onto an innocent bride an groom the necessity of meeting a deficit of a couple of hundred dollars every week Patsy s face fell They have no money I know she said except what they earn And their wages ll be cut off when they begin hiring themselves added the major No you can t decently thrust such an incubus on Hetty and Thursday or on anyone else You ve been willing to pay the piper for the sake of the dance but no one else would do it Quite true agreed Arthur The days of the Millville Tribune are numbered Let us not settle that question just yet proposed mister Merrick who had been deep in thought I ll consider Patsy s proposition for awhile and then talk with Thursday The paper belongs to the girls but the outfit is mine and I suppose I may do what I please with it when my nieces retire from journalism Even the major could not demur at this statement and so the conversation dropped During the next few days Uncle John visited the printing office several times and looked over the complete little plant with speculative eyes Then one day he made a trip to Malvern thirty miles up the railway line from the Junction where a successful weekly paper had long been published He interviewed the editor examined the outfit critically and after asking numerous questions returned to Millville in excellent spirits Then he invited Thursday Smith and Hetty to dine at the farm on Saturday evening which was the one evening in the week they were free there being no Sunday morning paper Thursday had bought a new suit of clothes since he came to the Tribune and Hetty after much urging finally prevailed upon him to accept the invitation When the young man appeared at the farm he wore his new suit with an air of perfect ease that disguised its cheapness and it was noticed that he seemed quite at home in the handsome living room where the party assembled after dinner I am in search of information Thursday said Uncle John in his pleasant way Will you permit me to question you a bit Certainly sir And you Hetty Ask anything you like sir Thank you To begin with what are your future plans I understand of course you are to be married but afterward We haven t considered that as yet sir replied Thursday thoughtfully Of course we shall stay with the Tribune as long as you care to employ our services but Well I have been given to understand the young ladies plan to return to New York at the end of September and in that case of course the paper will suspend My nieces will be obliged to abandon journalism to be sure said mister Merrick but I see no reason why the paper should suspend How would you and Hetty like to remain in Millville and run it Both Thursday and Hetty smiled but it was the man who answered We cannot afford such a luxury sir Would you care to make your future home in Millville Oh yes exclaimed Hetty I love the quaint little town dearly and the villagers are all my friends I m sure Thursday doesn t care to go back to New York where where Harold Melville once lived But as he truly says we couldn t make a living with the Tribune even if you gave us the use of the plant Let us see about that said Uncle John I will admit in advance that a daily paper in such a place is absurd None of us quite understood that when we established the Tribune My nieces thought a daily the only satisfactory sort of newspaper because they were used to such but it did not take long to convince me and perhaps them that in spite of all our efforts the Millville Daily Tribune would never thrive It is too expensive to pay its own way and requires too much work to be a pleasant plaything Only unbounded enthusiasm and energy have enabled my clever nieces to avoid being swamped by the monster their ambition created That said Patsy with a laugh is very clearly and concisely put my dear Uncle It was never intended to be a permanent thing anyhow continued mister Merrick yet I must express my admiration for the courage and talent my nieces have displayed in forcing a temporary success where failure was the logical conclusion Shortly however they intend to retire gracefully from the field of journalism leaving me with a model country newspaper plant on my hands Therefore it is I Thursday and Hetty and not my nieces who have a proposition to place before you While a daily paper is not appropriate in Millville a weekly paper distributed throughout Chazy County would not only be desirable but could be made to pay an excellent yearly profit Through the enterprise of Joe Wegg Millville is destined to grow rapidly from this time on and Chazy County is populous enough to support a good weekly paper in any event Therefore my proposition is this To turn the plant over to mister and missus Thursday Smith who will change the name to the Millville Weekly Tribune and run it as a permanent institution Your only expense for labor will be one assistant to set type and do odd jobs since you are so competent that you can attend to all else yourselves We will cut out the expensive news service we have heretofore indulged in and dispense with the private telegraph wire Joe Wegg says he ll furnish you with what power you need free of all charge because the paper will boost Millville s interests with which his own interests are identified Now then tell me what you think of my proposal Hetty and Thursday had listened attentively and their faces proved they were enthusiastic over the idea They said at once they would be glad to undertake the proposition However said Thursday after a little reflection there are two things that might render our acceptance impossible I suppose you will require rent for the outfit but for a time until we get well started we could not afford to pay as much as you have a right to demand I have settled on my demands replied mister Merrick and hope you will agree to them You must pay me for the use of the outfit twenty per cent of your net profits over and above all your operating and living expenses When this sum has reimbursed me for my investment the outfit will belong to you Thursday Smith looked his amazement That seems hardly business like sir he protested You are right but this isn t entirely a business deal You are saving my nieces the humiliation of suspending the paper they established and have labored on so lovingly Moreover I regard you and Hetty as friends whom I am glad to put in the way of a modest but I venture to predict a successful business career What is your second objection I heard mister West say the other day that he would soon need the building we occupy to store his farm machinery in True but I have anticipated that I have completed plans for the erection of a new building for the newspaper which will be located on the vacant lot next to the hotel I purchased the lot a long time ago The new building for which the lumber is already ordered will be a better one than the shed we are now in and on the second floor I intend to have a cozy suite of rooms where you and Hetty can make a home of your own Eh How does that strike you my children Their faces were full of wonder and delight The new building goes with the outfit on the same terms continued mister Merrick That is I take one fifth of your net profits for the whole thing But sir suggested Thursday suppose no profits materialize Then I have induced you to undertake a poor venture and must suffer the consequences which to me will be no hardship at all In that case I will agree to find some better business for you but I am quite positive you will make a go of the Millville Weekly Tribune I think so too mister Merrick or I would not accept your generous offer replied Smith What do you think Hetty The idea pleases me immensely she declared It is a splendid opportunity for us and will enable us to live here quietly and forget the big outside world New York has had a bad influence on both you and me Thursday and here we can begin a new life of absolute respectability When do you intend to be married asked Patsy We have scarcely thought of that as yet for until this evening we did not know what the future held in store for us Couldn t you arrange the wedding before we leave asked Beth It would delight us so much to be present at the ceremony I think we owe the young ladies that much Thursday said Hetty after a brief hesitation Nothing could please me better he asserted eagerly So they canvassed the wedding and Patsy proposed they transfer the paper to Thursday and Hetty to become a weekly instead of a daily in a week s time and celebrate the wedding immediately after the second issue so as to give the bridal couple a brief vacation before getting to work again Neither of them wished to take a wedding trip and mister Merrick promised to rush the work on the new building so they could move into their new rooms in the course of a few weeks CHAPTER XXIV A CHEERFUL BLUNDER We would like to ask your advice about one thing sir said Thursday Smith to mister Merrick a little later that same evening Would it be legal for me to marry under the name of Thursday Smith or must I use my real name Harold Melville Uncle John could not answer this question nor could the major or Arthur Hetty and her fianc had both decided to cling to the name of Thursday Smith thereafter and they disliked to be married under any other especially the detestable one of Harold Melville An act of legislature would render your new name legal I believe said mister Merrick but such an act could not be passed until after the date you have planned to be married But if it was made legal afterward it wouldn t matter greatly suggested the major I do not think it matters at all asserted Hetty It s the man I m marrying not his name I don t much care what he calls himself Oh but it must be legal you know exclaimed Patsy You don t care now perhaps but you might in the future We cannot be certain you know that Thursday is entirely free from his former connection with Harold Melville Quite true agreed the major Then said Smith with evident disappointment I must use the hateful name of Melville for the wedding and afterward abandon it for as long as possible The nieces were greatly pleased with Uncle John s arrangement which relieved them of the newspaper and also furnished Thursday and Hetty of whom they had grown really fond with a means of gaining a livelihood Millville accepted the new arrangement with little adverse comment the villagers being quite satisfied with a weekly paper which would cost them far less than the daily had done Everyone was pleased to know Thursday Smith had acquired the business for both he and Hetty had won the cordial friendship of the simple hearted people and were a little nearer to them than the nabob s girls could ever be Preparations were speedily pushed forward for the wedding which the nieces undertook to manage themselves the prospective bride and groom being too busy at the newspaper office to devote much attention to the preliminaries of the great event The ceremony was to take place at the farmhouse of mister Merrick and every inhabitant of Millville was invited to be present The minister would drive over from Hooker s Falls and the ceremony was to be followed by a grand feast for which delicacies were to be imported from New York The girls provided a complete trousseau for Hetty as their wedding present while Arthur and the major undertook to furnish the new apartments which were already under construction Uncle John s gift was a substantial check that would furnish the newly married couple with modest capital to promote their business or which they could use in case of emergencies It was the very day before the wedding that Fogerty gave them so great and agreeable a surprise that Uncle John called it Fogerty s Wedding Present ever afterward In its physical form it was merely a telegram but in its spiritual and moral aspect it proved the greatest gift Thursday and Hetty were destined to receive The telegram was dated from New York and read as follows Harold Melville just arrested here for passing a bogus check under an assumed name Have interviewed him and find he is really Melville so Thursday Smith must be some one else and doubtless a more respectable character Shall I undertake to discover his real identity Uncle John let Thursday and Hetty answer this question and their reply was a positive no The great Fogerty made such a blunder the first time said Hetty who was overjoyed at the glorious news that he might give poor Thursday another dreadful scare if he tackled the job again Let the mystery remain unfathomable But on the contrary my dear Fogerty might discover that Thursday was some eminent and good man as I am firmly convinced is the truth suggested mister Merrick He s that right now asserted Hetty For my part I prefer to know nothing of his former history and Thursday says the present situation thoroughly contents him I am more than contented said Thursday with a happy smile Hetty has cured me of my desire to wander and no matter what I might have been in the past I am satisfied to remain hereafter a
