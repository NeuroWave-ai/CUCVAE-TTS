Question XXII Chicane XXIII Amnesty I OUT OF NO MAN S LAND On the muddy verge of a shallow little pool the man lay prone and still as still as those poor dead whose broken bodies rested all about him where they had fallen months or days hours or weeks ago in those grim contests which the quick were wont insensately to wage for a few charnel yards of that debatable ground Alone of all that awful company this man lived and though he ached with the misery of hunger and cold and rain drenched garments was unharmed Ever since nightfall and a brisk skirmish had made practicable an undetected escape through the German lines he had been in the open alternately creeping toward the British trenches under cover of darkness and resting in deathlike immobility as he now rested while pistol lights and star shells flamed overhead flooding the night with ghastly glare and disclosing in pitiless detail that two hundred yard ribbon of earth littered with indescribable abominations which set apart the combatants When this happened the living had no other choice than to ape the dead lest the least movement detected by eyes that peered without rest through loopholes in the sandbag parapets invite a bullet s blow Now it was midnight and lights were flaring less frequently even as rifle fire had grown more intermittent as if many waters might quench out hate in the heart of man For it was raining hard a dogged dreary downpour drilling through a heavy atmosphere whose enervation was like the oppression of some malign and inexorable incubus its incessant crepitation resembling the mutter of a weary sullen drum dwarfing to insignificance the stuttering of machine guns remote in the northward dominating even a dull thunder of cannonading somewhere down the far horizon lowering a vast and shimmering curtain of slender lances steel bright close ranked between the trenches and over all that weary land Thus had it rained since noon and thus for want of any hint of slackening it might rain for another twelve hours or eighteen or twenty four The star rocket whose rays had transfixed him beside the pool paled and winked out in mid air and for several minutes unbroken darkness obtained while on hands and knees the man crept on toward that gap in the British barbed wire entanglements which he had marked down ere daylight waned shaping a tolerably straight course despite frequent detours to avoid the unspeakable Only once was his progress interrupted when straining senses apprised him that a British patrol was taking advantage of the false truce to reconnoitre toward the enemy lines its approach betrayed by a nearing squash of furtive feet in the boggy earth the rasp of constrained respiration a muttered curse when someone slipped and narrowly escaped a fall the edged hiss of an officer s whisper reprimanding the offender Incontinently he who crawled dropped flat to the greasy mud and lay moveless Almost at the same instant warned by a trail of sparks rising in a long arc from the German trenches the soldiers imitated his action and as long as those triple stars shone in the murk made themselves one with him and the heedless dead Two lay so close beside him that the man could have touched either by moving a hand a mere six inches he was at pains to do nothing of the sort he was sedulous to clench his teeth against their chattering even to hold his breath and regretted that he might not mute the thumping of his heart Nor dared he stir until the lights fading out the patrol rose and skulked onward Thereafter his movements were less stealthy with a detachment of their own abroad in No Man s Land the British would refrain from shooting at shadows One had now to fear only German bullets in event the patrol were discovered Rising the man slipped and stumbled on in semi crouching posture ready to flatten to earth as soon as any one of his many overshoulder glances detected another sky spearing flight of sparks But this necessity he was spared no more lights were discharged before he groped through the wires to the parapet with almost uncanny good luck finding the very spot where the British had come over the top indicated by protruding uprights of a rough wooden scaling ladder As he turned felt with a foot for the uppermost rung and began to descend he was saluted by a voice hoarse with exposure from the black bowels of the trench Blimy but ye re back in a urry Wot s up Forget to put perfume on yer pocket andkerchief or wot The man s response if he made any was lost in a heavy splash as his feet slipped on the slimy rungs delivering him precipitately into a knee deep stream of foul water which moved sluggishly through the trench like the current of a half choked sewer a circumstance which neither suprised him nor added to his physical discomfort who could be no more wet or defiled than he had been Floundering to a foothold he cast about vainly for a clue to the other s whereabouts for if the night was thick in the open here in the trench its density was as that of the pit the man could distinguish positively nothing more than a pallid rift where the walls opened overhead Well sullen w ere s yer manners Carn t yer answer a civil question Turning toward the speaker the man replied in good if rather carefully enunciated English I am not of your comrades I am come from the enemy trenches The ell yer are Ands up The muzzle of a rifle prodded the man s stomach Obediently he lifted both hands above his head A thought later he was half blinded by the sudden spot light of an electric flash lamp Deserter eh You kamerad wot Kamerad the man echoed with an accent of contempt I am no German I am French I have come through the Boche lines to night with important information which I desire to communicate forthwith to your commanding officer Strike me his catechist breathed skeptical There was a new sound of splashing in the trench A third voice chimed in Ello Wot s all the row abaht Step up and tike a look for yerself Ere s a blighter wot sez e s com from the Germ trenches with important information for the O C Bloody liar the newcomer commented dispassionately Mind yer eye Likely it s just another pl yful little trick of the giddy Boche Ere you The splashing drew nearer Wot s yer gime Speak up if yer don t want a bullet through yer in ards I play no game the man said patiently I am unarmed your prisoner if you like I like all right Mike yer mind easy abaht that But wot s all this important information I shall divulge that only to the proper authorities Be good enough to conduct me to your commanding officer without more delay Wot do yer mike of im corp ril the first soldier enquired Ow abaht an inch or two o the bay net to loosen is tongue After a moment s hesitation in perplexed silence the corporal took the flash lamp from the private and with its beam raked the prisoner from head to foot gaining little enlightenment from this review of a tall spare figure clothed in the familiar gray overcoat of the German private its face a mere mask of mud through which shone eyes of singular brilliance and steadiness the eyes of a man of intelligence determination and courage Keep yer ands igh the corporal advised curtly Ginger you search im Propping his rifle against the wall of the trench its butt on the firing step just out of water the private proceeded painstakingly to examine the person of the prisoner in course of which process he unbuttoned and threw open the gray overcoat exposing a shapeless tunic and trousers of shoddy drab stuff E asn t got no arms e asn t got nothink not so much as is blinkin latch key Very good Get back on yer post I ll tike charge o this one Grounding his own rifle the corporal fixed its bayonet then employed it in a gesture of unpleasant significance Bout fice he ordered March Yer can drop yer ands but don t go forgettin I m right ere be ind yer In silence the prisoner obeyed wading down the flooded trench the spot light playing on his back striking sullen gleams from the inky water that swirled about his knees and disclosing glimpses of coated figures stationed at regular intervals along the firing step faces steadfast to loopholes in the parapet Now and again they passed narrow rifts in the walls of the trench entrances to dugouts betrayed by glimmers of candle light through the cracks of makeshift doors or the coarse mesh of gunnysack curtains From one of these at the corporal s summons a sleepy subaltern stumbled to attend ungraciously to his subordinate s report and promptly ordered the prisoner taken on to the regimental headquarters behind the lines A little farther on captive and captor turned off into a narrow and tortuous communication trench Thereafter for upward of ten minutes they threaded a labyrinth of deep constricted reeking ditches with so little to differentiate one from another that the prisoner wondered at the sure sense of direction which enabled the corporal to find his way without mis step with the added handicap of the abysmal darkness Then of a sudden the sides of the trench shelved sharply downward and the two debouched into a broad open field Here many men lay sleeping with only waterproof sheets for protection from that bitter deluge which whipped the earth into an ankle deep lake of slimy ooze and lent keener accent to the abiding stench of filth and decomposing flesh A slight hillock stood between this field and the firing line where now lively fusillades were being exchanged its profile crowned with a spectral rank of shell shattered poplars sharply silhouetted against a sky in which star shells and Verey lights flowered like blooms of hell Here the corporal abruptly commanded his prisoner to halt and himself paused and stood stiffly at attention saluting a group of three officers who were approaching with the evident intention of entering the trench One of these loosed upon the pair the flash of a pocket lamp At sight of the gray overcoat all three stopped short A voice with the intonation of habitual command enquired What have we here The corporal replied A prisoner sir sez e s French come across the open to night with important information so e sez The spot light picked out the prisoner s face The officer addressed him directly What is your name my man That said the prisoner is something which like my intelligence I should prefer to communicate privately With a startled gesture the officer took a step forward and peered intently into that mud smeared countenance I seem to know your voice he said in a speculative tone You should the prisoner returned Gentlemen said the officer to his companions you may continue your rounds Corporal follow me with your prisoner He swung round and slopped off heavily through the mud of the open field Behind them the sound of firing in the forward trenches swelled to an uproar augmented by the shrewish chattering of machine guns Then a battery hidden somewhere in the blackness in front of them came into action barking viciously Shells whined hungrily overhead The prisoner glanced back the maimed poplars stood out stark against a sky washed with wave after wave of infernal light Some time later he was conscious of a cobbled way beneath his sodden footgear They were entering the outskirts of a ruined village On either hand fragments of walls reared up with sashless windows and gaping doors like death masks of mad folk stricken in paroxysm Within one doorway a dim light burned through it the officer made his way prisoner and corporal at his heels passing a sentry then descending a flight of crazy wooden steps to a dank and gloomy cellar stone walled and vaulted In the middle of the cellar stood a broad table at which an orderly sat writing by the light of two candles stuck in the necks of empty bottles At another table in a corner a sergeant and an operator of the Signal Corps were busy with field telephone and telegraph instruments On a meagre bed of damp and mouldy straw against the farther wall several men orderlies and subalterns rested in stertorous slumbers Despite the cold the atmosphere was a reek of tobacco smoke sweat and steam from wet clothing The man at the centre table rose and saluted offering the commanding officer a sheaf of scribbled messages and reports Taking the chair thus vacated the officer ran an eye over the papers issued several orders inspired by them then turned attention to the prisoner You may return to your post corporal The corporal executed a smart about face and clumped up the steps In answer to the officer s steadfast gaze the prisoner stepped forward and confronted him across the table Who are you My name said the prisoner after looking around to make sure that none of the other tenants of the cellar was within earshot is Lanyard Michael Lanyard The Lone Wolf Involuntarily the officer jumped up almost overturning his chair That same the prisoner affirmed adding with a grimace of besmirched and emaciated features that was meant for a smile General Wertheimer Wertheimer is not my name I am aware of that I uttered it merely to confirm my identity to you it is the only name I ever knew you by in the old days when you were in the British Secret Service and I a famous thief with a price upon my head when you and I played hide and seek across half Europe and back again in the days of Troyon s and the Pack the days of De Morbihan and Popinot and Ekstrom the officer supplied as the prisoner hesitated oddly And Ekstrom the other agreed There was a little silence between the two then the officer mused aloud All dead All but one The officer looked up sharply Which The last named Ekstrom But we saw him die You yourself fired the shot that It was not Ekstrom Trust that one not to imperil his precious carcase when he could find an underling to run the risk for him I tell you I have seen Ekstrom within this last month alive and serving the Fatherland as the genius of that system of espionage which keeps the enemy advised of your every move down to the least considerable that system which makes it possible for the Boche to greet every regiment by name when it moves up to serve its time in your advanced trenches You amaze me I shall convince you I bring intelligence which will enable you to tear apart this web of treason within your own lines and Lanyard s voice broke The officer remarked that he was trembling trembling so violently that to support himself he must grip the edge of the table with both hands You are wounded No but cold to my very marrow and faint with hunger Even the German soldiers are on starvation rations now the civilians are worse off and I I have been over there for years a spy a hunted thing subsisting as casually as a sparrow Sit down Orderly And there was no more talk between these two for a time Not only did the officer refuse to hear another word before Lanyard had gorged his fill of food and drink but an exigent communication from the front transmitted through the trench telephone system diverted his attention temporarily Gnawing ravenously at bread and meat Lanyard watched curiously the scenes in the cellar following as best he might the tides of combat gathering that German resentment of a British bombing enterprise doubtless the work of that same squad which had stolen past him in the gloom of No Man s Land had developed into a violent attempt to storm the forward trenches In these a desperate struggle was taking place Reinforcements were imperatively wanted Activities at the signallers table became feverish the commanding officer stood over it reading incoming messages as they were jotted down and taking such action thereupon as his judgment dictated Orderlies dragged half asleep from their nests of straw were shaken awake and despatched to rouse and rush to the front the troops Lanyard had seen sleeping in the open field Other orderlies limped or reeled down the cellar steps delivered their despatches and staggered out through a breach in the wall to have their injuries attended to in the field dressing station in the adjoining cellar or else threw themselves down on the straw to fall instantly asleep despite the deafening din The Boche artillery seeking blindly to silence the field batteries whose fire was galling their offensive had begun to bombard the village Shells fled shrieking overhead to break in thunderous bellows Walls toppled with appalling crashes now near at hand now far The ebb and flow of rifle fire at the front contributed a background of sound not unlike the roaring of an angry surf Machine guns gibbered like maniacs Heavier artillery was brought into play behind the British lines apparently at no great distance from the village the very flag stones of the cellar floor quaked to the concussions of big calibre guns Through the breach in the wall echoed the screams and groans of wounded The foul air became saturated with a sickening stench of iodoform Gusts of wet wind eddied hither and yon Candles flickered and flared guttered out were renewed Monstrous shadows stole out from black corners crept along mouldy walls crouched sprang and vanished or inscrutably baffled retreated sullenly to their lairs For the better part of an hour the struggle continued then its vigour began to wane The heaviest British metal went out of action some time later the field batteries discontinued their activities The volume of firing in the advance trenches dwindled was fiercely renewed some half a dozen times died away to normal Once more the Boche had been beaten back Returning to his chair the commanding officer rested his elbows upon the table and bowed his head between his hands in an attitude of profound fatigue He seemed to remind himself of Lanyard s presence only at cost of a racking effort lifting heavy lidded eyes to stare almost incredulously at his face I presumed you were in America he said in dulled accents I was for a time You came back to serve France Lanyard shook his head I returned to Europe after a year the spring before the war Why I was hunted out of New York The Boche would not let me be The officer looked startled The Boche More precisely Herr Ekstrom to name him as we knew him But this I did not suspect for a long time that it was he who was responsible for my persecution I knew only that the police of America informed of my identity with the Lone Wolf sought to deport me that every avenue to an honourable livelihood was closed So I had to leave to try to lose myself Your wife I mean to say you married didn t you Lanyard nodded Lucy stuck by me till the end She had a little money of her own It financed our flight from the States We made a round about journey of it to elude surveillance and I think succeeded You returned to Paris No France like England was barred to the Lone Wolf We settled down in Belgium Lucy and I and our boy He was three months old We found a quiet little home in Louvain The officer interrupted with a low cry of apprehension Lanyard checked him with a sombre gesture Let me tell you We might have been happy None knew us We were sufficient unto ourselves But I was without occupation it occurred to me that my memoirs might make good reading for Paris my friends the French are as fond of their criminals as you English of your actors On the second of August I journeyed to Paris to negotiate with a publisher While I was away the Boche invaded Belgium Before I could get back Louvain had been occupied sacked He sat for a time in brooding silence the officer made no attempt to rouse him but the gaze he bent upon the man s lowered head was grave and pitiful Abruptly in a level and toneless voice Lanyard resumed In order to regain my home I had to go round by way of England and Holland I crossed the Dutch frontier disguised as a Belgian peasant When I reentered Louvain it was to find But all the world knows what the blond beast did in Louvain My wife and little son had vanished utterly I searched three months before I found trace of either Then Lucy died in my arms in a wretched hovel near Aerschot She had seen our child butchered before her eyes She herself Lanyard s hand that rested on the table clenched and whitened beneath its begrimed skin His eyes fathomed distances immeasurably removed beyond the confines of that grim cellar But he presently continued Ekstrom had accompanied the army of invasion had seen and recognized Lucy in passing through Louvain Therefore she and my son were among the first to be sacrificed When I stood over her grave I dedicated my life to the extermination of Ekstrom and all his breed I have since done things I do not like to think about But the Prussian spy system is the weaker for my work But Ekstrom I could never find It was as if he knew I hunted him He was seldom twenty four hours ahead of me yet I never caught up with him but once and then he was too closely guarded I pursued him to Berlin to Potsdam three times to the western front to Serbia once to Constantinople twice to Petrograd The officer uttered an exclamation of astonishment Lanyard looked his way with a depreciatory air Nothing strange about that To one of my early training that was easy everything was easy but the end I sought En passant I collected information concerning the workings of the Prussian spy system From time to time I found means to communicate somewhat of this to the Surete in Paris I believe France and England have already profited a little through my efforts They shall profit more and quickly when I have told all that I have to tell Of a sudden Ekstrom vanished Overnight he disappeared from Germany A false lead brought me back to this front Two days ago I learned he had been sent to America on a secret mission Knowing that the States have severed diplomatic relations with Berlin and tremble on the verge of a declaration of war we can surmise something of the nature of his mission I mean to see that he fails To follow him to America making my way out through Belgium and Holland pursuing such furtive ways as I must in territory dominated by the Boche meant much time lost So I came through the lines to night Fortune was kind in throwing me into your hands I count upon your assistance As an ex agent of the Secret Service you are in a position to make smooth my path as an Englishman you will advance the interests of a prospective ally of England if you help me to the limit of your ability for what I mean to do in America will serve that country by exposing the conspiracies of the Boche across the water as much as it will serve my private ends The officer s hand fell across the table and closed upon the knotted fist of the Lone Wolf As an Englishman he said simply of course But no less as your friend II FROM A BRITISH PORT And one man in his time plays many parts few more than this same Lanyard In no way to be identified with the hunted creature who crept into the British lines out of No Man s Land was the Monsieur Duchemin who ten days after that wintry midnight took passage for New York from a British port aboard the steamship Assyrian Andre Duchemin was the name inscribed in the credentials furnished him in recognition of signal assistance rendered the British Secret Service in its task of scotching the Prussian spy system And the personality he chose to assume suited well the name A man of modest and amiable deportment viewing the world with eyes intelligent and curious his temper reacting from its ways in terms of grave humour Monsieur Duchemin passed peaceably on his lawful occasions took life as he found it made the best of irksome circumstances This last idiosyncrasy stood him in good stead For the Assyrian failed to clear upon her proposed sailing date and for a livelong week thereafter chafed alongside her landing stage steam up cargo laden and stowed nothing lacking but the Admiralty s permission to begin her westbound voyage a permission inscrutably withheld giving rise to a common discontent which the passengers dissembled to the various best of their abilities that is to say in most cases thinly or not at all Yet they were none of them unreasonable beings They had come aboard one and all keyed up to a high nervous pitch pardonable in such as must commit their lives to the dread adventure of the barred zone wanting nothing so much as to get it over with whatever its upshot And everlasting procrastination required them day after day to steel their hearts anew against that Terror which followed its furtive ways beneath the leaden waters of the Channel Alone among them this Monsieur Duchemin paraded successfully a false face of resignation protesting no predilection whatsoever for a watery grave no infatuate haste to challenge the Hun upon his chosen hunting ground In the fullness of time it would be permitted to him to go down to the sea in this ship Meanwhile he found it apparently pleasant and restful to explore the winding cobbled ways of that antiquated waterside community made over by the hand of War into a bustling seaport or to tramp the sunken lanes that seamed those green old Cornish hills which embosomed the wide harbour waters or to lounge about the broad white decks of the Assyrian watching the diurnal traffic of the haven a restless warlike pageant Daily in earliest dusk of dawn the wakeful might watch the faring forth of a weirdly assorted fleet of small craft the day patrol to relieve a night patrol as weirdly heterogeneous Daily at all hours mine sweepers came and went by twos and twos in flocks in schools and daily bellowing offshore detonations advertised their success in garnering those horned black seeds of death which the Hun and his kin were sedulous to sow in the fairways While daily battleships both great and small rolled in wearily to refit and dress their wounds or took swift departure on grim and secret errands There was moreover the not infrequent spectacle of some minor ship of war a truculent gray destroyer as like as not shepherding in a sleek submarine like a felon whale armoured and strangely caparisoned in gray brown steel to be moored in chains with a considerable company of its fellows on the far side of the roadstead while its crew was taken ashore and consigned to some dark limbo of oblivion And once with a light cruiser snapping at her heels a drab Norwegian tramp plodded sullenly into port a mine layer caught red handed plying its assassin s trade beneath a neutral flag Not long after its crew had been landed volleys of musketry crashed in the town gaol yard One of a group of three idling on the promenade deck of the Assyrian Lanyard turned sharply and stared through narrowed eyelids into the quarter whence the sounds reverberated The man at his side a loose jointed American of the commercial caste paused momentarily in his task of masticating a fat dark cigar This way out he commented thoughtfully Lanyard nodded but the third a plumply ingratiative native of Geneva known to the ship as Emil Dressier frowned in puzzlement Pardon Monsieur Crane but what is that you say this way out Simply Crane explained I take the firing to mean the execution of our nootral friends from Norway The Swiss shuddered It is most terrible Well I don t know about that They done their damnedest to fix it for us to drown somewhere out there in the nice cold English Channel I m just as satisfied it s them instead with their backs to a stone wall in the warm sunlight getting their needin s That s only justice Eh Monsieur Duchemin It is war said Lanyard with a shrug And war is No Sherman was all wrong Hell s got perfectly good grounds for a libel suit against William Tecumseh for what he up and said about it and war all in the same breath Lanyard smiled faintly but Dressler pondered this obscure reference with patent distress Crane champed his cigar reflectively What s more to our purpose he said presently I shouldn t be surprised if this meant the wind up of our rest cure here That s the third mine layer they ve collected this week two subs and now this benevolent nootral Am I right Monsieur Duchemin Who knows Lanyard replied with a smile Even now the mine sweeping flotilla is coming home as you see which means the neighbouring waters have been cleared It is altogether a possibility that we may be permitted to depart this night Even so the event as that day s sun declined amid a portentous welter of crimson and purple and gold the moorings were cast off and the Assyrian warped out into mid channel and anchored there for the night Inasmuch as she was to sail as the tide served some time before sunrise the passengers were advised to seek their berths at an early hour Thirty minutes before the steamship entered the danger zone as she would soon after leaving the harbour they would be roused and were expected promptly to assemble on deck with life preservers and station themselves near the boats to which they were individually assigned For their further comforting they were treated in the ebb of the chill blue twilight to boat drill and final instructions in the right adjustment of life belts A preoccupied company assembled in the dining saloon for what might be its last meal In the shadow of the general apprehension conversation languished expressions of relief on the part of those who had been loudest in complaining at the delays were notably unheard even Crane Lanyard s nearest neighbour at table was abnormally subdued Reviewing that array of sobered and anxious faces Lanyard remarked not for the first time but with renewed gratitude that in all the roster of passengers none were children and but two were women the American widow of an English officer and her very English daughter an angular and superior spinster Avoiding the customary post prandial symposium in the smoking room Lanyard slipped away with his cigar for a lonely turn on deck Beneath a sky heavily canopied the night was stark black and loud with clashing waters A fitful wind played in gusts now grim now groping like a lost thing blundering blindly about in that deep darkness Ashore a few wan lights widely spaced winked uncertainly withdrawn in vast remoteness those near at hand of the anchored shipping skipped and swayed and flickered in mad mazes of goblin dance To him who paced those vacant darkened decks the sense of dissociation from all the common kindly phenomena of civilization was something intimate and inescapable Melancholy as well rode upon that black winged wind At pause beneath the bridge the adventurer rested elbows upon the teakwood rail and with importunate eyes searched the masked face of his destiny There was great fear in his heart not of death but lest death overtake him before that scarlet hour when he should encounter the man whom he must always think of as Ekstrom After that nothing would matter let Death come then as swiftly as it willed He was not even middle aged on the hither side of thirty yet his attitude was that of one who had already crossed the great divide of the average mortal span he looked backward upon a life never forward to one To him his history seemed a thing written lacking the one word Finis he had lived and loved and lost had arrayed himself insolently against God and Man had been lifted toward the light a little way by a woman s love had been thrust relentlessly back into the black pit of his damnation He made no pretense that it was otherwise with him remained now merely the thing he had been in the beginning minus that divine spark which love had once kindled into consuming aspiration toward the right the Lone Wolf prowled again to day and would henceforth forevermore the beast of prey callous to every human emotion animated by one deadly purpose existing but to destroy and be in turn destroyed Two decks below about amidships a cargo port was thrust open to the night A thick broad beam of light leaped out buffeting the murk striking evanescent glimmers from the rocking facets of the waters Deckhands busied themselves rigging out an accommodation ladder A tender of little tonnage panted nervously up out of nowhere and was made fast alongside The light raked its upper deck picking out in passing a group of men in uniforms Fugitively something resembling a petticoat snapped in the wind Then several persons moved toward the accommodation ladder climbed it disappeared through the cargo port The wearer of the petticoat did not accompany them Lanyard noted these matters subconsciously for the time altogether preoccupied casting forward his thoughts along those dim trails his feet must tread who followed his dark star Ten minutes later a deck steward found him and paused touching his cap Beg pardon sir but all passingers is requested to report immedately in the music room Indifferently Lanyard thanked the man and went below to find the music room tenanted by a full muster of his fellow passengers all more or less indignantly waiting to be cross examined by the party of port officials from the tender the ship s purser standing by together with the second and third officers and a number of stewards Resentment was not unwarranted already before being suffered to take up quarters on board the Assyrian each passenger had submitted to a most comprehensive survey of his credentials his mental moral and social status his past record present affairs and future purposes A formality to be expected by all such as travel in war time it had been rigid but mild in contrast with this eleventh hour inquisition a proceeding so drastic and exhaustive that the only plausible inference was official determination to find excuse for ordering somebody ashore in irons Nothing was overlooked once passports and other proofs of identity had been scrutinized each passenger was conducted to his stateroom and his person and luggage subjected to painstaking search None escaped on the other hand not one was found guilty of flagitious peculiarity In the upshot the inquisitors baffled and betraying every symptom of disappointment were fain to give over and return to their tender By this time Lanyard one of the last to be grilled and passed found himself as little inclined for sleep as the most timorous soul on board Selecting an American novel from the ship s library he repaired to the smoking room where established in a corner apart he became an involuntary and at first a largely inattentive eavesdropper upon an animated debate involving some eight or ten gentlemen at a table in the middle of the saloon its subject the recent visitation Measures so extraordinary were generally held to indicate an incentive more extraordinary still You can t get away from it he heard Crane declare there s some sort of funny business going on or liable to go on aboard this ship She wasn t held up for a solid week out of pure cussedness Neither did they come aboard to night to give us another once over through sheer voluptuousness There s a reason And what a satiric English voice enquired do you assume that reason to be Search me Sfar s I m concerned the processes of the British Intelligence Office are a long sight past finding out It is simple enough one of Crane s compatriots suggested the Assyrian is suspected of entertaining a devil unawares Monsieur means the Swiss enquired I mean the authorities may have been led to believe some one of us a questionable character German spy Possibly Or an English traitor

Another guess Crane cut in they ve taken considerable trouble to clear the track for us Maybe it occurred to somebody at the last moment to make sure none of us was likely to pull off an inside job Inside job Dressler pleaded Planting bombs in the coal bunkers things like that anything to crab our getting through the barred zone in spite of mines and U boats Any such attempt would mean almost certain death What of it It s been tried before and got away with You ve got to hand it to Fritz he ll risk hell for breakfast cheerful any time he gets it in his bean he s serving Gott und Vaterland Granted said the Englishman But I fancy such an one would find it far from easy to secure passage upon this or any other vessel How so You may have haltered all your traitors but there s still a plenty German spies living in England Even you admit that And if they can get by your Secret Service to say nothing of Scotland Yard what s to prevent their fixing to leave the country Nothing certainly But I still contend it is hardly likely Of course it s hardly likely Look at these guys to night dead set on making an awful example of anybody that couldn t come clean I didn t notice them missing any bets They combed me to the Queen s taste for a while I was sure scared they d extract my pivot tooth to see if there wasn t something incriminating and degrading secreted inside it And nobody got off any easier I say the good ship Assyrian has a pretty clean bill of health to go sailing with On the other hand yet another American voice was speaking no spy or criminal worth his salt would try to ship without preparations thorough enough to insure success barring accidents Criminal drawled the Briton incredulously The enterprisin burglar keeps a burglin even in war time There have been notable burglaries in London of late according to your newspapers And you think the thief would attempt to smuggle his loot out of the country aboard such a ship as this Why not Scotland Yard to the contrary notwithstanding If Scotland Yard is as efficient as you think sir certainly any sane thief would make every effort to leave a country it was making too hot for him Considerable criminal Crane jeered Undeceive yourself senor This was a Brazilian a quiet little dark body who commonly contented himself with a listening role in the smoking room discussions There are truly criminals of intelligence And war conditions are driving them out of Europe Of a sudden Lanyard stretched out at length upon the leather cushions in full view of these gossips became aware that he was being closely scrutinised By whom with what reason or purpose he could not surmise and it were unwise to look up from that printed page But that sixth sense of his intuition what you will that exquisitively sensitive sentinel admonished that at least one person in the room was watching him narrowly Though he made no move other than to turn a page his glance followed blindly blurring lines of text and his quickened wits overlooked no shade of meaning or intonation as that talk continued A criminal of intelligence some one observed is a giddy paradox whose fatuous existence is quite fittingly confined to the realm of fable You took the identical words right out of my mouth Crane complained bitterly Your pardon senores history confutes your incredulity But we are talking about to day Even to day can you deny it men attain high places by means which the law would construe as criminal were they not intelligent enough to outwit it Big game Crane objected something else again What we contend is no man of ordinary common sense could get his own consent to crack a safe or pick a pocket or do second story work or pull any rough stuff like that Again you overlook living facts persisted the Brazilian Name one just one The Lone Wolf then Unnatural history is out of my line Crane objected Why is a lone wolf anyway The Brazilian s voice took on an accent of exasperation Senores I do not jest I am a student of psychology more especially of criminal psychology I lived long in Paris before this war and took deep interest in the case of the Lone Wolf Well you ve got me all excited Go on with your story With much pleasure This gentleman then this Michael Lanyard as he called himself was a distinguished Parisian figure a man of extraordinary attainment esteemed the foremost connoisseur d art in all Europe Suddenly at the zenith of his career he disappeared Subsequently it became known that he had been identical with that great Parisian criminal the Lone Wolf a superman of thieves who had plundered all Europe with unvarying success for almost a decade Then what made the silly ass quit According to my information he won the love of a young woman And reformed for her sake of course To the contrary senor Lanyard renounced his double life because of a theory on which he had founded his astonishing success According to this theory any man of intelligence may defy society as long as he will always providing he has no friend lover or confederate in whom to confide A man self contained can never be betrayed the stupid police seldom apprehend even the most stupid criminal save through the treachery of some intimate This Lanyard proved his theory by confounding not only the utmost efforts of the police but even the jealous enmity of that association of Continental criminals known as the Bande Noire until he became a lover Then he proved his intelligence in one stroke he flouted the police delivered into their hands the inner circle of the Bande Noire and vanished with the woman he loved And then The rest said the Brazilian is silence It is for to night anyway Crane observed yawning It s bedtime Here comes the busy steward to put the lights and us out There was a general stir men drained glasses knocked out pipes got up murmured good nights Lanyard closed the American novel upon a forefinger looked up abstractedly rose moved toward the door The utmost effort of exceptional powers of covert observation assured him that at the moment none of the company favoured him with especial attention the author of that interest whose intensity had so weighed upon his consciousness had been swift to dissemble On his way forward he exchanged bows and smiles with Crane and one or two others his gesture completely casual Yet when he entered the starboard alleyway he carried with him a complete catalogue of those who had contributed to the conversation With all thanks to seven days association he stood on terms of shipboard acquaintance Not one in his esteem was more potentially mischievous than any other not even the Brazilian Velasco though he had been the first to name the Lone Wolf It was furthermore quite possible that the mention of his erstwhile sobriquet had been utterly fortuitous And yet one might not forget that sensation of being under intent surveillance In his stateroom Lanyard stood for several minutes gravely peering into the mirror above the washstand The face he scanned was lean and worn in feature darkly weathered framed in hair whose jet already boasted an accent of silver at either temple the face of a man inured to hardship seasoned in suffering strong in self knowledge The incandescence of an intelligence coldly dispassionate quick and shrewd lighted those dark eyes Distinctively a face of Gallic cast three years of long drawn torment had served in part to erase from it wellnigh all resemblance to both the brilliant social freebooter of ante bellum Paris and that undesirable alien whom the authorities had sought to deport from the States Amazing facility in impersonation had done the rest unrecognisable as what he had been he was to day flawlessly the incarnation of what he elected to seem Monsieur Duchemin gentleman of Paris Impossible to believe his disguise had been so soon penetrated And yet again that gossip of the smoking room Police work Or had Ekstrom s creatures picked up his trail once more Beneath that urbane mask of his a hunted wild thing poised in question mistrustful of the very wind prick eared fangs agleam eyes grimly apprehensive A little sound the least of metallic clicks breaking the hush of his solitude froze the adventurer to attention Only his glance swerved swiftly to a fastened door in the forward partition his stateroom being the aftermost of three that might be thrown together to form a suite The nickeled knob was being tried with infinite precaution On the half turn it checked with a faint repetition of the click Then the door itself quivered almost imperceptibly to pressure though it yielded not a fraction of an inch Lanyard s eyes hardened He did not stir from where he stood but one hand whipped an automatic from his pocket while the other darted out to the switch box by the head of his berth and extinguished the light Instantly a glimmer of light in the forward stateroom showed through a narrow strip of iron grill work set in the top of the partition for ventilating purposes Simultaneously the door knob was gently released and with another louder click the light in the adjoining cubicle was blotted out Mystified Lanyard undressed and turned in but not to sleep not for a little at least Who might this neighbour be who tried his door so stealthily Before to night that room had had no tenant Apparently one of the passengers had seen fit to shift his quarters To what end To keep a jealous eye on the Lone Wolf perhaps So much the better then Lanyard need only make enquiry in the morning to identify his enemy Deliberately closing his eyes he dismissed the enigma He possessed in marked degree that attribute of genius ability to command slumber at will Swiftly the troubled deeps of thought grew calm on their placid surface inconsequent visions were mirrored darkly fugitive scenes from the store of subconscious memory Crane s lantern jawed physiognomy keen eyes semi veiled by humorously drooping lids the extreme corner of his mouth bulging round his everlasting cigar grimy lions in Trafalgar Square of a rainy afternoon the octagonal room of L Abbaye Theleme at three in the morning a swirl of Bacchanalian shapes Wertheimer s soldierly figure beside the telegraphers table in that noisome cave at the Front the deck of a tender in darkness swept by a shaft of yellow light which momentarily revealed a group of folk with upturned faces a petticoat fluttering in its midst III IN THE BARRED ZONE Day broke with rather more than half a gale blowing beneath a louring sky Once clear of the bottleneck mouth of the harbour the Assyrian ran into brutal quartering seas An old hand at such work for upward of a decade a steady paced Dobbin of the transatlantic lanes she buckled down to it doggedly and remembering her duty by her passengers rolled no more than she had to buried her nose in the foaming green only when she must For all her care the main deck forward was alternately raked by stinging volleys of spray and scoured by frantic cascades More than once the crew of the bow gun narrowly escaped being carried overboard to a man Blue with cold soaked to the buff despite oilskins they stuck stubbornly to their posts Perched beyond reach of shattering wavecrests the passengers on the boat deck huddled unhappily in the lee of the superstructure and snarled in response to the cheering information that better conditions for baffling the ubiquitous U boat could hardly have been brewed by an indulgent Providence Sheeting spindrift contributed to lower visibility two destroyers standing on parallel courses about a mile distant to port and to starboard were more often than not barely discernible spectral vessels reeling and dipping in the haze The ceaseless whistle of wind in the rigging was punctuated by long drawn howls which must have filled any conscientious banshee with corrosive envy Toward mid morning rain fell in torrents driving even the most fearful passengers to shelter within the superstructure A majority crowded the landing at the head of the main companionway close by the leeward door Bolder spirits marched off to the smoking room Crane starting this movement with the declaration that for his part he would as lief drown like a rat in a trap as battling to keep up in the frigid inferno of those raging seas A handful of miserables too seasick to care whether the ship swam or sank mutinously took to their berths Stateroom twenty seven adjoining Lanyard s sported obstinately a shut door Lanyard sedulous not to discover his interest by questioning the stewards caught never a glimpse of its occupant For his own satisfaction he took a covert census of passengers on deck as the vessel entered the danger zone and made the tally seventy one all told the number on the passenger list when the Assyrian had left her landing stage the previous evening It seemed probable therefore that the person in twenty seven had come aboard from the tender either with or following the official party Lanyard was unable to say that more had not left the tender than appeared to sit in inquisition in the music room By noon the wind was beginning to moderate and the sea was being beaten down by that relentlessly lashing rain Visibility however was more low than ever A fairly representative number descended to the dining saloon for luncheon a meal which none finished Midway in its course a thunderous explosion to starboard drove all in panic once more to the decks Within two hundred yards of the Assyrian a floating mine had destroyed a patrol boat No more was left of it than an oil filmed welter of splintered wreckage of its crew never a trace Imperturbably the Assyrian proceeded Not so her passengers now the smoking room was deserted even by the insouciant Crane and the seasick to a woman brought their troubles back to the boat deck Alone the tenant of twenty seven stopped below And the riddle of this ostensible indifference to terrors that clawed at the vitals of every other soul on board grew to intrigue Lanyard to the point of obsession Was the reason brute apathy or sheer foolhardihood He refused either explanation feeling sure some darker and more momentous motive dictated this obstinate avoidance of the public eye Exasperation aroused by failure to fathom the mystery took precedence in his thoughts even to the personal solicitude excited by last night s gossip of the smoking room With no other disturbing incident the afternoon wore away the wind steadily flagging the waves as steadily subsiding When twilight closed in there was nothing more disturbing to one s equilibrium than a sea of long and sullen rolls scored by the pelting downpour Perhaps as many as ten venturesome souls dined in the saloon their fellows sticking desperately to the decks and contenting themselves with coffee and sandwiches Daylight waned terrors waxed passengers instinctively gravitated into little knots and clusters conversing guardedly as if fearful lest their normal accents bring down upon them those Apaches of the underseas for signs of whom their frightened glances incessantly ranged over rail and searched the heaving wastes The understanding was tacit that all would spend the night on deck Dusk at length blotted out the shadows of their guardian destroyers and a great and desolating loneliness settled down upon the ship One by one the passengers grew dumb still they clung together but seemingly their tongues would no more function With nightfall the rain ceased the breeze freshened a trifle the pall of cloud lifted and broke giving glimpses of remote impersonal stars Later a gibbous moon leered through the flying wrack checkering the sea with a restless pattern of black and silver In this ghastly setting the Assyrian showing no lights a shape of flying darkness pursuing a course secret to all save her navigators strained ever onward panting groaning quivering from stem to stern like an enchanted thing doomed to perpetual labours striving vainly to break bonds invisible that transfixed her to one spot forever more in the midst of that bleak purgatory of shadow and moonshine and dread Sensitive to the eerie influence of the hour Lanyard interrupted the tour of the decks which he had steadily pursued for the better part of the evening and rested at the forward rail looking down over the main deck its bleached planking dotted with dark shapes of fixed machinery In the bows the formless uncouth bulk of the gun squatted in its tarpaulin Its crew tramped heavily to and fro shivering in heavy jackets hands in pockets shoulders hunched up to ears Farther aft an iron door clanged heavily behind a sailor emerging from an alleyway he approached the ship s bell with practised hand sounded two double strokes then turned and sang out in the weird minor traditional in his calling Four bells and a a all s well Even as the wind made free with the melancholy echoes of that assurance the spell upon the ship was exorcised Overhead from the foremast crow s nest a voice screamed hoarsely urgent Torpedo Ware submarine to port Many things happened simultaneously or in a span of seconds strangely scant The gunners sprang to station whipping away the tarpaulin while their lieutenant focussed binoculars upon the confused distances of the night Obedient to his instructions the long gleaming tube of steel pivoted smoothly to port From the bridge a signal rocket soared hissing The whistle loosed stentorian squalls of indignation and distress one long and four short Commands were shouted the engine room telegraph wrangled madly The momentum of the Assyrian was checked startlingly her bows sheered smartly off to port A rumour of frightened voices and pounding feet came from the leeward boat deck where the main body of the passengers was congregated hidden from Lanyard by the shoulder of the foreward deck house A number of men ran forward paused by the rail stared and scurried back yelling in alarm At this the din swelled to uproar Scanning closely the surface of the sea Lanyard himself descried a silvery arrow of spray lancing the swells making with deadly speed toward the port bow of the Assyrian But now both screws were churning full speed astern the vessel lost headway altogether Then her engines stopped For a breathless instant she rested inert like something paralyzed with fright bows on to the torpedo the telegraph ringing frantically Then the starboard screw began to turn full ahead the port remaining idle The bows swung off still more sharply to port The torpedo shot in under them vanished for a breathless moment reappeared a boat s length to starboard plunged harmlessly on its unhindered way down the side of the vessel and disappeared astern Amidships terrified passengers milled like sheep hampering the work of the boat crews at the davits Ship s officers raged among them endeavouring to restore order Half a mile or so dead ahead a tiny tongue of flame spat viciously in the murk A projectile shrieked overhead and dropped into the sea astern Another followed and fell short The U boat was shelling the Assyrian The forward gun barked violent expostulation if without visible effect the submarine lobbing two more shells at the steamship with an indifference to its own peril astonishing in one of its craven breed trained to strike and run before counterstroke may be delivered Its extraordinary temerity indeed argued ignorance of the convoying destroyers Coincident with the second shot however these unleashed searchlights slashed the dark through and through with their great white fanlike blades till first one then the other picked up and steadied relentlessly upon a toy boat shape that swam the swells about midway between the Assyrian and the destroyer off the port bows Simultaneously the quickfirers of the latter went into action jetting orange flame In the searchlights glare spurts of white water danced all round the submarine A mutter of gunfire rolled over to the Assyrian abruptly silenced by an imperative deep voice of heavier metal which spoke but once With the lurid unreality of clap trap theatrical illusion the U boat vomited a great spreading sheet of flame Someone at the rail near Lanyard s shoulder uttered a hushed cry of horror He paid no heed his interest wholly focussed upon that distant patch of shining water As his dazzled vision cleared he saw that the submarine had disappeared Unconsciously in French he commented So that is finished Likewise in French but in a woman s voice of uncommon quality deep and bell sweet came the protest from the passenger at his side But monsieur what are we doing We turn away from them those poor things drowning there That was quite true under forced draught the Assyrian was heading away on a new course They drown out there in that black water and we leave them to that Lanyard turned The destroyers will take care of them he said if any survived that explosion with strength enough to swim He spoke from the surface of his thoughts and with a calm that veiled profound surprise The woman by his side was neither the American widow nor her English daughter but wholly a stranger to the ship s company he knew The training of the Lone Wolf had been wasted if one swift glance had failed to comprehend every essential detail that tall straight slender figure cloaked in the folds of a garment whose hood framed a face of singular pallor and sweetness in the moonlight its shadowed eyes wide with emotion its lips a little parted With a shiver she lifted her hands to her eyes as if to darken the visions of her imagination They die out there she said in murmurs barely audible We turn our backs on them You think that right We play the game by the rules the enemy himself laid down Lanyard returned They would have sunk us without one qualm of pity would in all probability have shelled our boats had any succeeded in getting off They have done as much before and will again It is out of reason to insist that the captain risk his ship in the hope of picking up one or two drowning assassins Risk his ship How They are helpless As a rule U boats hunt in pairs always when specially charged to sink one certain vessel It was so with the Lusitania with the Arabic as well I don t doubt it was so in this instance that we should have heard from a second submarine had not the destroyers opened fire when they did The woman stared You think that That the Boche had specific instructions to waylay and sink the Assyrian I begin to think that yes This declaration affected the woman curiously she shrank away a little as from a blow her eyes winced her pale lips quivered When she spoke it was strangely enough in English so naturally enunciated that Lanyard could not doubt that this was her mother tongue Then you think it is because Of a sudden she wilted clinging to the rail and trembling wildly Lanyard shot a glance aft The disorder among the passengers was measurably less though excitement still ran so high that he felt sure they were as yet unnoticed On impulse he stepped nearer Pardon mademoiselle he said quietly you are excusably unstrung But all danger is past and there is still time to regain your stateroom unobserved If you will permit me to escort you He watched her narrowly but she showed no surprise at this suggestion of intimacy with her affairs After a brief moment she pulled herself together and dropped a hand upon the arm he offered In another minute he was helping her over the raised watersill of the door Like all the ship the landing and main companionway were dark but below on the promenade deck the second doorway aft on the starboard side stood ajar affording a glimpse of a dimly lighted stateroom With neither hesitation nor surprise for he was already satisfied in this matter Lanyard conducted the woman to this door and stopped Her hand fell from his arm She faltered on the threshold of Stateroom twenty seven eyeing him dubiously Thank you monsieur There was just enough accent of enquiry to warrant his giving her the name Duchemin mademoiselle Monsieur Duchemin Please to tell me how you knew this was my stateroom I occupy Stateroom twenty nine There was no one in twenty seven till after the tender came out last night Furthermore your face was strange and I have come to know all others on board during our week s delay in port The light was at her back he could distinguish little of her shadowed features but fancied her a bit discountenanced In a subdued voice she said Thank you once more a hand resting significantly on the door knob But still he lingered If mademoiselle would be so good as to tell me something in return If I can Then why mademoiselle did you try my door last night It was neither locked nor bolted on my side I wished to make sure So one fancied Thank you Good night mademoiselle She was impervious to his hint Good night Monsieur Duchemin she said and closed the door Now Lanyard s quarters opened not on this alleyway fore and aft but on a short and narrow athwartship passage And as he turned away he saw out of the corner of an eye a white jacketed figure emerge from this passageway and move hurriedly aft Something furtive in the round of the fellow s shoulders challenged his curiosity He called quietly Steward There was no answer By now the white jacket was no more than a blur moving in that deep gloom He cried again more loudly I say steward He could hardly see but fancied that the man quickened his steps in another instant he vanished altogether Smothering an impulse to give chase the adventurer swung alertly into the narrow passage and opened the door to Stateroom twenty nine The room was dark but as he fumbled for the switch the door in the forward partition was thrust open and the girl s slight figure showed tensely poised against the light behind her Monsieur Duchemin she cried in a voice sharp with doubt Lanyard turned the switch Mademoiselle he said and coolly crossed to the port drawing the light proof curtains This door was locked all day locked when the firing alarmed me and I went out to the deck And on my side mademoiselle it was locked and bolted when last I was here shortly before dinner Whoever unfastened it entered my room during my absence and tampered with my luggage You have missed something Gaze intent to his she nodded He shrugged and cast shrewdly round his quarters for some clue to the enigma His glance fastened on a leather bellows bag beneath the berth Dropping to his knees he pulled this out and looked up with a quizzical grimace his forefinger indicating the lock which was uncaught I left this latched but not locked he said Perhaps I too have lost something Opening the bag out flat he sat back on his heels with practised eye inspecting its neat arrangement of intimate things Nothing has been taken mademoiselle he announced gravely But something I think has been generously added I seem to have an anonymous admirer on board Bending forward he rummaged beneath a sheaf of shirts and brought forth a small jewel box of grained leather with a monogram stamped on the lid C B The lock is broken he observed and handed it up to the woman As to its contents mademoiselle herself knows best The woman opened the box Nothing is missing she said in a thoughtful voice I am relieved Lanyard closed the bag thrust it back beneath the berth and got upon his feet But you are quite sure My jewels are all in order she affirmed without meeting his gaze And you miss nothing else Nothing Was there an accent of hesitation in this response Then I take it the thief was disappointed Now she glanced quickly at his eyes Why do you say that If the thief had found what he sought he would never have presented it to me mademoiselle would never again have seen her jewels Failing in his object after breaking that lock and interrupted by your unexpected return he planted the case with me hoping to have me suspected I am fortunately able to prove the best of alibis So then said Lanyard smiling it would appear that though we met ten minutes ago for the first time and I have yet to know mademoiselle by name we are allies in a common cause My name is Brooke Cecelia Brooke she said quietly if it matters But why allies It appears we own a common enemy Each of us possesses something which that one desires you a secret I a good name Duchemin indeed I have always held to be an excellent name I shall not hesitate to call on you if my treasure is again violated May I venture to hope mademoiselle will prove as ready to command my services Thank you I fancy however there will be no need She moved irresolutely toward the communicating door paused in its frame eyeing him speculatively from under level brows He detected or imagined a tremor of impulse toward him as though she faltered on the verge of some grave confidence If so she curbed her tongue in time Her gaze dropped fixed itself abstractedly on the door This must be fastened she said in a tone of complete disinterest I will speak to the chief steward immediately Don t trouble She roused It doesn t matter really for to night I shall leave what valuables I have in the purser s care and stop on deck till daybreak He gave a gesture of bewilderment You abandon your seclusion leave your secret unguarded Why not She shrugged slightly with a little moue of discontent If as you assume I had a secret it was that for certain reasons I did not wish my presence on board to become known But it seems it has become known my secret is no more So I need no longer risk being cut off from the boats in the event of any accident Momentarily her gravity was dissipated by a smile at once delightful and provocative Once more monsieur good night After some moments Lanyard with a start found himself staring blankly at a blankly incommunicative communicating door IV IN DEEP WATERS Following this abrupt introduction to his interesting neighbour Lanyard went back to his deck chair and bundling himself up against the cold settled down to ponder the affair and await developments in a spirit of chastened resignation That a denouement would duly unfold he was quite satisfied that he himself must willy nilly play some part therein he was too well persuaded Not that he wished to meddle If this Miss Cecelia Brooke as she named herself fostered any sort of intrigue he wanted nothing so fervently as to be left altogether out of it But already he had been dragged in without wish or consent of his whoever coveted her secret whatever that was more precious to her than jewels harboured designs upon his own as well It was his duty henceforth to go warily overlooking no circumstance however trifling and inconsiderable it might appear The slenderest thread may lead to the heart of the most intricate maze and the heart of this was become Lanyard s immediate goal for there his enemy lay perdu It was never this man s fault to underrate an enemy least of all an unknown and he entertained wholesome respect for Secret Service operators picked men as a rule the meanest no mean antagonist And this business he fancied had all the flavour of Secret Service work one of those blind duels desperate and grim affairs of masked combatants feinting thrusting guarding in the dark each with the other s sword ever feeling for his throat fighting for life itself and making his own rules as the contest swayed But what was this Brooke girl doing in that galley What conceivable motive induced her to dabble those slender hands in the muck and blood of Secret Service work Lanyard was fain to let that question rest After all it was no concern of his There she was up to her pretty eyebrows in some dark bad business and it was not for him to play the gratuitous ass rush in unasked and seek to extricate her Through endless hours he sat brooding vision blindly focussed upon the misty shimmering mystery of that night Ekstrom Slowly in his understanding intuition shaped the conviction that it was Ekstrom whom he was fighting now Ekstrom in the guise of one of his creatures some agent of the Prussian spy system who had contrived to smuggle himself aboard this British steamship Out of those nine in the smoking room the previous night then he must beware of one primarily perhaps of more Four he was disposed with reservations to reckon negligible Baron von Harden head of a Netherlands banking house a silent body whose acute mental processes went on behind a pallid screen of flabby features Julius Becker a theatrical manager of New York whose right name ended in ski Bartlett Putnam late charge d affaires of the American embassy in Madrid Edmund O Reilly naturalized citizen of the United States interested in the manufacture of motor tractors somewhere in Michigan Of the other five two were English Lieutenant Thackeray a civilly reticent gentleman whose right arm rested in a black silk sling making a flying trip to visit a married sister in New York Archer Bartholomew esquire solicitor a red cheeked bright eyed white haired brisk little Cockney beyond the military age There remained Dressier the stout self satisfied Swiss whose fawning manner was possibly accounted for by his statement that he journeyed to New York to engage in the trade of restaurateur in partnership with his brother Crane long and awkward and homely of saturnine cast slow of gesture and negligent as to dress his humorous sense clouding a power of shrewd intelligence and Senor Arturo Velasco of Buenos Aires middle aged apparently extremely well to do a thoughtful type more self contained than most of his countrymen One of these probably But which Nor must he permit himself to forget that the Assyrian carried fifty nine other male passengers in addition to her complement of officers crew and stewards that any one of these might prove to be Potsdam s cat s paw Awesome pallor tinged the eastern horizon gaining strength spread in imperceptible yet rapid gradations toward the zenith Stars faded winked out vanished Silver and purple in the sea gave place to livid gray Almost visibly the routed night rolled back over the western rim of the world Shafts of supernal radiance lanced the formless void between sky and sea Swollen and angry the sun lifted up its enormous ensanguined portent And the discountenanced moon withdrew hastily into the immeasurable fastnessness of a cloudless firmament yet failed therein to find complete concealment Keen sweet airs of dawn raked the decks now to port now to starboard as the Assyrian twisted and writhed on her corkscrew way Passengers whose fears had become sufficiently numb to permit them to drowse stirred in their chairs roused blinking and blear eyed arose and stretched cramped cold bodies Others lay listless enervated by the sleepless misery of that night Crane found Lanyard awake and marched him off for coffee and cigarettes in the smoking room Later starting out for a turn around the decks they passed a deck chair sheltered in a jog where the engine room ventilating shaft joined the forward deck house in which Miss Brooke lay cocooned in wraps and furs her profile turned aside from the sea exquisitely etched against the rich blackness of a fox stole She slept as quietly as the most carefree a shadowy smile touching her lips Crane s stride faltered He whistled low In the name of all things wonderful how did that get on board Lanyard mentioned the girl s name She has the stateroom next to mine came off that tender night before last And me sore on that darn li l boat because it brought aboard all the nosey Johnnies Ain t it the truth you never know your luck The American ruminated in silence till another lap of their walk took them past the girl again Funny he mused if that s why they held us up Comment monsieur Oh I was just wondering if it was on that young lady s account they kept us kicking our heels back there so long I am still stupid Lanyard confessed Why she might be a special messenger you know something like that the British Government wanted to smuggle out of the country without anybody suspecting Monsieur is a romantic You can t trust me Crane averred unblushingly When they passed the chair again it was empty At breakfast Lanyard saw the girl from a distance their places were separated by the width of the saloon She had no neighbours at her table did not look up when Lanyard entered finished her meal some time before he did and retired immediately to her stateroom in whose seclusion she remained for the rest of the day That second day was altogether innocent of untoward incident At least superficially the life of the ship settled into the groove of business as usual Only the company of the Assyrian s faithful convoys was an ever present reminder of peril And in the middle of the afternoon she passed close by a derelict a torpedoed tramp deep down by the stern her bows helplessly high in air and crimson with rust the melancholy haunt of a great multitude of gulls More than slightly to Lanyard s surprise he received no quiet invitation to the captain s quarters to be interrogated concerning the burglary in Stateroom twenty seven Apparently the young woman had contented herself with reporting merely that the communicating door had carelessly been left unfastened For his own part neither seeking nor avoiding individual members of the smoking room group Lanyard permitted himself to be drawn into their company and sat among them amiably receptive But this profited him scantily there was no further talk of the Lone Wolf he was not again aware of that covert surveillance But when the evening chill driving him below to don a fur lined topcoat the Brooke girl coming up the companionway acknowledged his look of recognition with the most distant of nods he accepted the apparent rebuff without resentment He understood She was playing the game The enemy was watching listening After that he was studious to refrain from seeming either to avoid or to seek her neighbourhood and if he did keep a sharp eye on her it was so circumspectly as to mock detection To the best of his observation she found no friends on board contracted no new acquaintances kept herself to herself within walls of inexorable reserve Dawn ending the second night at sea found the Assyrian pursuing a course still devious and now alone the destroyers had turned back during the night The western boundary of the barred zone lay astern Ahead at the end of a brief interval of time the ivory towers of New York loomed a shimmer with endless sunlight glorious in golden promise Accordingly the spirits of the passengers were exalted The very ship seemed to grin in self complacence she had won safely through Unremitting vigilance was none the less maintained No hour of the twenty four found either gun forward or aft wanting a full working crew on the keen qui vive The life boats remained on outswung davits boat drills for passengers as well as crew were features of the daily programme Regulations concerning light and smoking on deck after dark were rigidly enforced Fuel was never spared in the effort to widen the blue gulf between the steamship and those waters wherein she had so nearly met her end By day a hunted thing racing frantically toward a port of refuge in the West all her stout fabric labouring with titanic pulsations shying in panic from the faintest suspicion of smoke upon the horizon the Assyrian slipped into the grateful obscurity of night like a snake into a thicket made herself akin to its densest shadows strained hopelessly not to be outdistanced by its fugitive mantle And the benison of unseasonably clement weather was hers day after shining day night after placid night the Atlantic revealed a singularly gracious humour mirrored the changeful panorama of the heavens in a surface little flawed So that the most squeamish voyagers as well as those most beset with fears slept sweetly in the comfort of their berths Lanyard however never went to bed without first securing his door so that it might be opened by force alone and never slept without a pistol beneath his pillow But the truth is he slept little For the first time in his history he learned what it meant to will sleep to come and have his will defied He lay for hours staring wide eyed into darkness hearkening to the steady throbbing of the engines unable to dismiss the thought that their every revolution brought him so much nearer to America so much the nearer to his hour with Ekstrom In vain he sought to fatigue his senses by over indulgence in his weakness for gambling Day long sessions at poker and auction in the smoking room where he found formidable antagonists principally in the persons of Crane Bartlett Putnam Velasco Bartholomew Julius Becker and Baron von Harden served only to forward his financial fortunes his luck was phenomenal he multiplied many times that slender store of English banknotes with which he had embarked upon this adventure But he left each exhausting sitting only to toss upon a wakeful pillow or to roam uneasily the dark and desolate decks a man haunted by ghosts of his own raising hagridden by passions of his own nurturing About two o clock on the third night the first outside the danger zone when every other passenger might reasonably be expected to be in his berth Lanyard lay in a deck chair deep in shadows wondering if it was worthwhile to go below and woo sleep in his stateroom By way of experiment he shut his eyes When after a moment he opened them again he was no longer alone Some distance away at the rail the woman of Stateroom twenty seven was standing with her back to Lanyard looking intently forward unquestionably ignorant of his presence Without moving he watched in listless incuriosity till he saw her straighten and stand away from the rail as if bracing herself against some crisis A man was coming aft from the entrance to the main companionway impatience in his stride a tall man of good carriage muffled almost to the heels in a heavy ulster a steamer cap well forward over his eyes But the light was poor the pale shine of the aged moon blending trickily with the swaying shadows Lanyard was unable to place him among the passengers There was a suggestion of Lieutenant Thackeray but that one was handicapped by one shell shattered arm whereas this man had the use of both He demonstrated that promptly taking the girl into them She yielded herself gladly with a hushed little cry hiding her face in the bosom of his ulster clinging to him This then was an assignation prearranged Miss Cecelia Brooke had a lover aboard the Assyrian a lover whom she denied by day but met in stealth by night And yet after that first swift embrace their conduct became oddly unloverlike The man released her of his own initiative held her by the shoulders at arm s length There was irritation in his manner He seemed tempted to shake the young woman Celia what madness So much at least Lanyard overheard the rest was a mumble into the hand which the girl placed over the man s lips She cried breathlessly Hush not so loud And then she remembered to guard her own voice In an undertone she spoke passionately for a moment The man interrupted in a tone of profound vexation She drew away as if hurt caught him up as he hesitated for a word returned clung to the lapels of his coat her accents rapid and pitiful eloquent of explanation entreaty determination The man lifted his hands to her wrists broke her grasp cut her brusquely short put her forcibly from him She sobbed softly Thus swiftly the scene suffered disillusioning transition The pretty fiction of lovers meeting in secret was no more Remained a man annoyed to the verge of anger a woman desperately importunate The wind sweeping aft carried broken snatches of their communications all I have could not let you go Insanity I was desperate drive me mad with your nonsense Lanyard sat up scraping his chair harshly on the deck Stricken mute the pair at the rail moved only to turn his way the pallid ovals of their faces Heedless of the prohibition he struck a vesta cupped its flame in his hands bending his face close and deliberately lighting a cigarette Appreciably longer than necessary he permitted the flare to reveal his features Then he blew it out rose sauntered to the rail cast the cigarette into the sea went aft and so below satisfied that the girl must have recognised him and so knew that her secret was safe But it was in an oddly disgruntled humour that he turned in he who had been so ready to twit Crane with his fantastic speculations concerning the English girl who had himself been the readiest to endue her with the romantic attributes becoming a heroine of her country s Secret Service What if he must now esteem her in the merciless light of to night s exposure as the most pitiable of all human spectacles a poor lovesick thing sans dignity sans pride sans heed for the world s respect a woman pursuing a man weary of her He resented unreasonably the unreasonable resentment which the affair inspired in him What was it to him He who had struck off all fettering bonds of common human interests who had renounced all common human emotions who had set his hand against all mankind that stood between him and that vengeful purpose to which he had dedicated his life He the Lone Wolf the heartless soulless pitiless beast of prey God in Heaven what was any woman to him V ON THE BANKS Unaccountably enough in his esteem and more and more to Lanyard s exasperation the evil flavour of that overnight incident lasted it tinctured distastefully his first waking thoughts and through all that fourth day at sea his mood was dark with irrational depression And the fifth day and the sixth were like unto the fourth Constantly he caught himself on watch for the young woman wondering how she would comport herself toward him unwilling witness though he had been to that shabby scene But save distantly at meal times he saw nothing of her And though he knew that she was much on deck after midnight he was studious to keep out of her way The tedium of stopping in a stuffy stateroom when the spell of restlessness was on him waiting for the sounds of his neighbour s return before he might venture forth was nothing anything were preferable to figuring as the innocent bystander at another encounter between the Brooke girl and her reluctant lover Then that happened which lent the business another complexion altogether Its second phase of close development drew toward an end Subtle underlying forces began to stir in their portentous latency The rapiers which thus far had merely touched shivering lightly against each other measuring each its opponent s strength feeling out his skill fell apart then re engaged in sharp and deadly play Steel met steel and clashing struck off sparks whose fugitive glimmerings lightened measurably the murk On the sixth night out at eleven o clock as a matter of routine the smoking room was closed for the night terminating an uncommonly protracted and in Lanyard s esteem irksome sitting at cards Well tired he went immediately to his quarters undressed stretched out in his berth and switched off the light Incontinently he found himself bedevilled by thoughts that would not rest For upward of an hour he lay moveless seeking oblivion in that very effort to preserve immobility while the Assyrian lunging heavily on her way moaned and muttered tedious accompaniment to the chant of the working engines Despairing at length and fretted by the closeness of his quarters he got up dressed sketchily and was shrugging into his fur lined coat when he heard the door to the adjoining stateroom open and close stealth in the sound of it At that he hung up his overcoat and threw himself down with a book on the lounge seat beneath the port The novel was dull enough in all conscience for that matter no tale within the compass of the cunningest weaver of words could have enthralled his temper at that time He read and read again page after page but without intelligence Between his eyes and the type blackened paper mirages of the past trembled and wavered old faces old scenes old illusions took unsubstantial form dissolved blended faded away a saddening show of shadows His heavy eyelids drooped slumber s drowsy vestments trailed lazily athwart the sea of consciousness A slight noise startled him either the shutting of the door to Stateroom twenty seven or the sound of the book dropping from his relaxed grasp He sat up and consulted his watch The hour was half after twelve The ship s bell sounded remotely a single doleful stroke He might have dozed five minutes or fifteen long enough at least to leave its tantalising effect of sleep desperately desirable mockingly elusive almost grasped whisked beyond grasping And with this he was aware of something even less tangible a sense of something amiss of something vaguely wrong as of an evil spirit stalking furtively through the darkened labyrinth of the ship as impalpable and ineluctable as miasmic exhalations of a morass Lanyard passed a hand across his forehead Had he been dreaming then Was this merely the reaction from some bitter nightmare He could not remember On sheer impulse he stood up extinguished the light opened the door As he did this he noted that a light burned in Stateroom twenty seven visible through the ventilating grille So the girl must have returned while he slept Or had she neglected to turn the switch when she went out He could not be certain On the threshold he paused a little attentive to the familiar rumour of the ship by night the prolonged sloughing of riven waters down the side gnashing of swells hurled back by the bows sibilance of draughts in alleyways groaning of frames a thin metallic rattle of indeterminate origin the crunching grind of the steering gear the everlasting deep throated diapason of the engines somewhere aft in that tier of staterooms a persistent human snore nothing unusual no alarming discordance Yet the feeling that mischief was afoot would not be still Lanyard moved down to the junction of the thwartship passage with the fore and aft alleyway Here he commanded a view of the promenade deck landing and the main companionway all in darkness but for a feeble glimmer of reflected starlight through the open deck port on the far side of the vessel Beyond this the rail was stencilled against the dull face of the sea with its far lifting and falling horizon within no more was visible than the dimmed whiteness of the forward partition the dense indefinite mass of balusters winding up to the boat deck and the flat plane of the tiled landing On this last near the mouth of the port alleyway half obscured by the intervening balusters something moved something huge black and formless swayed and writhed strangely and in the strangest silence like a dumb tormented misshapen brute transfixed to one spot from which its most anguished efforts might not avail to budge it Lanyard ran forward rounded the well of the companionway and pulled up Now the nature of the thing was revealed Blackly silhouetted against the square of the doorway two human figures were close locked and struggling desperately straining resisting thrusting giving recovering and all with never a sound more than the deadened thump of a shifting foot or the rasp of hard won breathing For several seconds the spectator could not distinguish one contestant from the other Then a change in the fortunes of war enabled him to make out that one was a woman the other and momentarily more successful a man Slender and youthful and strong she fought with the indomitable fury of a pantheress He on his part had won this much temporary advantage had broken the woman s clutch upon his throat and was bending her back over his hip one hand fumbling at her windpipe the other imprisoning her two wrists Yet she was far from being vanquished Even as Lanyard moved toward the pair she drove a savage knee into the man s middle and as he checked instantaneously with a grunt of pained surprise regained her footing and planted both elbows against his chest striving frantically to free her hands Simultaneously Lanyard took the fellow from behind wound an arm around his neck jerked his head sharply back twisted his forearm till he released the woman s wrists and threw him with a force that must have jarred his every bone The woman staggered back against the partition panting and sobbing beneath her breath The man rebounded from his fall with astonishing agility and flew back at Lanyard An object in his right hand gave off the dull gleam of polished steel Lanyard his automatic in his stateroom in the pocket of the overcoat where he had deposited it when meaning to go out on deck lacked any means of defense other than his two hands but his one time fame as an amateur pugilist had been second only to his fame as a connaisseur d art and to one whose youth had been passed in association with the Apaches of Paris some mastery of la savate was an inevitable accomplishment A lightning coup de pied planted a heel against one of the man s shins and his onslaught faltered in a gust of curses Then the point of his jaw received the full force of Lanyard s right fist with all the ill will imaginable behind it The man reared back reeled into the black mouth of the alleyway fell heavily Even so he demonstrated extraordinary vitality and appetite for punishment He had no more gone down than the adventurer peering into the gloom saw him struggle up on his knees Instantly Lanyard made toward him intent on finishing this work so well begun but in his second stride tripped over a heavy body hidden in the shadows and pitched headlong Falling he was conscious of a flashing thing that sped past his cheek immediately above his shoulder There followed an echoing thud against the forward partition Picking himself up smartly Lanyard crept several paces down the alleyway flattening against the wall straining his vision listening intently rewarded by neither sign nor sound of his antagonist That one must have been swift to advantage himself of Lanyard s tumble If he had not vanished into thin air or gone to earth in some untenanted stateroom thereabouts he found in the close blackness of that narrow passage a cloak of positive invisibility to cover his escape And there is little wisdom in stalking an armed man whom one cannot see with what little light there is at one s own back So Lanyard went back to the landing stepping carefully over the obstacle which had both thrown him and saved his life the supine body of a third man motionless whether dead or merely insensible he did not stop to investigate His immediate concern was for the woman As he came upon her now she stood en profile to the partition tugging strongly at something embedded in the woodwork close by her side between her waist and armpit At the sound of his approach she looked up with a tremor of apprehension quickly calmed Monsieur Duchemin If you please Lanyard in no way surprised to recognise the voice of Miss Cecelia Brooke stepped closer What is it he enquired and then bending over to look found that her cloak was pinned to the partition by the blade of a heavy knife buried a full half of its considerable length He threw it as you fell the girl explained I was in the direct line Permit me mademoiselle He laid hold of the haft of the weapon and with some difficulty withdrew it Who was it he asked weighing the knife in his palm and examining it as closely as he could without the aid of light There was no reply Directly her cloak was freed the girl had moved hastily away to the body over which Lanyard had stumbled He heard an imploring whisper Please and looked up to see her on her knees Who then is this he demanded joining her Lionel Lieutenant Thackeray Please O please tell me he is not dead Her voice broke he saw her slender body convulsed with racking emotions Kneeling Lanyard made a hasty and superficial examination necessarily no more under the conditions His heart beats he announced he breathes I do not think him seriously injured He made as if to get up I will get a light a flash lamp from my stateroom or better still the ship s surgeon Her hand fell upon his arm Please no Not that not now Later if necessary but now surely you can help me carry him to his stateroom You know the number It s close by thirty Find it and light up No leave this to me I can carry him without assistance The girl rose and disappeared Lanyard passed his arms beneath the Englishman s body gathered him into them and struggled to his feet no inconsiderable task Light gushed from an open doorway the third aft from the landing Staggering the adventurer entered and deposited the body upon the berth Immediately the girl closed and bolted the door then passed between him and the berth to bend over the unconscious man He lay in deep coma limbs a sprawl unpleasant glints of white between his half closed eyelids his breathing stertorous through parted lips Free of its sling his wounded arm dangled over the edge of the berth In putting him down Lanyard had remarked that its sleeve had been slit to the shoulder and that its bandages were undone Now in amazement he saw the arm was firm and muscular with an unbroken skin never a sign of any injury in all its length Gently the girl lifted the lieutenant s head to the light discovering a hideously bruised swelling at the base of the skull blood darkly matting the close clipped hair She requested without looking round Water please and a towel Obediently Lanyard ran hot and cold water into the hand basin in equal proportions Would it not be well now to call the ship s surgeon he suggested diffidently Is that necessary I am something of a nurse This is simply a bad contusion no worse I believe He was struck down from behind a cowardly blow in the dark as he started to go up on deck I had been waiting for him When he didn t come I suspected something was wrong I came down found him lying there that brute kneeling over him She spoke coolly enough in contrast with the high excitement that inflamed her eyes as she turned away from the berth Monsieur Duchemin are you armed I have this he said exhibiting the knife thrown by the would be murderer a simple trench dagger without distinguishing marks of any sort Then take this please Extracting an automatic pistol from a holster belted beneath Thackeray s coat she proffered it You won t mind staying here a moment standing guard while I fetch a dressing from my room Before he could utter a word of protest she had slipped out into the alleyway shutting the door behind her When several minutes had passed the adventurer found himself beset by increasing concern This long delay seemed not only inconsistent with her solicitude but indicated a possibility that the girl had braved unwisely the chance of a resumption of hostilities on the part of her late and as yet anonymous assailant Darkening the room as a matter of common sense precaution Lanyard pistol in hand stepped out into the alleyway in time to see the girl in the act of rising from her knees on the landing near the spot where Thackeray had fallen The light of her flash lamp was blotted out as she came hurriedly aft Perplexed he turned back and switched on the light as she entered Her eyes challenged his almost defiantly Was I long she asked breathless I dropped something Lanyard bowed without speaking Instinctively he knew that she was lying and divining this in his attitude she coloured and disconcerted turned away For a moment while she busied herself arranging on a convenient chair an assortment of first aid accessories he fancied that her half averted face wore a look of sullen chagrin with its compressed lips downcast eyes and faintly gathered brows But directly she needed assistance and requested it of him in a subdued and impersonal manner showing a countenance devoid of any incongruous emotion Lanyard lifting the lieutenant s head and heavy torso helped turn him face downward on the berth then stood aside thoughtfully watching the girl s deft fingers sop absorbent cotton in an antiseptic wash and apply it to the injury After a little he said If mademoiselle has no more immediate use for me Thank you monsieur You have already done so very much Then if mademoiselle will supply the name of this assassin I know it no more than you monsieur She glanced up at him startled What do you mean to do Why naturally lodge an information with the captain concerning this outrage Oh please no At a loss Lanyard shrugged eloquently Not yet at all events she hastened to amend Let Lionel judge what is best to be done when he comes to But mademoiselle who can say when that will be He pointed out the ugly ragged abrasion in the young Englishman s scalp exposed by the cleansing away of the clotted blood No ordinary blow he commented something very like a slung shot or a loaded cane did that work If I may venture again to advise unless mademoiselle is herself a surgeon Her colour faded and she caught her breath sharply You think it as serious as all that I do not know Such a blow might easily fracture the skull possibly bring about a concussion of the brain Regard likewise his laborious breathing I most assuredly advise consulting competent authority She did not immediately answer turning back undivided attention to her task but he noticed that her hands were tremulous however dextrously they finished dressing and bandaging the hurt and deep distress troubled the handsome eyes she turned to his when she rose You are right she murmured unquestionably right monsieur We must have the surgeon in But when Lanyard advanced a hand toward the bell push to call the steward she interposed in quick alarm No if you please a moment I must have time to think Her slender fingers writhed together in her agony of doubt and irresolution If only I knew what to do Lanyard was dumb There was indeed nothing helpful he could offer who was without a solitary tangible or trustworthy clue to the nature of this strange business He owned himself sadly mystified In the light or rather the shadow of this latest development his revised suspicions seemed unwarranted to the point of impertinence unless of course one assumed the unknown assailant to be a rejected lover or wronged husband And somehow one did not in the presence of this clear eyed straight limbed courageous young Englishwoman so wanting in self consciousness And yet what the deuce was she to this man whom indisputably she followed against his wish And what conceivable chain of circumstances linked their fortunes with his and that double burglary of the first night out with this murderous assault of to night Nor was to night s work considered by itself lacking in questionable features Why had Thackeray carried that sound arm in a sling How had its bandages come to be unwrapped Not in struggles before being placed hors de combat for he had never had a chance to resist Had his assailant then unwrapped it subsequently If so with what end in view Why had this Miss Cecelia Brooke surprising the thug at his work joined battle with him so bravely and so madly without calling for help What hidden motive excused this singular hesitation to summon the surgeon this reluctance to inform the officers of the ship What duplicity was that which the girl had paraded concerning her procrastination when Lanyard had surprised her on her knees out there on the landing If this were what Lanyard had first inclined to think it Secret Service intrigue surely it was weirdly intricate when an English girl hesitated to safeguard an Englishman by taking into her confidence the officers of a British ship British manned Nevertheless and however much he might wonder and doubt Lanyard would never question her Never of his own volition would he probe more deeply into this mystery take one farther step into the intricacies of its maze So in silence he waited passively courteous at her further service if she had need of him content if she had not tolerant of her tacit prayer for time in which to think a way out of her difficulties After some few moments he grew uncomfortably aware that he had become the object of a speculative regard not at all unfavourable He indulged in a mental gesture of resignation Then what he had feared befell not altogether as he had apprehended but in the girl s own fashion if without material difference in the upshot I am afraid said she in an even voice so quietly pitched as to be inaudible to any eavesdropper This becomes a task greater than I had dreamed more than my wits can cope with Monsieur Duchemin She hesitated He bowed slightly If mademoiselle can make any use of my poor abilities she has but to command me We I have much to thank you for already monsieur much more than I can ever hope to reward adequately Reward he echoed But mademoiselle Please don t misunderstand She flushed a little very prettily I am simply trying to express my sense of obligation not only for what you have already done but for what I mean to ask you to do Again he bowed without comment amiably receptive She resumed with perceptible effort I can trust you You must make sure of that before you do he warned her smiling I am sure she averred gravely You know nothing concerning me mademoiselle pardon For all you know I may be the greatest rogue in Christendom And I must tell you in all candour sometimes I think I am What I may or may not know concerning you Monsieur Duchemin is immaterial as long as I know you are what you have proved yourself to me a gentleman considerate generous brave and not inquisitive He was frankly touched If this were flattery tone and manner robbed it of fulsomeness rendered it subtle beyond the coarser perceptions of the man He knew himself for what he was knew himself unworthy and that part of him which was unaffectedly French whether by accident of birth or influence of environment and so impulsive and emotional reacted in spontaneous gratitude to this implicit acceptance of him for what he strove to seem to be Mademoiselle is gracious beyond my deserts he protested Only let me know how I may be of use In three ways Continue to be lenient in your judgments and ask me no more questions than you must because I may not answer Her hands worked together again She added unhappily in a faint voice I dare not That too moved him since he had been far from lenient in his judgments He responded the more readily All that is understood mademoiselle Please go at once back to your stateroom and as quietly as possible There is a bare chance you were not recognised that nobody knows who came to my aid to night If you can slip away without attracting attention so much the better for us for all of us You may not be suspected Trust me to use my best discretion Lastly take and keep this for me till I ask you for it again Hide it as secretly as you can It may be sought for is certain to be if you are believed to be in my confidence 
7383_95441_000059_000002	train-clean-360	It must not be 
none	none	found And I may not want it again before we land in New York She extended a hand on whose palm rested a small and slender white cylinder no longer and little thicker than the toy pencil that dangles from a dance card a tight roll of plain white paper enclosed in a wrapping of transparent oiled silk gummed fast down its length and at either end sealed with miniature blobs of black wax Will you do this for me Monsieur Duchemin I warn you it may cost you your life He took it his temper veering to the whimsical What is life he questioned A prelude perhaps an overture to that great drama Death Who knows Who cares She heard him in a stare You place no value on life Mademoiselle he said I have lived nearly thirty years in this world three years in the theatre of war seldom far from the trenches of one front or another I tell you I know death too well He shrugged and put the roll of paper away in a pocket You understand it must not be taken from you under any circumstance As a last resort it must be destroyed rather than yielded up It shall be he said quietly Is there anything more She shook her head thoughtfully knuckling her underlip How can I communicate with you in event of necessity after we get to New York she asked I shall stop for a week or two at the Hotel Knickerbocker If anything should happen with a swift glance of anxiety toward the motionless figure in the berth if anything should prevent my calling for it within a week after our arrival you will be good enough to deliver it to She caught herself up quickly the unuttered words trembling on her lip I will write down the address of the person to whom you will deliver it and slip it underneath the door between our rooms first making certain you are there to receive it if I do not ask you to return the thing before we land That shall be as you will When you have memorized the address you will destroy it Depend on that I think that is all Thank you Monsieur Duchemin and good night She extended her hand He saluted it punctiliously with fingertips and lips If you will put out the light mademoiselle it may aid me to get away unseen She nodded and offered him Thackeray s pistol Take this O I have another with me Lanyard accepted the weapon and when she had darkened the room opened the door slipped out and closed it behind him so noiselessly that the girl could not believe he was gone Nothing hindered his return to Stateroom twenty nine Fully two minutes after he had locked himself in he heard the distant clamour of the annunciator calling a steward to Stateroom thirty VI UNDER SUSPICION He sat for a long time on the edge of his berth elbow on knee chin in hand unstirring gaze fixed upon that little cylinder of white paper resting in the hollow of his palm in profoundest concentration pondering the problems it presented what it was what possession of it meant to Michael Lanyard what safe disposition to make of it pending welcome relief from this unsought and most unwelcome trust This last question alone bade fair to confound his utmost ingenuity As for what it was Lanyard was well satisfied that he now held the true focus of this conspiracy a secret of the first consequence far too momentous to the designs of England to be entrusted though couched in the most cryptic cipher ever mind of man devised even to cables or mails which England herself controlled Solely to prevent this communication from reaching America Lanyard believed Germany had sown mines broadcast in all the waters which the Assyrian must cross and had commissioned her U boats without fail and at whatever cost to sink the vessel if by any accident she won safely through the mine fields In the effort to steal this secret German spies had sailed on the Assyrian knowing well the double risk they ran of being shot like rats if found out of being drowned like neutrals if the ship went down through the efforts of their compatriots It was the zeal of Potsdam s agents seeking the bearer of this secret which had caused the rifling of Miss Brooke s luggage when she fell under suspicion thanks to her clandestine way of coming aboard and through the same agency young Thackeray had been all but murdered when suspicion for whatever reason shifted to him To insure safe transmission of this communication England had held the Assyrian idle in port day after day while her augmented patrols scoured the seas hunting down ruthlessly every submarine whose periscope dared peer above the surface and while her trawlers innumerable swept the channels clear of mines To prevent its theft Lieutenant Thackeray had invented the subterfuge of the wounded arm amid whose splints and bandages Lanyard never doubted the cylinder had been secreted Finally it was as a special agent deep in her country s confidence that this English girl had smuggled herself aboard at the last moment bringing no doubt this very cylinder to be transferred to the keeping of Lieutenant Thackeray or perhaps another confrere should she find reason to think herself suspected her trust endangered Nothing strange in that women had served their countries in such capacities before the secret archives of European chancellories are replete with their records Lanyard himself remembered many such women brilliant mondaines from many lands domiciled in that Paris of the so dead yesterday to serve by stealth their respective governments but never it was true a woman of the caste of Cecelia Brooke unless indeed this were an actress of surpassing talent gifted to hoodwink the most skeptical and least susceptible of men And yet Lanyard s train of thought faltered New doubt of the girl began to shadow his meditations Contradictory circumstances he had noted intruded uninvited to challenge overcredulous conclusions concerning her Would any secret agent worth her salt invite suspicion by making such a conspicuously furtive embarkation by such ostentatious avoidance of her fellow passengers by surrounding herself with an atmosphere of such palpable mystery Would such an one confess she had a secret to an utter stranger as she had to Lanyard that first night out Would she under any conceivable circumstances entrust to that same stranger that selfsame secret upon whose inviolate preservation so much depended And would she make love trysts on the decks by night Would a brother agent take her in his arms then reprove her with every symptom of vexation for her madness her insanity her nonsense that was like to drive me mad Thackeray s own words Vainly Lanyard cudgelled his wits for some plausible reading of this riddle Was this Brooke girl possibly of a sudden he sat bolt upright a Prussian agent infatuated with this young Englishman and by him beloved in spite of all that forbade their passion Did not this explanation reconcile every apparent inconsistency in her conduct even to the entrusting to a stranger of the stolen secret the purloined paper she dared not keep about her lest it be found in her possession Lanyard s eyes narrowed Visibly his features hardened If this surmise of his were any way justified in the outcome he promised Miss Cecelia Brooke an hour of most painful penitence Woman or not she need not look for mercy from him who must ever be merciless in his dealings with Ekstrom s crew To be made that one s tool The very thought was intolerable As for himself possession of this paper meant that pitfalls were digged for his every step If ever the British found cause to suspect him his certain portion would be to face a firing squad in dusk of early day If on the other hand these Prussian agents on board the Assyrian ever got wind of the fact that the cylinder was in his care his fate was apt to be a knife between his ribs the first time he was caught alone and with his back to the assassin Two courses then were open to him the most sensible and obvious to go straightway to the captain of the Assyrian report all that he knew or surmised and turn over the paper for safekeeping one alternative to hide the cylinder so absolutely that the most drastic search would overlook it yet so handily that he could rid himself of it at an instant s notice But the first course involved denunciation of the Brooke girl And what if she were innocent What if after all these doubts of her were the specious spawn of facts misinterpreted misconstrued What if she proved to be all she seemed Could he even though what he had warned her he might be the greatest rogue unhung be false to a trust reposed in him by such a woman As to that there was no question in his mind he would never betray her lacking irrefutable conviction that she was an employee of the Prussian spy system Then how to hide the paper Kneeling Lanyard drew from beneath the berth his bellows bag selected from its contents a black japanned tin case containing a rather elaborate though compact trench medicine kit the idle purchase of an empty afternoon in London Extracting from its fittings a small leather covered case he replaced the kit relocked and shoved the bag back beneath the berth Then standing over the hand basin he opened the leather covered case Its velvet lined compartments held a hypodermic syringe and needle and a glass phial of twenty four one thirtieth grain morphia tablets Uncorking the phial he shook out all the tablets replaced three then slid the paper cylinder into the tube it fitted precisely concealed by the label of the manufacturing chemist leaving room for six more tablets Lanyard inserted four on top of the cylinder moistening the lowermost slightly to make it stick recorked the phial and returned it to its compartment Next he dissolved three morphia tablets in a little water in the bottom of a glass filled the syringe with the strong solution fitted on the needle squirted most of the contents down the waste pipe and consigned the remaining tablets to the same innocuous fate Finally he replaced needle and syringe in the case let the glass which had held the solution stand without rinsing and put the open case upon the shelf above the basin A light tapping sounded on the panels of his door Well Who s there Your steward sir Captain Osborne s compliments an e d like to see you in is room as soon as convenient sir You may say I will come at once Nk you sir A summons to have been expected as a sequel to the surgeon s report after attending Lieutenant Thackeray none the less Lanyard had not expected it so soon Authority he reflected ran true to form afloat as well as ashore it was prompt enough when required to apply a pound or so of cure Surely the officers at least the captain must have been advised why this voyage was apt to prove exceptionally hazardous and surely in the light of such information it had been wiser to set armed watches on every deck by night rather than permit the lives of passengers to be imperilled through the possible activities of Prussian agents among them incogniti And now that he was reminded of it was not this perhaps but a device of the enemy s to decoy him from the comparative safety of his stateroom It was with a hand in his jacket pocket grasping Thackeray s automatic that he presently left the room The alleyway however was deserted except for his steward who as he appeared turned and led the way up to the boat deck Rounding the foot of the companionway Lanyard contrived a hasty glance down the port alleyway The door to Stateroom thirty was on the hook a light burned within Outside a guard was stationed a sailor with a cutlass the first application of the pound of cure At the heels of his guide he approached a door in the deck house devoted to officers accommodations beneath the bridge Here the steward knocked discreetly A heavy voice grumbling within was stilled for a moment then barked a sharp invitation to enter The steward turned the knob announced dispassionately Monseer Duchemin and stood aside Lanyard entered a well lighted room simply but comfortably furnished as the captain s office and sitting room sleeping quarters adjoined the head of a berth with a battered pillow showing through a door a foot or so ajar Four persons were present the notion entered Lanyard s head that a fifth possibly lurked in the room beyond spying eavesdropping not a bad scheme if Thackeray had an associate on board whose identity it was desirable to keep under cover The door closed gently behind him as he stood politely bowing conscious that the four faces turned his way were distinguished by a singular variety of expression Miss Cecelia Brooke was nearest him beside a chair from which she had evidently just risen her pretty young face rather pale and set a scared look in her candid eyes Beyond her the captain sat with his back to a desk a broad beamed vigorous body intensely masculine choleric by habit and just now in an extraordinarily grim temper his iron gray hair bristling from his pillow and his stout person visibly suffering the discomfort of wearing night clothes beneath his uniform coat and trousers Bending upon Lanyard the steel hard regard of small steel blue eyes he drummed the arms of his chair with thick and stubby fingers To one side standing was the third officer a mister Sherry a youngish man with a pleasant cast of countenance which temporarily wore a look rarely British of ingrained sense of duty at odds with much embarrassment Lastly mister Crane s lanky person was draped with its customary effect of carelessness on one end of the lounge seat He looked up nodded shortly but cheerfully to Lanyard then resumed a somewhat quizzical contemplation of the half smoked cigar which etiquette obliged him to neglect in the presence of a lady This is the gentleman Captain Osborne queried heavily of the girl Receiving a murmured affirmative he continued Good morning Monsieur Duchemin Thanks Miss Brooke we won t keep you up any longer to night He rose bowed stiffly as mister Sherry opened the door for the girl and when she was gone threw himself back into his chair with a force which made it enter a violent protest Sit down sir Daresay you know what we want of you It is not difficult to guess Lanyard admitted A sad business monsieur Sad the captain iterated in a tone of harsh sarcasm That s a mild name to give murder Even had it not been blurted violently at him that word was staggering The adventurer echoed it blankly You can t mean Lieutenant Thackeray Not yet though doctor says it may come to that the poor chap s in a bad way concussion So one feared But monsieur said murder Captain Osborne sat forward steely gaze mercilessly boring into Lanyard s eyes Monsieur Duchemin he said slowly Lieutenant Thackeray was not the only passenger to suffer through to night s villainy The other died instantly In God s name monsieur who Bartholomew mister Bartholomew A memory of that brisk little body s ruddy cheerful British personality flashed athwart the screen of memory Lanyard murmured Incredible Murdered the captain proceeded in Stateroom twenty eight Lieutenant Thackeray and he were friends shared the suite Apparently mister Bartholomew heard some unusual noise in thirty and left his berth to investigate He was struck down from behind as he approached the communicating door The murderer had got in by way of the sitting room twenty six mister Sherry added in an awed voice Frightful blow skull crushed like an eggshell There was a pause Crane thoughtfully relighted his cigar and wrapped his right cheek round it The captain glared glassily at Lanyard mister Sherry looked if possible more uncomfortable than ever Lanyard pondered aghast Ekstrom s work of a certainty This was his way the way he imposed upon his creatures Ekstrom ever a killer obsessed by the fallacious notion that dead men tell no tales And Bartholomew had been in this mess with Thackeray both of them operatives of the British Secret Service Miss Brooke has given her version of the attack on Lieutenant Thackeray the captain pursued Be good enough to let us have yours Succinctly Lanyard recounted the happenings between the moment when premonition of evil drew him from his stateroom and the moment when he returned thereto He was at pains however to omit all mention of the cylinder of paper that pending definite knowledge to the contrary was a sacred trust a matter of his honour solely the affair of the Brooke girl The captain squared himself toward Lanyard his face louring his jaw pugnacious How did you happen to be up and dressed at that late hour so ready to respond to this ah premonition of yours I sleep not well monsieur It was my intention to go on deck and endeavour to walk off my insomnia Captain Osborne commented with a snort Why did you leave Miss Brooke alone before she called the doctor At mademoiselle s request naturally You d been deuced gallant up to that time I presume it didn t occur to you that the young woman might need further protection Lanyard shrugged It did not occur to me to refuse her request monsieur Didn t it strike you as odd she should wish to be left alone with Lieutenant Thackeray It was not my affair monsieur It was her wish Excuse me cap n Crane sat up I d like to ask mister Lanyard a question But Lanyard had prepared himself against that and acknowledged the touch with a quiet smile and the hint of a bow Monsieur Crane U S Secret Service Crane informed him with a grin Velasco spotted you had seen you years ago in Paruss tipped me off So one inferred And these gentlemen Lanyard indicated the captain and third officer I wised them up had to when this happened Naturally monsieur Proceed I only wanted to ask if you noticed anything to make you think perhaps there was an understanding between Miss Brooke and the lieutenant Why should I I ain t curious why you should What I want to know is did you No monsieur Lanyard lied blandly The little lady didn t seem to take on more n she naturally would if the lieutenant d been a stranger eh How to judge when one has never seen mademoiselle distressed on behalf of another Crane abandoned his effort resuming contemplation of his cigar Now we come to the point Monsieur Lanyard or whatever your name is I have found Duchemin very agreeable monsieur le capitaine I daresay Captain Osborne sneered He hesitated glowering in the difficulty of thinking See here Monsieur Duchemin since you prefer that style I m not going to beat about the bush with you I m a plain man plain spoken They tell me you reformed I don t know anything about that It s my conviction once a thief always a thief I may be wrong Right or wrong monsieur might easily be less offensive The captain s dark countenance became still more darkly congested Implacable prejudice glinted in his small eyes Nor was his temper softened by the effrontery of this offender in giving back look for look with a calm poise that overshadowed his arrogance of an honest law abiding man He made a vague gesture of impatience The point is he said this crime was accompanied by robbery Am I to understand I am accused Nobody is accused Crane cut in hastily You have found no clues Nary clue What I want to say to you Monsieur Duchemin is this the stolen property has got to be recovered before this ship makes her dock in New York It means the loss of my command if it isn t It means more than that according to my information it means a disastrous calamity to the Allied cause And you re a Frenchman Monsieur Duchemin And a thief Monsieur le capitaine must not forget his pet conviction As to that a man can t always be particular about the tools he employs I believe the old saying set a thief to catch a thief holds good Do I understand Lanyard suggested sweetly you are about to honour me by utilizing my reputed talents by commissioning a thief to catch this thief of to night Precisely You know more of this matter than any of us here You were at hand grips with the murderer and let him get away To my deep regret But I have told you how that happened Seems a bit strange you made no real effort to find out what the scoundrel looked like It was dark in that alleyway monsieur The captain made an inarticulate noise apparently meant to convey an effect of ironic incredulity More intelligible comment was interrupted by a ring of the telephone He swung around clapped receiver to ear snapped an impatient Well and listened with evident exasperation Lanyard s eyes narrowed This business of telephoning was conceivably well timed not improbably the captain was receiving the report of somebody who had been sent to search Stateroom twenty nine in Lanyard s absence He wondered and wondering glanced at Crane to find that gentleman watching him with a whimsical glimmer which he was quick to extinguish when the captain said curtly Very good mister Warde and turned back from the telephone his manner more than ever truculent mister Lanyard he said Monsieur Duchemin that is a valuable paper has been stolen an exceedingly valuable document I don t know which carried it Lieutenant Thackeray or mister Bartholomew But I do know such a paper was in their possession And to the best of my knowledge we three were the only ones on board that did know it And it has disappeared Now sir you may or may not be deeper in this affair than you have admitted If you are I d advise you to own up Monsieur le capitaine implies my complicity in this dastardly crime Osborne shook his head doggedly I imply nothing I only say this if you know anything you haven t told us my advice is to make a clean breast of it I have nothing to tell you monsieur beyond the fact that I find you your tone your manner and your choice of words intolerably insolent Then you know nothing Monsieur Lanyard cried sharply Very good the captain persisted I ll take your word for it and give you till we take on our pilot to find the real criminal and make him give up that paper And if I fail Not a soul on board leaves the Assyrian till the murderer and thief are found if they are not one But that is a general threat whereas monsieur has honoured me by making this a personal matter What punishment have you prepared for me specifically if I fail to accomplish this task which baffles your shrewdness I ll at least inform the port authorities in New York tell them who you are and have you barred out of the country I want to say Lanyard Crane interposed this isn t my notion of how to deal with you or in any way by my advice Thank you monsieur the adventurer replied icily without removing his attention from the captain What else Captain Osborne That is all I have to say to you to night sir Good night But I have something more to say to you monsieur le capitaine First I desire to give over to you this article which it will doubtless please you to consider stolen property Lanyard placed the automatic pistol on the desk One of Lieutenant Thackeray s he explained at Miss Brooke s suggestion I borrowed it as a life preserver in event of another brush with this homicidal maniac She told us about that Osborne said heavily fumbling with the weapon What else sir Only this monsieur le capitaine I shall use my best endeavour to uncover the author of these crimes If I succeed be sure I shall denounce him If I succeed only in securing this valuable paper you speak of be equally sure you will never see it for it shall leave my hands only to pass into those which I consider entirely trustworthy The devil Captain Osborne leaped from his chair quaking with fury You dare accuse me of disloyalty Now you mention it Lanyard cocked his head to one side with a maddening effect of deliberation No he concluded no I wouldn t accuse you of intentional treason monsieur for that would involve an imputation of intelligence He opened the door and nodded pleasantly to Crane and the third officer Good night gentlemen he said silkily Oh and you too Captain Osborne good night I m sure VII IN STATEROOM twenty nine In spite of his own anger something far from being either assumed or inconsiderable Lanyard was fain to pause a few paces from the deck house and laugh quietly at a vast and incoherent booming which was resounding in the room he had just quitted Captain Osborne trying to do justice to the emotions inspired in his virtuous bosom by the cheek of this damned gaol bird But suddenly reminded of the grim reason for all this wretched brawling Lanyard shrugged off his amusement Beneath his very feet almost a man lay dead another perhaps dying while the beast who had wrought that devilishness remained at large He comprehended in a wondering regard that wide star blazoned arch of skies that broad dark restful mystery of waters that still sweet world of peace through which the Assyrian forged muttering contentedly at her toil while Murder with foul hands and slavering chops skulked somewhere in the darkened fabric of her somewhere beyond that black mouth of the deck port yawning at Lanyard s elbow From that same portal a man came abruptly but quietly saw Lanyard standing there gave him a staring look and grudging nod and strode forward to the captain s quarters mister Warde the first officer Lanyard recollected himself and went below Still the sailor guarded the door in that port alleyway but now it stood wide and Cecelia Brooke was on its threshold conversing guardedly with the surgeon Even as Lanyard caught sight of them the latter bowed and turned aft while the girl retreated and refastened the door on its hook Thus reminded of Crane s shrewd questions Lanyard was speculating rather foggily concerning the reason therefor as he turned down the passage to his own quarters What had the American noticed or been told to make him surmise covert sympathy between the girl and the lieutenant He caught himself yawning Drowsiness buzzed in his brain He had an incoherent feeling that he would now sleep long and heavily Entering his stateroom he put a shoulder against the door pushing it to as he fumbled for the switch The circumstance that the lights were no longer burning as he had left them failed to impress him as noteworthy in view of his belief that by the captain s orders mister Warde had been ransacking his effects in his absence But when no more than a click responded to a turn of the switch the room remaining quite dark Lanyard uttered an imprecation abruptly very wide awake indeed Before he could move he stiffened to positive immobility the cool hard nose of a pistol had come into contact with his skull just behind the ear Simultaneously a softly modulated voice advised him in purest German Be quite still Herr Lanyard and hold up your hands so Also see that you utter no sound till I give you leave Karl the handkerchief Lanyard stood motionless hands well elevated while a heavy silk blindfold was whipped over his eyes and knotted tight at the back of his head Now your paws Herr Lone Wolf put them together behind your back prudently making no attempt to reach a pocket Obediently Lanyard permitted his wrists to be caught together with a second silk handkerchief He could feel a slight sensation of heat upon his hands and guessed that this was caused by the light of a flash lamp held close to the flesh None the less he took the chance of clenching his fists and tensing the muscles of his wrists Tightly Karl The bonds were made painfully fast Still it did not seem to occur to his captors to oblige their prisoner to open his hands and relax his wrists Lanyard perceived a glimmer of hope in this oversight the enemy was normally stupid Now the lights again After a little wait during which he could hear the bulbs being pressed back into their sockets the switch clicked once more And now swine dog the pistol tapped his skull significantly if you value your life speak and speak quickly Where is that document Document Lanyard repeated in a tone of wonder Unless you are eager to explore the hereafter tell us where we may find it without delay Upon my word I don t know what you re talking about You lie the German snapped Face about Somebody grasped his shoulders roughly and swung him round to the light the nose of the pistol shifting to press against his abdomen Search him Karl Unseen hands investigated his pockets cunningly As they finished the man who answered to the name of Karl became articulate for the first time following a grunt of disappointment Nothing he has it not upon him Look more thoroughly Did you think him idiot enough to carry it where you d find it at the first dip Imbecile For the purpose of this second search Lanyard s garments were ripped open and the enemy made sure that he carried nothing next his skin more incriminating than a money belt which was forcibly removed His shoes see to his shoes the first speaker insisted irritably Sit down Lanyard A petulant push sent the adventurer reeling across the cabin to fall upon the lounge seat beneath the port With some effort he assumed a sitting position while Karl kneeling hastily unlaced and tore off his shoes and socks Nothing captain was the report Damnation Continue to search his luggage Leave nothing unexamined In particular look into every hole and corner where none but a fool would attempt to hide anything This fine gentleman imagines we value his intelligence too highly to believe he would leave the paper in plain sight To an accompaniment of sounds indicating that Karl was obeying his superior this last resumed in a tone of lofty contempt How is it you have abandoned the habit of going armed Herr Lone Wolf That is not like you Is it that you grow unwary through drug using But that matters nothing We have more important business to speak over you and I You will be very very docile and answer promptly also in a low voice if you would avoid getting hurt Do you understand Perfectly Lanyard replied furtively working at the bonds on his wrists Good We speak together like good friends yes Naturally said Lanyard It is so conducive to chumminess to be caressed with an automatic pistol you ve no idea Oblige by speaking German Our ears are sick with all this bastard English Also more quietly speak Do not put me to the regrettable necessity of shooting you How regrettable You didn t stick at braining those others Hardly the same thing You are not like those English swine You are French and Germany has no hatred for France but only pity that it so fatuously opposes manifest destiny In truth you are not even French but a great thief and criminals have no patriotism nor loyalty to any State but their own the state of moral turpitude The speaker interrupted himself to relish his wit with a thick chuckle And Lanyard s jaws ached with the strain of self control He continued to pluck at the folds of silk while concentrating in effort to memorise the voice which he failed utterly to place Undoubtedly this animal was a shipboard acquaintance one who knew him well but those detestable German gutturals disguised his accents quite beyond identification For all that you are not wise so to try my patience I permit you five minutes by my watch in which to make up your mind to surrender that document How often must I tell you Lanyard enquired all this talk of documents is Greek to me Then you have five minutes to brush up your classical education and translate into terms suited to your intelligence I will have that document from you or in four more minutes shoot you dead To this Lanyard said nothing But his patient attentions to the handkerchief round his wrists were beginning perceptibly to be rewarded Moreover Herr Lanyard you will do yourself a very good turn by confessing entirely aside from saving your life How is that Providing you persuade me of your good faith I am empowered to offer you employment in our service Lanyard s breath passed hardly through a throat swollen with rage chagrin and hatred all hopelessly impotent But he succeeded in preserving an unruffled countenance as his captor s next words demonstrated You are surprised yes You are thinking it over Take your time you have three minutes more Or perhaps you are sulky resenting that our cleverness has found you out Be reasonable my good man Think you cannot be insensible to the honour my offer does you What do you want of me First that paper thereafter to use your surpassing talents to the glory of God and Fatherland In addition you will be greatly rewarded Now you do begin to interest me Lanyard said coolly Surely he could contrive some way to slay this beast with his naked hands He must play for time How rewarded As I say with a place in the Prussian Secret Service its protection freedom to ply your trade unhindered in America even countenanced till that country becomes a German province under German laws But do I hear you offer this to a Frenchman Undeceive yourself Men of all nations to day recognising that the star of Germany is in the ascendant that soon all nations will be German are hastening to make their peace beforehand by rendering Germany good service Something in that perhaps Lanyard admitted thoughtfully Think well my friend Yes Karl The voice of the other spy responded sullenly Nothing absolutely nothing Two minutes Herr Lanyard Of a sudden Lanyard s face was violently distorted in a grimace of terror He lurched his shoulders forward openly struggling with his bonds But good God he protested in a voice of terror you can t possibly be so unreasonable I tell you I haven t got your damned paper A loop of the handkerchief slipped over one hand Be still Cease your struggles And not so loud my friend The peremptory voice dropped into mockery as Lanyard pale and exhausted sat back trembling and a second loop of silk dropped over the other hand So you begin to appreciate that we mean business yes One minute and thirty seconds Have mercy the adventurer whined desperately and licked his lips as if he found them dry with fear Now both hands were all but wholly free True he remained blindfolded and covered by a deadly weapon Give me a chance I ll do anything you wish But I can t give you what I haven t got Be silent Here Karl There was a sound of unintelligible murmuring as the two spies conferred together Lanyard writhed in apparent extremity of terror His hands were free He sought hopelessly for inspiration What to do without arms Be grateful to Karl He urges that perhaps you know nothing of the document Don t you think I d tell if I did know Then you have one minute no forty seconds in which to pledge yourself to the Prussian Secret Service You want me to swear Certainly Then hear me said Lanyard earnestly You damned canaille And in one movement he tore the bandage from his eyes and launched himself head foremost at the man who stood over him He caught part of an oath drowned out by the splitting report of a pistol that went off within an inch of his ear Then his head took the man full in the belly and both went sprawling to the deck Lanyard fighting like a maniac Sheer luck had guided clawing fingers to the right wrist of his antagonist round which they shut like jaws of a trap At the same time he wrenched the other s arm high above his head Momentarily expecting the shock of a bullet from the pistol of the second spy he found time to wonder that it was so long deferred and even in the fury of his struggles out of the corner of one eye caught a fugitive glimpse of a tallish man masked standing back to the forward partition in a pose of singular indecision pistol poised in his grasp Then the efforts of his immediate adversary threw him into a position in which he was unable to see the other Of a sudden the stateroom was filled with the thunder of an automatic its seven cartridges discharged in one brisk rippling crash It was as if a white hot iron had been laid across Lanyard s shoulder Beneath him the man started convulsively with such force as almost to throw him off bodily then relaxed altogether and lay limp and still pinning one of Lanyard s arms under him Its visor displaced the face of Baron von Harden was revealed features distorted eyes glaring a frozen mask of hate and terror His arm free the adventurer rolled away from the corpse in time to see the open window port blocked by the body of the other spy Gathering himself together he snatched up the pistol that dropped from the inert grasp of the dead man and levelled it at the port But now that space was empty He rose and paused for an instant his glance instinctively seeking the ledge above the hand basin The hypodermic outfit was there but minus the phial In the alleyway rose a confusion of running feet and shouting tongues A heavy banging rang on the door to Stateroom twenty nine Crane s nasal accents called upon Lanyard to open VIII OFF NANTUCKET 
7383_95441_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Upon the authors of that commotion Lanyard wasted no consideration whatever 
7383_95441_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Let them knock and clamour he had more urgent work in hand and knew too well the penalty were he stupid enough to unbolt to them 
none	none	Their bodies would dam the doorway hopelessly insistent hands would hinder him innumerable importunate enquiries would be dinned at him all immaterial in contrast with this emergency a catechism one would need an hour to satisfy 
7383_95441_000004_000003	train-clean-360	And all attempts would be futile to make them understand that while they plagued him with futile questions a murderer and spy and thief was making good his escape being afforded ample opportunity to slough all traces of his recent work and resume unchallenged his place among them 
7383_95441_000005_000000	train-clean-360	No if by any freak of good fortune any exertion of wit or daring that one were to be apprehended it must be within the next few minutes it could only be through immediate pursuit 
none	none	Nor did the adventurer waste time debating the better course 
7383_95441_000006_000001	train-clean-360	With him whose ways of life were ceaselessly beset by instant and mortal perils each with its especial and imperative demand upon his readiness and ingenuity action must ever press so hard upon the heels of thought as to make the two seem one 
7383_95441_000007_000000	train-clean-360	For that matter the whole transaction had been characterised by almost unbelievable rapidity 
none	none	And that square opening of the window port was hardly vacant when Lanyard sprang to his feet the fugitive had barely time to find his own upon the outer deck before Lanyard leaped after him the first thumps upon the panels of his door were still echoing when he thrust head and shoulders out of the port and began to pump the automatic at a shadow fleeing aft upon that narrow breadth of planking between rail and wall 
7383_95441_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Then at the third shot the automatic jammed upon a discharged shell 
7383_95441_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Exasperated the adventurer cast the weapon from him shrugged hastily out of his unfastened coat and waistcoat hitched tight his belt and clambered through the port 
7383_95441_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Dropping to the deck he turned in time to see the fugitive dart round the shoulder of the superstructure 
7383_95441_000011_000000	train-clean-360	As Lanyard gained the after rail of the promenade deck a man standing on the boat deck at the head of the companion ladder greeted him with pistol fire 
7383_95441_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He dodged back untouched and instantaneously devised a stratagem to cope with this untoward development 
none	none	Overhead at the side a lifeboat hung on its davits ready for emergency launching the gap in the rail which it filled when normally swung inboard spanned only by a length of line 
7383_95441_000012_000001	train-clean-360	And the darkness in the shadow of the boat was dense an excellent screen 
none	none	Climbing upon the rail Lanyard grasped the edge of the deck overhead and drew himself up undetected by his quarry whom he espied still holding the head of the companion ladder hidden from the bridge by the after deck house standing ready to shoot Lanyard should he attempt to renew the pursuit by that approach 
7383_95441_000014_000000	train-clean-360	At the same time Karl seemed mysteriously occupied with some object or objects in whose manipulation he was hampered to a degree by the necessity under which he laboured of holding his pistol ready and dividing his attention 
7383_95441_000015_000000	train-clean-360	A man of good stature broad at the shoulders slender at the hips he poised himself with athletic grace the lower part of his face masked by what Lanyard took to be a dark silk handkerchief 
none	none	Lanyard heard him swearing in German 
7383_95441_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Then a brisk little spray of sparks jetted from the flint and steel of a patent cigar lighter in the hands of the spy 
none	none	And as Lanyard rose from his knees after ducking beneath the line a stream of fatter sparks spat from the end of a fuse 
7383_95441_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The man leaned over the rail and cast a small black object to which the sputtering fuse was attached down to the main deck 
7383_95441_000019_000000	train-clean-360	As it struck midway between superstructure and stern it burst into brilliant flame releasing upon the night an electric blue glare that must have been visible from any point within the compass of the horizon 
7383_95441_000020_000000	train-clean-360	A yell of profane remonstrance saluted the light and throughout the brief passage that followed Lanyard was conscious that pistols and rifles on the after deck below were making him and his antagonist their targets 
7383_95441_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Before the German could face about Lanyard moving almost noiselessly in his bare feet had covered more than half the intervening space 
none	none	In another breath he might have had the fellow at a disadvantage 
7383_95441_000021_000002	train-clean-360	But the distance was too great 
7383_95441_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Twice the automatic blazed in his face as he closed in the bullets clearing narrowly or else he fancied that their deadly cold breath fanned his cheek 
7383_95441_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Then the spy s weapon in turn went out of action 
7383_95441_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Half blinded Lanyard clipped the man round the body and hugged him tight exerting all his skill and strength to effect a throw 
7383_95441_000023_000000	train-clean-360	That effort failed his onslaught was met with address and ability that all but matched his own 
none	none	The animal he embraced had muscles like tempered springs and the cunning and fury of a wild beast in a trap 
7383_95441_000023_000002	train-clean-360	For a moment Lanyard was able to accomplish no more than to smother resistance in a rib crushing embrace no sooner did he relax it than all attempts to shift his hold were anticipated and met half way forcing him back upon the defensive 
7383_95441_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Yet he was given little chance to prove himself the master 
7383_95441_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The first phase of the struggle was still in contest when the rear door of the smoking room opened and a man stepped out paused summed up the situation in a glance seized Lanyard from behind 
none	none	The adventurer felt his arms grasped by hands whose strength seemed little short of superhuman and wrenched back so violently that his very bones cracked Fairly lifted from his feet he was held as helpless as an infant kicking in the arms of its nurse Released the other spy stepped back and swung his left fist viciously to Lanyard s jaw 
7383_95441_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Something in the brain of the adventurer seemed to let go his head dropped weakly to one side 
7383_95441_000026_000002	train-clean-360	The man who had struck him said quietly Loose the fool Ed and followed as Lanyard reeled away striking him repeatedly 
none	none	For a giddy moment Lanyard was darkly conscious as one dreams an evil dream of blows raining mercilessly about his head and body blows that drove him back athwartships toward a fate dark and terrible a great void of blackness 
7383_95441_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He felt unutterably weary and was weakened by a sensation of nausea 
7383_95441_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Beneath him his knees buckled 
7383_95441_000027_000003	train-clean-360	There fell one final blow ruthless as the wrath of God 
7383_95441_000028_000000	train-clean-360	He was falling backward into nothingness into an everlasting gulf of night that yawned for him 
7383_95441_000029_000000	train-clean-360	As he shot under the guard rope and into space between the edge of the deck and the keel of the lifeboat the spy rounded smartly on a heel and darted to the smoking room door 
7383_95441_000029_000001	train-clean-360	His confederate was in the act of stepping across the raised threshold 
7383_95441_000029_000002	train-clean-360	He followed closed the door 
7383_95441_000030_000000	train-clean-360	The first officer charging aft from the bridge rounded the deck house and pulled up with a grunt of surprise to find the deck completely deserted 
7383_95441_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The shock of icy immersion reanimated Lanyard 
7383_95441_000032_000000	train-clean-360	He felt himself plunging headlong down down and down to inky depths unguessable 
7383_95441_000032_000001	train-clean-360	The sheer habit of an accustomed swimmer alone bade him hold his breath 
7383_95441_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Then came a pause he was no more descending for a time of indeterminate duration an age of anguish he seemed to float without motion suspended in frigid purgatory 
none	none	Against his ribs something hammered like a racing engine In his ears sounded a vast roaring the deafening voices of a thousand waterfalls 
7383_95441_000033_000003	train-clean-360	His head felt swollen and enormous on the point of bursting wide 
none	none	Without warning expelled from those depths he shot full half length out of water and fell back into the milky welter of the Assyrian s wake 
7383_95441_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Instinctively he kept afloat with feeble strokes 
7383_95441_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The cold was bitter as sharp as the teeth of death but his head was now clear he was able to appreciate what had befallen him 
none	none	Already the Assyrian forging onward unchecked had left him well astern her progress distinctly disclosed by that infernal bluish glare spouting from her after deck 
7383_95441_000038_000000	train-clean-360	She seemed absurdly small 
7383_95441_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Incredulity infected Lanyard s mind 
none	none	Nothing so tiny so insignificant so make believe as that silhouette of a ship could conceivably be that great liner the Assyrian Temporarily a burning pain in his left shoulder drove all other considerations out of mind The salt water was beginning to smart in the raw superficial wound made by that assassin s bullet back there in the stateroom long ago 
7383_95441_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Then the cold began to bite into his marrow and he struggled manfully to swim taking long slow strokes at first comparatively powerful by insensible degrees losing force 
7383_95441_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Just why he took this trouble he did not know for some dim reason it seemed desirable to live as long as possible 
7383_95441_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Withal he was aware he could not live 
none	none	Whether careless or utterly ignorant of his fate the Assyrian was trudging on and on leaving him ever farther astern lost beyond rescue in that weird bleak waste 
7383_95441_000041_000003	train-clean-360	Even were an alarm to be given were she to stop now and put out a boat it would find him if it found him at all too late 
7383_95441_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The cold was killing 
7383_95441_000043_000000	train-clean-360	He felt very sleepy 
7383_95441_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Drowsily he apprehended the beginning of the end His senses growing numb with cold presently must cease to function altogether 
7383_95441_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Then he would forget and nothing would matter any more 
7383_95441_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Yet the will to live persisted amazingly 
7383_95441_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Had Lanyard wished it he could not have ceased to swim at least to keep afloat 
7383_95441_000044_000002	train-clean-360	Vaguely he wondered how people ever managed to commit suicide by drowning it seemed to pass human power to resist that buoyancy which sustained one to let go let one s self go down 
7383_95441_000044_000003	train-clean-360	Impossible to conceive how that was ever done 
none	none	Why should he care to go on living 
7383_95441_000046_000000	train-clean-360	No reading that riddle 
7383_95441_000047_000000	train-clean-360	On obscure impulse he gave up swimming turned upon his back floated face to the sky derelict resigning himself to the cradling arms of the sea The gradual slow rocking of the swells soothed his passion like a kindly opiate 
none	none	The cold no more irked him but seemed somehow strangely anodynous Imperturbably he envisaged death without fear without welcome 
7383_95441_000047_000002	train-clean-360	What must be must 
7383_95441_000048_000000	train-clean-360	For all that life clutched at him with jealous hands 
none	none	More than ever sleepy before he slept that last long sleep he must somehow solve this enigma learn the reason why life continued so to allure his failing senses 
7383_95441_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Athwart the drab texture of consciousness wild fancies played like heat lightning in a still midsummer night 
7383_95441_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Death s countenance was kind 
7383_95441_000051_000000	train-clean-360	That wide field of stars drooping low and lifting away with rhythmic motion would sometime dip swiftly down to the very sea itself and swinging back take with it his soul to some remote bourne 
none	none	The deeps were yielding up their mysteries Past him a huge pale monster swept at furious pace hissing grimly as it passed like some spectral Nemesis pursuing the Assyrian Indifferently he speculated concerning the reality of this phenomenon 
7383_95441_000054_000000	train-clean-360	The heave of a swell enabled him to glance incuriously after the steamship She seemed smaller less genuine than ever a shadow shape that boasted visibility solely through that unearthly light on her after deck 
none	none	Even that now had waned to a mere glimmer the flicker of a candle lost in the immensities of that night bound world of empty sky and empty ocean 
7383_95441_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Even as he that had been named Michael Lanyard was a lost light a tiny flame that guttered toward its swift extinction 
7383_95441_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Why live when one might die and dying find endless rest 
none	none	Like a blazing thunderbolt one word rent the slumbrous web of sentience Ekstrom Galvanised by the flood of hatred unpent by the syllables of that name Lanyard began again to swim flailing the water with frantic arms as if to win somewhither by the very violence of his efforts 
7383_95441_000058_000000	train-clean-360	This the one cogent reason why he must not could not die 
7383_95441_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Unjust to require him to give up life while that one lived 
none	none	Unfair It must not be 
7383_95441_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Across the sea rolled a dull brutish detonation 
none	none	The swimmer swung high on the bosom of a great swell saw a vast sheet of fire raving heavenward from the Assyrian 
7383_95441_000061_000000	train-clean-360	It vanished instantly 
7383_95441_000062_000000	train-clean-360	When his dazzled vision cleared he could see no more of the ship 
7383_95441_000062_000001	train-clean-360	He imagined a faint wild rumour of panic voices conjured up scenes of horror indescribable as that great fabric sank almost instantaneously as if some gigantic hand plucked her under 
7383_95441_000063_000000	train-clean-360	What had happened 
none	none	Had the accomplices of the dead Baron von Harden set off an infernal machine aboard the vessel In the name of reason why 
7383_95441_000063_000003	train-clean-360	They had got what they sought that accursed document whatever it was that page torn from the Book of Doom 
none	none	Then why And to what end had they exploded that light bomb on the after deck To make the Assyrian a glaring target in the night what else 
7383_95441_000065_000001	train-clean-360	A target for what 
none	none	Of a sudden all rational mental processes were erased from Lanyard s consciousness 
7383_95441_000066_000001	train-clean-360	A wave of pure fear flooded him body mind and soul 
none	none	He began to struggle like a maniac fighting the waters that hindered his flight from some hideous thing that was lifting up from the ocean s ooze to drag him down 
7383_95441_000067_000000	train-clean-360	He heard a voice screaming thinly and knew it was his own 
7383_95441_000068_000000	train-clean-360	The impossible was happening to him out there alone and helpless on the face of the waters 
7383_95441_000068_000001	train-clean-360	A shape of horror was rising out of the deep to engorge him 
7383_95441_000068_000002	train-clean-360	He could feel distinctly the slow irresistible heave of its bulk beneath him 
7383_95441_000068_000003	train-clean-360	His feet touched and slipped upon its horrible sleek flanks 
7383_95441_000069_000000	train-clean-360	His most desperate efforts were all unavailing 
7383_95441_000069_000001	train-clean-360	He could not escape 
7383_95441_000069_000002	train-clean-360	The thing came up too rapidly 
7383_95441_000069_000003	train-clean-360	Following that first mad thrill of contact with it underfoot he was lifted swiftly and irresistibly into the air 
7383_95441_000069_000004	train-clean-360	Almost instantly he was floundering in knee deep waters that parted cascading away on either hand 
none	none	Then elevated well above the sea he slid and fell prone upon a slimy wet surface 
7383_95441_000070_000000	train-clean-360	His clawing hands clutched something solid and substantial an upright bar of metal 
7383_95441_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Incredulously Lanyard pawed the body of the monster beneath him 
7383_95441_000071_000001	train-clean-360	His hands passed over a riveted joint of metal plates 
7383_95441_000071_000002	train-clean-360	Looking up he made out the truncated cone of a conning tower with its antennae like periscope tubes stencilled black upon the soft purple of the star strewn sky 
7383_95441_000072_000000	train-clean-360	Slowly the truth came home a submarine had risen beneath him 
7383_95441_000072_000001	train-clean-360	He lay upon its after deck grasping a stanchion that supported the small raised bridge round the conning tower 
none	none	He sobbed a little in sheer hysteric gratitude that this miracle had been vouchsafed unto him that he had thus been spared to live on against his hour with Ekstrom 
7383_95441_000074_000000	train-clean-360	But when he sought to drag himself up to the bridge he could not he was too weak and faint 
7383_95441_000074_000001	train-clean-360	Ceasing to struggle he rested in half stupour panting 
7383_95441_000075_000000	train-clean-360	With a harsh clang a hatch was thrown back 
7383_95441_000075_000001	train-clean-360	Rousing Lanyard saw several figures emerge from the conning tower 
7383_95441_000075_000002	train-clean-360	Men uncouthly clothed in shapeless shiny leather garments straddled and stretched above him filling their lungs with the sweet air 
7383_95441_000075_000003	train-clean-360	He tried to call to them but evoked a mere rattle from his throat 
none	none	Two came to the edge of the bridge and stood immediately over him fixing binoculars to their eyes their voices quite audible 
7383_95441_000077_000000	train-clean-360	A pang of despair shot through Lanyard when he heard them conferring together in the German tongue 
7383_95441_000078_000000	train-clean-360	Death then was but a little delayed 
7383_95441_000079_000000	train-clean-360	Thereafter he lay in dumb apathy save that he shivered and his teeth chattered uncontrollably 
7383_95441_000080_000000	train-clean-360	Through the torpor that rested like a black cloud upon his senses he caught broken phrases snatches of sentences 
none	none	sinking fast struck square amidships broke her back trouble with her boats There goes one over fools jumping overboard like cattle
7383_95441_000107_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that 
none	none	rocket Do the swine want us to shell their boats Why not They re asking for it One of the officers lowered his glasses and barked a series of sharp commands 
7383_95441_000086_000001	train-clean-360	The crew on deck leaped to attention 
7383_95441_000086_000002	train-clean-360	One leaned over the conning tower hatch and shouted to his mates below 
7383_95441_000086_000003	train-clean-360	A hatch forward of the tower opened and a quick firing gun on a disappearing carriage swung smoothly and silently up from its lair 
none	none	The other officer looking down started violently Verdammt 
7383_95441_000088_000001	train-clean-360	What s this 
7383_95441_000089_000000	train-clean-360	The first rejoined him 
none	none	Impossible Impossible or not a man or a cadaver
7383_95441_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Have him up and see 
none	none	By order two of the crew dragged Lanyard up to the bridge supporting him by main strength while the officers examined him
7383_95441_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 At the last gasp but alive one announced 
7383_95441_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 How the devil did he get out here 
none	none	From the Assyrian
7383_95441_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Impossible for any man to swim this far since our torpedo struck 
7383_95441_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Then he must have gone overboard before it struck or was thrown 
none	none	A cry of alarm from the group about the gun awaiting final orders to open fire upon the Assyrian s boats interrupted the conference The officers swung away in haste
7383_95441_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 Hell s fury 
7383_95441_000099_000001	train-clean-360	what s that searchlight 
7383_95441_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 A Yankee destroyer in all probability the one we dodged yesterday afternoon 
none	none	She ll find us yet if we don t submerge 
7383_95441_000101_000001	train-clean-360	Forward there house that gun And get below quickly 
7383_95441_000102_000000	train-clean-360	During a moment of apparent confusion one of the men sustaining Lanyard caught the attention of an officer 
7383_95441_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 What shall we do with this fellow sir he enquired 
none	none	Leave him here to sink or swim as we go down snapped the officer and be damned to him With a supreme effort the adventurer sank his fingers deep into the arms of the two men Wait he gasped faintly in German
7383_95441_000106_000001	train-clean-360	 On the Emperor s service 
none	none	What s that 
7383_95441_000107_000001	train-clean-360	The officer turned back sharply 
7383_95441_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 Imperial Secret Service Lanyard faltered Personal Division Wilhelmstrasse Number twenty seven 
7383_95441_000109_000000	train-clean-360	A brilliant glare settled suddenly upon the deck of the submarine and was welcomed by a panicky gust of oaths 
7383_95441_000109_000001	train-clean-360	One officer had already popped through the conning tower hatch followed by several of the crew 
none	none	There remained only those supporting Lanyard and the second officer
7383_95441_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 Take him below the latter ordered 
7383_95441_000110_000001	train-clean-360	 He may be telling the truth 
7383_95441_000110_000002	train-clean-360	If not 
7383_95441_000111_000000	train-clean-360	In the distance a gun boomed 
7383_95441_000111_000001	train-clean-360	A shell shrieked over the submarine and dropped into the sea not a hundred yards to starboard 
7383_95441_000111_000002	train-clean-360	The men rushed Lanyard toward the conning tower 
7383_95441_000111_000003	train-clean-360	He tried feebly to help them 
none	none	In that effort consciousness was altogether blotted out IX SUB SEA When he opened his eyes again he was resting after a fashion naked between harsh damp blankets in a narrow low ceiled bunk inches too short for one of his stature After an experimental squirm or two he lay very still his back and all his limbs were stiff and sore his bullet seared shoulder burned intolerably beneath a rudely applied first aid dressing and he was breathing heavily long labouring inhalations of an atmosphere sickeningly dank close and foul with unspeakable stenches for which the fumes of sulphuric acid with a rank reek of petroleum and lubricating oils formed but a modest and retiring background Also his head felt very thick and dull He found it extremely difficult to think and for some time indeed was quite unable to think to any purpose His very eyes ached in their sockets In the ceiling glowed an electric bulb dimly illuminating a cubicle barely big enough to accommodate the bunk a dresser and a small desk with a folding seat The inner wall was a slightly concave surface of steel plates whose seams oozed moisture In the opposite wall was a sliding door open beyond which ran a narrow alleyway floored with metal grating Everything in sight was enamelled with white paint and clammy with the sweat of that foetid air Over all an unnatural hush brooded now and again accentuated by a rumble of distant voices and gusts of vacant laughter once or twice by a curious popping For a long time he heard nothing else whatever The effect was singularly disquieting and did its bit to quicken torpid senses to grasp his plight Sluggishly enough Lanyard pieced together fragments of lurid memories reconstructing the sequence of last night s events scene by scene to the moment of his rescue by the U boat So it appeared he was aboard a German submersible virtually a prisoner though posing as an agent of the Personal Intelligence Department of the German Secret Service To that inspiration of failing consciousness he owed his life or such of its span as now remained to him a term whose duration could only be defined by his ability to carry off the imposture pending problematic opportunity to escape And assuming that this last were ever offered him there was no present possibility of guessing how long it might not be deferred Its butcher s mission successfully accomplished the U boat was not improbably even now en route for Heligoland beginning a transatlantic cruise of weeks that might never end save in a nameless grave at the bottom of the Four Seas Only the matter of impersonation failed to embarrass in prospect A natural linguist Lanyard s three years within the German lines had put a rare finish upon his mastery of German More than this he was well versed in the workings of the Prussian spy system As doctor Paul Rodiek Wilhelmstrasse Agent Number twenty seven he was safe as long as he found no acquaintance of that gentleman in the complement of the submarine for largely upon information furnished by Lanyard himself doctor Rodiek had been secretly apprehended and executed in the Tower the day before Lanyard left London to join the Assyrian But the question of the U boat s present whereabouts and its movements in the immediate future disturbed the adventurer profoundly He was elaborately incurious about Heligoland and several weeks association with the Boche in the close quarters of a submarine was a prospect that revolted Wellnigh any fate were preferable Uncertain footsteps sounded in the alleyway paused at the entrance to his cubicle He turned his head wearily on the pillow In the doorway stood a man whose slenderly elegant carriage of a Prussian officer was not disguised even by his shapeless wreck of a naval lieutenant s uniform a man with a countenance of singularly unpleasant cast leaving out of all consideration the grease and grime that discoloured it His narrow forehead slanted back just a trace too sharply his nose was thin and overlong his mouth thin and cruel beneath its ambitious mustache a la Kaiser his small black eyes set much too close together blazed with unholy exhilaration As soon as he spoke Lanyard understood that he was drunk drunk with more than the champagne of which he presently boasted Awake eh he greeted Lanyard with a mirthless snarl You ve slept like the dead man I took you for at first my friend a solid fourteen hours my word for it Feeling better now Lanyard s essays to reply began and ended in a croak for water The Prussian nodded disappeared returned with an aluminium cup of stale cold water mixed with a little brandy Champagne if you like he offered as Lanyard painfully propping himself up on an elbow gulped like an animal from the vessel held to his lips We are holding a little celebration you know Lanyard dropped back to the pillow the question in his eyes Celebrating our success the Prussian responded We got her and that means much honour and a long furlough to boot when we get home just as failure would have spelled I don t like to think what I shouldn t care to fill the shoes of those poor devils who let the Assyrian escape them off Ireland I can tell you Something very much like true fear flickered in his small eyes as he pondered the punishment meted out to those who failed So the U boat was homeward bound Strange one noticed no motion of her progress heard no noise of machinery Where are we Lanyard whispered Peacefully asleep on the bottom about five miles south of Martha s Vineyard waiting till it is dark enough to slip in to our base Base The Prussian hiccoughed and giggled On the south shore of the Vineyard he confided with alcoholic glee snuggest little haven heart could wish well to the north of all deep sea traffic and the coastwise trade runs still farther north through Vineyard Sound other side the island Not a soul ever comes that way not a soul suspects How should they The admirable charts of the Yankee Coast and Geodetic Survey he sneered show no break in the south beach of the island between the ocean and the ponds But there is one The sea made the breach during a gale our people helped with a little Trotyl tides and storms did the rest Now we can enter a secluded landlocked harbour with just enough water at low tide and lie hidden there till the word comes to move again three miles of dense scrub forest all privately owned as a game preserve fenced and patrolled between us and the nearest cultivated land and friends in plenty on the island to keep all our needs supplied petroleum fresh vegetables champagne all that Just the same we take no chances never make our landfall by day never enter or leave harbour except at night He paused contemplating Lanyard owlishly Ought not to tell you all this I presume he continued more soberly though the wild light still flickered ominously in his eyes But it is safe enough you will see for yourself in a few hours and then either you are all right or you will never live to tell of it We radio d for information about Wilhelmstrasse Number twenty seven just before dawn after we had dodged that damned Yankee destroyer Ought to get an answer to night when we come up Heavier footsteps rang in the alleyway The Prussian made a grimace of dislike Here comes the commander he cautioned uneasily A great blond Viking of a German in the uniform of a captain shouldered heavily through the doorway and acknowledging the salute of the rat faced subaltern with a bare nod stood looking down at Lanyard in taciturn silence hostility in his blood shot blue eyes How long since he wakened he asked thickly with the accent of a Bavarian A minute or two ago Why did you not inform me The tone was offensively domineering thanks like enough to drink nerves and hatred of his job and all things and persons pertaining to it The subaltern coloured He asked for water I got it for him The commander stared churlishly then addressed Lanyard How are you now Very faint Lanyard said truthfully But he would have lied had it been otherwise with him It was his book to make time in which to collect his thoughts concoct a bullet proof story plan against an adverse answer to that wireless enquiry Can you eat drink a little champagne Lanyard nodded slightly adding a feeble Please The Bavarian glanced significantly at his subaltern who hastened to leave them Who are you What is your name doctor Paul Rodiek Your employment Personal Intelligence Bureau confidential agent What were you doing on board the Assyrian Lanyard mustered enough strength to look the man squarely in the eye Pardon he said coldly You must know your question is indiscreet I must know more about you It should be enough Lanyard ventured boldly to know that I set off that flare as arranged at risk of my life How came you overboard In the scuffle caused by my lighting the flare So you tell me But we found you half clothed lacking any sort of identification Am I to accept your unsupported word My papers are naturally at the bottom of the sea in the garments I discarded lest their weight drag me down If you have doubts Lanyard continued firmly it is your privilege to settle them by communicating via radio with Seventy ninth Street He shut his eyes wearily and turned his head aside on the pillow confident that this reference to the headquarters and secret wireless station of the Prussian spy system in New York would win him peace for a time at least After a moment the commander uttered a non committal grunt We shall see he prophesied darkly and went away Later one of the crew brought Lanyard a dish of greasy stew and potatoes lukewarm with bread and a half bottle of excellent champagne He ate all he could stomach of the first devoured the second ravenously and drained the bottle of its ultimate life giving drop Then immeasurably refreshed and fortified in body and spirit he turned face to the wall composed himself as if to sleep shut his eyes adjusted the tempo of his respiration and lay quite still wide awake and thinking hard After a while somebody tramped into the cubicle bent over Lanyard inquisitively and satisfied that he slept retired taking away the empty bottle and dishes Otherwise his meditations were disturbed only by those echoes of revelry in honour of the late manifestation of the Hun s divine right to do wanton murder on the high seas The rumour waxed and waned died into dull mutterings broke out afresh in spurts of merriment that held an hysterical note Once a quarrel sprang up and was silenced by the commander s deep unpleasant tones Corks popped spasmodically Again there were sounds much like a man s sobbing but these were promptly blared down by a phonograph with a typically American accent When that palled a sentimental disciple of frightfulness sang Tannenbaum in a melting tenor Everything tended to effect an impression that all commander and meanest mechanic alike were making forlorn efforts to forget Devoutly Lanyard prayed they might be successful at least until the submarine made her secret base If too much alcohol was bad too much brooding was infinitely worse for the German temperament He remembered one U boat commander who returning to the home port after a conspicuously successful cruise had been taken ashore in a strait jacket Lanyard himself did not care to dwell upon those scenes which must have been enacted on board the Assyrian after the torpedo struck Deliberately ignoring all else he set himself the task of reviewing those events which had led up to his going overboard One by one he considered the incidents of that night painstakingly dissected them examined their every phase in minute analysis weighing for ulterior meaning every word uttered in his presence harking even farther back to reconstruct his acquaintance with each actor from the very moment of its inception seeking that hint which he was convinced must be somewhere hidden in the history of the affair waiting only recognition to lead straightway out of this gloomy maze of mystery into a sunlit open of understanding In vain there was an ambiguity in that business to baffle the keenest and most pertinacious investigation The conduct of Cecelia Brooke alone bristled with inconsistencies inexplicable the conduct of the German spies no less To get better perspective upon the problem he reduced the premises to their barest summary A valuable dossier brought on board the Assyrian no matter by whom had come into the possession of British agents with the knowledge of Captain Osborne Thackeray had secreted it in that fraudulent bandage German agents apparently under the leadership of Baron von Harden had waylaid him knocked him senseless unwrapped the bandage but somehow probably in the first instance through the interference of the Brooke girl had overlooked the document Subsequently the Brooke girl had found and entrusted it to Lanyard No matter why He on his part had exerted his utmost inventiveness in hiding it away Nevertheless it had been discovered and abstracted within an hour By whom Not improbably by the Brooke girl herself Repenting her impulsiveness after leaving Lanyard with the captain from whom she had doubtless learned the truth about Monsieur Duchemin she might well have gone directly to Lanyard s stateroom and hit upon the morphia phial as the likeliest hiding place without delay thanks to prior acquaintance with the proportions of the paper cylinder But why should she have assumed that Lanyard had not disposed of the trust about his person Not impossibly the thing had been found by the first officer of the Assyrian searching by order of the captain as Lanyard assumed he had But if mister Warde had found it he had not reported his find when telephoning to Captain Osborne or else the latter had gone to great lengths to mystify Lanyard There remained the chance that the paper had been stolen by one of the two German agents by either without the knowledge of the other If Baron von Harden had found it necessarily before Lanyard returned to the room he had subsequently been at elaborate pains to conceal his success from both his victim and his confederate Why Did he distrust the latter Again why If Karl had been the thief it must have been after Lanyard s return and while the Baron was preoccupied with the task of keeping the prisoner quiet to let the search proceed In that event Karl had lied deliberately to his superior Why Because the document was salable and Karl intended to realize its value for his personal benefit Not an unlikely explanation Nor could this be called the first instance in which the Prussian spy system admirably organized though it was had been betrayed by one of its own agents This hypothesis too accounted for that most perplexing circumstance of all the murder of Baron von Harden For Lanyard was fully persuaded that had been nothing less than premeditated murder in no way an accident of faulty aim Even the most nervous and unstrung man could hardly have missed six shots out of seven point blank A nervous man indeed could hardly have gained his own consent to take so hideous a chance of injuring or killing a collaborator It appeared then that one of four things had happened to the cylinder of paper Miss Brooke had taken it back into her own care In which case Lanyard was no more concerned Captain Osborne had secured it through mister Warde This however Lanyard did not seriously credit It had gone to the bottom when the Assyrian sank with the body among others of Baron von Harden Or Karl had stolen it Privately indeed Lanyard rather inclined to hope that the last might prove to be the true solution He desired earnestly to meet Karl once more on equal terms And the more counts in the score the greater his satisfaction in exacting a reckoning in full But he anticipated That chapter might only too possibly have been closed forever by the hand of Death As yet he knew nothing concerning the mortality of the Assyrian debacle He had not enquired of the officers of the U boat because they knew little if anything more than he Their glasses had discovered to them trouble with the lifeboats they had spoken of one boat capsizing of people going overboard like cattle There must have been many drownings even with a United States destroyer near by and speeding to the rescue A single question troubled Lanyard greatly Officers and crew of the U boat had betrayed profoundest consternation upon the advent of that destroyer presumably a warship of a neutral nation And that same ship had without hesitation fired upon the submarine Was it possible then that the United States had already declared war on Germany It seemed extremely probable in such event these Germans would have been notified instantly by wireless from the New York bureau of their country s Secret Service whereas Captain Osborne receiving the same advice by wireless might reasonably have kept it quiet lest the news stir to more formidable activity those agents of the Wilhelmstrasse whose presence among the passengers he must at least have strongly suspected Presently the closeness of the atmosphere began to work upon Lanyard s perceptions In spite of his long rest a new drowsiness drugged his senses He yielded without struggle knowing he would soon need every ounce of strength and vitality that sleep could give him The din of an inferno startled him awake Those narrow metal walls were echoing a clangour of machinery maniacal in character and overpowering in volume Clankings tappings hissings coughings clatterings stridulation of a wireless spark drone of dynamos shrewdish scolding of Diesel motors developing two thousand horsepower individual efforts of some two thousand valves combined or declined to combine in a cacophony like nothing under the sun but the chant of a submersible under way on the surface Lanyard gratefully aware of a current of fresh air sweeping through the hold rolled out of his bunk to find that while he slept clothing had been provided for him rough but adequate heavy woollen underwear and socks a sweater a dungaree coat trousers of the same stuff all vilely damp and a friendless pair of oil sodden shoes the sweepings of a dozen lockers but as welcome as disreputable Dressed he turned aft through the alleyway entering immediately the central operating room and storm center of that typhoon of noise a wilderness of polished machinery in active being Of the score or more leather clad machinists silent at their posts none paid him more heed than a passing incurious glance as he crossed to a narrow steel companion ladder and ascended to the conning tower This he found deserted but its deck hatch was open He climbed out to the bridge The night was calm and heavily overcast with no sea more than long slow swells Through its windless quiet the U boat racketed with the raving abandon of the Spirit of Discord on a spree in a boiler factory To the riot of its internal strife was added the remonstrance of waters sliced by the stem and flung back by the sides a prolonged and stertorous hiss like the rending of an endless sheet of canvas To eyes new from the electric illumination of the hold the blackness was positive with the palpable quality of an element relieved alone by the dull glow of the binnacle housing the gyroscope telltale from which the faintest of golden reflections struck back to pick out a pair of seemingly severed fists gripping the handles of the bridge steering wheel with a singular effect of desperation For some moments Lanyard could see nothing more The mirthless chuckle of the lieutenant sounded at his elbow So the good Herr Doctor thought he had better come up for air eh My friend the very dead might envy you the sincerity of your slumbers We have been half an hour on the surface with all this uproar and you are only just wakened Half an hour Lanyard repeated thoughtfully Then we should be close in Give us ten minutes more if we don t go aground in this accursed blackness A broad shouldered body passed between Lanyard and the binnacle momentarily eclipsing its light Down below in the operating room a bell shrilled and of a sudden the Diesels were silenced The dead quiet that followed the sharp extinction of that hubbub was as startling as the detonation of high explosive had been Through this sudden stillness the submarine slipped stealthily the hissing beneath her bows dying down to gentle sibilance From forward the calls of an invisible leadsman were audible In response the commander uttered throaty orders to the helmsman at his elbow and those unattached hands shifted the wheel minutely Lanyard started to speak but a growl from the captain and a touch of the lieutenant s hand on his sleeve cautioned him to silence There was a small pause The vessel seemed to have lost way altogether to swim like a spirit ship that Stygian tide The lieutenant moved forward leaving Lanyard alone The voice of the leadsman was stilled By the wheel the captain stood absolutely motionless his body vaguely silhouetted against the glow of the binnacle The hands that gripped the wheel so savagely were as steady as if carven out of stone An atmosphere of suspense enveloped the boat like a cloud Lanyard grew conscious of something huge and formidable a denser shadow in the darkness beyond the bows the loom of land Off to starboard a point of light appeared abruptly precisely as if a golden pin had punctured the black blanket of the night The captain growled gutturals of relief and command The hands on the wheel shifted steering exceeding small A second light shone out to port then shifted slowly into range with the first till the two were as one Again the bell sang in the operating room and the vessel forged ahead quietly to the urge of electric motors alone A third light and a fourth appeared well apart to port and starboard the range lights precisely equidistant between them Between these the U boat moved swiftly They swam back on either hand and were abruptly extinguished as if the night resenting their insolent trespass had gobbled both at a gulp The temperature became sensibly warmer and the salt air of the sea was strongly tinctured with the sweet smell of pines and forest mould Up forward carbons sputtered and spat a searchlight was unsheathed and carved the gloom as if it was butter ranging swiftly over the tree clad shore of a burnished black lagoon picking out en passant several unpainted wooden structures then steadying on a long and substantial landing stage on which several men stood waiting X AT BASE As the U boat with motors dead and way lessening glided up alongside the head of that T shaped landing stage and was made fast the wireless operator popped up from below saluted the commander and delivered a written message Lanyard instinctively aware that this was the expected report from Seventy ninth Street on doctor Paul Rodiek quietly pulled himself together and took quick observations At best his chances in the all too probable emergency were far from brilliant Yet one might better perish trying however hopelessly than passively submit to being shot down The lieutenant waspishly superintending the work of crew and base guards at the mooring lines stood preoccupied within an arm s length while the landing stage was a fair six feet away From its T head to the shore the distance was nothing less than two hundred yards Desperate action and miraculous luck might take the Prussian by surprise and enable one to snatch the service automatic from its holster at his belt leap to the stage and shoot a way landward through the guards clustered there after which everything would depend on swiftness of foot and the uncertain light permitting one to gain a refuge in the surrounding woodland without a bullet in one s back It was a sorry hope With catlike attention Lanyard watched the hands holding that paper to the binnacle light large hands heavy and muscular but tremulous with drink and nervous reaction from the long strain and cumulative horror of the cruise then ending Their aim would not be good except by accident None the less if the report were unfavourable their first gesture would be toward the holster signalling to Lanyard that the moment had come to initiate heroic measures The Bavarian was an unconscionable time absorbing the import of the message Bending his face close to the paper the better to make out the writing he read with moving lips slowly a doltish frown of concentration clouding his congested countenance At length however he stood up swaying a little as he folded and pocketed the paper Lanyard relaxed The man was too far gone in drink to be crafty too sure of his absolute power of life and death to imagine a need for craft Since his hand had not immediately sought the holster it would not Turbid accents uttered the name of doctor Rodiek Lanyard stepped forward alertly Yes Herr Captain New York says it had no knowledge of your intention to leave England on the Assyrian but that you may well have done so The Wilhelmstrasse will know of course It has already been telegraphed Pending its reply I am to detain you How long Lanyard demurred As you know transatlantic communications must now go by land telegraph to the Border by hand into Mexico thence by radio via Venezuela to Berlin All that takes time Also we may not signal New York but at stated times of night You will be detained another twenty four hours at least possibly longer My errand cannot wait It must You will obstruct the business of the Imperial Government at your peril I would incur still greater peril did I let you go the commander replied nervously With these swine dogs at war with the Fatherland our lives are not worth that should this base be betrayed Do I understand America has declared war Two days since Did you not know The Assyrian s wireless room was under guard the captain published no bulletins whatever The Bavarian gave a gesture of impatience You will remain on board for the night he announced heavily Pardon Lanyard insisted with every evidence of anxious excitement What you tell me makes it more than ever imperative that I reach New York without an hour s avoidable delay I warn you think well before you hinder the discharge of my duty It is not necessary that I think the commander replied My thinking has all been done for me Me I obey my orders it is not my part to question their wisdom Moreover Herr Doctor to my mind your insistence is to say the least suspicious Even had I discretion in the matter I should hold you Therefore you will keep a civil tongue in your head or go below in irons immediately He swung on his heel showing an insolent back while he conferred with his subaltern And Lanyard shrugged appreciation of the futility of more contention against such mulishness Not that the Bavarian was not right enough As to that one had really hoped for no better issue but every shift is worth trial till proved worthless and he was no worse off now than if he had submitted without complaint Still one had Chance to look to for aid and comfort in this stress and Chance the jade is not always unkind to her audacious suitors Even now she flashed upon Lanyard a provoking intimation of her smile He began to divine possibilities in this overt ill feeling between the officers advantage might be made of the racial hostility of Prussian and Bavarian The commander s attitude and tone were consistently overbearing if his words were inaudible to Lanyard The lieutenant quite evidently submitted only in form his salute was punctiliously correct and curt and as the commander lumbered off down the landing stage he grumbled indistinctly in Lanyard s hearing Dog of a Bavarian The good Herr Captain Lanyard suggested pleasantly is not in the most agreeable of tempers yes The high and well born lieutenant spat comprehensively into the darkness overside After a moment of hesitation he moved nearer and spoke in confidential accents And the fragrant air of the night was tainted with the vinous effluvium of his breath Always he prattles of his precious duty the Prussian muttered Damn his duty Look you Herr Doctor months we have been on this cruise yes more than three months out of Heligoland penned together in this ramshackle stinkpot or isolated here in this God forgotten hole seeing nothing of life hearing nothing of the world but what little the radio tells us sick of the very sight of one another s faces And now when we have accomplished a glorious feat and have every right to look for prompt recall and the rewards of heroes orders come to remain indefinitely and operate against the North Atlantic fleet of the contemptible Yankee navy The life of a dog And that noble commander of mine pretends to welcome it talks of one s duty to the Fatherland as if he liked the work any better than I solely to spite me But why Because he hates me the lieutenant snarled passionately hates me even as I hate him he knows how well He interrupted himself to define his conception of the commander s character in the freest vernacular of the Berlin underworld Lanyard laughed amiably They are like that he agreed those Bavarians Which inspired the Prussian to deliver a phosphorescent diatribe on the racial traits of the Bavarian people as comprehended by the North German junker To be cooped up God knows how long in this putrescent death trap with such cattle he concluded mutinously it passes all endurance I wonder you stand it Lanyard sympathised a man of spirit and good birth as one readily perceives Though the life of a secret agent is not altogether heavenly either if you ask me he added gratuitously Regard me now charged with a mission of most vital moment more than ever so since the Yankees have shown their teeth delayed here indefinitely because your excellent Herr Captain chooses to doubt my word Patience Maybe your release comes quickly Then he will regret or would had he wit enough There is no cure for a fool The sententiousness of this aphorism was unhappily marred by a hiccough Anybody with eyes in his head could see you are what you are The last of the operating room crew piled up the hatchway saluted and hurried ashore to join in noisy jubilations There remained on the U boat only the lieutenant with Lanyard and two base guards detailed as anchor watch I must go the lieutenant volunteered And believe me one welcomes a change of clothing and a dry bed after a week in this reeking sieve As for you my friend if it lay with me you should receive the treatment due a gentleman A wave of maudlin camaraderie affected him He passed an affectionate arm through Lanyard s and was suffered though the gorge of the adventurer revolted at the familiarity I am sorry to leave you No do not be astonished No protestations please It is quite true I know a man of the right sort when I meet one the sort even I can associate with without loss of self respect It is a great pity you may not come with me and make a night of it Another time perhaps Lanyard said The night may yet come when you and I shall meet at the Metropole or the Admiral s Palace Who knows Ah sighed the Prussian enchanted What a night that will be my friend But now it is too bad I really must ask you to step below Such are my silly orders I am made responsible for you What do you think of that for a joke eh He laughed vacantly but loudly and attempting to poke a derisive thumb into Lanyard s ribs lost his balance What a responsibility said Lanyard gravely holding him up Nonsense that s what it is You have no possible chance to escape Suppose I make one tip you overboard take to my heels You would be shot like a rabbit before you got half way to the shore Ah but grant for the sake of argument that these brave fellows the guards aim poorly in this gloom Where would you go Into the forest naturally But how far You may believe me when I tell you not a hundred yards It s a true wilderness scrub oak and cedar and second growth choked with underbrush almost trackless In five minutes you would be helplessly lost in this blackness with no stars to steer by We need only wait till daylight to find you walking in a circle You can t mean Lanyard pursued learning something helpful every moment there is no communicating road The main woods road yes but that is far too well patrolled Without the countersign you would be caught or shot a dozen times before you reached the end of it Ah well with the sigh of a philosopher then I presume there s no way out but by swimming Over to the beach you mean Well what then You have got a twenty mile walk either way through deep sand sure to betray your footprints At dawn we follow and bag you at our leisure You are discouraging Lanyard complained I see I may as well go below and be good It s a dull life Tell you what giggled the lieutenant leading his prisoner to the conning tower hatch and lowering his voice do just that go below and be nice and presently I will come back and we ll split a bottle What do you say to that eh Colossal Not a bad notion is it I like it myself One gets weary for the society of a gentleman you ve no idea As soon as my commander is drunk enough I will slip away How s that Grossartig Lanyard approved turning to descend Wait You shall see for yourself what it means to have the friendship of a man of my stamp The lieutenant raised his voice addressing the anchor watch Attention Heed with care this gentleman is my friend He is detained merely as a matter of form I do not wish him to be annoyed Do you understand You are to leave him to himself as long as he remains quietly below But he is not to come on deck again till I return Is all that clear imbeciles The imbeciles saluting mechanically indicated glimmerings of comprehension Then below you go doctor Rodiek And don t get impatient I will rejoin you as soon as possible Don t be long Lanyard implored As he lowered himself through the hatch he saw the Prussian stumble down the gangplank and reel shoreward Well satisfied with his diplomacy Lanyard lingered a while in the conning tower closely studying and memorising the more salient features of the Island of Martha s Vineyard and its adjacent waters and mainland as delineated on a most comprehensive large scale chart published by the German Admiralty from exhaustive soundings and surveys of its own navigators and typographers with corrections of as recent date as the first part of the year nineteen seventeen Here the breach in the south coast line which permitted the utilisation of what had formerly been an extensive fresh water pond as this secret submarine base was clearly shown And a single glance confirmed the lieutenant s statement concerning its remote isolation from settled sections of the island Somewhat dismayed Lanyard descended to the central operating compartment and scouted through the hold from bow bulkhead to stern making certain he enjoyed undisputed privacy And it was so every man jack of the U boat s personnel jaded to the marrow with its cramped accommodations unremitting toil and care unsanitary smells and forbidding associations having naturally seized the earliest opportunity to escape so loathsome a prison Lanyard however was anything but resentful of condemnation to this solitary confinement His interest in the interior arrangements of submersibles seemed all but feverish as intense as sudden witness the minute attention to detail which marked his second tour of inspection On this round he took his time He had all night in which to work out his salvation the wildest schemes were revolving in his mind the least fantastic utterly impracticable without accurate knowledge of many matters and such knowledge might be gained only through patient investigation and ungrudging expenditure of time It was now something past ten by the chronometers He could hardly do much before dawn lacking the instinct of a red Indian to guide him through that night bound waste of woodland So he felt little need to slight his researches through haste except in anticipation of his lieutenant s return And as to that Lanyard was moderately incredulous he expected to see nothing more of this new found friend unless the infatuation of the Prussian proved far stronger than his head Turning first to the private quarters of the commander a somewhat more commodious cubicle than that across the alleyway in which Lanyard had been berthed his interest was attracted by a small safe anchored to the deck beneath the desk To this Lanyard addressed himself without hesitation solving the secret of its combination readily through exercise of the most rudimentary of professional principles The problem it offered indeed was child s play to such cunning of touch and hearing as had made the reputation of the Lone Wolf Open the safe discovered to him a variety of articles of interest some five thousand dollars in English and American banknotes of large denomination several hundred in American gold three distinct cipher codes one of these wholly novel in Lanyard s experience and so he believed in the knowledge of the Allied secret services the log of the U boat and the intimate diary of its commander both in cryptograph a compact directory of German agents domiciled in Atlantic coast ports a very considerable accumulation of German Admiralty orders together with many documents of lesser moment Rapidly sorting out the more valuable of these Lanyard disposed them about his person then confiscated the banknotes as indemnity for his stolen money belt replaced the rejections and reclosed and locked the safe His next interest was to arm himself After several disappointments he discovered arms lockers beneath the berths for the crew in the forward compartment just aft of that devoted to torpedo tubes Here he selected a latest pattern German navy automatic pistol with three extra cartridge clips and after some hesitation a peculiarly devilish magazine rifle firing explosive bullets The latter he placed handily yet out of sight near the foot of the companion ladder The pistol fitted snugly a trousers pocket its bulk hidden by the sag of his sweater Some time later the lieutenant slipping down the ladder found Lanyard studying with a convincing aspect of childlike bewilderment the complicated combinations of machinery which crowded the central operating compartment Fresh from a bath and shave and wearing a clean uniform the Prussian showed vast improvement in looks if not in equilibrium But his mouth twitched fitfully his eyes wandered and disclosed a disquieting superabundance of white and his tongue was noticeably thicker than before Well my friend he said you are truly disappointing The watch said you had made no sound since going below I was afraid of another of those famous naps of yours With the prospect of a bottle with you Impossible I have been waiting and waiting with my tongue hanging out Too bad Why did you not look around help yourself Why not the lieutenant demanded Have I not given you freedom of ship It is yours everything here yours I want nothing but an end to this great thirst Lanyard protested Then God in Heaven why we standing here Come Releasing the handrail the Prussian took careful aim for the alleyway door launched himself toward it slipped on the greasy metal grating and would have fallen heavily but for Lanyard Cursing pettishly he stood up threw off Lanyard s arms without thanks and made a new attempt this time shooting headlong through the alleyway to bring up against the wing table in the third forward compartment the kitchen and messroom in one A great pity he muttered opening a locker and fumbling in its depths rotten pity What Keep you waiting so long Not my fault The lieutenant brought forth two bottles of champagne and one of brandy You open them Herr Doctor like good fellow he said placing the three on the table I just wish you understand no discourtesy meant unavoidably detained beastly commander drunk Give my word hopelessly drunk Poor fool If my judgment is sound Lanyard said this noble vessel will soon need a new commander True Quite true The Prussian placed two aluminium cups upon the table and half filled one with brandy then brimmed it with champagne Try that he said thickly That will keep your tail up my friend Many thanks Lanyard protested filling another cup with undiluted champagne I prefer one thing at a time Unfortunate don t know what is good King s peg wonderful drink No matter To new commander prosit He drained his cup at a gulp To the new commander Lanyard echoed and drank judiciously Excellent How long can he last do you think at this pace No telling not long too long for my liking Shall I tell something He filled his cup again half and half and sat down his wicked rat like face more than ever pale and repulsive Not whisper of this mind though I think crew sometimes suspects he s going mad Not that Bavarian The lieutenant nodded wisely If knew him as I know him never be surprised my friend You think too much drink Yes but not entirely He keeps seeing things hearing them especially by night What sort of things Faces The Prussian licked his lips glanced furtively over his shoulder and drank Dead faces eyes eaten out seaweed in their hair And voices he s forever hearing voices people trying to talk can t make him understand because mouths full of water you know But they understand one another keep discussing how to get at him He tells me about it I tell you it is Hell to hear him talk especially when submerged as last night Then he hears them fumbling all over the hull with their stumpy fingers trying to find way in talking about him And he tells me and keeps insisting till sometimes I seem to hear them too But I don t Before God I don t You don t believe I do do you His eyes rolled wildly Why should you Just so why should I The lieutenant s accents rose to a shrill pitch I have not his record still in training when he sent Lusitania to the bottom Yes it was he second in command in charge of torpedo tubes His own hand fired that torpedo He fell silent staring moodily into his cup perhaps thinking of the number of torpedoes it had been his own lot to discharge upon errands of slaughter And the dead silence of the ship was made audible by a stealthy drip drip of water from the seams and the furtive slaver of the tide on the outer plates A shiver ran through the body of the Prussian He pulled himself together with obvious effort looked up with an uncertain grin and passed a shaking hand across his writhing lips All foolishness of course but gets on one s nerves constant association with man like that Know what he s doing now or was when I came away Sitting up with doors and windows locked and blinds drawn drinking brandy neat He can t sleep by night if sober or without light in the room If he does he knows they will get him people he hears crawling up from the sea slopping round the house mumbling whimpering in the dark He broke off abruptly with a whisper more dreadful than a shriek God and jumped to his feet whipping the automatic from his belt A footfall sounded in one of the after compartments Others followed Someone was coming slowly down the alleyway someone with dragging heavy feet The lieutenant waited motionless as one petrified with terror The bulkhead doorway framed the figure of the commander He paused there louring at his subaltern with haunted eyes ablaze in a face like parchment So he said nodding As I thought It is thus I find you fraternising with one who may be for all we know an enemy to the Fatherland You drunken babbling fool Get ashore His angry foot thumped the grating Get ashore and report yourself under arrest With no more warning than a strangled snarl the lieutenant shot him through the head XI UNDER THE ROSE Vague stupefaction replaced the scowl upon the countenance of the commander He swayed a hand faltering to his forehead where dark blood was beginning to well from a cleanly drilled puncture Then he collapsed completely falling prone across the raised sill of the bulkhead opening A convulsive tremor shook savagely his huge frame Thereafter he was quite still The report of that one shot had reverberated stunningly within those narrow walls of steel Momentarily Lanyard looked to see the alarmed anchor watch appear so too apparently the lieutenant who remained immobile pistol poised in a hand for the moment strangely steady gaze fixed upon the mouth of the alleyway But through a long minute no other sounds were audible than that ceaseless dripping from frames and seams with that muted terrible mouthing of waters on the plates Unable either to fathom or forecast the workings of the drink maddened mentality masked by that rat like face Lanyard waited with a hand covertly grasping the automatic in his pocket There was no telling at any moment that murderous mania might veer his way And he was not content to die not yet not in any event by the hand of a decadent little beast of a Boche Slowly the arm of the lieutenant dropped lowering the pistol till its muzzle chattered on the top of the table a noise that broke the spell upon his senses He looked down in dull brutish wonder then roused and with a gesture of horror let the weapon fall clattering His glance shifting to the body of his commander he started violently backing up against the plates to put all possible distance between himself and his handiwork His lips moved framing phrases at first incoherent presently articulate in part done it at last Knew I must soon Abruptly he looked up at Lanyard Bear witness he cried I was provoked beyond human endurance He insulted me in your presence me that scum Lanyard said nothing but met his gaze with a blank non committal stare under which the eyes of the lieutenant wavered and fell Then with a start he realised anew the significance of that still figure at his feet and tried to shake some of the swagger back into his wretched fear racked being A good job he muttered defiantly And you will stand by me I know Only there is nothing in that of course no justification possible before a court martial Even your testimony could not save me I am done for utterly He hung his head Lanyard heard whispered words degraded dishonour firing squad A chronometer in the central operating compartment tolled eight bells With a sharp cry the lieutenant dropped to his knees He can t be dead he shrilled It is all play acting to frighten me Frantically he sought to turn the body over Lanyard s hand shot swiftly out capturing the automatic on the table With rapid and sure gestures he extracted and pocketed the clip drew back the breech ejecting into his palm the one shell in the barrel and replaced the weapon all before the Prussian gave over his insane efforts to resurrect the dead He is dead enough he announced eyeing Lanyard morosely beyond helping Look here are you with me or against me Need you ask I count on you then Good I think we can cover this up He checked and stood for a while lost in thought How Lanyard roused him Simply enough I go on deck send the watch ashore on some trumped up errand They suspect nothing thinking the commander and I have you in charge If they heard that shot I will say one of us dropped a bottle of champagne and it exploded When they are gone I bring the dory alongside and with your help it should be an easy matter to carry this body up weight it row it out to the middle of the lagoon dump it overboard Then we return Our story is the commander followed the anchor watch ashore if later he wandered off got lost in the woods in his alcoholic delirium that is no affair of ours Do you understand Perfectly said Lanyard with a look of fatuous innocence But how about the water is it deep enough The Prussian took no pains to dissemble his scorn of this question seemingly so witless To cover the body Why even here there is sufficient depth at low tide for us to submerge completely barring the periscopes And it is deeper yet in the middle Thanks Lanyard replied meekly Have another drink No The Prussian tossed off a half cupful of undiluted brandy and shuddered Then stop here I ll be back in a Half a minute The lieutenant halted in the act of stepping across the body Lanyard levelled a hand at the automatic Do you mind taking that with you I have no desire to be found here with it and a dead man should anything prevent your return With a sickly grimace the murderer snatched up the weapon thrust it in its holster and hurriedly departed Lanyard watched him pass through the alleyway and turn toward the companion ladder then followed quietly As the lieutenant climbed out on deck Lanyard ascended to the conning tower and waited there listening He could not quite make out what was said but after a few brusque words of command two pair of boots rang on the gangplank and thumped away down the stage At the same time Lanyard let himself noiselessly out through the hatch As soon as his vision grew reconciled to the change from light to darkness he discovered the slender figure of the lieutenant skulking on tip toe after the retreating anchor watch about midway on the landing stage however he paused and bent over one of the piles apparently fumbling with the painter of a small boat moored in the black shadows below At this Lanyard began to move along the deck one by one working the mooring lines clear of their cleats and dropping them gently overboard till but two were left to hold the U boat in place Throughout he kept watch upon the manoeuvres of the lieutenant saw him drop over the side of the stage heard a thump of feet as he landed in a boat and a subsequent creak of oar locks The small boat was rounding the bows of the submarine when the adventurer ducked back through conning tower to hold He was standing where he had been left when the lieutenant came below It s all right this last announced with shabby bravado as he stepped over the body in the doorway We are rid of that damned watch for a time They won t return within half an hour at least I have the dory moored amidships If we are lively this dirty job will be over in no time at all Lanyard nodded I am ready No need to hurry plenty of time for one more drink The Prussian splashed brandy into the cup filling it to the brim And God knows I need it Lanyard watched critically as with head well back he drained that staggering dose of raw spirit gulp by gulp without once removing the cup from his lips No mortal man could drink like that and stand up under it it was now a mere question of time Hardly that the hand of the murderer shook and wavered widely as he put down the cup For a moment he swayed with eyes fixed and glazing features visibly losing plasticity then lurched forward knocking the brandy bottle to the floor swung around a full half turn in blind effort to re establish equilibrium fell backward upon the table and lay racked from head to foot with savage spasms hands clawing empty air chest labouring vainly to win sufficient oxygen to combat the poison with which his system was saturated Moving to his side Lanyard laid a hand upon the left breast The man s heart was hammering his ribs with agonizing blows at first rapid by degrees more slow and feeble No power on earth could save him now he had committed suicide as surely as murder Wasting not another glance or thought upon him Lanyard hurried aft to the central operating room The time he had spent there an hour earlier was by no means lost in purposeless marvelling He boasted a certain aptitude for mechanics perhaps legitimately inherited from that obscure origin of his largely fostered by the requirements of his craft into the bargain he had been privileged ere now to gain some slight insight into the principles of submersible operation If obliged to work swiftly and in some instances upon the advice of intuition rather than practical knowledge he went not unintelligently about his task made few false moves Turning first to the diving controls he adjusted the hydroplanes to their extreme downward inclination then made the rounds of the vent valves opening all wide With a sharp hissing and whistling the air from the auxiliary tanks was driven inboard and as Lanyard manipulated the wheels operating the forward and aft groups of Kingston valves to the hissing was added the suck and gurgle of water flooding the main and auxiliary ballast and adjusting tanks Immediately the U boat began to sink Lanyard delayed only to close the switches which controlled the electric motors As their drone gained volume he grasped the rifle and swarmed up the companion ladder passing through the conning tower to deck with little or nothing to spare with in fact barely time to throw off the two mooring lines and jump into the small boat before water sweeping hungrily up over deck and bridge began to cascade through conning tower and torpedo hatchways Constrained to cut the painter lest the dory be drawn down with the fast sinking submarine he fitted oars to locks and put his back to them swinging the small boat hastily clear of whirlpools which formed as the waves closed over the spot where the U boat had rested From first to last less than five minutes activity had been needed for the task of scotching this water moccasin of the salt seas and putting its keepers at the mercy of the country whose hospitality they had too long abused Well content after a little Lanyard lay on his oars and contemplated with much interest what the night permitted to be visible the landing stage no more than a dark vague mass in the darkness the land picked out with but few lights mainly at windows of the base buildings painting dim ribbons upon the polished floor of the lagoon Methodically these were eclipsed as a moving figure passed before them Listening intently Lanyard could distinguish the slow footfalls of an unsuspecting sentry no other sounds more than gentle voices of the night murmurs of blind wavelets the plaintive whisper of a little breeze belated amid the tree tops of that dark forest and a slow weary soughing of swells upon the distant ocean shore Perceiving as yet not the slightest indication of an alarm ashore Lanyard ventured to continue rowing but with utmost caution lifting and dipping his blades as gingerly as though they were fashioned of brittle glass and for want of a better guide keeping the stern of the dory square to the shank of the T stage In time the bows grounded lightly on sand The melancholy voice of the sea now seemed a heavier sighing in the stillness He pushed off and rowed on parallel with a dark shore line so close in that his starboard oar touched bottom at each stroke At intervals he paused and rested striving vainly to garner some clue to his bearings Inexorably the blackness forbade that He might have failed ere dawn to grope a way out of that trap had not the disappearance of the submarine been discovered within the hour A sudden clamour rose in the quarter of the landing stage first one great shout of dismay then two voices bellowing together then others Several rifle shots were fired in the air More lights broke out in windows ashore Many feet drummed resoundingly upon the stage and the confusion of voices attained a pitch of wild hysteric uproar Of a sudden a flare was lighted and tossed far out upon the bosom of the lagoon Surprised by that sharp and merciless blue glare Lanyard instinctively shipped oars and picked up the rifle He could see so clearly that huddle of figures upon the head of the landing stage that he confidently apprehended being fired upon at any moment but minutes lengthened and he was not Either the Germans were looking for bigger game than a dory adrift or the dazzling flare hindered more than aided their vision At length persuaded that he had not been detected Lanyard put aside the rifle and resumed the oars Now his course was made beautifully clear to him the blue light showed him that outlet to the sea which he sought within a hundred yards distance Presently the flare began to wane It was not renewed Altogether unseen unsuspected Lanyard swung the dory into the breach and drove it seaward with all his might Swiftly the lagoon was shut out by narrow closing banks The blue glare died out behind a black profile of rounded dunes Lanyard turned the bow eastward rowing broadside to the shore After something more than an hour of this mode of progress he struck in toward the beach disembarked in ankle deep waters slung the rifle over his shoulder by its strap and pushing the dory off abandoned it to the whim of the sea Then again he set his face to the east following the contour of the beach just within the wash of the tide thereby making sure that there should be no trail of footprints in the sand to guide a possible pursuit in the morning The rising sun found him purposefully splashing on weary but enheartened by the discovery that he had left behind the more thickly wooded section of the island Presently turning in to the dry beach for the first time he climbed to the summit of a dune somewhat higher than its fellows and took observations finding that he had come near to the eastern extremity of the island At some distance to his right a wagon road faintly rutted in sand and overgrown with beach grass struck inland Following this at a venture he came at about eight o clock upon the outskirts of a waterside community Before proceeding he hid the magazine rifle in a thicket then made a wide detour and picked up a roadway which entered the village from the north If his disreputable appearance was calculated to excite comment readiness in disbursing money to remedy such shortcomings made amends for Lanyard s taciturnity Within two hours shaved bathed and inconspicuously dressed in a cheap suit of ready made clothing he was breakfasting famously upon the plain fare of a commercial tavern The town he learned was the one time important whaling port of Edgartown He would be able to leave for the mainland on a ferry steamer sailing early in the afternoon Ten minutes before going abroad he filed a long telegram in code addressed to the head of the British Secret Service in New York Consequences manifold and various ensued When the telegram had been delivered and decoded both transactions being marked by reasonable promptitude the head of the British Secret Service in New York called the British Embassy in Washington on the long distance telephone Shortly thereafter an attache of the British Embassy jumped into a motor car and had himself driven to one of the cardinal departments of the Federal Government When he had kicked his heels in an antechamber upward of an hour he was received affably enough by the head of the department a smug open faced gentleman whose mood was largely preoccupied with illusions of grandeur who was in short interested far more in considering how splendid it was to be himself than in hearing about any mare s nest of a German U boat base on the south shore of Martha s Vineyard He was however indulgent enough to promise to give the matter his distinguished consideration in due course He even went so far as to have his secretary make a note of what alleged information this young Englishman had to impart During the night he chanced to wake up and recall the matter and concluded that all things considered it would do no harm to give the United States Navy a little amusement and exercise even if it should turn out that the rumour of this submarine base was a canard So the next morning he went to his desk some time before noon and issued a lot of orders One of them had to do with the necessity for absolute secrecy During the day several minor officials of the department might have been and indeed were observed going about their business with painfully tight lipped expressions Also many messages were transmitted by wireless telephone and telegraph to various persons charged with the defense of the Atlantic Coast some of these were code messages some were not That same night a great forest fire sprang up on the south shore of Martha s Vineyard both preceded and accompanied by a series of heavy explosions The first United States vessel to reach the lagoon found only charred remains of a landing stage and several buildings and at the bottom of the lagoon an incoherent mass of wreckage a twisted and shattered chaos of steel plates and framework that might possibly have been a perfectly sound submarine though sunken had somebody not been warned in ample time to permit its destruction through the agency of trinitrotoluene that enormously efficient modern explosive nicknamed by British military and naval experts T N T and by the Germans Trotyl XII RESURRECTION The early editions of those New York evening newspapers which Lanyard purchased in Providence when he changed trains there en route from New Bedford to New York carried multi column and most picturesque accounts of the Assyrian disaster But the whole truth was in none Lanyard laid aside the last paper privately satisfied that for no doubt praiseworthy reasons of its own Washington had seen fit to dictate the suppression of a number of extremely pertinent circumstances and facts which could hardly have escaped governmental knowledge Already one inferred a sort of censorship was at work an effective if comparatively modest precursor to that noble volunteer committee which was presently with touching spontaneity to fasten itself upon an astonished Ship of State before it could gather enough way to escape such cirripede attachments Presumably it was not thought wise to disconcert a great people in the complacence of its awakening to the fact that it was remotely at war with the Hun with information that a Boche submersible was or of late had been operating in the neighbourhood of Nantucket Unanimously the sinking of the Assyrian was ascribed to an internal explosion of unknown origin No paper hinted that German secret agents might possibly have figured incogniti among her passengers There was mention neither of the flare which had burned on her after deck to make the Assyrian a conspicuous target in the night nor of any of the other untoward events which had led up to the explosion Nothing whatever was said of the shot fired at the submerging U boat by a United States torpedo boat destroyer speeding to the rescue Still the bare facts alone were sufficiently appalling Reading what had been permitted to gain publication Lanyard experienced a qualm of horror together with the thought that even had he drowned as he had expected to drown such a fate had almost been preferable to participation in those awful ten minutes precipitated by that pale messenger of death which had so narrowly missed Lanyard himself as he rested on the bosom of the sea Within ten minutes after receiving her coup de grace the Assyrian had gone under barely that much time had been permitted a passenger list of seventy two and a personnel of nearly three hundred souls in which to rouse from dreams of security and take to the lifeboats Thanks to the frenzied haste compelled by the swift settling of the ship more than one boat had been capsized Others had been sunk literally driven under by masses of humanity cascading into them from slanting decks Others again had never been launched at all The utmost efforts of the destroyer fortuitously so near at hand had served to rescue but thirty one passengers and one hundred and eighty of the crew In the list of survivors Lanyard found these names Becker Julius New York Brooke Cecelia London Crane Robert T New York Dressier Emil Geneva O Reilly Edmund Detroit Putnam Bartlett Philadelphia Velasco Arturo Buenos Aires Among the injured Lieutenant Lionel Thackeray D S O was listed as suffering from concussion of the brain said to have been contracted through a fall while attempting to aid the launching of a lifeboat In the long roster of the drowned these names appeared Bartholomew Archer London Duchemin Andre Paris Von Harden Baron Gustav Amsterdam Osborne Captain E W London Of all the officers mister Sherry was a solitary survivor fished out of the sea after going down with his ship No list boasted the name Karl Lacking accommodations for the rescued it was stated the destroyer had summoned by wireless the east bound freight steamship Saratoga which had trans shipped the unfortunates and turned back to New York Throughout the best part of that journey from Providence to New York Lanyard sat blankly staring into the black mirror of the window beside his chair revolving schemes for his immediate future in the light of information derived indirectly as much as directly from these newspaper stories Retrospective consideration of that voyage left little room for doubt that the designs of the German agents had been thoughtfully matured They had been quiet enough between their first stroke in the dark and their last between the burglary of Cecelia Brooke s stateroom the first night out and those murderous attacks on Bartholomew and Thackeray Unquestionably had they bided their time pending that hour when according to their information the submersible would be off Nantucket awaiting their signal to sink the Assyrian a signal which would never have been given had their plans proved successful had they not made the ship too hot to hold them and finally had they not made every provision for their own escape when the ship went down Lanyard was confident that all of their company had been warned to hold themselves ready and consequently had come off scot free all that is save that victim of treachery the unhappy Baron von Harden If the number of that group which Lanyard had selected as comprising a majority of his enemies those nine who had discussed the Lone Wolf in the smoking room was now reduced to five Becker Dressier O Reilly Putnam and Velasco or four eliminating Putnam of whose loyalty there could be no question Lanyard still had no means of knowing how many confederates among the other passengers these four might not have had And even four men who appreciated what peril to their plans inhered in the Lone Wolf even four made a ponderable array of desperate enemies to have at large in New York apt to be encountered at any corner apt at any time to espy and recognise him without his knowledge This situation imposed upon him two major tasks of immediate moment he must hunt down those four one by one and either satisfy himself as to their innocence of harmful intent or put them permanently hors de combat and he must extinguish utterly once and for all time that amiable personality whose brief span had been restricted to the decks of the Assyrian Monsieur Andre Duchemin That one must be buried deep beyond all peradventure of involuntary resurrection Fortunately the last step toward the positive metamorphosis indicated had been taken that very morning when the Gallic beard of Monsieur Duchemin was erased by the razor of a New England barber whose shears had likewise eradicated every trace of a Continental mode of hair dressing There remained about Lanyard little to remind of Andre Duchemin but his eyes and the look of one s eyes as every good actor knows is something far more easy to disguise than is commonly believed But it was hardly in human nature not to mourn the untimely demise of so useful a body one who carried such beautiful credentials and serviceable letters of introduction whose character boasted so much charm with a solitary fault too facile vulnerability to the prying eyes of those to whom Paris meant those days and social strata in which Michael Lanyard had moved and had his being Witness according to Crane the demoniac cleverness of the Brazilian in unmasking the Duchemin incognito Suspicion was taking form in Lanyard s reflections that he had paid far too little attention to Senor Arturo Velasco of Buenos Aires whose avowed avocation of amateur criminologist might easily be synonymous with interests much less innocuous Or why had Velasco been so quick to communicate recognition of Lanyard to an employee of the United States Secret Service For that matter why had he felt called so publicly to descant upon the natural history of the Lone Wolf In order to focus upon that one the attentions of his enemies Or to put him on guard It was altogether perplexing Was one to esteem Velasco friend or foe Lanyard could comfort himself only with the promise he should one day know and that without undue delay Alighting in Grand Central Terminus late at night he made his way to Forty second Street and there in the staring headlines of a Late Extra read the news that the steamship Saratoga had suffered a crippling engine room accident and was limping slowly toward port still something like eighteen hours out Wondering if it were presumption to construe this as an omen that the stars in their courses fought for him Lanyard went west to Broadway afoot all the way beset with a sense of incredulity it was difficult to believe that he was himself alive and at large in this city of wonder and space where people moved at leisure and without fear on broad streets that resembled deep bitten channels for rivers of light He was all too wont with nights of dread and trembling with the mediaeval gloom that enwrapped the cities of Europe by night their grim black streets desolate but for a few infrequent scurrying shapes of fright While here the very beggars walked with heads unbowed and men and women of happier estate laughed and played and made love lightly in the scampering taxis that whisked them homeward from restaurants of the feverish midnight A people at war actually at grips with the Blond Beast arrayed to defend itself and all humanity against conquest by that loathsome incubus incarnate a people heedless carefree irresponsible refusing to credit its peril Here and there a recruiting poster down the broad reaches of Fifth Avenue a display of bunting no other hint of war time spirit and gravity Longacre Square a weltering lake of kaleidoscopic radiance even at this late hour thronged with carnival crowds not one note of sobriety in the night Lanyard lifted a wondering gaze to the livid sky whose far clear stars were paled and shamed by the up flung glare like eyes of innocence peering down into a pit of hell Inscrutable Yet one could hardly be numb to the subtle heady intoxication of those cool immaculate sea sweet airs which swept the streets instilling self confidence and lightness of spirit even in heads shadowed with the woe of war worn Europe Lanyard had not crossed the Avenue before he found himself walking with a brisker stride holding his own head high On impulse despite the lateness of the hour albeit with misgivings justified in the issue he hailed a taxicab and had himself driven to the headquarters of the British Secret Service in America an unostentatious dwelling on the northwest corner of West End Avenue at Ninety fifth Street Here a civil footman answered the door and Lanyard s enquiries with the information that Colonel Stanistreet had unexpectedly been called out of town and would not return before evening of the next day while his secretary mister Blensop had gone to a play and might not come home till all hours More impatient than disappointed Lanyard climbed back into his cab and in consequence of consultation with its friendly minded chauffeur eventually put up for the night in an Eighth Avenue hotel of the class that made Senator Raines famous a hostelry brazenly proclaiming accommodations for gentlemen only whereas it offered entertainment for both man and beast and catered rather more to beast than to man However it served it was inconspicuous and made no demands upon a shabby traveller sans luggage more than payment in advance Early abroad Lanyard breakfasted with attention fixed to the advertising columns of the Herald and by mid morning was established as sub tenant of a furnished bachelor apartment on Fifty eighth Street near Seventh Avenue a tiny nest of few rooms on the street level with entrances from both the general lobby and the street direct an admirable arrangement for one who might choose to come and go without supervision or challenge Lacking local references as to his character Lanyard was obliged to pay three months rent in advance in addition to making a substantial deposit to cover possible damage to the furnishings His name a spur of the moment selection was recorded in the lease as Anthony Ember At noon he brought to his lodgings two trunks salvaged from a storage warehouse wherein they had been deposited more than three years since on the eve of his flight with his family from America an affair of haste and secrecy forbidding the handicap of heavy impedimenta Thus Lanyard became once more possessor of a tolerably comprehensive wardrobe But those trunks released more than his personal belongings intermingled were possessions that had been his wife s and his boy s As he unpacked memories peopled those perfunctorily luxurious lodgings of the transient with melancholy ghosts as sweet and sad as lavender and rue For hours on end the man sat idle head bowed down hands plucking aimlessly at small broidered garments And if in the sweep and turmoil of late events he seemed to have forgotten for a little that feud which had brought him overseas he roused from this brief interlude of saddened dreaming with the iron of deadly purpose newly entered into his soul and in his heart one dominant thought that now his hour with Ekstrom could not must not be long deferred In the street there rose an uproar of inhuman bawling Lanyard went to the private door hailed one of the husky authors of the din an itinerant news vendor and disbursed a nickel coin for one cent s worth of spushul uxtry and four cents worth of howling impudence He found no more of interest in the newspaper than the information that the Saratoga had been sighted off Fire Island and was expected to dock in New York not later than eight o clock that night This however was acceptable reading Lanyard had work to do which were better done before Karl and his crew found opportunity to communicate directly with their collaborators ashore work which it were unwise to initiate before nightfall lent a cloak of shadows to hoodwink the ever possible adventitious German spy Nor was he so fatuous as to fancy it would profit him to call before nine o clock at the house on West End Avenue No earlier might he hope to find Colonel the Honourable George Fleetwood Stanistreet near the end of his dinner and so in a mood approachable and receptive But there could be no harm in reconnaissance by daylight He whiled away the latter part of the afternoon in taxicabs by dint of frequent changes contriving in the most casual fashion imaginable to pass the Seventy ninth Street branch of the Wilhelmstrasse no less than four times Little rewarded these tactics other than a fairly accurate mental photograph of the building and its situation and a growing suspicion that the United States Government had profited nothing by England s lessons of early war days in respect of the one way to cope with resident enemy aliens The house stood upon a corner occupying half of an avenue block the northern half of which was the site of a towering apartment house in course of construction and loomed over its lesser neighbours a monumental monstrosity of architecture as formidable as a fortress its lower tiers of windows barred with iron substantial iron grilles ready to bar its main entrance even heavier gates guarding the carriage court in the side street In all a stronghold not easy for the most accomplished house breaker to force yet the heart of it was Lanyard s goal for there he believed Ekstrom under whatever nom de guerre lay hidden or if not Ekstrom at least a clear lead to his whereabouts Certainly that one could not be far from the powerful wireless station secretly maintained on the roof of this weird jumble of architectural periods its aerials cunningly hidden in the crowning atrocity of its minaret a station reputedly so powerful that it could receive Berlin s nightly outgivings of news and orders and in emergency transmit them to other secret stations in Cuba Mexico and Venezuela Yet the shrewdest scrutiny of eyes trained to detect police agents at sight however well disguised failed to espy one sign of any sort of espionage upon this nest of rattlesnakes Apparently its tenants came and went as they willed untroubled by and contemptuous of governmental surveillance A handsome limousine car pulled up at its carriage block as Lanyard drove by one time and a pretty woman exquisitely gowned alighted and was welcomed by hospitable front doors that opened before she could ring a woman Lanyard knew as one of the most daring diabolically clever and unscrupulous creatures of the Wilhelmstrasse one whose life would not have been worth an hour s purchase had she ventured to show herself in Paris London or Petrograd at any time since the outbreak of the war He drove on deep in amaze Indications were not wanting on the other hand that enemy spies maintained close watch upon the movements of those who frequented the house on West End Avenue A German agent whom Lanyard knew by sight was strolling by as his taxi rounded its corner and swung on down toward Riverside Drive This more modest residence possessed a brick walled garden at the back on the Ninety fifth Street side And if the top of the wall was crusted with broken glass in a fashion truly British it had a door and the door a lock And Lanyard made a note thereon And when he went home to dress for dinner he opened up the false bottom of one of his trunks and selected from a store of cloth wrapped bundles therein one which contained a small bunch of innocent looking keys whose true raison d etre was anything in the world but guileless Later he did himself very well at Delmonico s enjoying for the first time in many years a well balanced dinner faultlessly cooked and served amid quiet surroundings that carried memory back half a decade to the Paris that was the Paris that nevermore will be At nine precisely he paid off a taxicab at the corner of Ninety fifth Street While waiting on the doorstep of the corner house he raked the street right and left with searching glances and was somewhat reassured Apparently he called at an hour when the Boche pickets were off duty at the moment there was no pedestrian visible within a block s distance on either hand nobody that he could see skulked in the areas of the old fashioned brownstone houses across the way The neighbourhood was indeed quiet even for an upper West Side residential quarter A block over to the east Broadway was strident in the flood of its nocturnal traffic a like distance to the west Riverside Drive hummed with pleasure cars taking advantage of the first bland night of that belated spring But here now that the taxi had wheeled away there was never a car in sight nor even a strolling brace of sidewalk lovers The door opened revealing the same footman Colonel Stanistreet I will see sir Lanyard entered If you will be kind enough to be seated the footman suggested indicating a small waiting room And what name shall I say It had been Lanyard s intention to have himself announced simply as the author of that telegram from Edgartown Obscure impulse made him change his mind some premonition so tenuous as to defy analysis mister Anthony Ember Thank you sir After a little the footman returned If you will come this way sir He led toward the back of the house introducing Lanyard to a spacious apartment a library uncommonly well furnished rather more than comfortably yet without a trace of ostentation in its complete luxury a warm room a room intimately lived in a room in short characteristically British in atmosphere Waist high bookcases lined the walls broken on the right by a cheerful fireplace with a grate of glowing cannel coal in front of it a great club lounge upholstered like all the chairs in well used leather Opposite the chimney piece a handsome thing in carved oak a door was draped with a curtain that swung with it In the back of the room two long and wide French windows stood open to the night beyond them that garden whose wall had attracted Lanyard s attention There were a number of paintings portraits for the most part heavily framed with overhead picture lights In the middle of the room was a table desk broad and long supporting a shaded reading lamp On the far side of the table a young man sat writing with several dockets of papers arranged before him As Lanyard entered this one put down his pen pushed back his chair and came round the table a tallish well made young man dressed a shade too foppishly in spite of an unceremonious dinner coat his manner assured amiable unconstrained perhaps a little over tolerant mister Ember I believe he said in a voice studiously musical Yes Lanyard replied vaguely annoyed with himself because of an unreasoning resentment of this musical quality mister Blensop I am mister Blensop that one admitted gracefully And how may I have the pleasure of being of service He waved a hand toward an easy chair beside the table and resumed his own But Lanyard hesitated I wished to see Colonel Stanistreet mister Blensop looked up with an indulgent smile His face was round and smooth but for a perfectly docile little moustache his lips full and red his nose delicately chiselled but his eyes though large were set cannily close together Colonel Stanistreet is unfortunately not at home I am his secretary Yes said Lanyard still standing In that case I d be glad if you would be good enough to make an appointment for me with Colonel Stanistreet I am afraid he will not be home till very late to night but Then to morrow mister Blensop smiled patiently Colonel Stanistreet is a very busy man he uttered melodiously If you could let me know something about the nature of your business It is the King s said Lanyard bluntly The secretary went so far as to betray well bred surprise You are an Englishman mister Ember Yes And for all he knew to the contrary so Lanyard was I am Colonel Stanistreet s secretary the young man again suggested hopefully That is precisely why I ask you to make an appointment for me with your employer Lanyard retorted politely You won t say what you wish to see him about A trace of asperity marred the music of those tones mister Blensop further indicated distaste of the innuendo inherent in Lanyard s use of the word employer by delicately wrinkling his nose I am sorry Lanyard replied sufficiently The door behind him opened and the footman intruded Beg pardon mister Blensop Yes Walker The servant advanced to the table and proffered a visiting card on a tray mister Blensop took it arched pencilled brows over it To see me Walker The gentleman asked for Colonel Stanistreet sir H m You may show him in when I ring The footman retired mister Blensop looked up brightly bending the card with nervous fingers You were saying your business was I was not Lanyard replied with disarming good humour I m afraid that is something much too important and confidential to reveal even to Colonel Stanistreet s secretary if you don t mind my saying so mister Blensop did mind and betrayed vexation with an impatient little gesture which caused the card to fly from his fingers and fall face uppermost on the table Almost instantly he recovered it but not before Lanyard had read the name it bore Of course not said the secretary pleasantly rising But you understand my instructions are rigid I m sorry You refuse me the appointment Unless you can give me an inkling of your business or perhaps bring a letter of introduction I can do neither mister Blensop said Lanyard earnestly I have information of the gravest moment to communicate to the head of the British Secret Service in this country The secretary looked startled What makes you think Colonel Stanistreet is connected with the British Secret Service I don t think so I know it After a moment of hesitation mister Blensop yielded graciously If you can come back at nine to morrow morning mister Ember I ll do my best to persuade Colonel Stanistreet I repeat my business is of the most pressing nature Can t you arrange for me to see your employer to night It is utterly impossible Lanyard accepted defeat with a bow To morrow at nine then he said turning toward the door by which he had entered At nine said mister Blensop generous in triumph But do you mind going out this way He moved toward the curtained door opposite the chimney piece Lanyard paused shrugged and followed mister Blensop opened the door disclosing a vista of Ninety fifth Street Thank you mister Ember Good night he intoned The door closed with the click of a spring latch Lanyard stood alone in the street looking swiftly this way and that his hand closing upon that little bunch of keys in his pocket his humour lawless For the name inscribed on that card which mister Blensop had so carelessly dropped was one to fill Lanyard with consuming anxiety for better acquaintance with its present wearer Written in pencil with all the individual angularity of French chirography the name was Andre Duchemin XIII REINCARNATION It took a little time and patience but on his third essay Lanyard found a key which agreed with the lock He permitted himself a sigh of relief Ninety fifth Street was bare the door set flush with the outside of the wall afforded no concealment to the trespasser while the direct light of a street lamp at the corner made his lonely figure uncomfortably conspicuous Apparently however he had not been observed Gently pushing the door open he slipped in as gently closed it then for a full minute stood stirless spying out the lay of the land Fitting precisely his anticipations the garden discovered a fine English flavour it was well kept modest fragrant and best of all quite dark especially so in the shadow of the street wall Only a glimmer of starlight enabled him to pick out the course of a pebbled footpath A border of deep turf between this and the wall muffled his footsteps as he moved toward the back of the house The library windows deeply recessed opened on a low broad stoop of concrete with a pergola effect above and a few wicker pieces upon a grass mat underfoot Noiselessly Lanyard stepped across the low sill and paused in the cover of heavy draperies commanding a tolerably full view of the library if one somewhat unsatisfactory since the light within was by no means bright Still this circumstance had its advantages for him with his dark topcoat buttoned to the throat and its collar turned up to hide his linen he was confident he would not be detected unless he gave his presence away by an abrupt movement something which the Lone Wolf never made At the moment mister Blensop seemed to be engaged in the surprising occupation of discoursing upon art to his caller The latter occupied that chair which Lanyard had refused on the far side of the table Thus placed the lamplight masked more than revealed him throwing a dull glare into Lanyard s eyes His man sat in a pose of earnest attention bending forward a trifle to follow the exposition of mister Blensop who stood beneath a portrait on the wall between the chimney piece and the windows his attitude incurably graceful a hand on the switch controlling the picture light Apparently he had just finished speaking for he paused looking toward his guest with a quiet and intimate smile as he turned off the light And that s all there is to it he declared moving back to the table I see said the other thoughtfully Lanyard felt himself start almost uncontrollably rage swept through him storming brain and body like a black squall over a hill bound lake For the moment he could neither see or hear clearly nor think coherently For the voice of this latest incarnation of Andre Duchemin was the voice of Karl When the tumult of his senses subsided he heard Blensop saying I ll write it out for you and saw him pick up a pad and pencil and jot down a memorandum There you are he added ripping off the sheet and passing it across the table Now you can t go wrong I precious seldom do his caller commented drily I think Blensop began and checked sharply as the man Walker came into the room Beg pardon mister Blensop There was an accent of impatience in those beautifully modulated tones Well what is it now A lady to see you sir Blensop took the card from the proffered salver Never heard of her he announced brusquely at a glance She asked for Colonel Stanistreet or for me Colonel Stanistreet sir But when I said he was not at home she asked to see his secretary Any idea what she wants She didn t say sir but she seemed much distressed They always are H m Young and good looking Quite sir Dessay I may as well see her said mister Blensop wearily Show her in when I ring Walker shut himself out of the room It s just as well Blensop added to his caller You understand my clear fellow Assuredly The man got up but Blensop contrived exasperatingly to keep between him and the windows I m to be back at midnight Twelve sharp you ll be sure to find him here then Mind leaving by this emergency exit Not in the least Then good night my dear Monsieur Duchemin Was there a hint of irony in Blensop s employment of that style Lanyard half fancied there was but did not linger to analyse the impression Already the secretary had opened the side door In a bound Lanyard cleared the stoop then ran back to the door in the wall But with all his quickness he was all too slow already as he emerged to Ninety fifth Street his quarry was rounding the Avenue corner Defiant of discretion Lanyard gave chase at speed but though he had not thirty yards to cover again was baffled by the swiftness with which Karl got about He had still some distance to go when the peace of the quarter was shattered by a door that slammed like a pistol shot and with roaring motor and grinding gears a cab swung away from the curb in front of the Stanistreet residence and tore off down the Avenue Swearing petulantly in his disappointment Lanyard pulled up on the corner The number on the license plate was plainly revealed as the vehicle showed its back to the street lamp But what good was that to him He memorised it mechanically in mutinous appreciation of the fact that the taxi was setting a pace with which he could not hope to compete afoot The rumble of another motor car caught his ear and he looked round eagerly A second taxicab undoubtedly that which had brought the young woman now presumably closeted with mister Blensop was moving up into the place vacated by the first In two strides Lanyard was at its side Follow that taxi he cried number seventy six three eighty five Don t lose sight of it but don t pass it don t let them know we re following Engaged the driver growled Hang your engagement Here Lanyard pressed a golden eagle into the fellow s palm there will be another of those if you do as I say Le s go the driver agreed with resignation If the cab was moving before Lanyard could hop in and shut the door the other had already established a killing lead and though Lanyard s man demonstrated characteristic contempt for municipal regulations governing the speed of motor driven vehicles and racketed his own madly down the Avenue he was wholly helpless to do more than keep the tail lamp of the first in sight More than once that dull red eye seemed sardonically to wink Still Lanyard did not think Karl knew he was pursued His conveyance had passed the corner before Lanyard emerged from the side street There being no reason that Lanyard knew of why the spy should believe himself under suspicion his haste seemed most probably due to natural desire to avoid adventitious recognition coupled with no doubt other urgent business At Seventy second Street the chase turned east with Lanyard two blocks behind and for a few agonizing moments was altogether lost to him But at Broadway the tide of southbound traffic hindered it momentarily and it swung into that stream with its pursuer only a block astern Thereafter through a ride of another mile and a half the distance between the two was augmented or abbreviated arbitrarily by the rules of the road At one time less than two cab lengths separated them then a Ford driven Fordishly wandered vaguely out of a crosstown street and hesitated in the middle of the thoroughfare with precisely the air of a staring yokel on a first visit to the city and Lanyard s driver slammed on the emergency brake barely in time to escape committing involuntary but justifiable flivvercide When he was able once more to throw the gears into high the chase was a long block ahead They were entering Longacre Square before he made up that loss And at Forty fourth Street again a stream of east bound cars edged in between the two reducing Lanyard s driver to the verge of gibbering lunacy A car resembling Karl s was crossing Broadway at Forty second Street when Lanyard was still on Seventh Avenue north of the Times Building But only a minute later his driver pulled up in front of the Hotel Knickerbocker and Lanyard peering through the forward window saw the number seventy six three hundred eighty five on the license plate of a taxicab drawing away empty from the curb beneath the hotel canopy He tossed the second gold piece to the driver as his feet touched the sidewalk and shouldered through a cluster of men and women at the main entrance to the lobby That rendezvous of Broadway was fairly thronged despite the slack mid evening hour between the dinner and the supper crushes but Lanyard reviewed in vain the little knots of guests and loungers if Karl were among them he was nobody whom Lanyard had learned to know by sight on board the Assyrian With as little success he searched unobtrusively all public rooms on the main floor It was of course both possible and probable that Karl himself a guest of the hotel had crossed directly to the elevators and been whisked aloft to his room With this in mind Lanyard paused at the desk asked permission to examine the register and being accommodated was somewhat consoled if his chase had failed of its immediate objective it now proved not altogether fruitless A majority of the Assyrian survivors seemed to have elected to stop at the Knickerbocker One after another Lanyard scanning the entries found these names Edmund O Reilly Detroit Arturo Velasco Buenos Aires Bartlett Putnam Philadelphia Cecelia Brooke London Emil Dressier Geneve Half inclined to commit the imprudence of sending a name up to Miss Brooke any name but Andre Duchemin Michael Lanyard or Anthony Ember together with a message artfully worded to fix her interest without giving comfort to the enemy should it chance to go astray the adventurer hesitated by the desk and of a sudden was satisfied that such a move would be not only injudicious but waste of time for now that he paused to think of it he surmised that the young woman young and good looking on Walker s word who had called to see Colonel Stanistreet was none other than this same Cecelia Brooke What more natural than that she should make early occasion to consult the head of the British Secret Service in America A pity he had not waited there in the window If he had no doubt the mystery with which the girl had surrounded herself would be no more mystery to Lanyard he would have learned the secret of that paper cylinder as well as the part the girl had played in the intrigue for its possession and so be the better advised as to his own future conduct But in his insensate passion for revenge upon one who had all but murdered him he had forgotten all else but the moment s specious opportunity With a grunt of impatience Lanyard turned away from the desk and came face to face with Crane The Secret Service man was coming from the direction of the bar in company with Velasco O Reilly and Dressier Of the three last named but one looked Lanyard s way O Reilly and his gaze resting transiently on the countenance of Andre Duchemin minus the Duchemin beard passed on without perceptible glimmer of recognition Why not Why should it enter his head that one lived and had anticipated his own arrival in New York by twenty hours whom be believed to be buried many fathoms deep off Nantucket As for Crane his cool gray humorous eyes half hooded with their heavy lids favoured Lanyard with casual regard and never a tremor of interest or surprise but as he passed his right eye closed deliberately and with a significance not to be ignored To this Lanyard responded only with a look of blankest amaze Chatting with an air of subdued self congratulation pardonable in such as have come safe to land through many dangers of the deep the quartet strolled round the desk and boarded one of the elevators Not till its gate had closed did Lanyard stir Then he went away from there with all haste and cunning at his command The route through the cafe to Broadway offered the speediest and least conspicuous of exits From the side door of the hotel he plunged directly into the mouth of the Subway kiosk and chance favouring him managed to purchase a ticket and board a southbound local train an instant before its doors ground shut Believing Crane would take the next elevator down once he had seen the others safely in their rooms Lanyard was content to let him find the lobby destitute of ghosts to let him fume and wonder and think himself perhaps mistaken The last thing he desired was entanglement with the American Secret Service For Crane he entertained personal respect and temperate liking thought the man socially an amusing creature professionally a deadly peril to one who had a feud to pursue Leaving the train at Grand Central the adventurer passed through the back ways of the Terminus into the Hotel Biltmore upstairs to its lobby thence out by the Vanderbilt Avenue entrance walking through Forty fourth Street to Fifth Avenue where he chartered a taxicab gave the address of his lodgings and lay back in the corner of its seat satisfied he had successfully eluded pursuit and very very grateful to the Subway system for the facilities it afforded fugitives like himself through its warren of underground passages One thing troubled him however without respite the Brooke girl was on his conscience To her he owed an accounting of his stewardship of that trust which she had reposed in him It was intolerable in his understanding that she should be permitted to go one unnecessary hour in ignorance of the truth about that business the truth that is as far as he himself knew it If through Crane or in some unforseeable fashion she were to learn that Andre Duchemin lived she would think him faithless If she knew that Duchemin had been one with Michael Lanyard the Lone Wolf she would not be surprised But that too was intolerable even the Lone Wolf had his code of honour Again if she remained in ignorance of the fact that Lanyard had escaped drowning she would continue to believe her secret at the bottom of the sea with him whereas in the hands of the enemy in the possession of Karl and his confederates it was potentially Heaven only knew how dangerous a weapon Abruptly Lanyard reflected that at least one doubt had been eliminated by that encounter in the Knickerbocker It was barely possible that Karl had gone to the bar on entering and added himself to Crane s party but it was hardly creditable in Lanyard s consideration He was convinced that whether or not Velasco O Reilly and Dressier were parties to the Hun conspiracy none of these was Karl As for the Brooke matter he felt it incumbent upon him immediately to find some safe means of communicating with the girl She could be trusted not to betray him to the police however much she might at first incline to doubt him But he would persuade her of his sincerity never fear The telephone offered one solution of his difficulty an agency non committal enough provided one were at pains not to call from one s private station to which the call might be traced back With this in mind he stopped and dismissed his taxicab at Fifty seventh Street and Sixth Avenue and availed himself of a coin box telephone booth in the corner druggist s The experience that followed was nothing out of the ordinary Lanyard connected with the Knickerbocker promptly with the customary expenditure of patience laboriously spelled out the name B r double o k e and was told to hold the wire Several minutes later he began to agitate the receiver hook and was eventually rewarded with the advice that the Knickerbocker operator being informed his party was in the rest runt was having her paged Still later the central operator told him his five minutes was up and consented to continue the connection only on deposit of an additional nickel Eventually in sequel to more abuse of the hook he received this response from the Knickerbocker switchboard Wait a min te can t you Here s your party Lanyard was surprised at the eagerness with which he cried Hello A click answered and a bland voice which was not the voice he had expected to hear Hello That you Jack He said wearily I am waiting to speak with Miss Cecelia Brooke Oh then there must be some mistake This is Miss Crooke speaking Lanyard uttered a strangled Sorry and hung up abandoning further effort as hopeless That matter would have to stand over till morning Time now pressed it was nearly eleven he had a rendezvous with Destiny to keep at midnight and meant to be more than punctual Walking to his apartment house he proceeded to establish an alibi by entering through the public hallway and registering with the telephone attendant a call for seven o clock the next morning In the course of the next half hour Lanyard let himself quietly out of the private door slipped around the block and boarded a Riverside Drive bus Alighting at Ninety third Street he walked two blocks north on the Drive turned east and without misadventure admitted himself a second time to the Stanistreet garden XIV DEFAMATION It was hardly possible to watch mister Blensop functioning in his vocational capacity without reflecting on that cruel injustice which Nature only too often practises upon her offspring in secreting most praiseworthy qualities within fleshy envelopes of hopelessly frivolous cast The flowing gestures of this young man his fluting accents poetic eyes and modestly ingratiating moustache the preciosity of his taste in dress assorted singularly with an austere devotion to duty rare if unaffected Beyond question whether or not naturally a man of studious and conscientious temper mister Blensop figured to admiration in the role of such an one Seated the shaded lamplight an aureole for his fair young head he wrought industriously with a beautiful gold mounted fountain pen for fully five minutes after Lanyard had stolen into the draped recess of the French window pausing only now and again to take a fresh sheet of paper or consult one of the sheaves of documents that lay before him At length however he hesitated with pen lifted and abstracted gaze focussed upon vacancy shook a bewildered head and rose moving directly toward the windows For as long as thirty breathless seconds Lanyard remained in doubt there was the barest chance that in his preoccupation Blensop might pass through to the garden without noticing that dark figure flattened against the inswung half of the window in the dense shadow of the portiere Otherwise the game was altogether up Lanyard could see no way to avoid the necessity of staggering Blensop with a blow racing for freedom abandoning utterly further effort to learn the motive of Karl s impersonation of Duchemin He gathered himself together waited poised in readiness for any eventuality and blessed his lucky stars to find his apprehensions idle Three paces from the windows mister Blensop made it plain that he was after all not minded to stroll in the garden Pausing he swung a high backed wing chair round to face the corner of the room switched on a reading lamp sat down and selected a volume of some work of reference from the well stocked book shelves For several minutes seated within arm s length of the trespasser he studied intently then with a cluck of satisfaction replaced the volume extinguished the light and went back to his writing But presently he checked with a vexed little exclamation shook his pen impatiently and fixed it with a frown of pained reproach But that did no good The cussedness of the inanimate was strong in this pen since its reservoir was quite empty it mulishly refused more service without refilling With a long suffering sigh mister Blensop found a filler in one of the desk drawers and unscrewed the nib of the pen This accomplished he paused listened for a moment with head cocked intelligently to one side dropped the dismembered implement and got up alertly At the same moment the door to the hallway opened and two women entered apparently sisters one a lady of mature and distinguished charm the other an equally prepossessing creature much her junior the one strongly animated with intelligent interest in life the other a listless prey to habitual ennui To these fluttered mister Blensop offering to relieve them of their wraps Permit me missus Arden he addressed the elder woman who tolerated him dispassionately And missus Stanistreet I say aren t you a bit late Frightfully assented missus Stanistreet in a weary voice It must be all of midnight Hardly that Adele said missus Arden with a humorous glance Dinner the play supper and home before twelve commented Blensop shocked I say that is going some you know George would insist on hurrying home the young wife complained Frightfully tiresome We were so comfy at the Ritz too The Crystal Room Dissembled envy poisoned Blensop s accents Frightfully interestin everybody was there I did so want to dance missed you Arthur I say you didn t did you really Poor mister Blensop missus Arden interjected with just a hint of malice What a pity you must be chained down by inexorable duty while we fly round and amuse ourselves I must not complain Blensop stated with humility becoming in a dutiful martyr a pose which he saw fit quickly to discard as another man came briskly into the room Ah good evening Colonel Stanistreet Evening Blensop With a brusque nod Colonel Stanistreet went straightway to the desk stopping there to take up and examine the work upon which his secretary had been engaged a gentleman considerably older than his wife of grave and sturdy cast with the habit of standing solidly on his feet and giving undivided attention to the matter in hand Anything of consequence turned up he enquired abstractedly running through the sheets of pen blackened paper Three persons called Blensop admitted discreetly One returns at midnight Stanistreet threw him a keen look Eh he said making swift inference and turned to his wife and sister in law It is nearly twelve now Forgive me if I hurry you off Patience said missus Arden indulgently Not for worlds would I hinder your weighty affairs dear old thing but I sleep more sound o nights when I know my trinkets are locked up securely in your safe With a graceful gesture she unfastened a magnificent necklace and deposited it on the desk Frightful rot her sister commented from the doorway As if anybody would dare break in here Why not missus Arden enquired calmly stripping her fingers of their rings With a watchman patrolling the grounds all night Letty is sensible Stanistreet interrupted Howson s faithful enough and these American police dependable but second storey men happen in the best guarded neighbourhoods Be advised Adele leave your things here with Letty s No fear his wife returned coolly Too frightfully weird She drifted across the threshold then hesitated a pretty figure of disdainful discontent But really Colonel Stanistreet is right Blensop interposed vivaciously What do you imagine I heard to night The Lone Wolf is in America What is that you say missus Arden demanded sharply The Lone Wolf Fact Have it on most excellent authority The Lone Wolf missus Stanistreet drawled If you ask me I think the Lone Wolf nothing in the world but a scapegoat for police stupidity You wouldn t say that missus Arden retorted if you had lived in Paris as long as I There in the dear old days we paid that rogue too heavy a tax not to believe in him Frightful nonsense insisted the other I m off Night Arthur Shall you be long George Oh half an hour or so her husband responded absently as she disappeared With a little gesture consigning her jewellery heaped upon the desk to the care of her brother in law missus Arden uttered good nights and followed her sister Blensop bowed her out respectfully shut the door and returned to the desk What s this about the Lone Wolf Stanistreet enquired sitting down to con the papers more intently Oh Blensop laughed lightly I was merely repeating the blighter s own assertion I mean to say he boasted he was the Lone Wolf Who boasted he was the Lone Wolf Chap who called to night giving the name of Duchemin Andre Duchemin Had French passports and letters from the Home Office recommending him rather highly Useful creature one would fancy with his knowledge of the right way to go about the wrong thing What Ought to be especially helpful to us in hunting down the Hun over here Is this the man who returns at midnight Yes sir I thought it best to make the appointment Why He said he had crossed on the Assyrian said it significantly you know I fancied he might be the person you have been expecting Stanistreet looked up with a frown Hardly he said if that is he is really what he claims to be I wonder how he came by those letters Does seem odd doesn t it sir A confessed criminal An extraordinary man by all accounts Those other callers Nobody of importance I should say A man who gave his name as Ember and got a bit shirty when I asked his business Told him you might consent to see him at nine in the morning And the other A young woman deuced pretty girl also reticent What was her name Brooke that was it Cecelia Brooke The devil Stanistreet exclaimed dropping the papers What did you say to her What could I say sir She refused to divulge a word about her business with us I told her Warned by a gesture from Colonel Stanistreet Blensop broke off Walker was opening the door Well Walker A mister Duchemin sir says mister Blensop made an appointment with you for twelve to night Show him in please The footman shut himself out Blensop clutched nervously at missus Arden s jewels Hadn t I better put these in the safe first No no time Stanistreet opened a drawer of the desk Here and closed it as Blensop hastily swept the jewellery into it Safe enough there as long as he doesn t know at all events But don t forget to put them away after he goes No sir Again the door opened Walker announced mister Duchemin Stanistreet rose in his place A man strode in with the assurance of one who has discounted a cordial welcome Through the gap which he had quietly created between the portiere and the side of the window Lanyard stared hungrily and for the second time that night damned heartily the inadequate light in the library The impostor s face barely distinguishable in the up thrown penumbra of the lampshade wore a beard a rather thick dark beard of negligent abundance after a mode popular among Frenchmen above which his features were an indefinite blur Lanyard endeavoured with ill success to identify the fellow by his carriage there was a perceptible suggestion of a military strut but that is something hardly to be termed distinctive in these days Otherwise he was tall quite as tall as Lanyard and had much the same character of body slender and lithe But he was Karl beyond question confederate and murderer of Baron von Harden the man who had thrown the light bomb to signal the U boat the brute with whom Lanyard had struggled on the boat deck of the Assyrian though the latter in the confusion of that struggle had thought the German s beard a masking handkerchief of black silk Now by that same token he was no member of that smoking room coterie upon which Lanyard s suspicions had centered On the other hand any number of passengers had worn beards not a few of much the same mode as that sported by this nonchalant fraud Vainly Lanyard cudgelled his wits to aid a laggard memory haunted by a feeling that he ought to know this man instantly even in so poor a light Something in his habit something in that insouciance which so narrowly escaped insolence was at once strongly reminiscent and provokingly elusive Pausing a little ways within the room the fellow clicked heels and bowed punctiliously in Continental fashion from the hips Colonel Stanistreet I believe he said in a sonorous voice Karl s unmistakable voice chief of the American bureau of the British Secret Service I am Colonel Stanistreet that gentleman admitted And you sir I have adopted the name of Andre Duchemin the impostor stated With permission I retain it Colonel Stanistreet inclined his head slightly As you will Pray be seated He dropped back into his chair while Karl with a murmur of acknowledgment again took the armchair on the far side of the desk where the lamp stood between him and the secret watcher My secretary tells me you have letters of introduction Here Calmly Karl produced and offered those purloined papers You will smoke Stanistreet indicated a cigarette box and leaned back to glance through the letters During a brief pause Blensop busied himself with collecting together the documents which had occupied him and began reassorting them while Karl helping himself to a cigarette smoked with manifest enjoyment These seem to be in order Stanistreet observed I note from this code letter that your true name is Michael Lanyard you were once a professional French thief known as The Lone Wolf but have since displayed every indication of desire to reform your ways and have been of considerable use to the Intelligence Office I am desired to employ your services in my discretion contingent pardon me upon your continued good behaviour Precisely assented Karl Proceed Monsieur Duchemin It is an affair of some delicacy Do we speak alone Colonel Stanistreet mister Blensop is my confidential secretary Oh no objection Still if I may venture the suggestion those windows open upon a garden I take it Yes Blensop be good enough to close the windows Certainly sir Stepping delicately Blensop moved toward the end of the room Again Lanyard was confronted with the alternatives of incontinent flight or attempting to remain undetected through the adoption of an expedient of the most desperate audacity He had prepared against such contingency he did not mean to go but the feasibility of his contemplated manoeuvre depended entirely upon chance its success in any event was forlornly problematic Karl remained hidden from him by the lamp so he from Karl Colonel Stanistreet facing his caller sat half turned away from the windows Everything rested with Blensop s choice which of the two windows he would elect first to close A right handed man he turned as Lanyard had foreseen to the right and momentarily disappeared in the recess of the farther window In the same instant Lanyard slipped noiselessly from behind the portiere and dropped into that capacious wing chair which Blensop had thoughtfully placed for him some time since Thus seated making himself as small and still as possible he was wholly concealed from all other occupants of the library but Blensop and even this last was little likely to discover him He did not He closed and latched the farther window then that wherein Lanyard had lurked and ambled back into the room with never a glance toward that shadowed corner which held the wing chair And Lanyard drew a deep breath if a quiet one Behind him the conversation had continued without break It was true he could see nothing but he could hear all that was said he had missed no syllable and now every second was informing him to his profit Your secretary no doubt has told you I am a survivor of the Assyrian disaster Yes You were I believe expecting a certain communication of extraordinary character by the Assyrian to be brought that is by an agent of the British Secret Service After an almost imperceptible pause Stanistreet said evenly It is possible A communication in fact of such character that it was impossible to entrust it to the mails or to cable transmission even in code And if so sir And you are aware that of the two gentlemen entrusted with the care of this document one was drowned when the Assyrian went down and the other so seriously injured that he has not yet recovered consciousness but was transferred directly from the pier to a hospital when the Saratoga docked What then Monsieur Duchemin Colonel Stanistreet said the impostor deliberately I have that communication I will ask you not to question me too closely as to how it came into my possession I have it that is sufficient If you possess any document which you conceive to be so valuable to the British Government monsieur and consequently to the Allied cause I have every confidence in your intention to deliver it to me without delay A note of mild derision crept into the accents of Karl I have every intention of so doing my dear sir But you must appreciate I have incurred considerable personal danger hardship and inconvenience in taking good care of this document in seeing that it did not fall into the wrong hands in short in bringing it safely here to you to night A slightly longer pause prefaced Stanistreet s reply something which he delivered in measured tones I am able to promise you the British Government will show due appreciation of your disinterested services Monsieur Duchemin Not disinterested not that the cheat protested Gentlemen of my kidney sir seldom put themselves out except in lively anticipation of favours to come Be good enough to make yourself more clear Cheerfully I possess this document I understand its character is such that Germany would pay a round price for it But I am a good patriot In spite of the fact that nobody knew I possessed it in spite of the fact that I need only have quietly taken it to Seventy ninth Street to night Monsieur Duchemin Stanistreet s voice was icy Your price Sorry you feel that way about it said Karl with ill concealed insincerity You must know thieving is no more what it once was Even I too often am put to it to make both ends If you please sir how much Ten thousand dollars Silence greeted this demand a lull that to Lanyard seemed endless For in his fury he was trembling so that he feared lest his agitation betray him The very walls before his eyes seemed to quake in sympathy He was aware of the ache of swollen veins in his temples his teeth hurt with the pressure put upon them his breath came heavily and his nails were digging painfully into his palms Blensop Sir How much have we on hand in the emergency fund Between ten and twelve thousand dollars sir Intuition monsieur is an indispensable item in the equipment of a successful chevalier d Industrie So at least the good novelists tell us Open the safe Blensop and fetch me ten thousand dollars Very good sir I presume you won t object to satisfying me that you really have this document before I pay you your price It is this which makes it a pleasure to deal with an Englishman monsieur one may safely trust his word of honour Indeed Permit me here is the document Use that magnifying glass I see by your elbow monsieur take your time satisfy yourself Thanks I mean to Another break in the dialogue during which the eavesdropper heard an odd sound a sort of muffled swishing ending in a slight thud then the peculiar metallic whine of a combination dial rapidly manipulated finally the dull clank of bolts falling back into their sockets Your coffre fort what do you say strong box safe is cleverly concealed Colonel Stanistreet There was no direct reply but after a moment Stanistreet announced quietly This seems to be an authentic paper Monsieur Duchemin what knowledge precisely have you of the nature of this document Surely monsieur cannot have overlooked the circumstance that its seals were intact True Stanistreet admitted Still I trust Monsieur does not question my good faith Why not Stanistreet enquired drily Monsieur Oh damn your play acting sir If you can be capable of one infamy you are capable of more None the less you are right about an Englishman s word here is your money Count it and get out Thanks the impostor s tone was an impertinently exact imitation of Stanistreet s I mean to Permit me to excuse myself Stanistreet added and Lanyard heard the muffled scrape of chair legs on the rug as the Englishman got up Gladly the spy returned and ten thousand thanks monsieur The secretary intoned melodiously This way Monsieur Duchemin if you please Pardon Is it material which way I leave What do you mean Stanistreet demanded I should be far easier in my mind if monsieur would permit me to go by way of his garden rather than run the risk of his front door What s this In these little affairs monsieur I try to make it a rule to avoid covering the same ground twice You have the insolence to imply I would lend myself to treachery I beg monsieur s pardon very truly for suggesting such a thing Nevertheless one cannot well be overcautious when one is a hunted man Blensop be good enough to see this man out through the garden Yes sir Again monsieur my thanks Good night said Stanistreet curtly Blensop passed Lanyard s chair unlatched and opened the window and stood aside An instant later Karl joined him swung on a heel facing back clicked heels again and bowed mockingly Apparently he got no response for he laughed quietly then turned and went out through the window Blensop mincing after With a struggle Lanyard mastered the temptation to dash after the spy overtake and overpower him expose and give him up to justice Only the knowledge that by remaining quiescent by biding his time he might be enabled to redeem his word to the Brooke girl gave him strength to be still But he suffered exquisitely maddened by the defamation imposed upon his nick name of a thief by this brazen impostor Nor was wounded amour propre mended by an exclamation in the room behind his chair the accents of Colonel Stanistreet thick with contempt The Lone Wolf Faugh XV RECOGNITION Presently Blensop came back closed the window and passed blindly by Lanyard his reappearance saluted by Stanistreet in tones that shook with contained temper You saw that animal outside the walls Mildly injured surprise was indicated in the reply Surely sir And locked the door after him Yes sir securely Howson anywhere about I didn t see him Daresay he s prowling somewhere within call Do you wish to speak to him No But you might if you see anything of him tell him to keep an extra eye open to night I don t trust this self styled Lone Wolf Naturally not sir under the circumstances Stanistreet acknowledged this with an irritated snort No matter he thought aloud if it has cost us a pretty penny we have got this safe in hand at last I ve not had too much sleep I can promise you since the report came through of Bartholomew s death and Thackeray s disablement Nor am I satisfied that this Monsieur Duchemin came by the document fairly confound his impudence If he hadn t put me on honour tacitly I d not hesitate an instant about informing the police Rather chancy course to take in this business what I don t know That Yankee invention known as the frame up would easily make America too small for the Lone Wolf without the British Secret Service ever being mentioned in the matter Yes but suppose the beast knows the contents of this paper suspects the authorship of the frame up as he instinctively would and blabs Messages have been unsealed and copied and resealed before this That one consideration ties my hands Here my boy take this and put it in the safe and don t forget missus Arden s things of course Good night Trust me sir Good night A door closed with a slight jar and for half a minute the room was so positively quiet that Lanyard was beginning to wonder if Blensop himself had gone out with his employer when he heard a low and musical chuckle followed by a soft clashing as the secretary scooped missus Arden s jewellery out of the desk drawer Itching with curiosity Lanyard turned with infinite care and peered round the wing of the chair thus gaining a view of the wall farthest from the street Blensop remaining invisible Lanyard s interest centred immediately upon the safe the ingenuity of whose concealment had excited Karl s favourable comment and with much excuse One of the portraits that upon whose merits Blensop had descanted to Karl earlier in the night was Lanyard saw so mounted upon a solid panel of wood that by means of hidden mechanism it could be moved sidelong from its frame uncovering the face of a safe built into the wall This last now stood open its door swung out toward Lanyard showing a simple arrangement of dials and locks with which he was on terms of contemptuous familiarity only the veriest tyro of a cracksman would want more than a good ear and a subtle sense of touch in order to open it without knowledge of the combination With all its reputation for efficiency and astuteness the British Secret Service entrusted its mysteries to an antiquated contraption such as this Humming a blithe little air Blensop moved into Lanyard s field of vision and stopped between him and the safe deftly pigeonholing therein the docketed papers and missus Arden s jewels Then closing the door he shot its bolts gave the dial a brisk twirl located a lever in the side of the frame and thrust it into its socket With the same swish and thud which had puzzled Lanyard at first hearing the portrait slipped back into place Rounding on a heel Blensop paused head to one side a slight frown shadowing his bland countenance and stood briefly rooted in some perplexity of obscure origin Twice he shook a peevish head then smiled radiantly and brought his hands together in an audible clap I have it he cried in delight and dancing briskly toward the desk once more disappeared Now what was this which mister Blensop so spontaneously had and from the having of which he derived so much apparently innocent enjoyment Wanting an answer Lanyard settled back in disgust then sat sharply forward gaze riveted to the near sash of the adjacent window In showing Karl out Blensop had moved the portieres exposing more glass than previously had been visible Now this mirrored darkly to the adventurer a somewhat distorted vision of Blensop standing over the desk seemingly employed in no more amusing occupation than filling his fountain pen But undoubtedly he was in the highest spirits for the lilt of his humming rose sweet and clear and ever louder To this accompaniment he pocketed his pen two stepped to the windows drew the portieres jealously close returned to the desk switched off the reading lamp and left the room completely dark but for a dim glow from the ash filmed embers of the fire But before he went out the secretary interrupted his humming to laugh with a mischievous elan which completely confounded Lanyard He was not unacquainted with the Blensop type but the secret glee which seemed to animate this specimen was something far beyond his comprehension As the door softly closed Lanyard moved silently across the room and bent an ear to its panels meanwhile drawing over his hands a pair of thin white kid gloves From beyond came no sound other than a faint creaking of stair treads quickly silenced Opening the door Lanyard peered out finding the hallway deserted and dimly lighted by a single bulb of little candle power at its far end then scouted out as far as the foot of the stairs listened there for a little hearing no sounds above and reconnoitred through the other living rooms at length returning to the library persuaded he was alone on the ground floor of the house A Yale lock was fixed to the library side of the door Lanyard released its catch insuring freedom from interruption on the part of anybody who lacked the key crossed to the other side door left this on the latch and having thus provided an avenue for escape turned attention to business in brief to the safe Turning on the picture light he found and operated the lever with his other hand so restraining the action of the panel that it moved aside without perceptible jar Then with an ear to that smooth cold face of enamelled steel he began to manipulate the combination From within the door a succession of soft clicks and knocks punctuated the muted whine of the dial speaking a language only too intelligible to the trained hearing of a thief synchronous breaks and resistance in the action of the dial conveyed additional information through the medium of supersensitive finger tips Within two minutes he had learned all he needed to know and standing back twirled the knob right and left with a confident hand At its fourth stop he heard the dull bump of released tumblers grasped the handle and twisted it strongly The door swung open Systematically Lanyard searched the pigeonholes emptying all but one examining minutely their contents without finding that slender roll of paper Mystified he hesitated The thing of course was somewhere there only hidden more cunningly than he had hoped It was possible even probable that Blensop had stowed the cylinder away in a secret compartment But the interior arrangement was disconcertingly simple Lanyard saw no sign of waste space in which such a drawer might be secreted Unless to be sure one of the pigeonholes had a false back He began a fresh examination again emptying each pigeonhole and sounding its rear wall without result till there remained only that in which Blensop had placed the Arden jewels It was necessary to move these but Lanyard long withheld his hand reluctant to touch them for that same reason which had influenced him to avoid them in his first search Jewels such as these he both worshipped and desired with the passionate adoration of connoisseur and lover in one He feared violently the temptation of physical contact with such stuff For his was no thief s errand to night but a matter as he conceived it of his private honour something apart and distinct from the code of rogue s ethics which guided his professional activities He had pledged his word to Cecelia Brooke to keep safe for her that cylinder of paper to return it upon her demand for whatsoever disposition she might choose to make of it It was no concern of his what that choice might turn out to be any more than it was his affair if the document were a paper of international importance But she must and should if act of his could compass it be given opportunity to redeem her word of honour if as one believed that likewise were involved in the fate of the document He had stolen into this house like a thief because he had given his pledge and perforce had been made false to that pledge because he had been despoiled of the concrete evidence of the trust reposed unasked in him and because he had learned that his spoiler was to meet Stanistreet in this room at midnight He was here solely to make good his word to take away that cylinder could he find it and to return it to the girl not to thieve Never that Slowly reluctantly inevitably he put forth his hand and selected from among those brilliant symbols of his soul s profound damnation the necklace a rope of diamonds consummately matched a rivulet of frozen fire no single stone less lovely than another Admirable he whispered Oh admirable Hesitant to do this thing which to him by the strange standard of his warped code spelled dishonour he would and he would not and while he paltered was visited by an oddly vivid memory of the clear and candid eyes of Cecelia Brooke seemed veritably to see them searching his own with their look of grieving wonder the eyes of one woman who had reckoned him worthy of her trust Almost he won victory in this fight he was foredoomed to lose Under the level and steadfast regard of those eyes his hand went out to replace the necklace moved unsteadily faltered Beyond the windows an incautious footfall sounded In the darkness out there someone blundered into a piece of wicker furniture and disturbed it with a small scraping sound all but inaudible but to the thief as loud as the blast of a police whistle Instantly and instinctively in two simultaneous gestures Lanyard dropped the necklace into an inner pocket of his coat and switched off the picture light With hands now as steady and sure as they had been vacillant a moment since he closed the safe door noiselessly shot its bolts and was yards away crouching behind an armchair before the man outside had ceased to fumble with the window fastenings If this were the watchman Howson doubtless he would be satisfied with finding the room dark and apparently untenanted and would go off upon his rounds unsuspecting If he did not or if he noticed the displaced panel then would come Lanyard s time to break cover and run for it With a faint creak one of the windows swung inward Curtain rings clashed dully on their poles Someone came through the portieres and paused pulling them together behind him The beam of an electric flash lamp lanced the gloom and its spotlight danced erratically round the walls Now there was no more thought of flight in Lanyard s humour but rather a firm determination to stand his ground This was no night watchman but a housebreaker one with no more title to trespass upon those premises than himself and at that an unskilled hand at such work the rawest of amateurs practising methods as clumsy and childish as any actor playing at burglary on a stage before a simple minded audience The noise he made on entering alone proved that then this fatuous business with the flash lamp And as he moved inward from the windows it became evident that he had not even had the wit to close the portieres completely a violet glimmer of starlight shone in through a deep triangular gap between them at the top For all that the intruder seemed to know what he wanted and where to seek it betrayed a nice acquaintance with the room proceeding directly to the safe picked out by his lamp Arrived beneath it he uttered a low sound which might have been interpreted as surprise due to finding the panel already out of place If so surprise evidently roused in him no suspicion that all might not be well On the contrary he quite calmly located and turned the switch controlling the picture light Immediately as its rays gushed down and disclosed the man Lanyard rose boldly from his place in hiding Now there was no more need for concealment now was his enemy delivered into his hands The man was Karl His back to Lanyard unconscious of that one s catlike approach the spy put up his flash lamp searched in a waistcoat pocket and produced a slip of paper and bent his face close to the combination dial studying its figures but abruptly like a startled animal whirled round to face the windows One of the sashes was thrown back roughly and a figure clad in the gray livery of a private watchman parted the portieres and entered the library Everything all right in here mister Blensop Lanyard saw the sheen of blue steel in the hands of Karl and leaped too late even as he fell upon the spy s shoulders the pistol exploded The watchman reeled back with a choking cry caught wildly at the portieres and dragged them down with him as he fell His screams of agony made hideous the night And the second cry was no more than uttered when Lanyard even in the heat of his struggle heard sounds indicating that already the household was alarmed But the door would hold for a while it was not probable that the first to come downstairs would think to bring with him the key Time enough to think of escape when Lanyard had settled his score with this one no light undertaking not only was the score a long one longer than Lanyard then dreamed but as he had learned to his cost the man was an antagonist of skill and strength not to be despised Nevertheless aided by the surprise of his onslaught Lanyard succeeded in disarming the spy forcing him to drop the pistol at the outset and through attacking from behind had him at a further disadvantage For all that he found his hands full till by a trick of jiu jitsu he wrenched one of the fellow s arms behind him so roughly as almost to dislocate it at the shoulder and forcing the forearm up toward his shoulder blades held him temporarily helpless Be still you murderous canaille he growled or must I tear your arm from its socket Still I say Karl uttered a grunt of pain and ceased to struggle Pinning him against the bookcase Lanyard hastily rifled his pockets at the first dip bringing forth a thin sheaf of American bank notes with the figures one thousand dollars conspicuous on the uppermost Ten thousand dollars he said grimly precisely my fee for the use of my name to say nothing of its abuse A torrent of untranslatable German blasphemy answered him Intelligible was the half frantic demand Who the devil are you Take a look assassin see for yourself Lanyard twisted the spy around to face him holding him helpless against the wall with a knee in his middle and a hand gripping his throat inexorably Do you know me now the man you thought you d drowned a hundred fathoms deep Blows thundered on the hallway door Neither heeded The spy was staring into Lanyard s face his eyes starting with horror and affright Lanyard he gasped Good God will you never die Never by your hand Lanyard began but stopped sharply For a moment he glared incredulously and in that moment knew his enemy Ekstrom he cried and the man at his mercy winced and quailed The din in the hallway grew louder Voices cried out for the key Somebody threw himself against the door so heavily that it shook The emergency forced itself upon Lanyard s consciousness would not be denied Its dilemma seemed calculated to unseat his reason If he lingered he was lost Either he must grant this creature new lease of life or be caught and pay the penalty of murder for an execution as surely just as any in the history of mankind It was bitter too bitter to have come to this his hour so long desired so long deferred so arduously sought and have the fruits of it snatched from his craving grasp He could not bring himself to this renunciation slowly his fingers tightened on the other s throat Driven to desperation by the light of madness that began to flicker in Lanyard s eyes the Prussian abruptly put all he had of might and fury into one final effort threw Lanyard off and in turn attacked him fighting like a lunatic for footroom for space enough to turn and make for the windows In spite of all he could do Lanyard saw the man work away from the wall and manoeuvre his back toward the windows then he flew at him with redoubled fury driving home blow after blow that beat down Ekstrom s guard and sent him staggering helplessly till an uppercut swinging in under his uplifted forearms put an end to the combat Ekstrom shot backward half a dozen feet stumbled over the prostrate body of the watchman and crashed headlong into the windows going down in a shower of shattered glass In one and the same instant Lanyard darted back and dropped upon his knees in the shadow of the club lounge and the door to the hallway slammed open A knot of men to the number of half a dozen tumbling into the library saw that figure floundering amid the ruins of the window and made for it passing on the other side of the lounge between it and the fireplace Unseen Lanyard rose ran crouching across the room found the side door opened it just far enough to permit the passage of his body and drew it to behind him Ninety fifth Street was a lonely lane of midnight quiet He sped across it like the shadow of a cloud wind hunted XVI AU PRINTEMPS In those days New York nights were long this was still young when Lanyard sauntered sedately from a side street and stopped on a corner of Broadway in the Nineties he had not long to wait ere a southbound taxicab hove in sight and sheered over to the curb in answer to his signal It was still something short of one o clock when he was set down at his door Wearily he let himself in by the private entrance made a light and without troubling even to discard his overcoat threw himself into a chair Leaden depression weighed down his heart and the flavour of failure was as aloes in his mouth Thrice within an hour he had fallen short of his promises to Cecelia Brooke to himself to his idee fixe His three chances to redeem his word to the girl to measure up to his queer criterion of honour to rid his world of Ekstrom all had slipped through fingers seemingly too infirm to profit by them He felt of a sudden old old and tired and lonely The uses of his world how weary stale flat and unprofitable What was his life An emptiness Himself A shuttlecock the helpless sport of his own failings a vain thing alternately strutting and stumbling now swaggering in the guise of an avenger self appointed now sneaking in the shameful habiliments of a felon self condemned What had prevented his dealing out to Ekstrom the punishment he had so well earned That insatiable lust for loot of his But for that damning evidence against him of the stolen necklace in his pocket he might have had his will of Ekstrom and justified himself when discovered by proving that he had merely done justice to a thief who sold what he had stolen and stole back to steal again what he had sold Self contempt attacked self conceit like an acid He saw Michael Lanyard a sorry figure sitting stultified with self pity crying over spilt milk Impatiently he shook himself What though he had to night forfeited his chances He could nay would make others He must To what end Would life be sweeter if one found a way to restore to Cecelia Brooke her precious document and to smuggle back to missus Arden her pilfered diamonds Would this deadly ache of loneliness be less poignant with Ekstrom dead With lack lustre eyes he looked round that cheerless room reckoning its perfunctory pretense of comfort the forlornest mockery To lodgings such as this he was condemned for life to an interminable sequence of transient quarters sordid or splendid rich or mean alike in this common quality of hollow loneliness His aimless gaze wandered toward the door opening on the public hallway and became fixed upon a triangular shape of white paper the half of an envelope tucked between door and sill Presently he rose and got the thing not until he touched it quite persuaded he was not the victim of an optical hallucination A square envelope of creamy paper it was superscribed simply in a hand strange to him Anthony Ember Esq with the address of his apartment house Tearing the envelope he found within a double sheet of plain notepaper bearing a message of five words penned hastily Au Printemps one o clock Please Nothing else not another word or pen scratch Opening the door Lanyard hailed the hall attendant a sleepy and not over intelligent negro When did this come for me Bout anour ago Mistuh Embuh Who brought it A messenger boy done fotch it suh look lak th same boy What same boy Same as come in when you do bout leven o clock remembuh Lanyard nodded recalling that on his way up the street from Sixth Avenue he had been subconsciously irritated by the shrill untuneful whistling of a loutish youth in Western Union uniform who had followed him into the house and become engaged in some minor altercation with the attendants while Lanyard was unlocking the door to his apartment What of him Why he bulge in heah an say we done send a call an we tell him we don know nuffin bout no call an he sweah an carry on an aftuh you done gone in he ast whut is yo name an somebody tell him an he go away An then bout haffanour aftuhwuds he come back with that theah lettuh say to stick it undeh yo do ef yo ain t home Leastways he look to me lak th same boy Ah dunno fo suah Repeated efforts failing to extract more enlightenment from this source Lanyard again shut himself in with the puzzle Somebody had set a messenger boy to dog him and find out his name and address Not Crane Lanyard had seen that one disappear in the elevator of the Knickerbocker and had thereafter moved too quickly to permit of Crane s returning to the lobby calling a messenger boy and pointing out Lanyard For that matter Lanyard was prepared to swear nobody had followed him from the Knickerbocker to the Biltmore Vaguely he seemed to recall a first impression of the boy at the time when he emerged from the drug store after his unprofitable effort to telephone Cecelia Brooke an indefinite memory of a shambling figure with nose flattened against the druggist s window apparently fascinated by the display of a catch penny corn cure Was there a link between that circumstance and the long delay which Lanyard had suffered in the telephone booth Had the Knickerbocker operator been less stupid and negligent than she seemed Was the truth of the matter that Crane had surmised Lanyard would attempt communication with the Brooke girl and had set a watch on the switchboard for the call Assuming that the Secret Service man had been clever enough for that it was not difficult to understand that Lanyard had purposely been kept dangling at the other end of the wire till the call could be traced back to its source and a messenger despatched from the nearest Western Union office with instructions to follow the man who left the booth and report his name and local habitation Sharp work if these inferences were reasonable And satisfied that they were Lanyard inclined to accord increased respect to the detective abilities of the American But this note this hurried unsigned scrawl of five unintelligible words what the deuce did it mean On the evidence of the handwriting a woman had penned it Cecelia Brooke Who else Crane might well have been taken into her confidence subsequent to the sinking of the Assyrian and on discovering that Lanyard had survived have used this means of relieving the girl s distress of mind But its significance Au Printemps translated literally meant in the springtime and in the springtime at one o clock was mere gibberish incomprehensible There is in Paris a department store calling itself Au Printemps but surely no one was suggesting to Lanyard in New York a rendezvous in Paris Nevertheless that Please intrigued with a note at once pleading and imperative which decided Lanyard to answer it without delay in person Au Printemps one o clock please Upon the screen of memory there flashed a blurred vision of an electric sign emblazoning the phrase Au Printemps against the facade of a building with windows all blind and dark save those of the street level which glowed pink with light filtered through silken hangings a building which Lanyard had already passed thrice that night without in the preoccupation of his purpose paying it any heed a building on Broadway somewhere above Columbus Circle if he were not mistaken Already it was one o clock Fortunately he was still in evening dress and needed only to change collar and tie to repair the disarray caused by his encounter with Ekstrom In two minutes he was once more in the street Within five a cab deposited him in front of the Restaurant Au Printemps an institution of midnight New York whose title for distinction resided mainly in the fact that it opened its upper floors for the diversion of members about the time when others put up their shutters Lanyard s advent occurred at the height of its traffic The dining rooms on the street level were closed and unlighted but men and women in pairs and parties were streaming across the sidewalk from an endless chain of motor cars and being ground through the revolving doors like grist in the hopper of an unhallowed mill the men all in evening dress the women in garments whose insolence outrivalled the most Byzantine nights of L Abbaye Theleme Drawn in with the current through the turnstile door Lanyard found himself in an absurdly little lobby thronged to suffocation largely with people of the half world here and there a few celebrities here and there small tight clusters of respectabilities making a brave show of feeling at ease all waiting their turn to be lifted to delectable regions aloft in an elevator barely big enough to serve in a private residence For a moment Lanyard lingered unnoticed on the outskirts of this assemblage searching its pretty faces for the prettier face he had come to find and wondering that she should have chosen for her purpose with him a resort of this character His memory of her was sweet with the clean smell of the sea there was incongruity to spare in this atmosphere heady with the odours of wine flesh scent and tobacco Perplexing A harpy with a painted leer and predacious eyes pounced upon him tore away his hat and coat gave him a numbered slip of pasteboard by presenting which he would be permitted to ransom his property on extortionate terms And still he saw no Cecelia Brooke though his aloof attitude coupled with an intent but impersonal inspection of every feminine face within his radius of vision earned him more than one smile at once furtively provocative and unwelcome By degrees the crowd emptied itself into the toy elevator such of it that is as was passed by a committee on membership consisting of one chubby bearded gentleman with the look of a French diplomatist the empressement of a head waiter and the authority of the Angel with the Flaming Sword Personae non gratae to the management inexplicably so in most instances were civilly requested to produce membership cards and upon failure to comply were inexorably rejected and departed strangely shamefaced Others of acceptable aspect were permitted to mingle with the upper circles of the elect without being required to prove their membership In the person of this suave but inflexible arbiter Lanyard identified a former maitre d hotel of the Carlton who had abruptly and discreetly fled London soon after the outbreak of war He fancied that this one knew him and was sedulous both to keep him in the corner of his eye and never to meet his regard directly And once he saw the man speak covertly with the elevator attendant guarding his lips with a hand and suspected that he was the subject of their communication The lobby was still comfortably filled a constant trickle of arrivals replacing in measure the losses by election and rejection when Lanyard watching the revolving doors saw Cecelia Brooke coming in She was alone at least momentarily and in his sight very creditably turned out remembering that all her luggage must have been lost with the Assyrian But what Englishwoman of her caste ever permitted herself to be visible after nightfall except in an evening gown of some sort even though a shabby sort Not that Miss Brooke to night was shabbily attired she was much otherwise from some mysterious source of wardrobe she had conjured wraps furs and a dancing frock as fresh and becoming as it was oddly enough not immodest And with whatever cares preying upon her secret mind she entered with the light step and bright countenance of any girl of her age embarked upon a lark All that was changed at sight of Lanyard He bowed formally at a moment when her glance resting on him seemed about to wander on instead it became fixed in recognition Instantly her smile was erased her features stiffened her eyes widened her lips parted the colour ebbed from her cheeks And she stopped quite still in front of the door till lightly jostled by other arrivals Then moving uncertainly toward him she said Monsieur Duchemin not loudly for she was not a woman to give excuse for a scene under any circumstances but in a tone of complete dumbfounderment Covering his own dashed contenance with a semblance of unruffled amiability he bowed again now over the hand which the girl tentatively offered letting it rest lightly on his fingers touching it as lightly with his lips It is such a pleasant surprise he said at a venture then added guardedly But my name I thought you knew it was now Anthony Ember Her eyes were blank I don t understand she faltered I thought you I never dreamed Is it really you Truly he averred lips smiling but mind rife with suspicion and distrust This was not acting he was convinced that her surprise was absolutely unfeigned So she had not expected to find him Au Printemps at one o clock in the morning till that very moment had believed him as dead as any of those poor souls who had perished with the Assyrian Therefore that note had not come from her therefore Lanyard had complimented Crane without warrant crediting him with another s cleverness Then whose And while Lanyard s head buzzed with these thoughts an independent chamber of his mind was engaged in admiring the address with which the girl was recovering from what must have been what plainly had been a staggering shock Already she had begun to grapple with the situation to take herself in hand and dissemble already her face was regaining its accustomed cast of self confidence composure and intelligent animation Throughout she pursued without a break the thread of conventional small talk It is a surprise she said calmly Really you are a most astonishing person mister Ember One never knows where to look for you That is my good fortune since it provides me with unexpected pleasures such as this You are with friends With a friend she corrected quietly with mister Crane He stopped outside to pay our taxi driver How odd it seems to find any place in the world as much alive as this New York It seems almost impossible Lanyard averred indeed somehow wrong I ve a feeling one has no right to encourage so much frivolity And yet Yes she responded quickly It is good to hear people laugh once more That is why mister Crane suggested coming here to night to cheer me up He said Au Printemps was unique promised I d find it most amusing I m sure Lanyard began as Crane entered breezing through the turnstile and comprehending the situation in a glance Hello he cried Didn t I tell you everybody alive would be here Nor was Cecelia Brooke less ready But fancy meeting mister Ember here I had no idea he was in New York had you Perhaps a dim suspicion Crane admitted with a twinkle taking Lanyard s hand Howdy Ember Glad to see you gladder n you d think How is that Lanyard asked returning the cordiality of his grasp Crane s penetrating accents must have been audible in the remotest corner of the ground floor rooms he made no effort to modulate them to a quieter pitch You can help me out of a fix if you feel like it You see I promised Miss Brooke if she d take me for her guide she d see life to night and now just when we re going good I ve got to renig Man I know held me up outside says I m wanted down town on special business and must go I might be able to toddle back later but can t bank on it Do you mind taking over my job Chaperoning Miss Brooke s investigations into the seamy side of current social history That will be delightful Attaboy If I m not back in half an hour you ll see her safely home of course Trust me And you ll excuse me Miss Brooke I hope you don t think What I do think mister Crane is that you have been most kind to a lonely stranger Of course I ll excuse you not willingly but understanding you must go That makes me a heap easier in my mind But I got to run So it s good night unless maybe I see you later So long Ember With a flirt of a raw boned hand Crane swung about threw himself spiritedly into the revolving door was gone Amazing creature Lanyard commented laughing I think him delightful the girl replied surrendering her wraps to a maid If all Americans are like that Shall we go up She nodded Please and turned with him The committee on membership himself bowed them into the elevator Several others crowded in after them For thirty seconds while the car moved slowly upward Lanyard was free to think without interruption But what to think now That Crane actuated by some motive occult to Lanyard had engineered this apparently adventitious rencontre for the purpose of throwing him and the Brooke girl together Or again that Crane was innocent of guile in this matter that other persons unknown causing Lanyard to be traced to his lodgings had framed that note to entice him to this place to night In the latter event who was conceivably responsible but Velasco Dressier O Reilly any one of these or all three working in concert The last named had looked Lanyard squarely in the face without sign of recognition back there in the lobby of the Knickerbocker precisely as he should if implicated in the conspiracies of the Boche though it might easily have been Velasco or Dressier who had recognized the adventurer without his knowledge The car stopped a narrow chested door slid open a gush of hectic light coloured morbidly the faces of alighting passengers a blare of syncopated noise singularly unmusical saluted the astonished ears of Lanyard and Cecelia Brooke She met his gaze with a smiling moue and slightly lifted eyebrows More than we bargained for he laughed But there is always something new in this America I promise you Au Printemps itself is new at all events did not exist when I was last in New York Following her out he paused beside the girl in a constricted space hedged about with tables waiting for the maitre d hotel to seat those who had been first to leave the elevator The room of irregular conformation held upward of two hundred guests and habitues seated at tables large and small and so closely set together that waiters with difficulty navigated narrow and tortuous channels of communication In the middle upon a small dancing floor rudely octagonal in shape made smaller by tables crowded round its edge to accommodate the crush a mob of couples danced arduously close locked in one another s arms swaying in rhythm with the over emphasized time beaten out by a perspiring little band of musicians on a dais in a far corner their activities directed by an antic conductor whose lantern jawed sallow face peered grotesquely out through a mop of hair as black and coarse and lush as a horse s mane Execrable ventilation or absence thereof manufactured an atmosphere that reeked with heat animal and artificial and with ill blended effluvia from a hundred sources Perhaps the odour of alcohol predominated Lanyard thought of a steam heated wine cellar He observed nothing but champagne in any glass and if food were being served it was done surreptitiously Sweat dripped from the faces of the dancers deep flushes discoloured all not so heavily enamelled as to preserve an inalterable complexion the eyes of many stared with the fixity of hypnosis Yet when the music ended with an unexpected crash of discord these dancers applauded insatiably till the jaded orchestra struck up once more when they renewed their curious gyrations with quenchless abandon The Brooke girl caught Lanyard s eye her lips moved Thanks to the din he had to bend his head near to hear She murmured with infinite expression Au Printemps The maitre d hotel was plucking at his sleeve Monsieur had made reservations no Startled recognition washed the man s tired and pasty countenance Pardon monsieur this way He turned and began to thread deviously between the jostling tables Dubiously Lanyard followed He likewise had known the maitre d hotel at sight a beastly little decadent whose cabaret on the rue d Antin just off the avenue de l Opera had been a famous rendezvous of international spies till war had rendered it advisable for him to efface himself from the ken of Paris with the same expedition and discretion which had marked the departure from London of his confrere who now guarded the lower gateway to these ethereal regions of Au Printemps The coincidence of finding those two so closely associated worked with the riddle of that note further to trouble Lanyard s mind Was he to believe Au Printemps the legitimate successor in America of that less pretentious establishment on the rue d Antin an overseas headquarters for Secret Service agents of the Central Powers He began to regret heartily not so much that he had presented himself in answer to that note but the responsibility which now devolved upon him of caring for Miss Brooke Much as he had wished to see her an hour ago now he would willingly be rid of her company Why had he been lured to this place if its character were truly what he feared Conceivably because he was believed since it now appeared he had cheated death still to possess either that desired document or knowledge of its whereabouts Naturally the enemy would not think otherwise He must not forget that Ekstrom was playing double as yet none but Lanyard knew he had stolen the document and done a murder to cover the theft from his associates and leave him free to sell to England without exciting their suspicion Consequently Lanyard believed he had been invited to this place to be sounded to be tempted bribed intimidated if need be and possible somehow to be won over to the uses of the Prussian spy system Leading them to the farther side of the room the maitre d hotel paused bowing and mowing beside a large table already in the possession of a party of three Lanyard s eyes narrowed One of the three was Velasco another a young man unknown to him a mannerly little creature who might have been written by the author of What the Man Will Wear in the theatre programmes The third was Sophie Weringrode the Wilhelmstrasse agent whom he had only that afternoon observed entering the house in Seventy ninth Street He stopped short in a cold rage Till that moment a mirror sheathed pillar had hidden from him Velasco and the Weringrode else Lanyard had refused to come so far for obviously there were no unreserved tables indeed few vacant chairs in that part of the room Not that he minded the cynical barefacedness of the dodge that was indeed amusing he was sanguine as to his ability to dominate any situation that might arise and to a degree indifferent if the upshot should prove his confidence misplaced and he did not in the least object to letting the enemy show his cards But he did enormously resent what was after all something quite outside the calculations of these giddy conspirators the fact that he must either beat incontinent retreat or introduce Cecelia Brooke to the company of Sophie Weringrode His face darkened a stinging reproof for the maitre d hotel trembled on his tongue s tip but that one was busily avoiding his eye on the far side of the table drawing out a chair for mademoiselle while Velasco and the Weringrode were alert to read Lanyard s countenance and forestall any steps he might contemplate in defiance of their designs At first glimpse of the Brooke girl Velasco jumped up and hastened to her with eager Latin courtesy expressing his unanticipated delight in the prospect of her consenting to join their party And she was suffering with quiet graciousness his florid compliments At the same time the Weringrode was greeting Lanyard in the most intimate fashion and damning him in the understanding of Cecelia Brooke with every word My dear friend she cried gayly extending a bedizened hand I had begun to despair of you Is it part of your system with women always to be a little late always to keep us wondering Schooling his features to a civil smile Lanyard bowed over the hand In warfare such as ours my dear Sophie he said with meaning one uses all weapons even the most primitive in sheer self defense The woman laughed delightedly I think she said if you rose from the dead at the bottom of the sea Tony it would be with wit upon your lips And you have brought a friend with you How charming She shifted in her chair to face Cecelia Brooke I wish to know her instantly Velasco was waiting only for that opening Dear princess he said instantly permit me to present Miss Cecelia Brooke Princess de Alavia Completely at ease and by every indication enjoying herself hugely the girl bowed and took the hand the Weringrode thrust upon her Her eyes a brim with excitement and mischief veered to Lanyard s ignored their warning glanced away How do you do she said simply I didn t understand mister Ember expected to meet friends here but that only makes it the more agreeable May we sit down XVII FINESSE The person in the educated evening clothes was made known as mister Revel For Lanyard s benefit and his own he vacated the chair beside Sophie Weringrode seating himself to one side of Cecelia Brooke who had Velasco between her and the soi disant princess Already a waiter had placed and was filling glasses for Lanyard and the girl With the best grace he could muster the adventurer sat down accepted a cigarette from the Weringrode case and with openly impertinent eyes inspected the intrigante critically She endured that ordeal well smiling confidently a handsome creature with a beautiful body bewitchingly gowned Time he considered had been kind to Sophie time the mysteries of the modern toilette and the astonishing adaptability of womankind Splendidly vital like all of her sort who survive she seemed mysteriously able to renew that vitality through the very extravagance with which she squandered it She had lived much of late years rapidly but well had learned much had profited by her lessons To night she looked legitimately the princess of her pretensions the manner of the grande dame suited her type her gesture was as impeccable as her taste prettier than ever she seemed at worst little more than half her age And her quick intelligence mocked the privacy of his reflections Fair fast and forty she interpreted smilingly He pretended to be stunned Never he protested feebly The woman reaffirmed in a series of rapid nods Have I ever had secrets from you You are too quick for me monsieur I do not intend to begin deceiving you at this late day or trying to Flattery he declared is meat and drink to me Tell me more She laughed lightly Thank you no vanity is unbecoming in men I do not care to make you vain Aware that Cecelia Brooke was listening all the while she seemed to be enchanted with the patter of mister Revel and the less vapid observations of Velasco Lanyard sought to shunt personalities from himself And now a princess Did you not know I had married Yes a princess of Spain and with a castle there if you must know Quite a change of atmosphere from Berlin he remarked But it has done you no perceptible harm That won him a black look Oh Berlin she said with contemptuous lips I haven t been there since the beginning of the war I wish never to see the place again True I was born an Austrian but is that any reason why I should love Germany She leaned forward her fan gently tapping the knuckles of his hand Pay less attention to me she insisted with a nod toward the middle of the room You are missing something Me I never tire of her The floor had been cleared A drummer on the dais was sounding the long roll crescendo At the culminating crash the lights were everywhere darkened save for an orange coloured spot light set in the ceiling immediately above the dancing floor Into that circular field of torrid glare bounded a woman wearing little more than an abbreviated kirtle of grass strands with a few festoons of artificial flowers Applause roared out to her the orchestra sounded the opening bars of an Americanised Hawaiian melody the woman with extraordinary vivacity began to perform a denatured hula a wild and tawny animal superbly physical relying with warrant upon the stark sensuality of her body to make amends for the censored phrases of the primitive dance The floor resounded like a great drum to the stamping of her bare feet till one marvelled at such solidity of flesh as could endure that punishment Sophie Weringrode lounged negligently upon the table bringing her head near Lanyard s shoulder Play fair she said between lips that barely moved Without looking round Lanyard answered in the same manner Why ask more than you are prepared to give The police ran you out of America once We need only publish the fact that mister Anthony Ember is the Lone Wolf Well Leave Berlin out of it before this girl Lanyard shrugged and laughed quietly What else We can t talk now Ask me for the next dance The woman sat back in her chair attentive to the posturing of the dancer slowly fanning herself Lanyard s semblance of as much interest was nothing more furtively his watchfulness alternated between two quarters of the room On the farther edge of the circle of tropical radiance he had marked down a table at which two men were seated Dressier and O Reilly No more question now as to the personnel of the conspiracy even Velasco had thrown off the mask The enemy had come boldly into the open indicating a sense of impudent assurance indicating even more contempt of opposition No longer afraid they no longer skulked in shadows Lanyard experienced a premonition of events impending In addition he was keeping an eye on the door to the elevator shaft Once already it had opened letting a bright window into the farther wall of the shadowed room discovering the figure of the maitre d hotel in silhouette anxiety in his attitude He was waiting for somebody waiting tensely So were the others waiting all that crew and their fellow workers scattered among the guests Lanyard told himself he could guess for whom Only Ekstrom was wanting to complete the circle When he appeared if by chance he should things ought to begin to happen If tolerably satisfied that Ekstrom would not come not that night at all events Lanyard none the less continued to be jealously heedful of that doorway But the hula came to an end without either his vigilance or the impatience of the maitre d hotel being rewarded Writhing with serpentine grace to the edge of the illuminated area the dancer leaped back into darkness and the folds of a wrap held by a maid in which garment she was seen bowing and laughing when the lights again blazed up Without ceasing to play changing only the time of the tune the orchestra swung into a fox trot Lanyard glanced across the table to see Cecelia Brooke rising in response to the invitation of dapper mister Revel In his turn he rose with Sophie Weringrode Be patient with me he begged It is long since I danced to music more frivolous than a cannonade But it is simple the woman promised simple at least to one who can dance as you could in the old days Just follow me till you catch the step It doesn t matter anyway I desire only the opportunity to converse Yielding to his arms she shifted into French when next she spoke You do admirably my friend Never again depreciate your dancing If you knew how one suffers at the feet of these Americans Excellent he said Now that is settled what is it you are instructed to propose to me She laughed softly Always direct Truly you would never shine as a secret agent Not as they shine Lanyard countered in the dark Don t be a fraud We are what we are and so are you Let us not begin to be censorious of one another s methods of winning a living Agreed But when do we begin to talk business Why do you continue so persistently antagonistic I am French That is silly You are an outlaw a man without a country Why not change all that And how does one effect miracles Germany offers you a refuge security freedom to ply your trade unhindered within reasonable limits And in exchange what do I give Your services as and when required in our service Beginning when To night With what specific performance We want we must without fail have that document you took from the Brooke girl Perhaps we had better continue in English You are speaking a tongue unknown to me Don t talk rot You know well what I mean We know you have the thing You didn t steal it to turn it over to England or the States What is your price to Germany Whatever you have in mind believe me when I say I have nothing to sell to the Wilhelmstrasse But what else can you do with it What other market My dear Sophie upon my word I haven t got what you want Then why so keen to get the Brooke girl on the telephone as soon as you found out where she was stopping How did you learn about that by the way Let the credit go to Senor Velasco He saw you first One thought as much Nevertheless I haven t what you want You gave it back to Miss Brooke Having nothing to give her I gave her nothing The woman was silent throughout a round of the floor then Tell me something she requested Can I keep anything from you Are you in love with the English girl Lanyard almost lost step then laughed the thought to derision What put that into your pretty head Sophie Do you not know it yourself my friend It is absurd She laughed maliciously Think it over Possibly you have not stopped to think as yet When you know the truth yourself you will be the better qualified to fib about it Also you will not forget What he demanded bluntly as she paused with intention That as long as she possesses the document since you have it not her life is endangered even more than yours She hasn t got it Lanyard declared as nearly in panic as he ever was Ah the woman jeered So you confess to some knowledge of it after all My dear he said teasingly do you really want to know what has become of that paper I do and mean to What if I tell you Her eyes lifted to his in childlike candour Need you ask You are irresistible Ask Karl She demanded sharply Whom Ekstrom Ah Again the adventuress was silent for a little What does he know Ask him enquire why he murdered von Harden then what business took him to Ninety fifth Street twice this evening once about nine o clock again at midnight You must be mad monsieur Karl would not dare You don t know him or have forgotten he was trained in the International Bureau of Brussels and there learned how to sell out both parties to a business that won t bear publicity I wonder the woman mused Never have I wholly trusted that one Shall I give you the key If you love Karl as little as I But where do you suppose the good man is this night of nights Who knows He was not here when I arrived at midnight I have seen nothing of him since When you do if he shows himself at all look him over carefully for signs of wear and tear Yes monsieur And in what respect Look for cuts about his head and hands possibly elsewhere And should he confess to an affair with a wind shield in a motor accident ask him what happened to the study window in the house at Ninety fifth Street Impish glee danced in the woman s eyes Your handiwork dear friend A mere beginning You may tell him so if you like He was subjected to a convulsive squeeze Never have I felt so kindly disposed toward an enemy It is true I were a better foe to Germany if I kept my counsel and let Ekstrom continue to play double The music ceasing to be followed by the inevitable clamour for more Lanyard offered an arm upon which Sophie rested a detaining hand No wait We dance this encore I have more to say He submitted amiably the more so since not ill pleased with himself And when again they were moving round the floor she bore more heavily upon his shoulder and was thoughtful longer than he had expected Then Attention my friend I am listening Sophie If what you hint is true and I do not doubt it is Karl s day is done More nearly than he dreams Lanyard affirmed grimly I shan t be sorry I am German through and through what I do I do for the Fatherland and in that find absolution for many things I care not to remember If through what you tell me I may prove Karl traitor I owe you something Always it has been my fondest hope Sophie some day to have you in my debt Her fingers tightened on his Do not jest in the shadow of death Since you have been unwise enough to venture here to night you will not be permitted to leave alive unless you pledge yourself to us and prove your sincerity by producing that paper That sounds reasonable like Prussia What next I have warned you so paid off my debt The rest is your affair Do you imagine I take this seriously It will turn out seriously for you if you do not How can I be prevented from leaving when I will from a public restaurant Is it possible you don t know this place It is maintained by the Wilhelmstrasse Attempt to leave it without coming to a satisfactory understanding and see what happens What for instance The lights would be out before you were half across the room When they went up again the Lone Wolf would be no more and never a soul here would know who stabbed him or what became of the knife Are you by any chance amusing yourself at my expense Once more the woman showed him her handsome eyes he found them frankly grave earnest unwavering If you will not listen your blood be on your own head Forgive me I didn t mean to be rude Still you do not believe You are wrong I am merely amused If you understood you could never mock your peril But I don t mock it I am enchanted with it I accept it and it renews my youth This might be Paris of the days when you ran with the Pack Sophie and I alone The woman moved her pretty shoulders impatiently I think you are either mad or the very soul of courage The encore ended they returned to the table Sophie leaning lightly on Lanyard s arm chattering gay inconsequentialities Dropping into her chair she bent over toward Cecelia Brooke He dances adorably my dear the intrigante declared But I dare say you know that already The English girl shook her head smiling Not yet Then lose no time You two should dance well together for you are more of a size I think the next number will be a waltz We get altogether too few of them these American dances these one steps and foxtrots they are not dances they are mere romps favourites none the less And there is always more room on the floor so few waltz nowadays Really you must not miss this opportunity This playful insistence the light stress she laid upon her suggestion that Cecelia Brooke dance with him considered in conjunction with her recent admonition impressed Lanyard as significantly inconsistent Sophie was no more a woman to make purposeless gestures than she was one sufficiently wanting in finesse to signal him by pressures of her foot There was sheer intention in that iteration lose no time you must not miss this opportunity Something had happened even since their dance she had observed something momentous and was warning him to act quickly if he meant to act at all With unruffled amiability amused urbane Lanyard bowed his petition across the table and was rewarded by a bright nod of promise Lighting another cigarette he lounged back poised his wine glass delicately with the eye of a connoisseur appraised its pale amber tint touched it lightly to his lips inhaling critically its bouquet sipped and signified approval of the vintage by sipping again all without missing one bit of business in a scene enacted on the far side of the room directly behind him but reflected in a mirror panel of the wall he faced The diplomatist charged with the task of discriminating the sheep from the goats in the lower lobby had come up to confer with his colleague the maitre d hotel of the upper storey When Lanyard first saw the man he was standing by the elevator shaft none too patiently awaiting the attention of the other who caught by inadvertence at some distance was moving to join him with what speed he could manage threading the thick set tables Was this what Sophie had noticed Had she likewise perhaps received some secret signal from the guardian of the lower gateway A signal possibly indicating that Ekstrom had arrived They met at last those two and discreetly confabulated the maitre d hotel betraying welcome mitigation of that nervous tension which had heretofore so palpably affected him and as the other stepped back into the elevator Lanyard saw this one s glance irresistibly attracted to the table dedicated to the service of the Princess de Alavia Something much resembling satisfaction glimmered in the fellow s leaden eyes it was apparent that he anticipated early relief from a distasteful burden of responsibility Then at ease in the belief that he was unobserved he turned to a near by table round which four sat without the solace of feminine society four men whose stamp was far from reassuring despite their strikingly quiet demeanour and inconspicuously correct investiture of evening dress Two were unmistakable sons of the Fatherland all were well set up with the look of men who would figure to advantage in any affair calling for physical competence and courage from coffee and pistols at sunrise in the Parc aux Princes to a battle royal in a Tenderloin dive Their table commanded both ways out by the stairs and by the elevator much too closely for Lanyard s peace of mind And more than one looked thoughtfully his way while the maitre d hotel hovered above them murmuring confidentially Four nods sealed an understanding with him He strutted off with far more manner than had been his at any time since the arrival of Lanyard and vented an excess of spirits by berating bitterly an unhappy clown of a waiter for some trivial fault The first bars of another dance number sang through the confusion of voices truly as Sophie had foretold a waltz XVIII DANSE MACABRE Trained in the old school of the dance Lanyard was unversed in that graceless scamper which to day passes as the waltz with a generation largely too indolent or too inept of foot to learn to dance His was that flowing waltz of melting rhythm the waltz of yesterday that dance of dances to whose measures a civilization more sedate in its amusements less jealous of its time danced flirted loved and broke its hearts Into the swinging movement of that antiquated waltz Lanyard fell without a qualm of doubt all ignorant as he was of his benighted ignorance and instantly with the ease and gracious assurance of a dancer born Cecelia Brooke adapted herself to his step and guidance with rare pliancy made her every movement exquisitely synchronous with his No need to lead her no need for more than the least of pressures upon her yielding waist no need for anything but absolute surrender to the magic of the moment Effortless like creatures of the music adrift upon its sounding tides they circled the floor once twice and again before reluctantly Lanyard brought himself to shatter the spell of that enchantment Looking down with an apologetic smile he asked Mademoiselle do you know you can be an excellent actress As if in resentment the girl glanced upward sharply with clouded eyes So can most women in emergency I mean I have something serious to say nobody must guess your thoughts She said simply I will do my best You must you must appear quite charmed Also should you catch me smirking like an infatuated ninny remember I am only doing my own indifferent best to act Laughter trembled deliciously in her voice I promise faithfully to bear in mind your heartlessness I am an ass he enunciated with the humility of conviction But that can t be helped Attend to me if you please and do not start This place turns out to be a nest of Prussian spies I was brought here by a trick I understand the order is I may not leave alive Playing her part so well as almost to embarrass Lanyard himself the girl smiled daringly into his eyes Because of that packet she breathed Because of that mademoiselle Where is it For an instant Lanyard lost countenance absolutely Through sheer good fortune the girl was now dancing with face averted her head so nearly touching his shoulder that it seemed to rest upon it Nevertheless it was at cost of an heroic struggle that he fought down all signs of that shock with which it had been borne in upon him that he dared not assure the girl her packet was in safe hands If he had failed in his efforts to restore the thing to her that she might consign it as she saw fit and so discharge her personal trust till now Lanyard had solaced himself with a hazy notion that she would in turn be comforted when she learned the document was in the keeping of her country s Secret Service Impossible to tell her that his own act had rendered it impossible that act the outcome of wilful trifling with his infirmity his itch for thieving Of a sudden the pilfered necklace secreted in an inner pocket of his waistcoat above his heart seemed to have gained the weight of so much lead The hideous consciousness of the thing stung like the bite of live coals This woman was in distress he yearned to lighten her burden he could do that with half a dozen words his guilt prohibited A thief Now indeed the Lone Wolf tasted shame and realized its bitterness Puzzled by his constraint the girl s eyes again sought his and warned in time by the movement of her head he mustered impudence to meet their question with the look of tenderness that went with the role she suffered him to play What is the matter I am ashamed that I have failed you Don t think of that I know you did your best Only tell me what became of it It was stolen when I returned to my stateroom that night I was held up and robbed The thief shot at me killed his confederate decamped by way of the port I pursued Another aided him to overpower and cast me overboard Yet you escaped Strange she should seem more intrigued by that than concerned about her loss I escaped no matter how You don t know who stole the packet I don t recall the man among the passengers but he may have been in one of the boats a fellow of about my stature with a flowing beard He sketched broadly Ekstrom as he had seen him in the Stanistreet library Her eyes quickened One such escaped in our boat the second steward I think his name was Anderson Doubtless the same Then it is gone For once in his acquaintance with her that brave spirit seemed to falter she became a burden bereft for a little of all grace and spontaneity He was constrained to swing her forcibly into time Almost instantly she recollected herself covered her lapse with a little laugh innocent of any hint of its forced falsity and showed him and the room as well a radiant countenance all with such address and art that the incident might well have escaped notice otherwise have passed for a bit of natural by play Yet distress was too eloquent in the broken query What am I to do Heartsick self sick to boot he essayed to suggest that she consult Colonel Stanistreet but lacking so much effrontery stammered and fell silent Perhaps misinterpreting she cried in quick contrition I am forgetting Forgive me I should have said what are you to do He whipped his wits together Look down turn your face aside smile I have a plan a desperate remedy but the best I can contrive When next the lift comes up we must try to be near it There is one row of tables which we must break through by main force Leave that to me follow as I clear a way go straight into the lift If anything happens run down the stairway on the left The ground floor is two flights below If I am any way detained don t stop go on get your wraps take the first taxi you see return directly to the Knickerbocker I will telephone you later If you live she breathed Never fear for me But if I do Do you imagine I could rest if I thought you had sacrificed yourself for me You must not think that I am far too selfish That is not so And I refuse positively to do as you wish unless you tell me how I may communicate with you Resigned to humour her he recited his address and the number of the house telephone and when she had memorized both by iteration resumed Once outside if anybody tries to hinder you don t let them intimidate you into keeping quiet but scream scream at the top of your lungs These beasts abominate a screaming woman or any other undue noise Not only will that frighten them off but it will fetch the nearest policeman The music ceased She stood flushed smiling adorably pretty eyes star like for him alone We are not far from the lift now she said just audibly But the door is shut Hush Here comes the encore Once more around They drifted again into that witching maze of melody and movement made one You are silent she said after a little Why Lanyard answered with a warning pressure on her hand The elevator was stationary at the floor its door wide the maitre d hotel engaged in a far quarter of the room while those four formidable guardians of the exit were gossiping with animation over their glasses Steady Now is our time Abruptly they stopped A couple that had been following them avoided collision by a close margin Over his partner s head the man scowled portentously and dissipated his display of temper on Lanyard s indifferent back Upon those guests who sat between the dancing floor and elevator Lanyard wasted no consideration Pushing roughly between two adjoining tables he lifted one chair with its astonished occupant bodily out of the way then turned swung an arm round the girl s waist all but threw her through the lane he had created followed without an instant s pause It was all so quickly accomplished that the girl was in the car before another person in the room appreciated what was happening And Lanyard in the act of slamming the door shut without heed for the protesting operator saw only a room full of amazed faces with gaping mouths and rounded eyes and one man of the four at the near by table in the act of rising uncertainly with a stupefied look Elbowing the boy aside he seized the operating lever and thrust it to the notch labelled Descend An instant of pause followed like its attendant the elevator seemed stalled in inertia of stupefaction Beyond the door somebody loosed an infuriated screech Angry hands drummed on the glass panel With a premonitory shudder the car started spasmodically moved downward at first gently then with greater speed coming to an abrupt stop at the street level with a shock that all but threw its passengers from their feet Up the shaft that senseless punishment of the panel continued Some other intelligence conceived the notion for ringing for the car to return its annunciator buzzed stridently continuously Unlatching the lower door Lanyard threw it back stepped out finding the lobby deserted but for a simpering group of coat room girls to one of whom he flipped a silver dollar Find this lady s wraps be quick Deftly catching the coin the girl snatched the check from Cecelia Brooke and darted into the women s dressing room Throughout a wait of agonising suspense the elevator boy remained cowering in a corner of the car staring at Lanyard as at some shape of terror while the ignored buzzer droned without cessation to persistent pressure from above Out of the dark entrance to the lower dining room the bearded diplomatist popped with the distracted look of a jack in the box about to be ravished of its young Monsieur is not leaving he expostulated shrilly darting forward Lanyard stopped him with a look whose menace was like a kick I am seeing this lady to her cab he said in a cold and level voice The coat room girl emerged from her lair with an armful of wraps and furs Again the bearded one made as if to block the doorway But monsieur mademoiselle Lanyard caught the fellow s arm and sent him spinning like a top Out of the way you rat he snapped then to the girl Be quick As she shouldered into a compartment of the revolving door incoherent yells began to echo down the staircase well At length it had occurred to those above to utilize that means of descent Wedged in the wheeling door a final glimpse of the lobby showed Lanyard the startled putty like mask of the maitre d hotel at the head of the stairway with beyond him the head of one who though in shadow uncommonly resembled Ekstrom but Ekstrom as he was in the old days without his beard That picture passed like a flash on a cinema screen They were on the sidewalk and the girl was running toward a taxicab the only vehicle of its sort in sight at the curb just above the entrance Coatless and bareheaded Lanyard swung to face the door porter a towering brawny animal in livery self confident and something more than keen to interfere but his mouth opening to utter some sort of protest shut suddenly without articulation when Lanyard displayed for his benefit a twenty two Colt s automatic And he fell back smartly Jerking open the cab door the girl stumbled into the far corner of the seat The motor was churning in promising fashion the chauffeur settling into place at the wheel Into his hand Lanyard thrust a ten dollar bill The Knickerbocker he ordered Stop for nobody If followed steer for the nearest policeman There ll be no change He closed the door sharply leaned over it dropped the little pistol into the girl s lap Chances are you won t want that but you may She bent forward quickly eyes darkly lustrous with alarm and placed a hand upon his arm But you It is I whom they want not you I won t subject you to the hazard of my company Gently Lanyard lifted the hand from his sleeve brushed it gallantly with his lips released it Good night he laughed then stepped back waved a hand to the chauffeur Go The taxicab shot away like a racing hound unleashed With a sigh of relief Lanyard gave himself wholly to the question of his own salvation The rank of waiting motor cars offered no hope all but one were private town cars and limousines operated by liveried drivers A solitary roadster at the head of the line tempted and was rejected even though it had no guardian chauffeur something of which he could not be sure he would be overhauled before he could start the motor and get the knack of its gear shift mechanism Even now Au Printemps was in frantic eruption its doors ejecting violently a man at each wild revolution Down Broadway an omnibus of the Fifth Avenue line lumbered at no less speed than twenty miles an hour without passengers and sporting an illuminated Special sign above the driver s seat Dashing out into the roadway Lanyard launched himself at the narrow platform of the unwieldy vehicle and in spite of a yell of warning from the guard landed safely on the step and turned to repel boarders But his manoeuvre had been executed too swiftly and unexpectedly The group before Au Printemps huddled together in ludicrous inaction as if stunned Then one raged through it plying vicious elbows As he paused against the light Lanyard identified unmistakably the silhouette of Ekstrom So that one had after all escaped the net of his own treachery The bus guard was shaking Lanyard s arm with an ungentle hand Here now you got no business boardin a Special From his pocket Lanyard whipped the first bank note his fingers encountered Divide that with the chauffeur he said crisply tell him to drive like the devil It s life or death with me The protruding eyeballs of the guard bore witness to the magnitude of the bribe You re on he breathed hoarsely and ran forward through the body of the conveyance to advise the driver Swarming up the curved stairway to the roof Lanyard dropped into the rear seat looking back The group round the doorway was recovering from its stupefaction Three struck off from it toward the line of waiting cars Of these the foremost was Ekstrom Simultaneously the bus lumbering drunkenly lurched into Columbus Circle and the roadster left the curb carrying in addition to the driver two passengers Ekstrom on the running board Tardily Lanyard repented of that impulse which had moved him to bestow his one weapon upon Cecelia Brooke The night air had a biting edge A chill rain had begun to drizzle down in minute globules of mist which both lent each street light its individual nimbus of gold and dulled deceitfully the burnished asphaltum rendering its surface greasy and treacherous More than once Lanyard feared lest the bus skid and overturn and before the old red brick building between Broadway and Eighth Avenue shut out the western sector of the Circle he saw the roadster driven insanely shoot crabwise toward the curb than answer desperate work at the wheel and whirl madly executing a volte face so violent that Ekstrom s hold was broken and he was hurled a dozen feet away And Lanyard s chances were measurably advanced by the delay required in order to pick up the sprawling one start the engine anew and turn more cautiously to resume the pursuit Striking diagonally across Broadway the bus swung into Fifty seventh Street at the moment when the roadster turned the corner of Columbus Circle The head of the guard lifted above the edge of the roof Clinging to the supports of the stairway he addressed Lanyard in accents of blended suspicion and respect Lis n boss is this all right on the level now Absolutely unless that racing car catches up with us in which case you ll have a dead man myself on your hands Well we don t wanna lose our jobs that s all You won t unless I lose my life Anything you d like me to do Go down wait on the platform if anybody attempts to get aboard kick him in the act Sure I will The guard disappeared Wallowing like a barge in a strong seaway the omnibus crossed Seventh Avenue and sped downhill toward Sixth with dangerous momentum Shortly however this began to be modified by the brakes a precaution against mishap which even the fugitive must approve Ahead loomed the gaunt structure of the Sixth Avenue L bridging the roadway at so low an elevation as to afford the omnibus little more than clear headroom Once beneath it a single bounce up from the surface car tracks must mean a wreck But the pursuit was less than half a block astern and gaining swiftly even as the speed of the omnibus was growing less and desperately less At what seemed little better than a snail s pace it began to pass beneath the span of the Elevated Like a racing thoroughbred the roadster swept up alongside motor chanting triumphantly running board level with the platform step Ekstrom poised to leap aboard hesitated a pistol in his hand exploded a shattered window fell crashing There was a yell from the guard not of pain but of fright Apparently he executed a von Hindenburg retreat Without more opposition Ekstrom gained the platform In the same breath Lanyard stood up The lowermost girder of the L was immediately overhead He grasped it doubled his legs beneath him swung clear The omnibus shot from under him the roadster convoying Drawing himself up he seized a round iron upright of guard rail and heaved his body in over the edge of the platform round the switching tower which was at this hour dark and untenanted In the street below a police whistle shrieked and a fusillade of pistol shots woke scandalised echoes Bending almost double Lanyard moved rapidly northward on the footway beside the western tracks and so gained the old station on the west side of Fifty eighth Street for years dedicated to the uses of desuetude Through this he crept then down the stairs encountering at the lower landing an iron gate which obliged him to climb over and jump Not a soul paid the least attention to this matter of a gentleman in evening dress without hat or top coat dropping from the stairway of a disused elevated station at two o clock in the morning In New York anything can happen and most things do without stirring up meddlesome impulses in innocent bystanders XIX FORCE MAJEURE This visit to his rooms was the briefest of the several Lanyard made that night considerations of mortal urgency dictating its drastic abbreviation If the events of the last few hours had meant anything whatever they had demonstrated two truths which shone like beacon lights that Manhattan Island was overpopulated as long as both he and Ekstrom remained on it that Ekstrom had been goaded to the verge of aberration by the discovery that Lanyard had come safely through the Assyrian debacle to take up anew his self appointed office of Nemesis to the Prussian spy system in general and to the genius of its American bureau in particular Henceforth that one would know no more rest while Lanyard lived Thus that little street level apartment forfeited whatever attractions it originally had possessed in the adventurer s estimation Not only was the address known to Ekstrom s associates and so open to him but its peculiar characteristics its facilities for access from the street direct rendered it a highly practicable death trap for a hunted man Lanyard was well persuaded he need only wait there long enough to receive a deputation from Seventy ninth Street And with any assurance that Ekstrom would come alone he might have been content to wait Not only had he through too intimate acquaintance with his methods every assurance that Ekstrom would never brave alone what he could induce another to risk with him but Lanyard was never one willing to play the passive part A banal axiom of all warfare applied The advantage is with him who fights upon the offensive Since midnight the offensive had shifted from Lanyard s grasp to the enemy s He was determined to recapture it and that was something never to be accomplished by sitting still and waiting for events to unfold but only by carrying the war into the enemy s camp He delayed then only long enough to change his clothing and to conceal about him certain properties which it seemed unwise to expose to chance discovery on the part of Ekstrom or in the ever possible event of police intervention Within five minutes from the time of his return he was closing behind him the private door Wearing a quiet lounge suit but no top coat with a hat not so soft as to lack character but soft enough to stick upon one s head in time of action and carrying a stick neither brutishly stout nor ineffectively slender he strolled up to Seventh Avenue turned north entered Central Park and strolled no more Kindly shadows enfolded him engulfed him altogether One minute after he had passed through the gateway he would have defied unaided apprehension by the most zealous officer of the peace He went swiftly and secretly avoiding all lighted ways Not till then did conscience stir and remind him of his slighted promise to call up Cecelia Brooke No time now for that the errand that engaged him was of a nature to brook no more procrastination The girl must wait He was sorry if as she had protested solicitude for his welfare must interfere with her night s rest But what must be must until he saw the end of this adventure he could be influenced by no minor consideration whatsoever Not that he seriously believed Cecelia s sleep would be uneasy because of him That was too much His temper was grim and skeptical The resentment roused by the trap that had so nearly laid him by the heels together with the subsequent effort to assassinate him out of hand had settled into a phase of smouldering fury whose heat consumed like misty vapours every lesser emotion every humane consideration Some by thought recalling the Weringrode s innuendo that he was in love without his knowledge moved him to laugh outright if strangely an unpleasant laugh that held as much of pain as of derision What room in that dark heart of his for love the heart of a thief and a potential assassin the heart of the Lone Wolf How was he to know he had hardly left his lodgings before their hush was interrupted by the grumble of the house telephone Intermittently for upward of three minutes that sound persisted When at length it discontinued the quiet of the untenanted rooms reigned undisturbed for a brief time only An odd metallic stridor became audible a succession of scrapings of stealthy accent at the private entrance Its latch clicked The door swung back against the wall with a muffled bump Two pairs of furtive feet padded in the little private hallway The flash of an electric hand lamp flickered hither and yon like a searching poignard picked out the door to the one bedchamber and vanished There was guarded whispering then a thud as one of the intruders gained the middle of the bedchamber in a bound An instant later a switch snapped and the room was flooded with light Beneath the chandelier stood a man in evening dress the worse for misadventure one knee of his trousers cut open both legs caked with a film of half dry mud his linen dingy with mud stains his top coat shockingly bedraggled He was bareheaded apparently having lost his hat a black smear across one cheek added emphasis to the pallor of newly shaven jowls and his eyes were blazing Stole away he muttered briefly in disgust then called Ed As quietly as a shadow a second man joined him greeting him with a Hush This gentleman was in far more presentable repair and a more equable frame of mind There was even a glint of amusement in his hard blue eyes His countenance had an Irish cast Hush the other iterated with contempt What for The hound s not here No Karl Ed admitted but there are others in the house If it s known to them that Lanyard s out they may turn in a police alarm and I for one have had enough of bulls for one night Karl grunted disdainfully I told you this would be a waste of time And I agreed with you entirely But you would come Lanyard s no such fool as to stick round a place he knows I know about Karl s hands twitched and his features worked nervously He knows me too well knows that if ever I lay hands on him again His voice was rising to an hysterical pitch when the other checked him with a sibilant hiss At the same time his hand darted out and switched off the light Karl uttered a startled ejaculation Sssh his companion repeated In the street a motor car was rumbling stationary before the door Then the remote grinding of the house door bell was heard Let s get out of this suggested the Irishman It s no good waiting anyway Hold hard We won t go till we have a clear field The Prussian stole out into the sitting room and stood listening at the door to the public hallway his companion standing by with a mutinous air Oh come along he insisted in a stage whisper Shut up Listen Shuffling footfalls traversed the hallway The front door was opened The clear voice of an Englishwoman was answered in the slurring patois of a negro No m he ain t in The next enquiry was intelligible the speaker had entered the hallway Are you sure Yas m Sumbody done call him up bout ten min tes ago an I rung an rung an he don answer He ain t in or he don mean to answer nobody tha s all I am very anxious about him Have you a key to his rooms Yas m I got a pass key but Please use it Take this Go in and make sure he is out or if at home that he is all right Yas m thanky ma am but Do as I tell you I will see that you don t get into trouble All right ma am The negro chuckled probably over his tip Yo sho has got the p suadin est way The Irishman caught the German s arm Come out of this he pleaded No fear I ll see it through That s the Brooke girl the fool got in with on the boat She may know something But Leave this to me You look out for the negro I ll take care of Miss Cecelia Brooke Swearing unhappily the Irishman flattened against the wall to one side of the door Karl waited behind it as it admitted the hall attendant who made directly toward the central chandelier Yo jes wait ma am an I ll mek a light an But the girl had impetuously followed him in The light went up and Karl put a heavy shoulder against the door closing it with a slam The negro turned and stood with gaping mouth and staring eyes dumb with terror The girl recognised Karl with a little cry and darted back toward the door Immediately he caught her in his arms Her lips opened but their utterance was stifled by a handkerchief thrust between them with the dexterity of a practised hand Without one word of warning the Irishman stepped forward and struck the negro brutally in the face The boy reeled whimpering Two more blows delivered with murderous ferocity silenced him altogether He collapsed like a broken puppet insensible on the floor his face a curious ashen colour beneath its glossy skin of brown XX RIPOSTE The drizzle had grown thicker the night blacker the early morning air still more chill But Lanyard was moving too swiftly to be affected by this last circumstance the first he anathematised with the perfunctory bitterness of a skilled artisan who sees his work in a fair way to be obstructed by elemental depravity Another of his trade would have termed such weather conditions ideal and so might the Lone Wolf on an everyday job but the prospect of a footing rendered insecure by rain trebled the hazards attending a plan of campaign that would brook neither revision nor delay There was only one way to break into the house on Seventy ninth Street this Lanyard had appreciated upon his first reconnaissance of the previous afternoon He could have wished for more time in which to prepare and assemble tested equipment instead of relying upon chance to supply the requisite gear but with all time at his disposal the mechanical difficulties of the problem would remain Far from indifferent to these Lanyard addressed himself to their conquest doggedly and with businesslike economy of motion Shunning the public paths he went over the park wall like a cat sped across town through Eightieth Street and so came to that plot of land upon which an apartment building was in process of erection immediately to the north of the American headquarters of the Prussian spy system Walled in with stone two storeys deep its gaunt skeleton of steel had been joined together as far as the seventh level How much higher it was destined to rise was immaterial for Lanyard s purpose it was enough that the frame had already outgrown its neighbour on the south A litter of lumber huge steel girders and other material narrowed the side street to half its normal width The sidewalk space was trampled earth roofed with heavy planks for the protection of pedestrian heads a passage lighted by electric bulbs widely spaced midway in this an entrance to the structure was flanked by a wooden shanty by day a tool house after working hours a shelter for the night watchman This boasted one glazed window dull with orange light Approaching with due precaution Lanyard peered in The light came from a single electric bulb and a potbellied sheet iron stove glowing red Near by in a chair tipped against the wall sat the watchman corncob pipe in hand head drooping eyes closed mouth ajar A snore of the first magnitude seemed to vibrate the very walls On the floor beside the chair stood a two quart tin pail full of arid emptiness Dismissing further consideration of the watchman as a factor satisfied that the entire neighbourhood as well was sound asleep Lanyard darted up the plank walk that led into the building then paused to get his bearings Effluvia of mortar and damp lumber saluted him in an uncanny place whose darkness was slightly qualified by a faint refracted glow from the low canopy of cloud and by equally dim shafts of diffused street light There was more or less flooring of a temporary character over a sable gulf of cellars and overhead a sullen weeping sky cross hatched with stark black ironwork With infinite patience Lanyard groped his way through that dark labyrinth to the foot of a ladder ascending an open shaft wherein a hoisting tackle dangled Here he stumbled over what he had been seeking a great coil of one inch hempen cable from which he measured off roughly what he would require if his calculations were correct and something over This length he re coiled and slung over his shoulder an awkward weighty handicap Nevertheless he began to climb Above the third level there was merely steel framework he had somewhat more light to guide him with a view of the north wall of the Seventy ninth Street house bright in the glare of avenue lamps The wall was absolutely blank At the seventh level the ladders ended He stepped off upon a foot wide beam paused to make sure of his poise and began to walk the girders with a sureness of foot any aviator might have envied At regular intervals he encountered uprights between these he had to depend upon his sense of direction and equilibrium to guide him safely across those narrow walks of steel made slippery by rain But thanks to forethought his footwork was faultless he wore shoes old well broken very soft flexible and silent The building was in the shape of a squat E with two courts facing south On this seventh level the first court was bridged by a single girder the middle of which was Lanyard s immediate objective Since it lacked uprights he took it cautiously on hands and knees until approximately equidistant from both ends when he straddled it took the cable from his shoulders uncoiled a length and made it fast round the girder with a clove hitch giddy work in that darkness on that greasy span fashioning by simple sense of touch the knot upon which his life was to depend half of the time prone upon the girder and fishing blindly beneath it for the rope s end with nothing but a seventy foot drop between him and eternity not even another girder to break a fall He was now immediately opposite the minaret at an elevation of about twenty feet above the roof he wished to reach and as far away or perhaps a trifle farther Still he detected no signs of life about that nest of spies if the wireless were in operation its apparatus was well housed there was no sound of the spark never a glimmer of its violet flash Laboriously the knot completed to his satisfaction Lanyard returned via the eastern arm of the E paying out the coiled cable as he progressed working round to the north side of the court Once again pausing opposite the minaret he knotted the end of the cable loosely round an upright connecting with the sixth level let it slide down followed it repeated the process and rested finally on the fifth Now his ordeal approached a climax which he contemplated with what calmness he could while securing the rope beneath the arms In another sixty seconds or less it must be demonstrated whether his dead reckoning would set him down safe and sound on the roof or dash him against the walls of the Seventy ninth Street house to swing back and dangle impotently in mid air till daylight and police discovered him unless escaping injury he were able to pull himself up hand over hand to the girder With one arm round the upright to prevent the sag of rope from dragging him over prematurely he essayed a final survey Either the murk deceived or Lanyard had judged shrewdly His feet were on an approximate level with the coping round the roof and he stood about as far from the upper girder to which the rope was hitched as that was distant from the coping One look up and round at those louring skies duskily flushed by subdued city lights with no more ceremony Lanyard released the upright and committed his body to space If the downward sweep was breathless what followed was breath taking once past the nadir of that giant swing he was borne upward by an impetus steadily and sensibly slackening Instant followed leaden winged instant while the wall looming like a mountainside seemed to be toppling insensately bent upon his annihilation even so his momentum decreasing with frightful swiftness seemed possessed of demoniac desire to frustrate him After an age long agony of doubt it became evident he was not destined to crash into the wall but not that he was to gain the coping through fractions of a second hideously protracted this last drew near nearer slowly ever more slowly And he was twisting dizzily With frantic effort he crooked an arm over the coping at a juncture when had he not acted instantly he must have swung back There was a racking wrench as though his arm were being torn from its socket At the end of a struggle even more wearing he flung his other arm across the ledge and for some time hung there at the end of an almost taut rope unable to overcome its resistance and pull himself in over the coping stubbornly refusing to loose his grasp Presently grown desperate he let go with his right hand holding fast only with the left fumbled in a pocket found his knife opened it with his teeth and began to saw at the rope round his chest Strand after strand parted grudgingly till it fell away altogether and reaction from its tension threw him against the coping with such violence that he all but lost his hold Dropping the knife he swept his right arm up and once more hooked his fingers over the inside of the ledge Far down the knife clinked suggestively upon stone Breathing deep Lanyard braced knees and feet against the wall worried heaved hauled squirmed like a mad thing in the end rolled over the top and fell at length upon the roof panting trembling bathed in sweat temporarily tormented by impulses to retch By degrees regaining physical control he sat up took his bearings and crept toward the foot of the minaret A small narrow doorway in its base was on the latch He passed through to the landing of a dark winding stairway with a dim light at the bottom of its circular well While he stood attentive intermittent stridor troubled the stillness originating at some point on the floors below the proscribed wireless was at work Hearing no other sounds Lanyard went on down the steps at their foot pausing to spy out through a half open doorway to the topmost storey Nobody moved in the corridor He saw nothing but a line of closed doors presumably to servants quarters Now however the vibrant rasp of the radio spark was perceptibly stronger and had a background of subdued noise echoes of distant voices deadened sounds of hasty footfalls now and again a heavy thump or the bang of a door Moving out he commanded the length of the corridor Toward one end a door stood open He could see no more of the room beyond than a narrow patch of wall fitfully illuminated by a play of violet light Then a man stepped out of this operating room turning on the threshold to utter some parting observation and Lanyard retired hastily to the shaft of the minaret stairway but not before recognising Velasco A moment later the Brazilian passed his lurking place walking with bended head a worried frown darkening his swarthy countenance and Lanyard emerged in time to see his head and shoulders vanish down a stairway at the far end of the corridor Following with discretion Lanyard leaned over the head of the main staircase well looking down three flights to the ground floor to which Velasco was descending The house seemed veritably to hum with secret and to judge by the pitch of its rumour well nigh panic activity One divined a scurrying as of rats about to desert a sinking ship Untoward events had thrown this establishment into a state of excited confusion their nature Lanyard could not surmise but their conjunction with his designs was exasperatingly inopportune To search this place and find his man if he were there at all without being discovered while its inmates buzzed about like so many startled hornets was a fair impossibility to attempt it was to court death None the less he was inflexible in determination to go on to push his luck to its extremity by sheer force to bend fortuity to his service and suffer without complaint whatever the consequences of its recoil Yet even as he advanced a foot to begin the descent he withdrew it On the ground floor a door closing with a resounding crash had proved the signal for an outburst of expostulant acrimonious voices some half a dozen men giving angry tongue at one and the same time their roars of polysyllabic gutturalisms fusing into utterly unintelligible clamour One thought of a mutiny in a German madhouse Moment after moment passed the squall persisting with unmitigated viciousness If now and again it subsided momentarily it was only into uglier growls and swiftly to rise once more to high frenzy of incoherence Two of the disputants appeared in the square frame of the staircase well oddly foreshortened figures brandishing wild arms one of them Velasco the other a man whom Lanyard failed to identify seemingly united in common anger directed at the head of some person invisible Abruptly with a gesture of almost homicidal fury the Brazilian darted out of sight The other followed Then the object of their wrath took to the stairs stopping at the rail of the first landing and gesticulating savagely over the heads of his audience Velasco and the others returning amid a knot of fellows to bay round the newel post His voice full throated cried them all down Ekstrom s deep and resonant voice domineering over the uproar hectoring one after another into sullen silence In the beginning employing nothing but terms and phrases of insolence and objurgation untranslatable when he had secured a measure of attention he delivered a short address in tones of unqualified contempt I will have obedience he stormed Let no one misunderstand my status here I am come direct from His Majesty the Emperor with full power and authority to command and direct affairs which you have individually collectively proved yourselves either unfit or unable to cope with What I do I do in my absolute discretion with the full sanction and confidence of the Kaiser He who questions my judgment or my actions questions the wisdom of the All Highest Let it be clearly understood I am answerable to no one under God but myself and my Imperial master Henceforth be good enough to hold your tongues or take the consequences and be damned to you all Briefly he stood glowering down at their upturned faces then sneered and turned away Come along O Reilly he said Fetch the woman and give no more heed to swine dogs His hand slipped up the rail to the first floor vanished If O Reilly followed with the woman mentioned both kept back from the rail and so out of Lanyard s field of vision The group at the foot of the stairs moved away grumbling profanely At once Lanyard began to descend rapidly and without care to avoid detection One flight down he met face to face a manservant evidently a footman with an armful of clothing which he was conveying from one chamber to another The fellow stopped short jaw dropping eyes popping whereupon Lanyard paused and addressed him in German with a manner of overbearing contempt that is to say in character You re wanted upstairs in the radio room he said at once The servant bleated one word of protest But Be silent Do as I bid you It is an emergency Drop those things and go Do you hear imbecile Completely cowed and cheated the man obeyed literally letting his burden of garments fall to the floor and bounding hurriedly up the stairs Another flight was negotiated without misadventure on this floor as well servants were flitting busily to and fro but none favoured the adventurer with the least attention Midway down the third flight he pulled up to one side of the landing and reconnoitred It was on the next floor below the first above the street that Ekstrom had stopped But in what quarter thereof The exigency forbade the risk of one false turn If Lanyard were to take Ekstrom unawares it must be at the first cast From the ground floor came semi coherent snatches of surly comment like growls of a thunderstorm passing off into the distance At a time such as this Secret Service snapping at our heels base on the Vineyard discovered Au Printemps raided Sophie Weringrode under arrest God knows whether she will hold her tongue Trust her But this ass Bringing a woman here putting all our necks into a halter Immediately opposite the foot of the stairway on the first storey a door opened O Reilly came alertly forth closed the door behind him paused fished in his pocket for a cigarette case lighted and inhaled with deep appreciation meantime eavesdropping on the utterances below with his head cocked to one side and a malicious smile shadowing his handsome Irish face In his own good time he shrugged an indifferent shoulder thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered coolly on down the stairs The moment he disappeared Lanyard went into action in two bounds cleared landing and stairs in another threw himself upon the door It opened readily Entering he put his back to it with his left hand groped for found and turned a key his right holding ready the automatic pistol he had taken from the lockers of the U boat The room was a combination of administrative bureau and study very handsomely if somewhat over decorated and furnished with an atmosphere as distinctively German as that of a Bierstube the sombreness of its colour scheme lending weight to its array of massive desks tables chairs bookcases and lounges Between great draped windows and an impressive chimney piece opposite beside a broad long desk in a straight backed chair sat a woman gagged bound as to her wrists strips of cloth which had but lately bound ankles as well on the floor about her feet That woman was Cecelia Brooke Ekstrom stood behind her in the act of loosening the knots which held the gag secure For a space of thirty seconds transfixed by the apparition of his enemy he did not stir other than to raise weaponless hands in deference to the pistol trained upon his head But the blood ebbed from his face leaving it a ghastly mask in which shone the eyes of a man who sees certain death closing in upon him and is powerless to combat it even to die fighting for life And his lips curled back in a snarl neither of contempt nor of hatred but of terror And for as long Lanyard remained as motionless rooted in a despondency of thwarted hopes no less profound than the despair of the Prussian apprehending what that one could not yet guess that once more and now certainly for the last time vengeance was denied him the fulfilment of all his labours and their sole purpose snatched from his grasp The instincts of a killer were not his Barring injudicious attempt to summon aid or take the offensive Ekstrom was safe from injury at the hands of Michael Lanyard His cunning his favour in the countenance of fortune or whatever it was that had enabled him to make the girl his prisoner and bring her here bade fair to prove his salvation Deep in Lanyard s consciousness an echo stirred of half forgotten words Vengeance is mine The sense of frustration brewed a hopelessness as stark as that of a brow beaten child A blackness seemed to be settling down upon his faculties A mist wavered momentarily before his eyes He gulped convulsively swallowing what had almost been a sob But he spoke in a voice positively dispassionate Keep your hands up Lanyard removed and pocketed the key crossed to the middle of the room without once letting his gaze waver from the face of the Prussian passed behind him planted the muzzle of the pistol beneath Ekstrom s shoulder blade and methodically searched him finding and putting aside on the desk one automatic nothing else Stand aside The almost puerile measure of his disappointment was betrayed in the thrust with which he shouldered Ekstrom out of the way so forcibly that the man was sent staggering wildly half a dozen paces Don t move assassin Pardon mademoiselle one moment Lanyard muttered with his one free hand undoing the gag He made slow work of that fumbling while watching Ekstrom with unremitting intentness hoping against hope that his enemy might make one false move one only by some infatuate endeavour to turn the tables excuse his killing But Ekstrom would not Recovery of his equilibrium had been coincident with the shock administered to his hardihood and sense of security by Lanyard s entrance He stood now in a pose of insouciant grace hands idly clasped before him disdain glimmering in languid lidded eyes contempt in the set of his lips an ensemble eloquent of brazen effrontery the outgrowth of perception of the fact that Lanyard being what he was could neither shoot him down in cold blood nor with the Brooke girl present even attempt to injure him compunctions unassembled in the make up of the Boche therefore when discovered in men of other races at once despicable and ridiculous The gag came away Mademoiselle has not been injured Lanyard enquired solicitous The girl coughed and gasped shaking her head enunciating with difficulty in little better than a husky whisper roughly handled nothing worse Lanyard s face burned as if his blood were molten mercury Nothing worse Appreciation of what handling she must have suffered if she had resisted at all before those beasts could have bound her excited an indignation from whose light as it blazed in Lanyard s eyes even Ekstrom winced The hand was tremulous with which he sought to loose her wrists so much so that she could not but notice Don t mind me look to that man she begged Leave me to unfasten these with my teeth He can t be trusted for a single instant Mademoiselle Lanyard mumbled instinctively employing the French idiom you have reason For an instant only he hesitated swayed this way and that by the maddest of impulses then resigned himself absolutely to their ascendancy This goes beyond all bounds he said in an undertone Deliberately leaving the Englishwoman to free herself according to her suggestion forgetful indeed for the moment that she was not altogether free he moved to the desk and left his own automatic there beside Ekstrom s Mademoiselle he said mechanically without looking at the girl without power to perceive aught else in the world but the white evil face of his enemy for what I am about to do I beg you forgive me of your charity I can endure no more It is too much He strode past her She twisted in her chair then rose following him with wide eyes of alarm above her hands whose bonds her teeth worried without rest Ekstrom had not stirred though one flash of pure exultation had transfigured his countenance on comprehension of Lanyard s purpose thanks to the silly scruples of this animal one more chance for life was granted him Nor would the Prussian give an inch when Lanyard paused confronting him squarely within arm s length Ekstrom the adventurer began in a voice lacking perceptible inflection what is between you and me needs no recounting You know it too well I likewise It is my wish and my intention to kill you with my two hands Nothing can prevent that not even what you count upon my reluctance to you incomprehensible to commit an act of violence in the presence of a woman But because Miss Brooke is here because you have brought her here by force because you are what you are and so have treated her insolently before we come to our final accounting you shall get down upon your knees and ask her pardon He saw no yielding in the eyes of the Prussian only arrogance and when he paused he was answered in one phrase of the gutters of Berlin couched in the imagery of its lowest boozing kens so unspeakably vile in essence and application that Lanyard heard it with an incredulity almost stupefying almost not altogether It was barely spoken when those lips that framed it were crushed by a blow of such lightning delivery that though he must have been prepared for it Ekstrom s guard was still lowered as he reeled back lost footing and went to his knees Panting snarling uttering teeth and blasphemy the Prussian recoiled like a serpent gathered himself together and launched headlong at Lanyard only to be met full tilt by a second blow and a third each more merciless than its predecessor beating him down once more This time Lanyard did not wait for him to come back for punishment but closed in catching him as he strove to rise meeting each fresh effort with ruthless accuracy battering him into insanity of despair so that Ekstrom came back again and again without thought animated only by frenzied brute instinct to find the throat of his tormenter and ever and ever failing till at length he crumpled and lay crushed and writhing then subsided into insensibility was quite still but for heaving lungs and the spasmodic clutchings of his broken and ensanguined fingers With a start a broken sigh a slight movement of the hand interpreting a crushing sense of the futility of human passion Lanyard relaxed drew back from standing over his antagonist abstractedly found a handkerchief and dried his hands of a sudden so inexpressibly shamed and degraded in his own sight that he dared not look the girl s way but stood with hang dog air avoiding her regard Yet could he have mustered up heart he might have surprised in her eyes a light to lift him out from this slough of humiliation to obliterate chagrin in a flood of wonder and misgivings When however he did after a moment turn to her that look was gone replaced by one that reflected something of his own apprehension for a heavy hand was hammering on the study door and more than one voice on the other side was calling on Karl to open Either the servant whom Lanyard had met and victimised on his way downstairs had given the alarm or else the noise of the encounter within the study had brought that pack of spies to the door wildly demanding admission Steadied by one swift exchange of alarmed glances with the girl Lanyard hastily reviewed the room seeking some avenue of escape None offered but the windows He ran to them tore back their draperies and found them closed with shutters of steel and padlocked Simultaneously the din at the door redoubled With a worried shake Lanyard crossed to the chimney piece ducked his head and stepped into its huge fireplace One upward glance sufficed to dash his hopes here was no way out arduous though feasible immediately above the fireplace the flue narrowed so that not even the most active man of normal stature might hope to negotiate its ascent He returned with only a gesture of disconcertion to answer the girl s look of appeal Can we do nothing she asked raising her voice a trifle to make it heard above the tumult in the corridor There s no help for it I m afraid he said going to the desk and taking up the pistols nothing to do but shoot our way out if we can Take this he added offering her one of the weapons which she accepted without spirit If you can t get your own consent to use it give it to me when I ve emptied the other She breathed a dismayed Yes and wonderingly consulted his face since he did not stir other than thoughtfully to replace his pistol on the desk then stood staring at his soot smeared palms What is it she demanded nervously Why do you hesitate As one fretted by inconsequential questions he merely shook his head glancing sidelong once at the unconscious Prussian again with calculation toward the door This he saw quivering under repeated blows With brusque decision he said Get a chair brace it beneath the door knob please and leaving her without more explanation turned back to the fireplace Motionless in dumb confusion the girl stood staring after him till roused by a blow of such splintering force as to suggest that an axe had been brought into play upon the door then ran to a ponderous club chair and with considerable exertion managed to trundle it to the door and tip it over wedging its back beneath the knob By this time it had become indisputably patent that an axe was battering the panels But the door in character with the room was a substantial piece of workmanship and needed more than a few blows even of an axe to break down its barrier of solid oak She looked round to discover Lanyard kneeling beside Ekstrom insanely so it seemed to the girl engaged in blackening the upper half of the man s face with a handful of soot Unconsciously uttering a little cry of distress she sped to his side and caught his shoulder with an importunate hand In Heaven s name Monsieur Duchemin what are you doing Is this a time for childishness He responded with a smile of boyish mischief so genuine that her doubts of his reason seemed all too well confirmed Making up my understudy he said simply And brushing his hands over the rug to rid them of superfluous soot Lanyard rose Please go back and stand by the door on the side of the hinges I ll be with you in one minute Resigned to humour this lunatic whim what else could she do the girl retreated to the position designated and watched with ever darker doubts of his sanity while Lanyard hurriedly drew the shells from his automatic and carefully placed its butt in the slack grasp of Ekstrom s fingers Then lifting from a near by table a great cut glass bowl of flowers the adventurer inverted it over Ekstrom s body Expending its full force upon the man s chest that miniature deluge splashed widely wetting his face half filling his open mouth Some of the soot was washed away but not a great deal enough stuck fast to suit Lanyard s purpose Roused by that cool shock half strangled as well Ekstrom coughed violently squirmed spat out a mouthful of water and lifted on an elbow still more than half dazed Joining the girl by the door Lanyard saw the Prussian sit up and glare blankly round the room a figure of tragic fun drenched woefully disfigured eyes rolling wildly in the wide spaces round them which Lanyard had left unblackened Swinging the club chair away from the door the adventurer placed it with its back to the room Get down behind that he indicated shortly and drew the key from his pocket Don t show yourself for your life And let me have that pistol please A bright triangular wedge of steel broke through one of the panels as he fitted and turned the key in the lock His wits clearing Ekstrom saw him and with a howl of fury staggered to his feet clutching the unloaded pistol and endeavouring to level it for steady aim Simultaneously Lanyard turned the knob and let the door fly open remaining beside the chair that hid the girl A knot of spies O Reilly and Velasco among them whirled into the room pulled up at sight of that strange grim figure disguised beyond all recognition by its half mask of black facing and menacing them with a pistol O Reilly fired in the next breath his shot echoed by half a dozen so closely bunched as to resemble the rattle of a mitrailleuse At the first report the pistol dropped from Ekstrom s grasp He carried a hand vaguely to his throat staggered a single step uttered a strangled moan and fell forward his body fairly riddled his death little short of instantaneous While the fusillade was still resounding Lanyard seizing the girl s wrist unceremoniously dragged her from behind the chair and thrust her through the door retreating after her with his face to the roomfull his pistol ready None of that lot paid him any heed the attention of all wholly absorbed by the tragedy their violent hands had wrought Velasco the first to stir ran forward and dropped to his knees beside the dead man Others followed Gently Lanyard drew the door to locked it on the outside and at the sound of a choking cry from Cecelia Brooke whirled smartly round prepared if need be to make good his promise to clear with gun play a way to the street though opposed by every inmate of the establishment But the first face he saw was Crane s The Secret Service man stood within a yard To him as to a rock of refuge Cecelia Brooke had flown to his hand she was clinging like a frightened child trying to speak failing because she choked on sobs and gasps of horror Behind him on the landing at the head of the staircase running up from below ascending to the upper storeys were a score or more of men of sturdy and business like bearing and indubitably American stamp Of these two were herding into a corner a little group of frightened German servants Lanyard s stare of astonishment was met by Crane s twisted smile My friend he said as quietly as anyone could with his accent of a quizzical buzz saw I sure got to hand it to you Every time I try to pull anything off on the dead quiet you beat me to it clean Everywhere I think you ain t and can t be that s just where you are But I ain t complaining I got to admit if you hadn t staged your act to occupy the minds of those gents in there we might ve had a lot more difficulty raiding this joint Quickly he wound an arm round the waist of Cecelia Brooke when without warning she swayed blindly and would have fallen Here now he protested That s no way to do Why she s flickered out Well Monsieur Duchemin Lanyard Ember to a man up a tree this looks like your job You take this little lady off my hands and see her home and I ll just naturally try and finish what I started or what you did For son I got to give you credit you sure are one grand li l trouble hound XXI QUESTION Through the breathing hush of that dark hour which foreruns the dawn that hour in which the head that knows a wakeful pillow is prone to sudden and disquieting apprehension of its insignificance and it s soul s dread isolation the cab sped swiftly south upon the Avenue shadowed reaches of the park upon its right upon its left the dull tired faces of those homes whose tenants lay wrapped in the cotton wool of riches The rain had ceased A little wind was blowing up There was a fresh smell in the air Sidewalks began to be maculated with spreading areas of dryness but the roadway was still wet and shining the wide black mirror of a myriad lights Through the windows of the speeding cab an orderly procession of street lamps marching past threw each its fugitive and pallid glimmer Periods of modified darkness intervened when the face of the girl in her corner seemed a vision subtle and wraithlike But ever the recurrent lights revealed her sweetly incarnate if deep in enervation of crushing weariness Once she stirred and sighed profoundly and Lanyard bending toward her asked if he could be in any way of service She replied in an undertone scarcely better than a whisper Thank you I am quite comfortable Please what time is it The cab was passing Sixtieth Street Lanyard caught a fleeting glimpse of a street clock with a dial like a little golden moon It s just four Thank you Very tired Very He had the maddest notion that her head inclined to droop toward his shoulder Perhaps the motion of the cab If so she recovered easily Can I do anything No thank you only An ungloved hand stirred from her lap and for the merest instant rested lightly above his own or hovered rather barely touching it with a touch tenuous and elusive no sooner realised than gone I mean she murmured I am a bit too overwrought too tired to talk I quite understand he said Please forget I m here just rest Perhaps she smiled drowsily Or was that too a freak of his imagination Lanyard assured himself it was in excess of consideration even tried to persuade himself he had dreamed that ghost of a caress upon his hand It seemed so little like her Not that anything had happened more than a gesture of transient inadvertence due to fatigue It could not have been intentional that act of intimacy when the girl was altogether engrossed in young Thackeray There was something one must not forget something that gave the lie flatly to that innuendo of the Weringrode s Ignorant of the circumstances the intrigante had leaped blindly at conclusions after the habit of her kind True Sophie had not implied that this girl cared for him but vice versa either supposition however was as absurd as the other As if Lanyard could love a woman who loved another As if the name of love meant aught to him but the memory of a sweetness like a vagrant air of Spring that had breathed fitfully for a season upon the Winter of his heart A corner of Lanyard s mouth lifted in a sneer That precious heart of his the heart of a thief upon which even now the fruits of his thieving weighed Irritated he wrenched his thoughts into another channel and began to piece together inconsecutive snatches of information gained from Crane in the confusion of the quarter hour just past while the Secret Service operatives were busy rounding up the inmates of that spy fold and searching for evidences of their impudent activities It appeared that Washington had at length however tardily roused out of its inertia and at midnight had telegraphed instructions to arrest out of hand every enemy alien in the land against whom there was evidence of conspiracy or even a ponderable suspicion So unexpected was this order that Crane had volunteered to show Cecelia Brooke that midnight rendezvous of the Prussian spy system without the least notion that he might be required before morning to lead a raiding force against the establishment and even when a messenger stopped him as he turned to enter Au Printemps he was not advised concerning the cause of this demand for his immediate presence at headquarters The first cast of what Crane aptly termed the dragnet had brought in the management and service staff to a man with a number of the restaurant s habitues including Sophie Weringrode and her errand boy the exquisite mister Revel Velasco however had somehow mysteriously managed to slip through the meshes and had straightway hastened to spread the alarm As for O Reilly and Dressier they had left with Ekstrom in pursuit of Lanyard less than five minutes before and so had escaped not only arrest but all knowledge of the raid prior to their return to Seventy ninth Street The second cast of the net had been made at the latter place as soon as the watchers were able to assure Crane that Ekstrom and O Reilly had returned Dressier having anticipated them there by something like half an hour By daybreak then these gentry would be interned on Ellis Island And break of day impended visibly in grayish shades that stole westward through the cross town streets like clouds of secret agents spying out the city against invasion by the serried lances of the sun A garish twilight washed Forty second Street from wall to wall by the time the car swung round in front of the Knickerbocker As yet however there was little evidence that the town was growing restive in its sleep with premonition of the ardour of another day Lanyard stepped down and offered the girl a hand in whose palm her slender fingers rested lightly for an instant ere she passed on while he turned to bid the driver wait Following he overtook her in the entrance where by tacit consent both paused and lingered in an odd constraint There was so much to be said that was impossible to say just then Visibly the woman drooped betraying physical exhaustion in every line of her pose seeming scarcely strong enough to lift the silken lashes that trembled upon cheeks a little drawn and pale with the faintest of bluish rings beneath the eyes I must not keep you Lanyard broke the silence I merely wished to say good night and I am sorry Sorry she echoed That you had such an unhappy experience he explained thanks to your thoughtfulness for me I do not deserve so much consideration and that only makes me feel all the more regretful It was silly of me she admitted with a shadowy rueful smile I m afraid my silliness makes too much trouble He commented honestly I don t understand If I had only been patient enough to wait for you to call me Forgive that oversight I was pressed for time as you may imagine Oh it all comes back to my own stupidity I might have known you had come through all right How should you Why not when you turn up here in New York safe and sound after being drowned on the Assyrian as if that were not proof enough that you bear a charmed life Charmed he laughed And you haven t yet told me how you survived that adventure You are kind to be interested and I am unfortunate in never seeing you save under circumstances unfavourable for yarn spinning You might be more fortunate Only tell me how If you cared to ask me to dine with you to morrow I mean to night You would He was distressed by consciousness that his voice had thrilled impetuously But perhaps she had not noticed there was no change in the even friendliness of her tone I m as inquisitive as any woman that ever lived Even if I wished to I m afraid I shouldn t be able to resist an invitation to hear your Odyssey Delmonico s at eight Thank you she said primly You make me too happy May I call for you Please She offered a hand whose touch he found cool steady and impersonal Good morning mister Ember He stood in a stare while she went quickly through the lobby to a waiting elevator then roused and went back to his cab It was by daylight that he reentered his rooms and found them tenanted by a negro boy bound and gagged bruised and sore and scared beyond intelligible expression Freeing him and salving his injuries bodily and spiritual with a liberal douceur Lanyard exacted an oath of silence then turned him out He had approximately five hours to put in somehow before his appointment with Colonel Stanistreet at nine and was too well versed in the lore of late hours to think of giving any part of that time to sleep By so doing he would only insure a mutinous awakening with mind and body sluggish and unrested If on the other hand he remained awake he would go to that interview in a state of supernormal animation exceedingly to be desired if he were to round out this adventure without discredit For its end was not yet He had still a part to play whose lines were not yet written whose business remained to be invented He neither dared shirk that appointment for reasons of policy nor wished to while there remained reparation to be accomplished a wrong to be righted justice to be done a question to be answered Only when these matters had been put in order would he feel his honour discharged of its burdens himself free once more to drop out and go in peace his lonely ways in life ways henceforth to be both lonely and aimless For when he strove to peer into the future only an emptiness confronted him With Ekstrom accounted for finally and forevermore there was nothing to come but the final accounting of the Lone Wolf with that civilization which had bred and suffered him One way presented itself to make that reckoning even The Foreign Legion of France asks no embarrassing questions of its recruits and enlistment in its ranks offers with anonymity a consoling certainty Thus alone might he find his way home to the heart of that enigma whence he had emerged a nameless waif astray in grim Parisian by ways This vision of his end contenting him he began to scheme a campaign for the day that was simple enough in prospect a little chicanery with Stanistreet a personal appeal to Crane to restore the passports of Monsieur Andre Duchemin which must have been found on Ekstrom s body a berth on some steamer sailing for Europe then the last evanishment One detail alone troubled him his promise to the Brooke girl that she should dine with him that night Reminded of this obligation figuratively he seized Michael Lanyard by the scruff of his neck and shook him with a savage hand What insensate folly was ever his what want of wit and strength to keep out of temptation s ways Why must he have fallen in so readily with her suggestion Why this infatuate thirst for sympathy this eagerness to violate the seals of reticence at the wish of a strange woman Was there any reasonable explanation of the strange lack of his wonted self sufficiency in the company of Cecelia Brooke No matter If he might not contrive somehow to squirm out of that engagement he could at all events school himself to decent reticence He promised himself to make his account of the submarine adventure drearily bald and trite to minimize to the last degree his part therein above all things to refrain from painting the Lone Wolf in romantic colours She was much too good a sort too straight sincere fair minded honest the sort of girl who deserved the Thackeray sort of man never a thief If she even dreamed Lanyard brought forth from its hiding place the necklace weighed it in his hand examined it minutely Granting its marvellous perfection he recognized no more its beauty dispassionately reviewed in turn each stone of matchless loveliness no more susceptible to their seductive purity perceiving in them nothing but hard bright translucent pebbles cold soulless cruel One by one they slipped through his fingers like beads of an unholy rosary At length crushing them together in the hollow of his palm he stood a while in thought then turning to his writing desk bundled the necklace in wrappings of white tissue secured with rubber bands counted carefully the sheaf of bills he had taken from Ekstrom sealed the whole amount in a plain long envelope and put this aside in company with the necklace Already two hours had passed and since he meant to call at the house on West End Avenue well in advance of the hour when Cecelia Brooke might be there presuming Blensop to have given her the same appointment as he had given mister Ember that is nine o clock it was now time to prepare Returning to his bedchamber he laid out a carefully selected change of clothing shaved parboiled himself in a hot bath chilled him to the pith in one of icy coldness and dressed with scrupulous heed to detail studiously effacing every sign of his sleepless night That experience was in no way to be surmised from his appearance when he sallied forth to breakfast at the Plaza At eight precisely presenting himself at the Stanistreet residence he desired the footman to announce him as the author of a certain telegram from Edgartown He was obliged to wait less than a minute the footman returning in haste to request him to step into the library This apartment which he found much as he had last seen it eight hours ago its window shattered the portieres down the furniture in some disorder was on his introduction occupied by two persons one an elderly iron gray gentleman of untidy dress and unobtrusive habit in spite of a discerning cool gray eye the other mister Blensop in the neatest of one button morning coat effects with striped trouserings neither too smart nor too sober for that state of life unto which it had pleased God to call him and fair white spats If his attire was radiant so was the temper of the secretary sunny He tripped forward in sprightliest fashion offering cordial hands to the caller till he recognized him and even then was discountenanced only for the briefest moment My dear mister Ember he purred soothingly why didn t you tell me last night it was you who had sent that telegram If I had for a moment suspected the truth you should have had your appointment with Colonel Stanistreet at any hour you might have cared to name no matter how ungodly Lanyard bowed gravely Thank you he said And Colonel Stanistreet Is just finishing breakfast He will be down directly Please be seated make yourself entirely at ease And will you excuse me With pleasure Lanyard assured him his gravity unbroken A doubt clouded mister Blensop s bright eyes but its transit was instantaneous He turned forthwith to join the iron gray man before the portrait which concealed the safe And now mister Stone said mister Blensop with indulgence Well sir said mister Stone quietly if you ll be good enough to show me how this contraption works maybe I ll find out something interesting maybe not mister Blensop proceeded to oblige by operating the lever and sliding aside the portrait Thanks said mister Stone producing a magnifying glass from a waistcoat pocket and beginning to peer myopically at the face of the safe I take it nobody s been pawing over this since the late as you might say unpleasantness Not a soul has touched it By Colonel Stanistreet s order it was covered as soon as we found it had been tampered with Um m mister Stone acknowledged bending close to his work Partially perhaps by way of administering an urbane rebuke to Lanyard for his readiness to dispense with his society mister Blensop remained in the neighbourhood of mister Stone hovering round him like a domesticated humming bird Do you find anything he enquired when Stone straightened up Fingerprints a plenty mister Stone admitted with a hint of temper a slew of the damn things Looks like you must ve called in the neighbours to help make a good show However we ll see what we can make of em He conjured from some recess in his clothing a squat bottle from another a stopper in which was fitted a blowpipe joined the two together approached the safe with one end of the pipe between his lips and sprayed it with a thin film of white powder the contents of the bottle I say do tell me what that s for That said mister Stone patiently is to make the fingerprints stand out so we can get a good likeness of em He put the bottle aside blinked at the safe approvingly and by further exercise of powers of legerdemain materialized a pocket kodak and a flashlight pistol Can t I help you Blensop offered eagerly I used to be rather a dab at amateur photography you know Well I m kind of stuck on pressing the button myself Stone confessed adjusting the focus But if you want to work that flashlight I don t mind Delighted mister Blensop asserted How does it go now Like this Stone set his camera down to demonstrate Now just stand behind me he concluded and pull the trigger when I say now I ll do my best but I say will it bang Stone had taken up the camera once more His sole answer was a grunt upon which his hearers placed two distinct interpretations Lanyard s affording him considerable gratification If you re ready said Stone now mister Blensop squinted unbecomingly and pressed the trigger A vivid flare lifted from the pan of the pistol and winked out in a cloud of vapour slowly dissipating Is that all Yes sir that s all of that Stone stowed the camera away about his person and from another cranny produced a small cardboard box of glass slides one of which he offered Now if you ll just run your fingers through your hair and rest them on this slide light but steady What for Blensop demanded with a giggle of nervous reluctance You don t think I m the thief do you No sir I don t But if I haven t got your fingerprints how am I going to tell them from the thief s Oh I see Blensop said with a note of allayed apprehension and put himself on record The door opening to admit Colonel Stanistreet Lanyard rose At sight of him the Englishman checked and stared enquiringly his eyes shadowed by careworn brows for it was apparent that if the events of the night had not depressed the spirits of the secretary his employer had known little sleep or none since the burglary Colonel Stanistreet Blensop said melodiously abandoning Stone to his unsupervised devices this is mister Ember the gentleman who called last night before you got home It appears he is the person who sent us that telegram from Edgartown day before yesterday Indeed Ember is not the name with which the message was signed The message was purposely left unsigned Lanyard explained Stanistreet nodded approval I am glad to meet you mister Ember he said offering a hand Be seated I am most anxious first to express our gratitude next to learn how you came by your information You will find it an interesting story No doubt of that Stanistreet took the desk chair opened a cigar humidor and offered it I shall be even more interested however he said with an evanescent trace of humour to know who the devil you are sir That is something I am prepared to prove to your satisfaction If you will be so good But excuse me for one moment Stanistreet turned in his chair mister Stone Yes sir Have you finished with the safe If so I want my secretary to check over its contents carefully and make sure nothing else is missing I m all through with it Colonel Stanistreet Now if you don t mind I m going to mouse around and see if I can nose out anything else that s useful That shall be entirely as you will Now Blensop Stanistreet nodded to the secretary let us make certain Yes sir Blithely mister Blensop addressed himself to the safe There has been an accident of some sort Colonel Stanistreet Lanyard enquired civilly nodding toward the shattered French window A burglary sir The criminal escaped Stanistreet nodded Our watchman surprised him and was shot for his pains not seriously I m happy to say The burglar got himself tangled up in that window but extricated in time and went over the garden wall before we could determine which way he had taken I trust you lost nothing of value Stanistreet shrugged Unhappily we did a diamond necklace the property of my sister in law and ah a document we could ill afford to part with But you offered to show me credentials I believe Such as they are Lanyard replied My passports and letters were stolen from me But these I think should serve as well to prove my bona fides He laid out in order upon the desk his plunder from the safe aboard the U boat all but the money the three cipher codes the log the diary of the commander the directory of German secret agents and such other documents as he had selected The first Colonel Stanistreet took up with a dubious frown which swiftly lightened yielding as he pursued his examination into the papers and began to recognize their surpassing value to the Allied cause to a subdued glimmer of gratulatory excitement But he was at pains to satisfy himself as to the authenticity of each paper in turn providing a lull for which Lanyard was not ungrateful since it gave him a chance to adjust his understanding to an unexpected development in the affair He lounged at ease smoking his eyes half veiled by lowered lids keenly reviewing the room and its tenants Stone the detective an operative Lanyard rightly inferred of the American Secret Service loaned to the British in order to keep the burglary out of police records and newspapers had wandered out into the garden that glowed with young April sunlight beyond the windows From time to time he was to be seen stooping and inspecting the earth with the gravity of an earnest efficient sober sided sleuth of the old school Blensop was busy before the safe extracting the contents of each pigeonhole in turn thumbing its dockets of papers checking each off upon a typewritten list several pages in length To that lithe and debonair figure Lanyard s gaze oftenest reverted So not only had the necklace been stolen but a document which the British Secret Service could ill afford to part with Lanyard entertained no least doubt as to the identity of the document in question There could be but one he felt which Stanistreet would so characterize That document had not been in the safe when Lanyard had opened it at midnight After a moment mister Blensop uttered a musical note of vexation The lead of his pencil had broken He threw it pettishly aside came over to the desk took up a penholder dipped it in the ink well and returned to his task XXII CHICANE Colonel Stanistreet put down the last of the papers and slapped his hand upon it resoundingly This is one of the most remarkable collections of data I venture to assert that has ever come into the hands of the British Government Have you any idea of its value Lanyard lifted a whimsical eyebrow Some he admitted drily And what do you ask for it sir Nothing The gaze of the Englishman bored into his eyes but he met their challenge with an unshaken countenance smiling My dear sir Stanistreet demanded who are you The name under which I sailed for New York on board the Assyrian Lanyard announced quietly was Andre Duchemin Disturbed by a startled exclamation together with a sound of shuffling and a slight thump he looked round in mild curiosity to see Blensop staggered and astare standing over a litter of documents which had slipped from his grasp to the floor Mastering his emotion quickly enough the secretary knelt with a mumbled apology and began to pick up the papers With no more notice of the incident Lanyard returned undivided attention to Colonel Stanistreet I had another name he confessed and a reputation none too savoury as I daresay you know Through the courtesy of the British Intelligence Office I was permitted to disguise these but on the Assyrian I was recognized in short ran afoul of German Secret Service agents who knew me but whom I did not know On the sixth night out circumstances conspired to make me seem a serious obstacle to their schemes Consequently I was waylaid robbed and thrown overboard Within the next few minutes a torpedo struck the ship and the submarine which fired it came up under me as I struggled to keep afloat By passing myself off as a Boche spy I succeeded in inducing the commander to take me below and so reached the Martha s Vineyard base There chance played into my hands I contrived to sink the U boat and escape as reported in my telegram During a brief silence he found opportunity to observe that mister Blensop was working with hands that trembled singularly Incredible Stanistreet commented Yet here is proof Lanyard asserted indicating the papers beneath Stanistreet s hand My dear sir I didn t mean Pardon Lanyard smiled with a lifted hand I never thought you did Colonel Stanistreet But it is your duty to make sure you are not imposed upon by plausible adventurers Therefore since my papers have been stolen I am glad to be able to prove my identity with Andre Duchemin by referring to survivors of the Assyrian disaster among others mister Sherry the second officer mister Crane of the United States Secret Service and a countrywoman of yours a Miss Cecelia Brooke whose acquaintance I was fortunate enough to make Stanistreet nodded heavily and consulted his watch Miss Brooke he said should be here shortly Blensop made an appointment with her last night which I confirmed by telephone this morning Then with permission I shall remain and ask her to vouch for me Lanyard suggested in resignation since it appeared he was not to be permitted to escape this girl that destiny was not yet finished with their entanglement I shall be glad if you will sir Monsieur Duchemin Stanistreet began but hesitated or do you prefer another style I am content with Duchemin That is a matter for your own discretion but I should warn you it may already have acquired an evil odour on this side To my knowledge it has been used within the last twenty four hours and the pretensions of its wearer supported by your stolen credentials I am not surprised Lanyard stated reflectively A chap with a beard perhaps Why yes Anderson the adventurer nodded that at least was his alias when he jockeyed himself into the second steward s berth aboard the Assyrian He glanced idly across the room discovered Blensop once more at pause in a stare and grinned amiably He came here last night Stanistreet volunteered deliberately representing himself as Andre Duchemin to sell me a certain paper the same which subsequently I am convinced he returned to steal And did Lanyard added And did the Briton conceded Now you have told me who he is I promise you every effort shall be made to apprehend him and prevent further misuse of the name you have assumed It has Lanyard said tersely I beg your pardon I say every effort has been made and successfully to accomplish the ends you mention What s that you say Blensop demanded shrilly crossing to the desk My secretary Stanistreet explained was present at the interview and is naturally interested And very good of him I m sure Lanyard agreed I was about to explain mister Blensop that Ekstrom alias Anderson was killed in the course of a raid on the Prussian spy headquarters in Seventy ninth Street this morning Amazing Blensop gasped I am glad to hear it he added and went slowly back to his task I may as well tell you sir Lanyard pursued I have every reason to believe the document sold you last night was one of those stolen from me Stanistreet wagged a contentious head I cannot conceive how it could have come into your possession sir Simply enough Miss Brooke requested me to take care of it for her The eyes of the Englishman grew stony Miss Brooke he repeated testily I don t understand It was a document I do not seek to know its nature from you sir of vital importance in this present crisis with the United States newly entered into the war Stanistreet affirmed with an inclination of his head I may tell you this much Monsieur Duchemin if it had not reached this country safely What am I saying If it be not recovered without delay the chances of America s early and efficient participation in the war will suffer a tremendous setback Blensop be good enough to call up the American Secret Service at once and ask whether the document in question was found on the body of this ah Ekstrom Pardon Lanyard interposed as Blensop hesitantly approached the telephone It would be a waste of time I happen to know because I was there that no such document was found on Ekstrom s body The devil Stanistreet grumbled What can have become of it This business grows only the blacker the deeper one seeks to fathom it I must own myself completely at a loss How it came into the hands of Miss Brooke I can explain that I think The document was in the care of two gentlemen mister Bartholomew and Lieutenant Thackeray The former was murdered by the Huns in search of it Lieutenant Thackeray murderously assaulted But for Miss Brooke s intervention the assassins must have succeeded As it was the young woman herself found it and one presumes took charge of it because her fiance was incapacitated and possibly with the notion that she might thereby prevent further mischief of the same nature Her fiance Stanistreet echoed blankly Lieutenant Thackeray Her brother sir the Briton laughed Thackeray was his nom de service It was Lanyard s turn to stare Ah he murmured A light begins to dawn Upon me as well Stanistreet confessed Miss Brooke and her brother are orphans and before the war were inseparable companions I do not doubt that learning he had been commissioned with an uncommonly perilous errand she booked passage by the Assyrian without his consent in order to be near him in event of danger This explains much Lanyard conceded much that perplexed more than one can say But in no way advances us on the trail of the purloined document I am afraid sir Lanyard lied deliberately you may as well abandon all hope of ever seeing it again Ekstrom made away with it no question about that There was time enough and to spare between his exploit here and his death for him to deliver it to safe hands It is doubtless decoded by this time a copy of it already well on the way to the Wilhelmstrasse I am afraid Stanistreet echoed I am very much afraid you are right His thick spatulate fingers of an executive drummed heavily upon the desk Stone s figure darkened the windows Colonel Stanistreet he called diffidently Yes mister Stone There s something here I d like to consult you about sir if you can spare a minute Certainly The Englishman rose If you will excuse me Monsieur Duchemin Half way to the windows he hesitated By the bye Blensop I wish you d call up Apthorp and ask after Howson s condition Very good sir Blensop intoned cheerfully And do it without delay please I don t like to think of the poor fellow suffering Immediately sir As his employer passed out into the garden with Stone the secretary discontinued his checking and came over to the desk drawing up a chair and sitting down to telephone At the same time Lanyard got up and began to pace thoughtfully to and fro Howson is the wounded night watchman I take it mister Blensop Yes an excellent fellow Schuyler nine three hundred Blensop cooed into the transmitter Conceivably that ostensible discomfiture whose symptoms Lanyard had remarked had been a transitory humour mister Blensop was now in what seemed the most equable and blithe of tempers His very posture at the telephone eloquently betokened as much he had thrown himself into the chair with picturesque nonchalance sitting with body half turned from the desk his right hand holding the receiver to his ear his left thrust carelessly into his trouser pocket thus dragging back the lapel of that impeccable morning coat and exposing the bright cap of his gold mounted fountain pen Something in that implement seemed to possess for Lanyard overpowering fascination His gaze yearned for it returned again and again to it He changed his course to stroll up and down behind Blensop between him and the safe I understood Colonel Stanistreet to say the watchman was not seriously injured I believe he observed with interest Shot through the shoulder that is all Schuyler nine three hundred doctor Apthorp please This is mister Blensop speaking secretary to Colonel Stanistreet Are you there doctor Apthorp With professional dexterity Lanyard en passant dropped a hand over the young man s shoulder and lightly lifted the pen from its place in the pocket of Blensop s waistcoat the even tempo of his step unbroken he tossed it toward the safe where it fell without sound upon a heavy Persian rug Yes about Howson the musical accents continued Colonel Stanistreet is most solicitous Swiftly Lanyard moved toward the safe glanced through the French windows to assure himself that Stanistreet and Stone were safely preoccupied whipped out the envelope he had prepared and thrust it into a file of papers which did not crowd its pigeonhole accomplishing the complete manoeuvre with such adroitness that like the business of the pen it passed utterly without the knowledge of the secretary Thank you so much Good morning doctor Apthorp Lanyard was passing the desk when Blensop rose and the footman was entering with his salver A lady to see Colonel Stanistreet sir by appointment she says Blensop glanced at the card At the same time Stanistreet came in from the garden leaving Stone to potter about visibly in the distance Miss Brooke is here sir the secretary announced Ask her to come in please The footman retired Howson is resting easily doctor Apthorp reports Blensop added going back to the safe Has Stone turned up anything of interest sir Footprints Stanistreet replied with a snort of moderate impatience He s quite upset since I ve informed him the man who made them is Good God The interruption was Blensop s in a voice strangely out of tune Stanistreet wheeled sharply upon him What the deuce he snapped By every indication the secretary had suffered the most severe shock of his experience His face was ghastly his eyes vacant his knees shook beneath him one hand pressed convulsively the bosom of his waistcoat His endeavours to reply evoked only a husky rattling sound What the devil has come over you Stanistreet insisted The rattle became articulate I ve lost it It s gone What have you lost N nothing sir That is I mean to say my fountain pen The way you take it I should say you d lost your head Stanistreet commented You must have dropped the thing somewhere Look about see if you can t find it Thus admonished the secretary began to search the floor with frantic glances and as the footman ushered in Cecelia Brooke Lanyard saw the young man dart forward and retrieve the pen with a start of relief wellnigh as unmanning as the shock of loss had seemed With that Lanyard s interest in the fellow waned he was too poor a thing to consider seriously while here was one who compelled anew as ever when they met the homage of sincere and marvelling admiration Yet another of those miracles of feminine adaptability and makeshift had brought the girl to this meeting in the guise of one who had never known a broken night or an hour s care with a look of such fresh tranquility that it seemed hardly possible she could be one and the same with that wilted little woman whom Lanyard had left in the gray dawn at the entrance to the Hotel Knickerbocker A tailored suit necessarily borrowed plumage became her so completely that it was difficult to believe it not her own Her eyes were calm and sweet with candour her colour was a clear and artless glow the hand she offered the Briton was tremorless Colonel Stanistreet I am he Miss Brooke It is kind of you to call so early to relieve my mind about your brother I have known Lionel so long He is resting easily said the girl His complete recovery is merely a matter of time and nursing That is good news said Stanistreet Monsieur Duchemin I believe you know I have been fortunate in that at least Gravely Lanyard saluted the hand extended to him in turn Mademoiselle is most gracious he said humbly Then I understand Monsieur Duchemin must have told you The girl addressed Stanistreet Permit me to leave you Lanyard interposed No she begged please not I ve nothing to say that you may not hear You have been too much involved If mademoiselle insists Lanyard demurred I feel it is not right I should stay And yet if you will indulge me I should like very much to demonstrate the truth of an old saw Two confused looks were his response I fear I for one do not follow Stanistreet admitted I will explain quite briefly Lanyard promised The adage I have in mind is as old as human wit Set a thief to catch a thief And the last time it was quoted in my hearing it was not to my advantage I recall indeed resenting it enormously He paused with purpose looking down at the desk A pad of blank paper caught his eye He took it up and examined it with an abstracted manner Well monsieur the application of your adage Colonel Stanistreet what would you think if I were to tell you the combination of your safe I should be inclined to suspect that you were the devil Stanistreet chuckled By all accounts a gentleman of intelligence one is flattered Very well I proceed to demonstrate black art with the aid of this white paper pad The combination monsieur is as follows nine twenty seven eighteen thirty six A low cry of bewilderment greeted this announcement Blensop had drawn near and was eyeing Lanyard as if under the influence of hypnotism How how do you know that he asked in a broken voice Clairvoyance mister Blensop I seem to see as I hold this pad somebody writing upon it the combination for the information of another who had no right to have it somebody using a pencil with a hard lead mister Blensop which was very foolish of him since it made a distinct impression on the under sheet So you see my magic is rather colourless after all Now a wiser man mister Blensop would have used a pen a fountain pen by preference with a soft gold nib well broken That would leave no impression If you will lend me the beautiful pen I observe in your pocket I will give a further demonstration The eyes of the secretary shifted wildly He hesitated moistening dry lips with the tip of a nervous tongue And don t try to get out of it mister Blensop because I am armed and don t mean to let you escape Besides that good mister Stone patrols the garden Lanyard s tone changed to one of command That pen monsieur Blensop s hand faltered to his waistcoat pocket hesitated withdrew and feebly extended the pen I think you are the devil he stammered in an under tone the devil himself Deftly unscrewing the pen point Lanyard inverted the barrel above the desk The cylinder of paper dropped out And now Colonel Stanistreet if you will call mister Stone and have this traitor removed XXIII AMNESTY When Stanistreet had gone out in company with Stone and the broken weeping Blensop ending a scene indescribably painful a lull almost as uncomfortable to Lanyard ensued Then How did you guess Cecelia Brooke asked in wonder Discountenanced by the admiration glowing in her eyes Lanyard stood fumbling with the disjointed members of Blensop s pen Do not give me too much credit he depreciated anybody acquainted with that roll of paper could have guessed that an empty fountain pen would furnish an ideal place of concealment for it Moreover just before you came in that traitor missed his pen and his consternation betrayed him beyond more doubt to one whose distrust was already astir As for the other it was true Blensop did write down the combination on this pad using a pencil with a hard lead the marks are very plain But for whose use Ekstrom Anderson was here last night and saw Blensop alone Colonel Stanistreet was not at home Knowing what we know now that Blensop was a creature of the German system here bought body soul and conscience through its studied pandering to his vices we know he could not well have refused to surrender the combination on demand Still I fail to understand Ekstrom being Ekstrom could not resist the opportunity to play double Here was a property he could sell to England at a stiff price Why not despoil the enemy put the money in pocket then return steal the paper anew for the use of Germany and collect the stipulated reward from that source But he reckoned without Blensop s avarice there he showed Blensop too plainly the way to profit through betraying both parties to a bargain Blensop saw no reason why he should not play the game that Ekstrom played So he stole it for himself to sell to Germany but being a poor witless fool lacking Ekstrom s dash and audacity was foredoomed to failure and exposure The girl continued to eye him steadfastly and he as steadfastly to evade her direct gaze Nothing that you tell me detracts from the wonder of your guessing so accurately she insisted Now I know what mister Crane said of you was true that you are one of the most extraordinary of men He was too kind when he said that Lanyard protested wretchedly It is not true If you must know Well Monsieur Lanyard Her tone was that of a light hearted girl arch with provocation Of a sudden Lanyard understood that he might no longer stop here alone with her If you will be a little indulgent with me he suggested I will try to explain what I mean And how indulgent monsieur I have a whim to take the air in this garden Will you accompany me Why not As she led the way through the French windows he noted with deeper misgivings how her action matched the temper of her voice how she seemed to day more deliciously alive and happier than any common mortal So light her heart And all since she had found him here At his wits ends he conceded now what he had so long denied With all her wit and wisdom with all her charm of beauty winsomeness and breeding with all her ingrained love of truth and honesty she was no more than Nature had meant her to be a woman with woman s weakness for the man she must admire She liked him divined in him latent qualities somehow excellent Something in him worked upon her imagination something no doubt in the overcoloured romantic yarns current about the Lone Wolf and so had touched her heart She liked him too well already and she was willing to like him better But that must never be He must rend ruthlessly apart this illusion of romance with which she chose to transfigure the prowling parasite of night the sneaking thief The garden was sweet with the bright promise of Spring A few weeks more and its formal walks would wend a riot of flowers Now its sunlight made amends for what it lacked in beauty of growing things and its air was warm and fragrant and still in the shelter of the red brick walls Midway down that walk by the side of which a thief had skulked nine hours ago near that door whose lock had yielded to his cunning keys the girl paused and confronted Lanyard spiritedly as he came up with heavy step and hang dog head Well monsieur she demanded Do you mean to tantalize me longer with your reticence But something in the haggard eyes he showed her made the girl catch her breath What is it she cried anxiously Monsieur Duchemin what is your trouble Only this truth that I must tell you he said bitterly I merely played a part back there just now There was neither wit nor guess work in that business once I had seen Blensop s panic over the fancied loss of his pen the rest was knowledge I saw him and Ekstrom together last night skulking in those windows I watched them and though in my denseness I didn t understand I saw him write upon that pad tear off and give the sheet to Ekstrom And I knew Ekstrom had not succeeded in stealing back what he had sold to Colonel Stanistreet knew he was guiltless in fact if not in deed But how could you know that Because I was there in the room when he entered it after it had been shut up for the night Conscious of her hands that fluttered like wounded things to her bosom he looked away in misery What were you doing there she whispered in the end Trying to find that paper which I had seen Ekstrom sell to Colonel Stanistreet so that I might make good my promise and relieve your distress by returning it to you I had opened the safe before he entered and searched it thoroughly and knew the paper was not there though at that time it never entered my thick head to suspect Blensop of treachery It was neither Blensop nor Ekstrom Miss Brooke it was I who stole that necklace She made no sound and did not stir and though he dared not look he knew her stricken gaze was steadfast to his face I will say this much in my defence I did not come with intent to steal but only to take back what had been stolen from me and return it to you who had trusted it to my care I wanted to do that because I did not then understand the ins and outs of this intrigue and had no means of knowing how deeply your honour might be involved But you did not take that necklace I am sorry I saw it and could not resist it But mister Crane assured me you had given up all that sort of thing years ago Notwithstanding that it seems I may not be trusted After another trying silence she declared vehemently I do not believe you You say this thing for some secret purpose of your own For some reason I can t understand you wish to abase yourself in my sight to make me think you capable of such infamy Why ah monsieur why must you do this Because it isn t fair to represent myself as what I am not mademoiselle Once a thief always No It isn t true Again I am sorry but I know You have been most generous to believe in me If anything could save me from myself it would be your confidence That I presume is why I felt called upon to undo my thieving and make good the loss The money Colonel Stanistreet paid Ekstrom is now in the safe back there in the library The necklace is here Blindly he thrust the tissue packet into her hands If you will consent to return it to its owner when I have gone I shall be most grateful Her hands shook so that when she would open the packet it escaped her grasp and dropped into a little pool of rain water which had collected in a hollow of the walk Lanyard picked it up stripped off the soiled and sodden paper dried the necklace with his handkerchief replaced it in her hand He heard the deep intake of her breath as she recognized its beauty then her quavering voice You give this back because of me Because I cannot be an ingrate I know no other way to prove how I have prized your faith in me And now with your leave I will go away quietly by this garden gate No please no But I have more to say to you It isn t fair of you to go like this when I She interrupted herself and when next she spoke he was dashed by a change in her voice from a tone of passionate expostulation to one of amused animation Colonel Stanistreet she called clearly Do come here at once please Startled Lanyard saw that Stanistreet had appeared in the French windows in company with Crane In response to Cecelia s hail both came out into the garden Stanistreet briskly leading Crane lounging at his heels champing his cigar his weathered features knitted against the brightness of the sun Good morning Miss Brooke Howdy Lanyard or are you Duchemin again he said but his salutations were lost in the wonder excited by the girl s next move See Colonel Stanistreet what we have found she cried and showed him the necklace I mean what Monsieur Duchemin found It was he who saw it lying beneath that rose bush over there Your burglar must have dropped it in making his escape you can see the paper he wrapped it in all rain wet and muddied Stanistreet s eyes protruded alarmingly and his face grew very red before he found breath enough to ejaculate God bless my soul Breathing hard he accepted the necklace from Cecelia s hands I must excuse me I must tell my sister in law about this immediately He turned and trotted hastily back into the house Crane lingered but a moment longer His cheek as ever was bulging round his everlasting cigar Was his tongue therein as well Lanyard never knew the man s eyes remained inscrutable for all the kindly shrewdness that glimmered amid their netted wrinkles Excuse me he said suddenly I got to tell the colonel something He got lankily into motion and presently passed in through the windows Irresistibly her gaze drew Lanyard s He lifted careworn eyes and realized her with a great wistfulness upon him She awaited in silence his verdict her chin proudly high her face adorably flushed her shining eyes level and brave to his her generous hands outstretched Must you go now she said tenderly as he stood hesitant and shamed Must you go now my dear THE END End of the Project
