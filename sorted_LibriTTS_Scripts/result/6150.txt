6974-258420-0000	train-other-500	THE ILIAD OF HOMER RENDERED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE BY EDWARD EARL OF DERBY PREFACE In the spring of eighteen sixty two I was induced
none	none	 at the request of some personal friends to print for private circulation only a small volume of Translations of Poems Ancient and Modern 
6974-258420-0001	train-other-500	in which was included the first Book
none	none	 of the Iliad The opinions expressed by some competent judges of the degree of success which had attended this attempt to infuse into an almost literal English version something of the spirit as well as the simplicity of the great original Footnote Introduction to unpublished volume were sufficiently favourable to encourage me to continue the work which I had begun It has afforded me in the intervals of more urgent business an unfailing and constantly increasing 
6974-258420-0002	train-other-500	source of interest and it is not without a feeling of regret at the completion of my task and a sincere diffidence as to its success that I venture to submit the result of my labour to the ordeal
6974-258420-0003	train-other-500	of public criticism Various causes irrespective of any demerits of the work itself forbid me to anticipate for this translation any extensive popularity
6974-258420-0004	train-other-500	First I fear that the taste for and appreciation of Classical Literature are greatly on the decline next those who have kept up their classical studies
6974-258420-0005	train-other-500	and are able to read and enjoy the original will hardly take an interest in a mere translation while the English reader unacquainted with Greek
none	none	 will naturally prefer the harmonious versification and polished brilliancy 
6974-258420-0006	train-other-500	of Pope s translation with which as a happy adaptation of the Homeric story to the spirit of English poetry I have not the presumption to enter into competition But admirable as it is
6974-258420-0007	train-other-500	Pope s Iliad can hardly be said to be Homer s Iliad
none	none	 and there may be some who having lost the familiarity with the original language which they once possessed may if I have at all succeeded in my attempt 
6974-258420-0008	train-other-500	have recalled to their minds a faint echo of the strains which delighted their earlier days and may recognize some slight trace of the original perfume Numerous as have been the translators of the Iliad
6974-258420-0009	train-other-500	or of parts of it the metres which have been selected have been almost as various the ordinary couplet in rhyme the Spenserian stanza the Trochaic or Ballad metre
6974-258420-0010	train-other-500	all have had their partisans even to that
none	none	 pestilent heresy 
6974-258420-0011	train-other-500	of the so called English Hexameter a metre wholly repugnant to the genius of our language which can only be pressed into the service by a violation of every rule of prosody
6974-258420-0012	train-other-500	and of which notwithstanding my respect for the eminent men who have attempted to naturalize it I could never read ten lines without being irresistibly reminded of Canning s
6974-258420-0013	train-other-500	Dactylics call saint thou them God help thee silly one
6974-258420-0014	train-other-500	But in the progress of this work I have been more and more confirmed in the opinion which I expressed at its commencement that whatever may be the extent of my own individual failure
6974-258420-0015	train-other-500	if justice is ever to be done to the easy flow and majestic simplicity of the grand old Poet it can only be in the Heroic blank verse
none	none	 I have seen isolated passages admirably rendered in other metres 
6974-258420-0016	train-other-500	and there are many instances in which a translation line for line and couplet for couplet naturally suggests itself and in which it is sometimes difficult to avoid an involuntary rhyme
6974-258420-0017	train-other-500	but the blank verse appears to me the only metre capable of adapting itself to all the gradations if I may use the term of the Homeric style
6974-258420-0018	train-other-500	from the finished poetry of the numerous similes in which every touch is nature and nothing is overcoloured or exaggerated down to the simple almost homely style of some portions of the narrative
6974-258420-0019	train-other-500	Least of all can any other metre do full justice to the spirit and freedom of the various speeches in which the old warriors give utterance without disguise or restraint to all their strong and genuine emotions
6974-258420-0020	train-other-500	To subject these to the trammels of couplet and rhyme would be as destructive of their chief characteristics as the application of a similar process to the Paradise Lost of Milton
6974-258420-0021	train-other-500	or the tragedies of Shakespeare the effect indeed may be seen by comparing with some of the noblest speeches of the latter the few couplets which he seems to have considered himself bound by
6974-258420-0022	train-other-500	custom to tack on to their close at the end of a scene or an act I have adopted not without hesitation the Latin rather than the Greek nomenclature for the Heathen Deities
6974-258420-0023	train-other-500	I have been induced to do so from the manifest incongruity of confounding the two and from the fact that though English readers may be familiar with the names of Zeus or Aphrodite or even Poseidon
none	none	 those of Hera or Ares or Hephaestus or Leto 
6974-258420-0024	train-other-500	would hardly convey to them a definite signification It has been my aim throughout to produce a translation and not a paraphrase
none	none	 not indeed such a translation as would satisfy 
6974-258420-0025	train-other-500	with regard to each word the rigid requirements of accurate scholarship but such as would fairly and honestly give the sense and spirit of every passage and of every line omitting nothing
6974-258420-0026	train-other-500	and expanding nothing and adhering as closely as our language will allow ever to every epithet which is capable of being translated and which has in the particular passage
6974-258420-0027	train-other-500	anything of a special and distinctive character Of the many deficiencies in my execution of this intention I am but too conscious whether I have been in any degree successful
none	none	 must be left to the impartial decision of such of the Public as may honour this work with their perusal D KNOWSLEY OCT eighteen sixty four 
6974-258420-0029	train-other-500	NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION The favourable reception which has been given to the first Editions of this work far exceeding my most sanguine hopes
6974-258420-0030	train-other-500	affords a gratifying proof how far in my preface I had overrated the extent to which the taste for and appreciation of Classical Literature had declined It will not I hope
6974-258420-0031	train-other-500	be thought extraordinary that some errors and inaccuracies should have found their way into a translation executed I must admit somewhat hastily
none	none	 and with less of the limae labor 
6974-258420-0032	train-other-500	than I should have bestowed upon it had I ventured to anticipate for it so extensive a circulation My thanks therefore are due to those critics who either publicly or privately
6974-258420-0033	train-other-500	have called my attention to passages in which the sense of the Author has been either incorrectly or imperfectly rendered All of these I have examined and have availed myself
6974-258420-0034	train-other-500	of several of the suggestions offered for their correction and a careful revision of the whole work and renewed comparison with the original have enabled me to discover other defects
6974-258420-0035	train-other-500	the removal of which will I hope render the present Edition especially in the eyes of Classical Scholars somewhat more worthy of the favour which has been accorded to its predecessors D
none	none	 saint JAMES S SQUARE May eighteen eighty five ARGUMENT THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON In the war of Troy the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring towns and taken from thence two beautiful captives Chryseis and Briseis allotted the first to Agamemnon and the last to Achilles Chryses the father of Chryseis and priest of Apollo comes to the Grecian camp to ransom her with which the action of the poem opens in the tenth year of the siege The priest being refused and insolently dismissed by Agamemnon entreats for vengeance from his god who inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks Achilles calls a council and encourages Calchas to declare the cause of it who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseis The King being obliged to send back his captive enters into a furious contest with Achilles which Nestor pacifies however as he had the absolute command of the army he seizes on Briseis in revenge Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his forces from the test of the Greeks and complaining to Thetis she supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her son by giving victory to the Trojans Jupiter granting her suit incenses Juno between whom the debate runs high till they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan The time of two and twenty days is taken up in this book nine during the plague one in the council and quarrel of the Princes and twelve for Jupiter s stay among the Ethiopians at whose return Thetis prefers her petition The scene lies in the Grecian camp then changes to Chrysa and lastly to Olympus BOOK I Of Peleus son Achilles sing O Muse The vengeance deep and deadly whence to Greece Unnumbered ills arose which many a soul Of mighty warriors to the viewless shades Untimely sent they on the battle plain Unburied lay a prey to rav ning dogs And carrion birds but so had Jove decreed From that sad day when first in wordy war The mighty Agamemnon King of men Confronted stood by Peleus godlike son Say then what God the fatal strife provok d Jove s and Latona s son he filled with wrath Against the King with deadly pestilence The camp afflicted and the people died For Chryses sake his priest whom Atreus son With scorn dismiss d when to the Grecian ships He came his captive daughter to redeem With costly ransom charg d and in his hand The sacred fillet of his God he bore And golden staff to all he sued but chief To Atreus sons twin captains of the host Ye sons of Atreus and ye well greav d Greeks May the great Gods who on Olympus dwell Grant you yon hostile city to destroy And home return in safety but my child Restore I pray her proffer d ransom take And in his priest the Lord of Light revere Then through the ranks assenting murmurs ran The priest to reverend rence and the ransom take Not so Atrides he with haughty mien And bitter speech the trembling sire address d Old man I warn thee that beside our ships I find thee not or ling ring now or back Returning lest thou prove of small avail Thy golden staff and fillet of thy God Her I release not till her youth be fled Within my walls in Argos far from home Her lot is cast domestic cares to ply And share a master s bed For thee begone Incense me not lest ill betide thee now He said the old man trembled and obeyed Beside the many dashing Ocean s shore Silent he pass d and all apart he pray d To great Apollo fair Latona s son Hear me God of the silver bow whose care Chrysa surrounds and Cilia s lovely vale Whose sov reign sway o er Tenedos extends O Smintheus hear if e er my offered gifts Found favour in thy sight if e er to thee I burn d the fat of bulls and choicest goats Grant me this boon upon the Grecian host Let thine unerring darts avenge my tears Thus as he pray d his pray r Apollo heard Along Olympus heights he pass d his heart Burning with wrath behind his shoulders hung His bow and ample quiver at his back Rattled the fateful arrows as he mov d Like the night cloud he pass d and from afar He bent against the ships and sped the bolt And fierce and deadly twang d the silver bow First on the mules and dogs on man the last Was pour d the arrowy storm and through the camp Constant and num rous blaz d the fun ral fires Nine days the heav nly Archer on the troops Hurl d his dread shafts the tenth th assembled Greeks Achilles call d to council so inspir d By Juno white arm d Goddess who beheld With pitying eyes the wasting hosts of Greece When all were met and closely throng d around Rose the swift footed chief and thus began Great son of Atreus to my mind there seems If we would scape from death one only course Home to retrace our steps since here at once By war and pestilence our forces waste But seek we first some prophet or some priest Or some wise vision seer since visions too From Jove proceed who may the cause explain Which with such deadly wrath Apollo fires If for neglected hecatombs or pray rs He blame us or if fat of lambs and goats May soothe his anger and the plague assuage This said he sat and Thestor s son arose Calchas the chief of seers to whom were known The present and the future and the past Who by his mystic art Apollo s gift Guided to Ilium s shore the Grecian fleet Who thus with cautious speech replied and said Achilles lov d of Heav n thou bidd saint me say Why thus incens d the far destroying King Therefore I speak but promise thou and swear By word and hand to bear me harmless through For well I know my speech must one offend The Argive chief o er all the Greeks supreme And terrible to men of low estate The anger of a King for though awhile He veil his wrath yet in his bosom pent It still is nurs d until the time arrive Say then wilt thou protect me if I speak Him answer d thus Achilles swift of foot Speak boldly out whate er thine art can tell For by Apollo s self I swear whom thou O Calchas serv saint and who thy words inspires That while I live and see the light of Heav n Not one of all the Greeks shall dare on thee Beside our ships injurious hands to lay No not if Agamemnon s self were he Who mid our warriors boasts the foremost place Embolden d thus th unerring prophet spoke Not for neglected hecatombs or pray rs But for his priest whom Agamemnon scorn d Nor took his ransom nor his child restor d On his account the Far destroyer sends This scourge of pestilence and yet will send Nor shall we cease his heavy hand to feel Till to her sire we give the bright ey d girl Unbought unransom d and to Chrysa s shore A solemn hecatomb despatch this done The God appeas d his anger may remit This said he sat and Atreus godlike son The mighty monarch Agamemnon rose His dark soul fill d with fury and his eyes Flashing like flames of fire on Calchas first A with ring glance he cast and thus he spoke Prophet of ill thou never speak saint to me But words of evil omen for thy soul Delights to augur ill but aught of good Thou never yet hast promis d nor perform d And now among the Greeks thou spread saint abroad Thy lying prophecies that all these ills Come from the Far destroyer for that I Refus d the ransom of my lovely prize And that I rather chose herself to keep To me not less than Clytemnestra dear My virgin wedded wife nor less adorn d In gifts of form of feature or of mind Yet if it must he so I give her back I wish my people s safety not their death But seek me out forthwith some other spoil Lest empty handed I alone appear Of all the Greeks for this would ill beseem And how I lose my present share ye see To whom Achilles swift of foot replied Haughtiest of men and greediest of the prey How shall our valiant Greeks for thee seek out Some other spoil no common fund have we Of hoarded treasures what our arms have won From captur d towns has been already shar d Nor can we now resume th apportion d spoil Restore the maid obedient to the God And if Heav n will that we the strong built walls Of Troy should raze our warriors will to thee A threefold fourfold recompense assign To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus Think not Achilles valiant though thou art In fight and godlike to defraud me thus Thou shalt not so persuade me nor o erreach Think saint thou to keep thy portion of the spoil While I with empty hands sit humbly down The bright ey d girl thou bidd saint me to restore If then the valiant Greeks for me seek out Some other spoil some compensation just Tis well if not I with my own right hand Will from some other chief from thee perchance Or Ajax or Ulysses wrest his prey And woe to him on whomsoe er I call But this for future counsel we remit Haste we then now our dark ribb d bark to launch Muster a fitting crew and place on board The sacred hecatomb then last embark The fair Chryseis and in chief command Let some one of our councillors be plac d Ajax Ulysses or Idomeneus Or thou the most ambitious of them all That so our rites may soothe the angry God To whom Achilles thus with scornful glance Oh cloth d in shamelessness oh sordid soul How canst thou hope that any Greek for thee Will brave the toils of travel or of war Well dost thou know that t was no feud of mine With Troy s brave sons that brought me here in arms They never did me wrong they never drove My cattle or my horses never sought In Phthia s fertile life sustaining fields To waste the crops for wide between us lay The shadowy mountains and the roaring sea With thee O void of shame with thee we sail d For Menelaus and for thee ingrate Glory and fame on Trojan crests to win All this hast thou forgotten or despis d And threat nest now to wrest from me the prize I labour d hard to win and Greeks bestow d Nor does my portion ever equal thine When on some populous town our troops have made Successful war in the contentious fight The larger portion of the toil is mine But when the day of distribution comes Thine is the richest spoil while I forsooth Must be too well content to bear on board Some paltry prize for all my warlike toil To Phthia now I go so better far To steer my homeward course and leave thee here But little like I deem dishonouring me To fill thy coffers with the spoils of war Whom answer d Agamemnon King of men Fly then if such thy mind I ask thee not On mine account to stay others there are Will guard my honour and avenge my cause And chief of all the Lord of counsel Jove Of all the Heav n born Kings thou art the man I hate the most for thou delight saint in nought But war and strife thy prowess I allow Yet this remember is the gift of Heav n Return then with thy vessels if thou wilt And with thy followers home and lord it there Over thy Myrmidons I heed thee not I care not for thy fury Hear my threat Since Phoebus wrests Chryseis from my arms In mine own ship and with mine own good crew Her I send forth and in her stead I mean Ev n from thy tent myself to bear thy prize The fair Briseis that henceforth thou know How far I am thy master and that taught By thine example others too may fear To rival me and brave me to my face Thus while he spake Achilles chaf d with rage And in his manly breast his heart was torn With thoughts conflicting whether from his side To draw his mighty sword and thrusting by Th assembled throng to kill th insulting King Or school his soul and keep his anger down But while in mind and spirit thus he mus d And half unsheath d his sword from Heav n came down Minerva sent by Juno white arm d Queen Whose love and care both chiefs alike enjoy d She stood behind and by the yellow hair She held the son of Peleus visible To him alone by all the rest unseen Achilles wond ring turn d and straight he knew The blue eyed Pallas awful was her glance Whom thus the chief with winged words address d Why com saint thou child of aegis bearing Jove To see the arrogance of Atreus son But this I say and will make good my words This insolence may cost him soon his life To whom the blue ey d Goddess thus replied From Heav n I came to curb if thou wilt hear Thy fury sent by Juno white arm d Queen Whose love and care ye both alike enjoy Cease then these broils and draw not thus thy sword In words indeed assail him as thou wilt But this I promise and will make it good The time shall come when for this insolence A threefold compensation shall be thine Only be sway d by me and curb thy wrath Whom answer d thus Achilles swift of foot Goddess I needs must yield to your commands Indignant though I be for so tis best Who hears the Gods of them his pray rs are heard He said and on the silver hilt he stay d His pow rful hand and flung his mighty sword Back to its scabbard to Minerva s word Obedient she her heav nward course pursued To join th Immortals in th abode of Jove But Peleus son with undiminish d wrath Atrides thus with bitter words address d Thou sot with eye of dog and heart of deer Who never dar saint to lead in armed fight Th assembled host nor with a chosen few To man the secret ambush for thou fear saint To look on death no doubt tis easier far Girt with thy troops to plunder of his right Whoe er may venture to oppose thy will A tyrant King because thou rul saint o er slaves Were it not so this insult were thy last But this I say and with an oath confirm By this my royal staff which never more Shall put forth leaf nor spray since first it left Upon the mountain side its parent stem Nor blossom more since all around the axe Hath lopp d both leaf and bark and now tis borne Emblem of justice by the sons of Greece Who guard the sacred ministry of law Before the face of Jove a mighty oath The time shall come when all the sons of Greece Shall mourn Achilles loss and thou the while Heart rent shalt be all impotent to aid When by the warrior slayer Hector s hand Many shall fall and then thy soul shall mourn The slight on Grecia s bravest warrior cast Thus spoke Pelides and upon the ground He cast his staff with golden studs emboss d And took his seat on th other side in wrath Atrides burn d but Nestor interpos d Nestor the leader of the Pylian host The smooth tongued chief from whose persuasive lips Sweeter than honey flowed the stream of speech Two generations of the sons of men For him were past and gone who with himself Were born and bred on Pylos lovely shore And o er the third he now held royal sway He thus with prudent words the chiefs address d Alas alas what grief is this for Greece What joy for Priam and for Priam s sons What exultation for the men of Troy To hear of feuds tween you of all the Greeks The first in council and the first in fight Yet hear my words I pray in years at least Ye both must yield to me and in times past I liv d with men and they despis d me not Abler in counsel greater than yourselves Such men I never saw and ne er shall see As Pirithous and Dryas wise and brave Coeneus Exadius godlike Polypheme And Theseus AEgeus more than mortal son The mightiest they among the sons of men The mightiest they and of the forest beasts Strove with the mightiest and their rage subdued With them from distant lands from Pylos shore I join d my forces and their call obey d With them I play d my part with them not one Would dare to fight of mortals now on earth Yet they my counsels heard my voice obey d And hear ye also for my words are wise Nor thou though great thou be attempt to rob Achilles of his prize but let him keep The spoil assign d him by the sons of Greece Nor thou Pelides with the monarch strive In rivalry for ne er to sceptred King Hath Jove such pow rs as to Atrides giv n And valiant though thou art and Goddess born Yet mightier he for wider is his sway Atrides curb thy wrath while I beseech Achilles to forbear in whom the Greeks From adverse war their great defender see To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus O father full of wisdom are thy words But this proud chief o er all would domineer O er all he seeks to rule o er all to reign To all to dictate which I will not bear Grant that the Gods have giv n him warlike might Gave they unbridled license to his tongue To whom Achilles interrupting thus Coward and slave indeed I might be deem d Could I submit to make thy word my law To others thy commands seek not to me To dictate for I follow thee no more But hear me speak and ponder what I say For the fair girl I fight not since you choose To take away the prize yourselves bestow d With thee or any one but of the rest My dark swift ship contains against my will On nought shalt thou unpunish d lay thy hand Make trial if thou wilt that these may know Thy life blood soon should reek upon my spear After this conflict keen of angry speech The chiefs arose the assembly was dispers d With his own followers and Menoetius son Achilles to his tents and ships withdrew But Atreus son launch d a swift sailing bark With twenty rowers mann d and plac d on board The sacred hecatomb then last embark d The fair Chryseis and in chief command Laertes son the sage Ulysses plac d They swiftly sped along the wat ry way Next proclamation through the camp was made To purify the host and in the sea Obedient to the word they purified Then to Apollo solemn rites perform d With faultless hecatombs of bulls and goats Upon the margin of the wat ry waste And wreath d in smoke the savour rose to Heav n The camp thus occupied the King pursued His threaten d plan of vengeance to his side Calling Talthybius and Eurybates Heralds and faithful followers thus he spoke Haste to Achilles tent and in your hand Back with you thence the fair Briseis bring If he refuse to send her I myself With a sufficient force will bear her thence Which he may find perchance the worse for him So spake the monarch and with stern command Dismiss d them with reluctant steps they pass d Along the margin of the wat ry waste Till to the tents and ships they came where lay The warlike Myrmidons Their chief they found Sitting beside his tent and dark ribb d ship Achilles mark d their coming not well pleas d With troubled mien and awe struck by the King They stood nor dar d accost him but himself Divin d their errand and address d them thus Welcome ye messengers of Gods and men Heralds approach in safety not with you But with Atrides is my just offence Who for the fair Briseis sends you here Go then Patroclus bring the maiden forth And give her to their hands but witness ye Before the blessed Gods and mortal men And to the face of that injurious King When he shall need my arm from shameful rout To save his followers blinded by his rage He neither heeds experience of the past Nor scans the future provident how best To guard his fleet and army from the foe He spoke obedient to his friend and chief Patroclus led the fair Briseis forth And gave her to their hands they to the ships Retrac d their steps and with them the fair girl Reluctant went meanwhile Achilles plung d In bitter grief from all the band apart Upon the margin of the hoary sea Sat idly gazing on the dark blue waves And to his Goddess mother long he pray d With outstretch d hands Oh mother since thy son To early death by destiny is doom d I might have hop d the Thunderer on high Olympian Jove with honour would have crown d My little space but now disgrace is mine Since Agamemnon the wide ruling King Hath wrested from me and still holds my prize Weeping he spoke his Goddess mother heard Beside her aged father where she sat In the deep ocean caves ascending quick Through the dark waves like to a misty cloud Beside her son she stood and as he wept She gently touch d him with her hand and said Why weeps my son and whence his cause of grief Speak out that I may hear and share thy pain To whom Achilles swift of foot replied Groaning Thou know saint what boots to tell thee all On Thebes we march d Eetion s sacred town And storm d the walls and hither bore the spoil The spoils were fairly by the sons of Greece Apportion d out and to Atrides share The beauteous daughter of old Chryses fell Chryses Apollo s priest to free his child Came to th encampment of the brass clad Greeks With costly ransom charg d and in his hand The

ransom take Not so Atrides he with haughty mien And bitter words the trembling sire dismiss d The old man turn d in sorrow but his pray r Phoebus Apollo heard who lov d him well Against the Greeks he bent his fatal bow And fast the people fell on ev ry side Throughout the camp the heav nly arrows flew A skilful seer at length the cause reveal d Why thus incens d the Archer God I then The first

injur d son Fly to Olympus to the feet of Jove And make thy pray r to him if on his heart Thou hast in truth by word or deed a claim For I remember in my father s house I oft have heard thee boast how thou alone Of all th Immortals Saturn s cloud girt son Didst shield from foul disgrace when all the rest Juno and Neptune and Minerva join d With chains to bind him then O Goddess thou Didst set him free invoking to his aid Him of the hundred arms whom Briareus Th immortal Gods and men AEgeon call He mightier than his father took his seat By Saturn s side in pride of conscious strength Fear seiz

slaughter may be driv n That all may taste the folly of their King And Agamemnon s haughty self may mourn The slight on Grecia s bravest warrior cast Thus he and Thetis weeping thus replied Alas my child that e er I gave thee birth Would that beside thy ships thou could saint remain From grief exempt and insult since by fate Few years are thine and not a lengthened term At once to early death and sorrows doom d Beyond the lot of man in evil hour I gave thee birth But to the snow clad heights Of great Olympus to the throne of Jove Who wields the thunder thy complaints I bear Thou by thy ships meanwhile against the Greeks Thine anger nurse and from the fight abstain For Jove is to a solemn banquet gone Beyond the sea on AEthiopia s shore Since yesternight and with him all the Gods On the twelfth day he purpos d to return To high Olympus thither then will I And to his feet my supplication make And he I think will not deny my suit This said she disappear d and left him there Musing

sails they furl d and lower d to the hold Slack d the retaining shrouds and quickly struck And stow d away the mast then with their sweeps Pull d for the beach and cast their anchors out And made her fast with cables to the shore Then on the shingly breakwater themselves They landed and the sacred hecatomb To great Apollo and Chryseis last Her to the altar straight Ulysses led The wise in counsel in her father s hand He plac d the maiden and address d him thus Chryses from Agamemnon King of men To thee I come thy daughter to restore And to thy God upon the Greeks behalf To offer sacrifice if haply so We may appease his wrath who now incens d With grievous suff ring visits all our host Then to her sire he gave her he with joy Receiv d his child the sacred hecatomb Around the well built altar for the God In order due they plac d their hands then washed And the salt cake prepar d before them all With hands uplifted Chryses pray d aloud Hear me God of the silver bow whose care Chrysa surrounds and Cilla s lovely vale Whose sov reign sway o er Tenedos extends Once hast thou heard my pray r aveng d my cause And pour d thy fury on the Grecian host Hear yet again and grant what now I ask Withdraw thy chast ning hand and stay the plague Thus as he pray d his pray r Apollo heard Their pray rs concluded and the salt cake strew d Upon the victims heads they drew them back And slew and

libations pour d Of ruddy wine arm d with the five fork d prongs Th attendant ministers beside him stood The thighs consum d with fire the inward parts They tasted first the rest upon the spits Roasted with care and from the fire withdrew Their labours ended and the feast prepar d They shared the social meal nor lacked there aught The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied Th attendant youths the flowing goblets crown d And in fit order serv d the cups to all All day they sought the favour of the God The glorious paeans chanting and the praise Of Phoebus he well pleas d the strain receiv d But when the sun was set and shades of night O erspread the sky upon the sandy beach Close to their ship they laid them down to rest And when the rosy finger d morn appear d Back to the camp they took

sought The honour d council nor the battle field But wore his soul away and inly pin d For the fierce joy and tumult of the fight But when the twelfth revolving day was come Back to Olympus heights th immortal Gods Jove at their head together all return d Then Thetis mindful of her son s request Rose from the ocean wave and sped in haste To high Olympus and the courts of Heav n Th all seeing son of Saturn there she found Sitting apart upon the topmost crest Of many ridg d Olympus at his feet She sat and while her left hand clasp d his knees Her right approached his beard and suppliant thus She made her pray r to Saturn s royal son Father if e er amid th immortal Gods By word or deed I did thee service true Hear now my pray r Avenge my hapless son Of mortals shortest liv d insulted now By mighty Agamemnon King of men And plunder d of his lawful spoils of war But Jove Olympian Lord of counsel Thou Avenge his cause and give to Trojan arms Such strength and pow r that Greeks may learn how much They need my son and give him honour due She said the Cloud compeller answer d not But silent sat then Thetis clasp d his knees And hung about him and her suit renew d Give me thy promise sure thy gracious nod Or else refuse for thou hast none to fear That I may learn of all th immortal Gods How far I stand the lowest in thine eyes Then much disturb d the Cloud compeller spoke Sad work thou mak saint in bidding me oppose My will to Juno s when her bitter words Assail me for full oft amid the Gods She taunts me that I aid the Trojan cause But thou return that Juno see thee not And leave to me the furth rance of thy suit Lo to confirm thy faith I nod my head And well among th immortal Gods is known The solemn import of that pledge from me For ne er my promise shall deceive or fail Or

heights The Goddess hasted to her ocean caves Jove to his palace at his entrance all Rose from their seats at once not one presum d To wait his coming but advanc d to meet Then on his throne he sat but not unmark d Of Juno s eye had been the council held In secret with the silver footed Queen The daughter of the aged Ocean God And with sharp words she thus addressed her Lord Tell me deceiver who

be impotent To save thee for tis hard to strive with Jove When to thy succour once before I came He seiz d me by the foot and hurl d me down From Heav n s high threshold all the day I fell And with

spacious hall Thus they till sunset pass d the festive hours Nor lack d the banquet aught to please the sense Nor sound of tuneful lyre by Phoebus touch d Nor Muses voice who in alternate strains

wont of old When overcome by gentle sleep to rest Olympian Jove ascended there he slept And by his side the golden throned Queen ARGUMENT THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES Jupiter in pursuance of the request of Thetis sends a deceitful vision to Agamemnon persuading him to lead the army to battle in order to make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles The general who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance but fears the army was discouraged by his absence and the late plague as well as by length of time contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem He first communicates his design to the princes in council that he would propose a return to the soldiers and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced Then he assembles the whole host and upon moving for a return to Greece they unanimously agree to it and run to prepare the ships They are detained by the management of Ulysses who chastises the insolence of Thersites The assembly is recalled several speeches made on the occasion and at length the advice of Nestor followed which was to make a general muster of the troops and to divide them into their several nations before they proceeded to battle This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and Trojans in a large catalogue The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day The scene lies in the Grecian camp and upon the sea shore toward the end it removes to Troy BOOK II All night in sleep repos d the other Gods And helmed warriors but the eyes of Jove Sweet slumber held not pondering in his mind How to avenge Achilles cause and pour Destructive slaughter on the Grecian host Thus as he mus d the wisest course appear d By a deluding vision to mislead The son of Atreus and with winged words Thus to a phantom form he gave command Hie thee deluding Vision to the camp And ships of Greece to Agamemnon s tent There changing nought as I command thee speak Bid that he arm in haste the long hair d Greeks To combat for the wide built streets of Troy He now may capture since th immortal Gods Watch over her no longer all are gain d By Juno s pray rs and woes impend o er Troy He said the Vision heard and straight obey d Swiftly he sped and reached the Grecian ships And sought the son of Atreus him he found Within his tent wrapped in ambrosial sleep Above his head he stood like Neleus son Nestor whom Agamemnon reverend renc d most Of all the Elders in his likeness cloth d Thus spoke the heav nly Vision Sleep saint thou son Of Atreus valiant warrior horseman bold To sleep all night but ill becomes a chief Charg d with the public weal and cares of state Hear now the words I bear to thee I come A messenger from Jove who from on high Looks down on thee with eyes of pitying love He bids thee arm in haste the long hair d Greeks To combat since the wide built streets of Troy Thou now mayst capture for th immortal Gods Watch over her no longer all are gain d By Juno s pray rs and woes impend o er Troy Bear this in mind and when from sleep arous d Let not my words from thy remembrance fade This said he vanish d and the monarch left Inspir d with thoughts which ne er should come to pass For in that day he vainly hop d to take The town of Priam ignorant what Jove Design d in secret or what woes what groans What lengthen d labours in the stubborn fight Were yet for Trojans and for Greeks in store He woke from sleep but o er his senses spread Dwelt still the heavenly voice he sat upright He donn d his vest of texture fine new wrought Then o er it threw his ample robe and bound His sandals fair around his well turn d feet And o er his shoulders flung his sword adorn d With silver studs and bearing in his hand His royal staff ancestral to the ships Where lay the brass clad warriors bent his way Aurora now was rising up the steep Of great Olympus to th immortal Gods Pure light diffusing when Atrides bade The clear voic d heralds to th Assembly call The general ral host they gave the word and straight From ev ry quarter throng d the eager crowd But first of all the Elders by the side Of Nestor s ship the aged Pylian chief A secret conclave Agamemnon call d And prudent thus the chosen few address d Hear me my friends In the still hours of night I saw a heav nly Vision in my sleep Most like it seemed in stature form and face To reverend rend Nestor at my head it stood And with these words address d me Sleep saint thou son Of Atreus valiant warrior horseman bold To sleep all night but ill becomes a chief Charg d with the public weal and cares of state Hear now the words I bear to thee I come A messenger from Jove who from on high Looks down on thee with eyes of pitying love He bids thee arm in haste the long hair d Greeks To combat since the wide built streets of Troy Thou now may saint capture for th immortal Gods Watch over her no longer all are gain d By Juno s pray rs and woes impend o er Troy Bear thou my words in mind Thus as he spoke He vanish d and sweet sleep forsook mine eyes Seek we then straight to arm the sons of Greece But first as is our wont myself will prove The spirit of the army and suggest Their homeward voyage ye throughout the camp Restore their courage and restrain from flight Thus having said he sat and next arose Nestor the chief of Pylos sandy shore Who thus with prudent speech replied and said O friends the chiefs and councillors of Greece If any other had this Vision seen We should have deem d it false and laugh d to scorn The idle tale but now it hath appear d Of all our army to the foremost man Seek we then straight to arm the sons of Greece He said and from the council led the way Uprose the sceptred monarchs and obey d Their leader s call and round them throng d the crowd As swarms of bees that pour in ceaseless stream From out the crevice of some hollow rock Now clust ring and anon mid vernal flow rs Some here some there in busy numbers fly So to th Assembly from their tents and ships The countless tribes came thronging in their midst By Jove enkindled Rumour urged them on Great was the din and as the mighty mass Sat down the solid earth beneath them groan d Nine heralds rais d their voices loud to quell The storm of tongues and bade the noisy crowd Be still and listen to the Heav n born Kings At length they all were seated and awhile Their clamours sank to silence then uprose The monarch Agamemnon in his hand His royal staff the work of Vulcan s art Which Vulcan to the son of Saturn gave To Hermes he the heav nly messenger Hermes to Pelops matchless charioteer Pelops to Atreus Atreus at his death Bequeath d it to Thyestes wealthy Lord Of num rous herds to Agamemnon last Thyestes left it token of his sway O er all the Argive coast and neighbouring isles On this the monarch leant as thus he spoke Friends Grecian Heroes Ministers of Mars Grievous and all unlook d for is the blow Which Jove hath dealt me by his promise led I hop d to raze the strong built walls of Troy And home return in safety but it seems He falsifies his word and bids me now Return to Argos frustrate of my hope Dishonour d and with grievous loss of men Such now appears th o er ruling sov reign will Of Saturn s son who oft hath sunk the heads Of many a lofty city in the dust And yet will sink for mighty is his hand Tis shame indeed that future days should hear How such a force as ours so great so brave Hath thus been baffled fighting as we do Gainst numbers far inferior to our own And see no end of all our warlike toil For should we choose on terms of plighted truce Trojans and Greeks to number our array Of Trojans all that dwell within the town And we by tens disposed to every ten To crown our cups one Trojan should assign Full many a ten no cupbearer would find So far the sons of Greece outnumber all That dwell within the town but to their aid Bold warriors come from all the cities round Who greatly harass me and render vain My hope to storm the strong built walls of Troy Already now nine weary years have pass d The timbers of our ships are all decay d The cordage rotted in our homes the while Our wives and helpless children sit in vain Expecting our return and still the work For which we hither came remains undone Hear then my counsel let us all agree Home to direct our course since here in vain We strive to take the well built walls of Troy Thus as he spoke the crowd that had not heard The secret council by his words was mov d So sway d and heav d the multitude as when O er the vast billows of th Icarian sea Eurus and Notus from the clouds of Heav n Pour forth their fury or as some deep field Of wavy corn when sweeping o er the plain The ruffling west wind sways the bending ears So was th Assembly stirr d and tow rd the ships With clam rous joy they rush d beneath their feet Rose clouds of dust while one to other call d To seize the ships and drag them to the main They clear d the channels and with shouts of home That rose to Heav n they knock d the shores away Then had the Greeks in shameful flight withdrawn Had Juno not to Pallas thus appeal d Oh Heav n brave child of aegis bearing Jove Shall thus the Greeks in ignominious flight O er the wide sea their homeward course pursue And as a trophy to the sons of Troy The Argive Helen leave on whose account Far from their home so many valiant Greeks Have cast their lives away Go quickly thou Amid the brass clad Greeks and man by man Address with words persuasive nor permit To launch their well trimm d vessels on the deep She said nor did Minerva not obey But swift descending from Olympus heights With rapid flight she reach d the Grecian ships Laertes son in council sage as Jove There found she standing he no hand had laid On his dark vessel for with bitter grief His heart was filled the blue ey d Maid approach d And thus address d him Great Laertes son Ulysses sage in council can it be That you the men of Greece embarking thus On your swift ships in ignominious flight O er the wide sea will take your homeward way And as a trophy to the sons of Troy The Argive Helen leave on whose account Far from their homes so many valiant Greeks Have cast their lives away Go quickly thou Among the multitude and man by man Address with words persuasive nor permit To launch their well trimm d vessels on the deep She said the heav nly voice Ulysses knew Straight springing to the course he cast aside And to Eurybates of Ithaca His herald and attendant threw his robe Then to Atrides hasten d and by him Arm d with his royal staff ancestral pass d With rapid step amid the ships of Greece Each King or leader whom he found he thus With cheering words encourag d and restrain d O gallant friend tis not for thee to yield Like meaner men to panic but thyself Sit quiet and the common herd restrain Thou know saint not yet Atrides secret mind He tries us now and may reprove us soon His words in council reach d not all our ears See that he work us not some ill for fierce His anger and the Lord of counsel Jove From whom proceeds all honour loves him well But of the common herd whome er he found Clam ring he check d with staff and threat ning words Good friend keep still and hear what others say Thy betters far for thou art good for nought Of small account in council or in fight All are not sovereigns here ill fares the state Where many masters rule let one be Lord One King supreme to whom wise Saturn s son In token of his sov reign power hath giv n The sceptre s sway and ministry of law Such were his words as through the ranks he pass d They from the vessels and the tents again Throng d to th Assembly with such rush of sound As when the many dashing ocean s wave Breaks on the shore and foams the frothing sea The others all were settled in their seats Only Thersites with unmeasur d words Of which he had good store to rate the chiefs Not over seemly but wherewith he thought To move the crowd to laughter brawl d aloud The ugliest man was he who came to Troy With squinting eyes and one distorted foot His shoulders round and buried in his breast His narrow head with scanty growth of hair Against Achilles and Ulysses most His hate was turn d on them his venom pour d Anon at Agamemnon s self he launch d His loud tongued ribaldry gainst him he knew Incensed the public mind and bawling loud one With scurril words he thus address d the King What more thou son of Atreus would saint thou have Thy tents are full of brass and in those tents Many fair women whom from all the spoil We Greeks whene er some wealthy town we take Choose first of all and set apart for thee Or dost thou thirst for gold which here perchance Some Trojan brings the ransom of his son Captur d by me or by some other Greek Or some new girl to gratify thy lust Kept for thyself apart a leader thou Shouldst not to evil lead the sons of Greece Ye slaves ye coward souls Women of Greece I will not call you men why go we not Home with our ships and leave this mighty chief To gloat upon his treasures and find out Whether in truth he need our aid or no Who on Achilles his superior far Foul scorn hath cast and robb d him of his prize Which for himself he keeps Achilles sure Is not intemperate but mild of mood Else Atreus son this insult were thy last On Agamemnon leader of the host With words like these Thersites pour d his hate But straight Ulysses at his side appear d And spoke with scornful glance in stern rebuke Thou babbling fool Thersites prompt of speech Restrain thy tongue nor singly thus presume The Kings to slander thou the meanest far Of all that with the Atridae came to Troy Ill it beseems that such an one as thou Should lift thy voice against the Kings and rail With scurril ribaldry and prate of home How these affairs may end we know not yet Nor how or well or ill we may return Cease then against Atrides King of men To pour thy spite for that the valiant Greeks To him despite thy railing as of right An ample portion of the spoils assign But this I tell thee and will make it good If e er I find thee play the fool as now Then may these shoulders cease this head to bear And may my son Telemachus no more Own me his father if I strip not off Thy mantle and thy garments aye expose Thy nakedness and flog thee to the ships Howling and scourg d with ignominious stripes Thus as he spoke upon Thersites neck And back came down his heavy staff the wretch Shrank from the blow and scalding tears let fall Where struck the golden studded staff appear d A bloody weal Thersites quail d and down Quiv ring with pain he sat and wip d away With horrible grimace the trickling tears The Greeks despite their anger laugh d aloud And one to other said Good faith of all The many works Ulysses well hath done Wise in the council foremost in the fight He ne er hath done a better than when now He makes this scurril babbler hold his peace Methinks his headstrong spirit will not soon Lead him again to vilify the Kings Thus spoke the general ral voice but staff in hand Ulysses rose Minerva by his side In likeness of a herald bade the crowd Keep silence that the Greeks from first to last Might hear his words and ponder his advice He thus with prudent phrase his speech began Great son of Atreus on thy name O King Throughout the world will foul reproach be cast If Greeks forget their promise nor make good The vow they took to thee when hitherward We sailed from Argos grassy plains to raze Ere our return the well built walls of Troy But now like helpless widows or like babes They mourn their cruel fate and pine for home Tis hard indeed defeated to return The seaman murmurs if from wife and home Ev n for one month his well found bark be stay d Toss d by the wint ry blasts and stormy sea But us the ninth revolving year beholds Still ling ring here I cannot therefore blame Our valiant Greeks if by the ships I hear Their murmurs yet twere surely worst of all Long to remain and bootless to return Bear up my friends remain awhile and see If Calchas truly prophesy or no For this ye all have seen and can yourselves Bear witness all who yet are spar d by fate Not long ago when ships of Greece were met At Aulis charg d with evil freight for Troy And we around a fountain to the Gods Our altars rear d with faultless hecatombs Near a fair plane tree where bright water flow d Behold a wonder by Olympian Jove Sent forth to light a snake with burnish d scales Of aspect fearful issuing from beneath The altars glided to the plane tree straight There on the topmost bough beneath the leaves Cow ring a sparrow s callow nestlings lay Eight fledglings and the parent bird the ninth All the eight nestlings utt ring piercing cries The snake devour d and as the mother flew Lamenting o er her offspring round and round Uncoiling caught her shrieking by the wing Then when the sparrow s nestlings and herself The snake had swallowed by the God who first Sent him to light a miracle was wrought For Jove the deep designing Saturn s son Turn d him to stone we stood and wond ring gaz d But when this prodigy befell our rites Calchas inspir d of Heaven took up his speech Ye long haired sons of Greece why stand ye thus In mute amaze to us Olympian Jove To whom be endless praise vouchsafes this sign Late sent of late fulfilment as ye saw The snake devour the sparrow and her young Eight nestlings and the parent bird the ninth So for so many years are we condemn d To wage a fruitless war but in the tenth The wide built city shall at last be ours Thus he foretold and now the time is come Here then ye well greav d Greeks let all remain Till Priam s wealthy city be our own He said and loudly cheer d the Greeks and loud From all the hollow ships came back the cheers In admiration of Ulysses speech Gerenian Nestor next took up the word Like children Grecian warriors ye debate Like babes to whom unknown are feats of arms Where then are now our solemn covenants Our plighted oaths Go cast we to the fire Our councils held our warriors plans matur d Our absolute pledges and our hand plight giv n In which our trust was placed since thus in vain In words we wrangle and how long soe er We here remain solution none we find Atrides thou as is thy wont maintain Unchang d thy counsel for the stubborn fight Array the Greeks and let perdition seize Those few those two or three among the host Who hold their separate counsel not on them Depends the issue rather than return To Argos ere we prove if Jove indeed Will falsify his promis d word or no For well I ween that on the day when first We Grecians hitherward our course address d To Troy the messengers of blood and death Th o er ruling son of Saturn on our right His lightning flashing with auspicious sign Assur d us of his favour let not then The thoughts of home be breath d ere Trojan wives Given to our warriors retribution pay For wrongs by us in Helen s cause sustain d But whoso longs if such an one there be To make his homeward voyage let him take His well rigg d bark and go before the rest To meet the doom of death But thou O King Be well advis d thyself and others lead By wholesome counsel for the words I speak Are not to be despis d by tribes and clans O Agamemnon range thy troops that so Tribe may to tribe give aid and clan to clan If thus thou do and Greeks thy words obey Then shalt thou see of chiefs and troops alike The good and bad for on their own behoof They all shall fight and if thou fail shalt know Whether thy failure be of Heav n s decree Or man s default and ignorance of war To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus Father in council of the sons of Greece None can compare with thee and would to Jove To Pallas and Apollo at my side I had but ten such counsellors as thee Then soon should royal Priam s city fall Tak n and destroy d by our victorious hands But now on me hath aegis bearing Jove The son of Saturn fruitless toil impos d And hurtful quarrels for in wordy war About a girl Achilles and myself Engag d and I alas the strife began Could we be friends again delay were none How short soe er of Ilium s final doom But now to breakfast ere we wage the fight Each sharpen well his spear his shield prepare Each to his fiery steeds their forage give Each look his chariot o er that through the day We may unwearied stem the tide of war For respite none how short soe er shall be Till night shall bid the storm of battle cease With sweat shall reek upon each warrior s breast The leathern belt beneath the cov ring shield And hands shall ache that wield the pond rous spear With sweat shall reek the fiery steeds that draw Each warrior s car but whomsoe er I find Loit ring beside the beaked ships for him Twere hard to scape the vultures and the dogs He said and from th applauding ranks of Greece Rose a loud sound as when the ocean wave Driv n by the south wind on some lofty beach Dashes against a prominent crag expos d To blasts from every storm that roars around Uprising then and through the camp dispers d They took their sev ral ways and by their tents The fires they lighted and the meal prepar d And each to some one of the Immortal Gods His off ring made that in the coming fight He might escape the bitter doom of death But to the o erruling son of Saturn Jove A sturdy ox well fatten d five years old Atrides slew and to the banquet call d The aged chiefs and councillors of Greece Nestor the first the King Idomeneus The two Ajaces next and Tydeus son Ulysses sixth as Jove in council sage But uninvited Menelaus came Knowing what cares upon his brother press d Around the ox they stood and on his head The salt cake sprinkled then amid them all The monarch Agamemnon pray d aloud Most great most glorious Jove who dwell saint on high In clouds and darkness veil d grant Thou that ere This sun shall set and night o erspread the earth I may the haughty walls of Priam s house Lay prostrate in the dust and burn with fire His lofty gates and strip from Hector s breast His sword rent tunic while around his corpse Many brave comrades prostrate bite the dust Thus he but Saturn s son his pray r denied Receiv d his off rings but his toils increas d Their pray rs concluded and the salt cake strewed Upon the victim s head they drew him back And slew and flay d then cutting from the thighs The choicest pieces and in double layers O erspreading them with fat above them plac d The due meat off rings these they burnt with logs Of leafless timber and the inward parts First to be tasted o er the fire they held The thighs consum d with fire the inward parts They tasted first the rest upon the spits Roasted with care and from the fire withdrew Their labours ended and the feast prepar d They shared the social meal nor lacked there aught The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied Gerenian Nestor thus his speech began Most mighty Agamemnon King of men Great Atreus son no longer let us pause The work delaying which the pow rs of Heav n Have trusted to our hands do thou forthwith Bid that the heralds proclamation make And summon through the camp the brass clad Greeks While in a body through the wide spread ranks We pass and stimulate their warlike zeal He said and Agamemnon King of men Obedient to his counsel gave command That to the war the clear voic d heralds call The long hair d Greeks they gave the word

That round the cattle sheds in spring tide pour While the warm milk is frothing in the pail So numberless upon the plain array d For Troy s destruction stood the long hair d Greeks And as experienced

eddying stream ARGUMENT THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS The armies being ready to engage a single combat is agreed upon between Menelaus and Paris by the intervention of Hector for the determination of the war Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the fight She leads her to the walls of Troy where Priam sat with his counsellors observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below to whom Helen gives an account of the chief of them The kings on either part take the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat The duel ensues wherein Paris being overcome is snatched away in a cloud by Venus and transported to his apartment She then calls Helen from the walls and brings the lovers together Agamemnon on the part of the Grecians demands the restoration of Helen and the performance of the articles The three and twentieth day still continues throughout this book The scene is sometimes in the field before Troy and sometimes in Troy itself BOOK III WHEN by their sev ral chiefs the troops were rang d With noise and clamour as a flight of birds The men of Troy advanc d as when the cranes Flying the wintry storms send forth on high Their dissonant clamours while o er the ocean stream They steer their course and on their pinions bear Battle and death to the Pygmaean race On th other side the Greeks in silence mov d Breathing firm courage bent on mutual aid As when the south wind o er the mountain tops Spreads a thick veil of mist the shepherd s bane And friendly to the nightly thief alone That a stone s throw the range of vision bounds So rose the dust cloud as in serried ranks With rapid step they mov d across the plain But when th opposing forces near were met A panther s skin across his shoulders flung Arm d with his bow and sword in front of all Advanc d the godlike Paris in his hand He pois d two brass tipp d jav lins and defied To mortal combat all the chiefs of Greece Him when the warlike Menelaus saw With haughty strides advancing from the crowd As when a lion hunger pinch d espies Some mighty beast of chase or antler d stag Or mountain goat and with exulting spring Strikes down his prey and on the carcase feeds Unscar d by baying hounds and eager youths So Menelaus saw with fierce delight The godlike Paris for he deem d that now His vengeance was at hand and from his car Arm d as he was he leap d upon the plain But when the godlike Paris saw him spring Defiant from the ranks with quailing heart Back to his comrades shelt ring crowd he sprang In fear of death as when some trav ller spies Coil d in his path upon the mountain side A deadly snake back he recoils in haste His limbs all trembling and his cheek all pale So back recoil d in fear of Atreus son The godlike Paris mid the Trojan host To whom in stern rebuke thus Hector spoke Thou wretched Paris though in form so fair Thou slave of woman manhood s counterfeit Would thou hadst ne er been born or died at least Unwedded so twere better far for all Than thus to live a scandal and reproach Well may the long hair d Greeks triumphant boast Who think thee from thine outward show a chief Among our warriors but thou hast in truth Nor strength of mind nor courage in the fight How was t that such as thou could e er induce A noble band in ocean going ships To cross the main with men of other lands Mixing in amity and bearing thence A woman fair of face by marriage ties Bound to a race of warriors to thy sire Thy state thy people cause of endless grief Of triumph to thy foes contempt to thee Durst thou the warlike Menelaus meet Thou to thy cost shouldst learn the might of him Whose bride thou didst not fear to bear away Then shouldst thou find of small avail thy lyre Or Venus gifts of beauty and of grace Or trampled in the dust thy flowing hair But too forbearing are the men of Troy Else for the ills that thou hast wrought the state Ere now thy body had in stone been cas d To whom the godlike Paris thus replied Hector I needs must own thy censure just Nor without cause thy dauntless courage knows Nor pause nor weariness but as an axe That in a strong man s hand who fashions out Some naval timber with unbated edge Cleaves the firm wood and aids the striker s force Ev n so unwearied is thy warlike soul Yet blame not me for golden Venus gifts The gifts of Heav n are not to be despis d Which Heav n may give but man could not command But if thou wilt that I should dare the fight Bid that the Trojans and the Grecians all Be seated on the ground and in the midst The warlike Menelaus and myself Stand front to front for Helen and the spoils Of war to combat and whoe er shall prove The better man in conflict let him bear The woman and the spoils in triumph home While ye the rest in peace and friendship sworn Shall still possess the fertile plains of Troy And to their native Argos they return For noble steeds and lovely women fam d He said and Hector joy d to hear his words Forth in the midst he stepp d and with his spear Grasp d by the middle stay d the Trojan ranks At him the long haired Grecians bent their bows Prompt to assail with arrows and with stones But loud the monarch Agamemnon s voice Was heard Hold Argives hold ye sons of Greece Shoot not for Hector of the glancing helm Hath as it seems some message to impart He said they held their hands and silent stood Expectant till to both thus Hector spoke Hear now ye Trojans and ye well greav d Greeks The words of Paris cause of all this war He asks through me that all the host of Troy And Grecian warriors shall upon the ground Lay down their glitt ring arms while in the midst The warlike Menelaus and himself Stand front to front for Helen and the spoils Of war to combat and whoe er shall prove The better man in conflict let him bear The woman and the spoils in triumph home While we the rest firm peace and friendship swear Thus Hector spoke the rest in silence heard But Menelaus bold in fight replied Hear now my answer in this quarrel I May claim the chiefest share and now I hope Trojans and Greeks may see the final close Of all the labours ye so long have borne T avenge my wrong at Paris hand sustain d And of us two whiche er is doom d to death So let him die the rest depart in peace Bring then two lambs one white the other black For Tellus and for Sol we on our part Will bring another for Saturnian Jove And let the majesty of Priam too Appear himself to consecrate our oaths For reckless are his sons and void of faith That none Jove s oath may dare to violate For young men s spirits are too quickly stirr d But in the councils check d by reverend rend age Alike are weigh d the future and the past And for all int rests due provision made He said and Greeks and Trojans gladly heard In hopes of respite from the weary war They rang d the cars in ranks and they themselves Descending doff d their arms and laid them down Close each by each with narrow space between Two heralds to the city Hector sent To bring the lambs and aged Priam call While Agamemnon to the hollow ships Their lamb to bring in haste Talthybius sent He heard and straight the monarch s voice obey d Meantime to white arm d Helen Iris sped The heav nly messenger in form she seem d Her husband s sister whom Antenor s son The valiant Helicaon had to wife Laodice of Priam s daughters all Loveliest of face she in her chamber found Her whom she sought a mighty web she wove Of double woof and brilliant hues whereon Was interwoven many a toilsome strife Of Trojan warriors and of brass clad Greeks For her encounter d at the hand of Mars Beside her Iris stood and thus she spoke Come sister dear and see the glorious deeds Of Trojan warriors and of brass clad Greeks They who erewhile impatient for the fight Roll d o er the plain the woful tide of war Now silent sit the storm of battle hush d Reclining on their shields their lances bright Beside them reared while Paris in the midst And warlike Menelaus stand prepar d With the long spear for thee to fight thyself The prize of conquest and the victor s wife Thus as she spoke in Helen s breast arose Fond recollection of her former Lord Her home and parents o er her head she threw A snowy veil and shedding tender tears She issu d forth not unaccompanied For with her went fair AEthra Pittheus child And stag ey d Clymene her maidens twain They quickly at the Scaean gate arriv d Attending there on aged Priam sat The Elders of the city Panthous And Lampus and Thymaetes Clytius Bold Icetaon and Ucalegon With sage Antenor wise in council both All these were gather d at the Scaean gate By age exempt from war but in discourse Abundant as the cricket that on high From topmost boughs of forest tree sends forth His delicate music so on Ilium s tow rs Sat the sage chiefs and councillors of Troy Helen they saw as to the tow r she came And tis no marvel one to other said The valiant Trojans and the well greav d Greeks For beauty such as this should long endure The toils of war for goddess like she seems And yet despite her beauty let her go Nor bring on us and on our sons a curse Thus they but aged Priam Helen call d Come here my child and sitting by my side From whence thou canst discern thy former Lord His kindred and thy friends not thee I blame But to the Gods I owe this woful war Tell me the name of yonder mighty chief Among the Greeks a warrior brave and strong Others in height surpass him but my eyes A form so noble never yet beheld Nor so august he moves a King indeed To whom in answer Helen heav nly fair With reverend rence dearest father and with shame I look on thee oh would that I had died That day when hither with thy son I came And left my husband friends and darling child And all the lov d companions of my youth That I died not with grief I pine away But to thy question I will tell thee true Yon chief is Agamemnon Atreus son Wide reigning mighty monarch ruler good And valiant warrior in my husband s name Lost as I am I call d him brother once She spoke th old man admiring gaz d and cried Oh bless d Atrides child of happy fate Favour d of Heav n how many noble Greeks Obey thy rule In vine clad Phrygia once I saw the hosts of Phrygian warriors wheel Their rapid steeds and with them all the bands Of Otreus and of Mygdon godlike King Who lay encamp d beside Sangarius stream I too with them was number d in the day When met them in the field the Amazons The woman warriors but their forces all Reach d not the number of the keen ey d Greeks Ulysses next the old man saw and ask d Tell me again dear child who this may be In stature less than Atreus royal son But broader shoulder d and of ampler chest His arms are laid upon the fertile plain But he himself is moving through the ranks Inspecting like a full fleec d ram that moves Majestic through a flock of snow white ewes To whom Jove s offspring Helen thus replied The wise Ulysses that Laertes son Though bred in rugged Ithaca yet vers d In ev ry stratagem and deep device O woman then the sage Antenor said Of these thy words I can the truth avouch For hither when on thine account to treat Brave Menelaus and Ulysses came I lodg d them in my house and lov d them both And studied well the form and mind of each As they with Trojans mix d in social guise When both were standing o er his comrade high With broad set shoulders Menelaus stood Seated Ulysses was the nobler form Then in the great Assembly when to all Their public speech and argument they fram d In fluent language Menelaus spoke In words though few yet clear though young in years No wordy babbler wasteful of his speech But when the skill d Ulysses rose to speak With down cast visage would he stand his eyes Bent on the ground the staff he bore nor back He wav d nor forward but like one untaught He held it motionless who only saw Would say that he was mad or void of sense But when his chest its deep ton d voice sent forth With words that fell like flakes of wintry snow No mortal with Ulysses could compare Then little reck d we of his outward show At sight of Ajax next th old man enquir d Who is yon other warrior brave and strong Tow ring o er all with head and shoulders broad To whom in answer Helen heav nly fair Gigantic Ajax that the prop of Greece And by his side Idomeneus of Crete Stands godlike circled round by Cretan chiefs The warlike Menelaus welcom d him Oft in our palace when from Crete he came Now all the other keen ey d Greeks I see Whom once I knew and now could call by name But two I miss two captains of the host My own two brethren and my mother s sons Castor and Pollux Castor charioteer Unrivalled Pollux matchless pugilist In Lacedaemon have they stay d behind Or can it be in ocean going ships That they have come indeed but shun to join The fight of warriors fearful of the shame And deep disgrace that on my name attend Thus she but they beneath the teeming earth In Lacedaemon lay their native land Meanwhile the heralds through the city bore The treaty off rings to the Gods the lambs And genial wine the produce of the soil In goat skin flasks therewith a flagon bright And cups of gold Idaeus brought and stood Beside the aged King as thus he spoke Son of Laomedon arise the chiefs Of Trojan warriors and of brass clad Greeks Call for thy presence on the battle plain To swear a truce where Paris in the midst And warlike Menelaus stand prepar d With the long spear for Helen and the spoils Of war to combat that whoe er may prove The better man in fight may bear away The woman and the spoils in triumph home While we the rest in peace and friendship sworn Shall still possess the fertile plains of Troy And to their native Argos they return For noble steeds and lovely women fam d He said the old man shuddered at his words But to his comrades gave command forthwith To yoke his car and they his word obey d Priam ascending gather d up the reins And with Antenor by his side the twain Drove through the Scaean gate their flying steeds But when between th opposing ranks they came Alighting from the car they mov d on foot Between the Trojan and the Grecian hosts Uprose then Agamemnon King of men Uprose the sage Ulysses to the front The heralds brought the off rings to the Gods And in the flagon mix d the wine and pour d The hallowing water on the monarchs hands His dagger then the son of Atreus drew Suspended as was wont beside the hilt Of his great sword and from the victim s head He cut the sacred lock which to the chiefs Of Troy and Greece the heralds portion d out Then with uplifted hands he pray d aloud O Father Jove who rul saint from Ida s height Most great most glorious and thou Sun who see saint And hearest all things Rivers and thou Earth And ye who after death beneath the earth Your vengeance wreak on souls of men forsworn Be witness ye and this our cov nant guard If Menelaus fall by Paris hand Let him retain both Helen and the spoil While in our ships we take our homeward way If Paris be by Menelaus slain Troy shall surrender Helen and the spoil With compensation due to Greece that so A record may to future days remain But Paris slain if Priam and his sons The promis d compensation shall withhold Then here my rights in battle to assert Will I remain till I the end achieve Thus as he spoke across the victims throats He drew the pitiless blade and on the ground He laid them gasping as the stream of life Pour d forth their vigour by the blade subdued Then from the flagon drawn from out the cups The wine they pour d and to th eternal Gods They pray d and thus from Trojans and from Greeks Arose the joint petition Grant O Jove Most great most glorious grant ye heav nly pow rs That whosoe er this solemn truce shall break Ev n as this wine we pour their hearts best blood Theirs and their children s on the earth be pour d And strangers in subjection take their wives Thus they but Jove unyielding heard their pray r The rites perform d then aged Priam spoke Hear me ye Trojans and ye well greav d Greeks To Ilium s breezy heights I now withdraw For that mine eyes will not endure the sight Of warlike Menelaus and my son Engag d in deadly combat of the two Which may be doom d to death is only known To Jove and to th immortal pow rs of Heav n Thus spoke the godlike King and on the car He plac d the consecrated lambs himself Ascending then he gather d up the reins And with Antenor by his side the twain To Ilium s walls retrac d their homeward way Then Hector son of Priam measur d out With sage Ulysses join d th allotted space Next in the brass bound helmet cast the lots Which of the two the first should throw the spear The crowd with hands uplifted to the Gods Trojans and Greeks alike address d their pray r O Father Jove who rul saint from Ida s height Most great most glorious grant that whosoe er On both our armies hath this turmoil brought May undergo the doom of death and we The rest firm peace and lasting friendship swear Thus they great Hector of the glancing helm With eyes averted shook the casque and forth Was cast the lot of Paris on the ground The rest lay down by ranks where near to each Were rang d his active steeds and glitt ring arms Then o er his shoulders fair hair d Helen s Lord The godlike Paris donn d his armour bright First on his legs the well wrought greaves he fix d Fasten d with silver clasps his ample chest A breastplate guarded by Lycaon lent His brother but which fitted well his form Around his shoulders slung his sword he bore Brass bladed silver studded then his shield Weighty and strong and on his firm set head A helm he wore well wrought with horsehair plume That nodded fearful o er his brow his hand Grasp d the firm spear familiar to his hold Prepar d alike the adverse warrior stood They from the crowd apart their armour donn

Jove His weapon hurling Menelaus pray d Great King on him who wrought me causeless wrong On Paris grant that retribution due My arm may bring that men in days to come May fear their host to injure and repay With treach rous wile his hospitable cares He said and poising hurl d his weighty spear Full in the midst it struck the buckler round Right through the buckler pass d the sturdy spear And through the gorgeous breastplate and within Cut through the linen vest but Paris back Inclining stoop d and shunn d the doom of death Atrides then his silver studded sword Rearing on high a mighty blow let fall On Paris helm but shiv ring in his hand In countless fragments new the faithless blade Then thus to Jove with eyes uplift to Heav n Atrides made his moan O Father Jove Of all the Gods the most unfriendly thou On Paris head I hop d for all his crimes To wreak my vengeance due but in my grasp My faithless sword is shatter d and my spear Hath bootless left my hand nor reached my foe Then onward rushing by the horsehair plume He seiz d his foeman s helm and wrenching round Dragg d by main force amid the well greav d Greeks The broider d strap that pass d beneath his beard The helmet held the warrior s throat compress d Then had Atrides dragg d him from the field And endless fame acquir d but Venus child Of Jove her fav rite s peril quickly saw And broke the throttling strap of tough bull s hide In the broad hand the empty helm remained The trophy by their champion whirl d amid The well greav d Greeks his eager comrades seiz d While he infuriate rush d with murd rous aim On Priam s son but him the Queen of Love As Gods can only from the field convey d Wrapt in a misty cloud and on a couch Sweet perfumes breathing gently laid him down Then went in search of Helen her she found Circled with Trojan dames on Ilium s tow r Her by her airy robe the Goddess held And in the likeness of an aged dame Who oft for her in Sparta when she dwelt Many a fair fleece had wrought and lov d her well Address d her thus Come Helen to thy house Come Paris calls thee in his chamber he Expects thee resting on luxurious couch In costly garb with manly beauty grac d Not from the fight of warriors wouldst thou deem He late had come but for the dance prepar d Or resting from the dance s pleasing toil She said and Helen s spirit within her mov d And when she saw the Goddess beauteous neck Her lovely bosom and her glowing eyes She gaz d in wonder and address d her thus Oh why great Goddess make me thus thy sport Seek saint thou to bear me far away from hence To some fair Phrygian or Maeonian town If there some mortal have thy favour gain d Or for that Menelaus in the field Hath vanquish d Paris and is willing yet That I his bane should to his home return Here art thou found to weave again thy wiles Go then thyself thy godship abdicate Renounce Olympus lavish here on him Thy pity and thy care he may perchance Make thee his wife at least his paramour But thither go

poor fool lest I in wrath Desert thee quite and as I heretofore Have lov d so make thee object of my hate And kindle twixt the Trojans and the Greeks Such bitter feuds as both shall wreak on thee She said and trembled Helen child of Jove She rose in silence in a snow white veil All glitt ring shrouded by the Goddess led She pass d unnotic d by the Trojan dames But when to Paris splendid house they came Thronging around her her attendants gave Their duteous service through the lofty hall With queenly grace the godlike woman pass d A seat the laughter loving Goddess plac d By Paris side there Helen sat the child Of aegis bearing Jove with downcast eyes Yet with sharp words she thus address d her Lord Back from the battle would thou there hadst died Beneath a warrior s arm whom once I call

I warn thee pause ere madly thou presume With fair hair d Menelaus to contend Soon shouldst thou fall beneath his conqu ring spear To whom thus Paris Wring not thus my soul With keen reproaches now with Pallas aid Hath Menelaus conquer d but my day Will come I too can boast my guardian Gods But turn we now to love and love s delights For never did thy beauty so inflame My sense not when from Lacedaemon first I bore thee in my ocean going ships And revell d in thy love on Cranae s isle As now it fills my soul with fond desire He said and led her to the nuptial couch Her Lord she follow d and while there reclin d Upon the richly inlaid couch they lay Atrides like a lion baffled rush d Amid the crowd if haply he might find The godlike Paris but not one of all The Trojans and their brave allies could aid The warlike Menelaus in his search Not that for love would any one that knew Have screen d him from his anger for they all Abhorr d him as the shade of death then thus Outspoke great Agamemnon King of men Hear me ye Trojans Dardans and Allies With warlike Menelaus rests tis plain The prize of vict ry then surrender ye The Argive Helen and the spoils of war With compensation due to Greece that so A record may to future days remain Thus he the Greeks assenting cheer d his words ARGUMENT THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE AND THE FIRST BATTLE The Gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war they agree upon the continuation of it and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break the truce She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus who is wounded but cured by Machaon In the mean time some of the Trojan troops attack the Greeks Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general he reviews the troops and exhorts the leaders some by praises and others by reproofs Nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline The battle joins and great numbers are slain on both sides The same day continues through this as through the last book as it does also through the two following and almost to the end of the seventh book The scene is wholly in the field before Troy BOOK IV On golden pavement round the board of Jove The Gods were gather d Hebe in the midst Pour d the sweet nectar they in golden cups Each other pledg d as down they look d on Troy Then Jove with cutting words and taunting tone Began the wrath of Juno to provoke Two Goddesses for Menelaus fight Thou Juno Queen of Argos and with thee Minerva shield of warriors but ye two Sitting aloof well pleased it seems look on While laughter loving Venus at the side Of Paris standing still averts his fate And rescues when as now expecting death To warlike Menelaus we decree Of right the vict ry but consult we now What may the issue be if we shall light Again the name of war and discord fierce Or the two sides in peace and friendship join For me if thus your general ral voice incline Let Priam s city stand and Helen back To warlike Menelaus be restor d So spoke the God but seated side by side Juno and Pallas glances interchang d Of ill portent for Troy Pallas indeed Sat silent and though inly wroth with Jove Yet answer d not a word but Juno s breast Could not contain her rage and thus she spoke What words dread son of Saturn dost thou speak How wouldst thou render vain and void of fruit My weary labour and my horses toil To stir the people and on Priam s self And Priam s offspring bring disastrous fate Do as thou wilt yet not with our consent To whom in wrath the Cloud compeller thus Revengeful how have Priam and his sons So deeply injur d thee that thus thou seek saint With unabated anger to pursue Till thou o erthrow the strong built walls of Troy Couldst thou but force the gates and entering in On Priam s mangled flesh and Priam s sons And Trojans all a bloody banquet make Perchance thy fury might at length be stayed But have thy will lest this in future times Twixt me and thee be cause of strife renew d Yet hear my words and ponder what I say If e er in times to come my will should be Some city to destroy inhabited By men beloved of thee seek not to turn My wrath aside but yield as I do now Consenting but with heart that ill consents For of all cities fair beneath the sun And starry Heaven the abode of mortal men None to my soul was dear as sacred Troy And Priam s self and Priam s warrior race For with drink off rings due and fat of lambs My altar still hath at their hands been fed Such honour hath to us been ever paid To whom the stag ey d Juno thus replied Three cities are there dearest to my heart Argos and Sparta and the ample streets Of rich Mycenae work on them thy will Destroy them if thine anger they incur I will not interpose nor hinder thee Mourn them I shall reluctant see their fall But not resist for sovereign is thy will Yet should my labours not be fruitless all For I too am a God my blood is thine Worthy of honour as the eldest born Of deep designing Saturn and thy wife Thine who o er all th Immortals reign saint supreme But yield we each to other I to thee And thou to me the other Gods will all By us be rul d On Pallas then enjoin That to the battle field of Greece and Troy She haste and so contrive that Trojans first May break the treaty and the Greeks assail She said the Sire of Gods and men complied And thus with winged words to Pallas spoke Go to the battle field of Greece and Troy In haste and so contrive that Trojans first May break the treaty and the Greeks assail His words fresh impulse gave to Pallas zeal And from Olympus heights in haste she sped Like to a meteor that of grave portent To warring armies or sea faring men The son of deep designing Saturn sends Bright flashing scatt ring fiery sparks around The blue ey d Goddess darted down to earth And lighted in the midst amazement held The Trojan warriors and the well greav d Greeks And one to other look d and said What means This sign Must fearful battle rage again Or may we hope for gentle peace from Jove Who to mankind dispenses peace and war Such was the converse Greeks and Trojans held Pallas meanwhile amid the Trojan host Clad in the likeness of Antenor s son Laodocus a spearman stout and brave Search d here and there if haply she might find The godlike Pandarus Lycaon s son She found of noble birth and stalwart form Standing encircled by his sturdy band Of bucklered followers from AEsepus stream She stood beside him and address d him thus Wilt thou by me be ruled Lycaon s son For durst thou but at Menelaus shoot Thy winged arrow great would be thy fame And great thy favour with the men of Troy And most of all with Paris at his hand Thou shalt receive rich guerdon when he hears That warlike Menelaus by thy shaft Subdued is laid upon the fun ral pyre Bend then thy bow at Atreus glorious son Vowing to Phoebus Lycia s guardian God The Archer King to pay of firstling lambs An ample hecatomb when home return d In safety to Zeleia s sacred town Thus she and fool he listen d to her words Straight he uncas d his polish d bow his spoil Won from a mountain ibex which himself In ambush lurking through the breast had shot True to his aim as from behind a crag He came in sight prone on the rock he fell With horns of sixteen palms his head was crown d These deftly wrought a skilful workman s hand And polish d smooth and tipp d the ends with gold He bent and resting on the ground his bow Strung it anew his faithful comrades held Their shields before him lest the sons of Greece Should make their onset ere his shaft could reach The warlike Menelaus Atreus son His quiver then withdrawing from its case With care a shaft he chose ne er shot before Well feather d messenger of pangs and death The stinging arrow fitted to the string And vow d to Phoebus Lycia s guardian God The Archer King to pay of firstling lambs An ample hecatomb when home return d In safety to Zeleia s sacred town At once the sinew and the notch he drew The sinew to his breast and to the bow The iron head then when the mighty bow Was to a circle strain d sharp rang the horn And loud the sinew twang d as tow rd the crowd With deadly speed the eager arrow sprang Nor Menelaus was thy safety then Uncar d for of the Gods Jove s daughter first Pallas before thee stood and turn d aside The pointed arrow turn d it so aside As when a mother from her infant s cheek Wrapt in sweet slumbers brushes off a fly Its course she so directed that it struck Just where the golden clasps the belt restrain d And where the breastplate doubled check d its force On the close fitting belt the arrow struck Right through the belt of curious workmanship It drove and through the breastplate richly wrought And through the coat of mail he wore beneath His inmost guard and best defence to check The hostile weapons force yet onward still The arrow drove and graz d the hero s flesh Forth issued from the wound the crimson blood As when some Carian or Maeonian maid With crimson dye the ivory stains designed To be the cheek piece of a warrior s steed By many a valiant horseman coveted As in the house it lies a monarch s boast The horse adorning and the horseman s pride So Menelaus then thy graceful thighs And knees and ancles with thy blood were dy d Great Agamemnon shudder d as he saw The crimson drops out welling from the wound Shudder d the warlike Menelaus self But when not buried in his flesh he saw The barb and sinew back his spirit came Then deeply groaning Agamemnon spoke As Menelaus by the hand he held And with him groan d his comrades Brother dear I wrought thy death when late on compact sworn I sent thee forth alone for Greece to fight Wounded by Trojans who their plighted faith Have trodden under foot but not in vain Are solemn cov nants and the blood of lambs The treaty wine outpoured and hand plight given Wherein men place their trust if not at once Yet soon or late will Jove assert their claim And heavy penalties the perjured pay With their own blood their children s and their wives So in my inmost soul full well I know The day shall come when this imperial Troy And Priam s race and Priam s royal self Shall in one common ruin be o erthrown And Saturn s son himself high throned Jove Who dwells in Heav n shall in their faces flash His aegis dark and dread this treach rous deed Avenging this shall surely come to pass But Menelaus deep will be my grief If thou shouldst perish meeting thus thy fate To thirsty Argos should I then return By foul disgrace o erwhelm d for with thy fall The Greeks will mind them of their native land And as a trophy to the sons of Troy The Argive Helen leave thy bones meanwhile Shall moulder here beneath a foreign soil Thy work undone and with insulting scorn Some vaunting Trojan leaping on the tomb Of noble Menelaus thus shall say On all his foes may Agamemnon so His wrath accomplish who hath hither led Of Greeks a mighty army all in vain And bootless home with empty ships hath gone And valiant Menelaus left behind Thus when men speak gape earth and hide my shame To whom the fair hair d Menelaus thus With cheering words Fear not thyself nor cause The troops to fear the arrow hath not touch d A vital part the sparkling belt hath first Turn d it aside the doublet next beneath And coat of mail the work of arm rer s hands To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus Dear Menelaus may thy words be true The leech shall tend thy wound and spread it o er With healing ointments to assuage the pain He said and to the sacred herald call d Haste thee Talthybius summon with all speed The son of AEsculapius peerless leech Machaon bid him hither haste to see The warlike Menelaus chief of Greeks Who by an arrow from some practis d hand Trojan or Lycian hath receiv d a wound A cause of boast to them to us of grief He said nor did the herald not obey But through the brass clad ranks of Greece he pass d In search of brave Machaon him he found Standing by buckler d warriors bold begirt Who follow d him from Trica s grassy plains He stood beside him and address d him thus Up son of AEsculapius Atreus son The mighty monarch summons thee to see The warlike Menelaus chief of Greeks Who by an arrow from some practis d hand Trojan or Lycian hath receiv d a wound A cause of boast to them to us of grief Thus he and not unmov d Machaon heard They thro the crowd and thro the wide spread host Together took their way but when they came Where fair hair d Menelaus wounded stood Around him in a ring the best of Greece And in the midst the godlike chief himself From the close fitting belt the shaft he drew Breaking the pointed barbs the sparkling belt He loosen d and the doublet underneath And coat of mail the work of arm rer s hand But when the wound appear d in sight where struck The stinging arrow from the clotted blood He cleans d it and applied with skilful hand The herbs of healing power which Chiron erst In friendly guise upon his sire bestowed While round the valiant Menelaus they Were thus engag d advanc d the Trojan hosts They donn d their arms and for the fight prepar d In Agamemnon then no trace was seen Of laggard sloth no shrinking from the fight But full of ardour to the field he rush d He left his horses and brass mounted car The champing horses by Eurymedon The son of Ptolemy Peiraeus son Were held aloof but with repeated charge Still to be near at hand when faint with toil His limbs should fail him marshalling his host Himself on foot the warrior ranks array d With cheering words addressing whom he found With zeal preparing for the battle field Relax not valiant friends your warlike toil For Jove to falsehood ne er will give his aid And they who first regardless of their oaths Have broken truce shall with their flesh themselves The vultures feed while we their city raz d Their wives and helpless children bear away But whom remiss and shrinking from the war He found with keen rebuke lie thus assail d Ye wretched Greeks your country s foul reproach Have ye no sense of shame Why stand ye thus Like timid fawns that in the chase run down Stand all bewildered spiritless and tame So stand ye now nor dare to face the fight What will ye wait the Trojans near approach Where on the beach beside the hoary deep Our goodly ships are drawn and see if Jove Will o er you his protecting hand extend As thus the King the serried ranks review d He came where thronging round their skilful chief Idomeneus the warlike bands of Crete Were arming for the fight Idomeneus Of courage stubborn as the forest boar The foremost ranks array d Meriones The rearmost squadrons had in charge with joy The monarch Agamemnon saw and thus With accents bland Idomeneus address d Idomeneus above all other Greeks In battle and elsewhere I honour thee And in the banquet where the noblest mix The ruddy wine for chiefs alone reserved Though others drink their share yet by thy side Thy cup like mine still new replenished stands To drink at pleasure Up then to the fight And show thyself the warrior that thou art To whom the Cretan King Idomeneus In me Atrides thou shalt ever find As at the first I promis d comrade true But go and stir the other long haired Greeks To speedy battle since the Trojans now The truce have broken and defeat and death Must wait on those who have their oaths forsworn He said and Agamemnon went his way Rejoicing through the crowd he pass d and came Where stood th Ajaces them in act to arm Amid a cloud of infantry he found And as a goat herd from his watch tow r crag Beholds a cloud advancing o er the sea By Zephyr s breath impell d as from afar He gazes black as pitch it sweeps along O er the dark ocean s face and with it brings A hurricane of rain he shudd ring sees And drives his flock beneath the shelt ring cave So thick and dark about th Ajaces stirr d Impatient for the war the stalwart youths Black masses bristling close with spear and shield Well pleas d the monarch Agamemnon saw And thus address d them Valiant chiefs to you The leaders of the brass clad Greeks I give Twere needless and unseemly no commands For well ye understand your troops to rouse To deeds of dauntless courage would to Jove To Pallas and Apollo that such mind As is in you in all

He plac d the car borne warriors in the rear Num rous and brave a cloud of infantry Compactly mass d to stem the tide of war Between the two he plac d th inferior troops That e en against their will they needs must fight The horsemen first he charg d and bade them keep Their horses well in hand nor wildly rush Amid the tumult See he said that none In skill or valour over confident Advance before

walls and fenced towns destroy d Thus he experienc d in the wars of old Well pleas d the monarch Agamemnon saw And thus address d him Would to Heav n old man That as thy spirit such too were thy strength And vigour of thy limbs but now old age The common lot of mortals weighs thee down Would I could see some others in thy place And thou couldst still be numbered with the young To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied Atrides I too fain would see restor d The strength I once possess d what time I slew The godlike Ereuthalion but the Gods On man bestow not all their gifts at once I then was young and now am bow d with age Yet with the chariots can I still go forth And aid with sage advice for such the right And privilege of age to hurl the spear Belongs to younger men who after me Were born who boast their vigour unimpair d He said and Agamemnon went his way Rejoicing to Menestheus next he came The son of Peteus charioteer renown d Him found he circled by th Athenian bands The raisers of the war cry close beside The sage Ulysses stood around him rang d Not unrenown d the Cephalonian troops The sound of battle had not reach d their ears For but of late the Greek and Trojan

King And thou too master of all tricky arts Why ling ring stand ye thus aloof and wait For others coming ye should be the first The hot assault of battle to confront For ye are first my summons to receive Whene er the honour d banquet we prepare And well ye like to eat the sav ry meat And at your will the luscious wine cups drain Now stand ye here and unconcern d would see Ten columns pass before you to the fight To whom with stern regard Ulysses thus What words have pass d the barrier of thy lips Atrides how with want of warlike zeal Canst thou reproach us when the Greeks again The furious war shall waken thou shalt see If that thou care to see amid the ranks Of Troy the father of Telemachus In the fore front thy words are empty wind Atrides saw him chafed and smiling thus Recalled his former words Ulysses sage Laertes high born son not over much I give thee blame or orders for I know Thy mind to gentle counsels is inclin d Thy thoughts are one with mine then come

let us too for the fight prepare He said and from the car leap d down in arms Fierce rang the armour on the warrior s breast That ev n the stoutest heart might quail with fear As by the west wind driv

Recoiling flings in giant curves its head Aloft and tosses high the wild sea spray Column on column so the hosts of Greece Pour d ceaseless to the war to each the chiefs Their orders gave the rest in silence mov d Nor would ye deem that mighty mass endued With power of speech so silently they moved In awe of their great captains far around Flashed the bright armour they were girt withal On th other hand the Trojans as the flocks That in the court yard of some wealthy Lord In countless numbers stand at milking time Incessant bleating as their lambs they hear So rose their mingled clamours through the camp For not one language nor one speech was there But many nations call d from distant lands These Mars inspir d and those the blue ey d Maid And Fear and Flight and Discord unappeas d Of

crowd and woe to mortals wrought When to the midst they came together rush d Bucklers and lances and the furious might Of mail clad warriors bossy shield on shield Clatter d in conflict loud the clamour rose Then rose too mingled shouts and groans of men Slaying and slain the earth ran red with blood As when descending from the mountain s brow Two wintry torrents from their copious source Pour downward to the narrow pass where meet Their mingled waters in some deep ravine Their weight of flood on the far mountain s side The shepherd hears the roar so loud arose The shouts and yells of

his spear Thrust through him by the navel from the wound His bowels gush d and darkness veil d his eyes But he advancing through the breast was struck Above the nipple by th AEtolian chief Thoas and through his lungs the spear was driv n Thoas approach d and from his breast withdrew The sturdy spear and with his sharp edg d sword Across his waistband gave the mortal stroke Yet could not touch his arms for all around The Thracian warriors with their tufted crowns Their long spears held before them him though stout And strong and valiant kept at bay perforce He yielded and thus side by side were laid The two the Thracian and th Epeian chief And round them many a valiant soldier lay Well might the deeds achieved that day deserve His praise who through that bloody field might pass By sword or spear unwounded by the hand Of Pallas guarded from the weapon s flight For many a Trojan many a Greek that day Prone in the dust and side by side were laid ARGUMENT THE ACTS OF DIOMED Diomed assisted by Pallas performs wonders in this day s battle Pandarus wounds him with an arrow but the goddess cures him enables him to discern gods from mortals and prohibits him from contending with any of the former excepting Venus AEneas joins Pandarus to oppose him Pandarus is killed and AEneas in great danger but for the assistance of Venus who as she is removing her son from the fight is wounded on the hand by Diomed Apollo seconds her in his rescue and at length carries off AEneas to Troy where he is healed in the temple of Pergamus Mars rallies the Trojans and assists Hector to make a stand In the mean time AEneas is restored to the field and they overthrow several of the Greeks among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars the latter incites Diomed to go against that god he wounds him and sends him groaning to heaven The first battle continues through this book The scene is the same as in the former BOOK V Such strength and courage then to Diomed The son of Tydeus Pallas gave as rais d Mid all the Greeks the glory of his name Forth from his helm arid shield a fiery light There flash d like autumn s star that brightest shines When newly risen

the Trojan host Astynous and Hypeiron then he slew His people s guardian through the breast of one He drove his spear and with his mighty sword He smote the other on the collar bone The shoulder sev ring from the neck and back Them left he there to lie of Abas then And Polyeidus went in hot pursuit Sons of Eurydamas an aged seer Whose visions stay d them not but both were doom d A prey to valiant Diomed to fall Xanthus and Thoon then the hero slew The sons of Phaenops children of his age He worn with years no other sons begot Heirs of his wealth they two together fell And to their father left a load of grief That from the battle they return d not home And distant kindred all his substance shar d On Chromius and Echemon next he fell Two sons of Priam on one chariot borne And as a lion springs upon a herd And breaks the neck of heifer or of steer Feeding in woodland glade with such a spring These two in vain resisting from their car Tydides hurl d then stripp d their arms and bade His followers lead their horses to the ships Him when AEneas saw amid the ranks Dealing destruction through the fight and throng Of spears he plung d if haply he might find The godlike Pandarus Lycaon

contend nor Lycia boasts Through all her wide spread plains a truer aim Then raise to Jove thy hands and with thy shaft Strike down this chief whoe er he be that thus Is making fearful havoc in our host Relaxing many a warrior s limbs in death If he be not indeed a God incens d Against the Trojans for neglected rites For fearful is the vengeance of a God Whom answer d thus Lycaon s noble son AEneas chief and councillor of Troy Most like in all respects to Tydeus son He seems his shield I know and visor d helm And horses whether he himself be God I cannot tell but if he be indeed The man I think him Tydeus valiant son He fights not thus without the aid of Heav n But by his side his shoulders veiled in cloud Some God attends his steps and turns away The shaft that just hath reach d him for ev n now A shaft I shot which by the breastplate s joint Pierc d his right shoulder through full sure I deem d That shaft had sent him to the shades and yet It slew him not tis sure some angry God Nor horse have I nor car on which to mount But in my sire Lycaon s wealthy house Elev n fair chariots stand all newly built Each with its cover by the side of each Two steeds on rye and barley white are fed And in his well built house when here I came Lycaon aged warrior urg d me oft With horses and with chariots high upborne To lead the Trojans in the stubborn fight I hearken d not twere better if I had Yet fear d I lest my horses wont to feed In plenty unstinted by the soldiers wants Might of their custom d forage be depriv d I left them there and hither came on foot And trusting to my bow vain trust it seems Two chiefs already have I struck the sons Of Tydeus and of Atreus with true aim Drawn blood from both yet but increas d their rage Sad was the hour when down from where it hung I took my bow and hasting to the aid Of godlike Hector hither led my troops But should I e er return and see again My native land my wife my lofty hall Then may a stranger s sword cut off my head If with these hands I shatter not and burn The bow that thus hath fail d me at my need Him answer d thus AEneas chief of Troy Speak thou not thus our fortunes shall not change Till thou and I with chariot and with horse This chief encounter and his prowess prove Then mount my car and see how swift my steeds Hither and thither in pursuit or flight From those of Tros descended scour the plain So if the victory to Diomed The son of Tydeus should by Jove be giv n We yet may safely reach the walls of Troy Take thou the whip and reins while I descend To fight on foot or thou the chief engage And leave to me the conduct of the car Whom answer d thus Lycaon s noble son AEneas of thy horses and thy car Take thou the charge beneath th accustomed hand With more assurance would they draw the car If we from Tydeus son be forced to fly Nor struck with panic and thy voice unheard Refuse to bear us from the battle field So should ourselves be slain and Tydeus son In triumph drive thy horses to the ships But thou thy horses and thy chariot guide While I his onset with my lance receive Thus saying on the car they mounted both And tow rd Tydides urg d their eager steeds Them Sthenelus beheld the noble son Of Capaneus and to Tydides cried Oh son of Tydeus dearest to my soul Two men I see of might invincible Impatient to engage thee Pandarus Well skill d in archery Lycaon s son With him AEneas great Anchises son Who from immortal Venus boasts his birth Then let us timely to the car retreat Lest moving thus amid the foremost ranks Thy daring pay the forfeit of thy life To whom brave Diomed with stern regard Talk not to me of flight I heed thee not It is not in my nature so to fight With skulking artifice and faint retreat My strength is yet unbroken I should shame To mount the car but forward will I go To meet these chiefs encounter for my soul Pallas forbids the touch of fear to know Nor shall their horses speed procure for both A safe return though one escape my arm This too I say and bear my words in mind By Pallas counsel if my hap should be To slay them both leave thou my horses here The reins attaching to the chariot rail And seize and from the Trojans to the ships Drive off the horses in AEneas car From those descended which all seeing Jove On Tros for Ganymede his son bestow d With these may none beneath the sun compare Anchises King of men the breed obtain d

Beside the nostril underneath the eye Crash d thro the teeth and cutting thro the tongue Beneath the angle of the jaw came forth Down from the car he fell and loudly rang His glitt ring arms aside the startled steeds Sprang devious from his limbs the spirit fled Down leap d AEneas spear and shield in hand Against the Greeks to guard the valiant dead And like a lion fearless in his strength Around the corpse he stalk d this way and that His spear and buckler round before him held To all who dar d approach him threat ning death With fearful shouts a rocky fragment then Tydides lifted up a mighty mass Which scarce two men could raise as men are now But he unaided lifted it with ease With this he smote AEneas near the groin Where the thigh bone inserted in the hip Turns in the socket joint the rugged mass The socket crush d and both the tendons broke And tore away the flesh down on his knees Yet resting on his hand the hero fell And o er his eyes the shades of darkness spread Then had AEneas King of men been slain Had not his mother Venus child of Jove Who to Anchises where he fed his flocks The hero bore his peril quickly seen Around her son she threw her snowy arms And with a veil thick folded wrapt him round From hostile spears to guard him lest some Greek Should pierce his breast and rob him of his life She from the battle thus her son removed Nor did the son of Capaneus neglect The strict injunction by Tydides giv n His reins attaching to the chariot rail Far from the battle din he check d and left His own fleet steeds then rushing forward seiz d And from the Trojans

They eat no bread they drink no ruddy wine And bloodless thence and deathless they become The Goddess shriek d aloud and dropp d her son But in his arms Apollo bore him off In a thick cloud envelop d

advancing close he threw His glitt ring spear the son of Selagus It struck Amphius who in Paesus dwelt In land and substance rich by evil fate Impell d to Priam s house he brought his aid Below the

and infant child For whether I may e er again return I know not or if Heav n have so decreed That I this day by Grecian hands should fall Thus saying Hector of the glancing helm Turn d to depart with rapid step he reach d His own well furnished house but found not there His white arm d spouse the fair Andromache She with her infant child and maid the while Was standing bath d in tears in bitter grief On Ilium s topmost tower but when her Lord Found not within the house his peerless wife Upon the threshold pausing thus he spoke Tell me my maidens tell me true which way Your mistress went the fair Andromache Or to my sisters or my brothers wives Or to the temple where the fair hair d dames Of Troy invoke Minerva s awful name To whom the matron of his house replied Hector if truly we must answer thee Not to thy sisters nor thy brothers wives Nor to the temple where the fair hair d dames Of Troy invoke Minerva s awful name But to the height of Ilium s topmost tow r Andromache is gone since tidings came The Trojan force was overmatch d and great The Grecian strength whereat like one distract She hurried to the walls and with her took Borne in the nurse s arms her infant child So

Th Atridae both and Tydeus warlike son Or by the prompting of some Heav n taught seer Or by their own advent rous courage led To whom great Hector of the glancing helm Think not dear wife that by such thoughts as these My heart has ne er been wrung but I should blush To face the men and long rob d dames of Troy If like a coward I could shun the fight Nor could my soul the lessons of my youth So far forget whose boast it still has been In the fore front of battle to be found Charg d with my father s glory and mine own Yet in my inmost soul too well I know The day must come when this our sacred Troy And Priam s race and Priam s royal self Shall in one common ruin be o erthrown But not the thoughts of Troy s impending fate Nor Hecuba s nor royal Priam s woes Nor loss of brethren numerous and brave By hostile hands laid prostrate in the dust So deeply wring my heart as thoughts of thee Thy days of freedom lost and led away A weeping captive by some brass clad Greek Haply in Argos at a

beheld and press d her hand and thus Address d her Dearest wring not thus my heart For till my day of destiny is come No man may take my life and when it comes Nor brave nor coward can escape that day But go thou home and ply thy household cares The loom and distaff and appoint thy maids Their sev ral tasks and leave to men of Troy And chief of all to me the toils of war Great Hector said and rais

at once the sympathetic grief For Hector yet alive his household mourn d Deeming he never would again return Safe from the fight by Grecian hands unharm d Nor linger d Paris in his lofty halls But donn d his armour glitt ring o er with brass And through the city pass d with bounding steps As some proud steed at well fill d manger fed His halter broken neighing scours the plain And revels in the widely flowing stream To bathe his sides then tossing high his head While o er his shoulders streams his ample mane Light borne on active limbs in conscious pride To the wide pastures of the mares he flies So Paris Priam s son from Ilium s height His bright arms flashing like the gorgeous sun Hasten d with boastful mien and rapid step Hector he found as from the spot he turn d Where with his wife he late had converse held Whom thus the godlike Paris first address d Too long good brother art then here detain d Impatient for the fight by my delay Nor have I timely as thou bad saint me come To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm My gallant brother none who thinks aright Can cavil at thy prowess in the field For thou art very valiant but thy will Is weak and sluggish and it grieves my heart When from the Trojans who in thy behalf Such labours undergo I hear thy name Coupled with foul reproach But go we now Henceforth shall all be well if Jove permit That from our shores we drive th invading Greeks And to the ever living Gods of Heav n In peaceful homes our free libations pour ARGUMENT THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector Minerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks Apollo seeing her descend from Olympus joins her near the Scaean gate They agree to put off the general engagement for that day and incite Hector to challenge the Greeks to a single combat Nine of the princes accepting the challenge the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax These heroes after several attacks are parted by the night The Trojans calling a council Antenor proposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks to which Paris will not consent but offers to restore them her riches Priam sends a herald to make this offer and to demand a truce for burning the dead the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon When the funerals are performed the Greeks pursuant to the advice of Nestor erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp flanked with towers and defended by a ditch and palisades Neptune testifies his jealousy at this work but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter Both armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans with thunder and other signs of his wrath The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax the next day the truce is agreed another is taken up in the funeral rites of the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships so that somewhat above three days is employed in this book The scene lies wholly in the field BOOK VII Thus as he spoke from out the city gates The noble Hector pass d and by his side His brother Paris in the breast of both Burnt the fierce ardour of the battle field As when some God a fav ring breeze bestows On seamen tugging at the well worn oar Faint with excess of toil ev n so appear d Those brethren twain to Troy s o erlabour d host Then to their prowess fell by Paris hand Menesthius royal Areithous son Whom to

death And Glaucus leader of the Lycian bands Son of Hippolochus amid the fray Iphinous son of Dexias borne on high By two fleet mares upon a lofty car Pierc d through the shoulder from the car he fell Prone to the earth his limbs relax d in death But them when Pallas saw amid the fray Dealing destruction on the hosts of Greece From high Olympus to the walls of Troy She came in haste Apollo there she found As down he look d from Ilium s topmost tow r Devising vict ry to the arms of Troy Beside the oak they met Apollo first The son of Jove the colloquy began Daughter of Jove from great Olympus heights Why com saint thou here by angry passion led Wouldst thou the vict ry swaying here and there Give to the Greeks since pitiless thou see saint The Trojans slaughter d Be advis d by me For so twere better cause we for today The rage of battle and of war to cease To morrow morn shall see the fight renew d Until the close of Ilium s destiny For so ye Goddesses have wrought your will That this fair city should in ruin fall To whom the blue ey d Goddess thus replied So be it Archer King with like intent I from Olympus came but say what means Wilt thou devise to bid the conflict cease To whom Apollo royal son of Jove The might of valiant Hector let us move To challenge to the combat man to man Some Grecian warrior while the brass clad Greeks Their champion urge the challenge to accept And godlike Hector meet in single fight He said nor did Minerva not assent But Helenus the son of Priam knew The secret counsel by the Gods devis d And drawing near to Hector thus he spoke Hector thou son of Priam sage as Jove In council hearken to a brother s words Bid that the Greeks and Trojans all sit down And thou defy the boldest of the Greeks With thee in single combat to contend By revelation from th eternal Gods I know that here thou shalt not meet thy fate He said and Hector joy d to hear his words Forth in the midst he stepp d and with his spear Grasp d in the middle stay d the Trojan ranks With one accord they sat on th other side Atrides bade the well greav d Greeks sit down While in the likeness of two vultures sat On the tall oak of aegis bearing Jove Pallas and Phoebus of the silver bow With heroes deeds delighted dense around Bristled the ranks with shield and helm and spear As when the west wind freshly blows and brings A dark ning ripple o er the ocean waves E en so appear d upon the plain the ranks Of Greeks and Trojans standing in the midst Thus to both armies noble Hector spoke Hear all ye Trojans and ye well greav d Greeks The words I speak the promptings of my soul It hath not pleas d high thron d Saturnian Jove To ratify our truce who both afflicts With labours hard till either ye shall take Our well fenc d city or yourselves to us Succumb beside your ocean going ships Here have ye all the chiefest men of Greece Of all let him who dares with me to fight Stand forth and godlike Hector s might confront And this I say and call to witness Jove If with the sharp edg d spear he vanquish me He shall strip off and to the hollow ships In triumph bear my armour but my corpse Restore that so the men and wives of Troy May deck with honours due my funeral pyre But by Apollo s grace should I prevail I will his arms strip off and bear to Troy And in Apollo s temple hang on high But to the ships his corpse I will restore That so the long hair d Greeks with solemn rites May bury him and to his mem ry raise By the broad Hellespont a lofty tomb And men in days to come shall say who urge Their full oar d bark across the dark blue sea Lo there a warrior s tomb of days gone by A mighty chief whom glorious Hector slew Thus shall they say and thus my fame shall live Thus Hector spoke they all in silence heard Sham d to refuse but fearful to accept At length in anger Menelaus rose Groaning in spirit and with bitter words Reproach d them Shame ye braggart cowards shame Women of Greece I cannot call you men Twere foul disgrace indeed and scorn on scorn If Hector s challenge none of all the Greeks Should dare accept to dust and water turn All ye who here inglorious heartless sit I will myself confront him for success Th immortal Gods above the issues hold Thus as he spoke he donn d his dazzling arms Then Menelaus had thine end approach d By Hector s hands so much the stronger he Had not the Kings withheld thee and restrain d Great Agamemnon s self wide ruling King Seizing his hand address d him thus by name What Heav n born Menelaus art thou mad Beseems thee not such folly curb thy wrath Though vex d nor think with Hector to contend Thy better far inspiring dread in all From his encounter in the glorious fight Superior far to thee Achilles shrinks But thou amid thy comrades ranks retire Some other champion will the Greeks provide And fearless as he is and of the fight Insatiate yet will Hector should he scape Unwounded from the deadly battle strife Be fain methinks to rest his weary limbs He said and with judicious counsel sway d His brother s mind he yielded to his words And gladly his attendants doff d his arms Then Nestor rose and thus address d the Greeks Alas alas what shame is this for Greece What grief would fill the aged Peleus soul Sage chief in council of the Myrmidons Leader approv d who often in his house Would question me and lov d from me to hear Of all the Greeks the race and pedigree Could

Would that my youth and strength were now the same Then soon should Hector of the glancing helm A willing champion find but ye of Greece The foremost men with Hector fear to fight The old man spoke

Then thus again Gerenian Nestor spoke Shake then the lots on whomsoe er it fall Great profit shall he bring to Grecian arms Great glory to himself if he escape Unwounded from the deadly battle strife He said each mark d his sev ral lot and all Together threw in Agamemnon s helm The crowd with hands uplifted pray d the Gods And looking heav nward said Grant Father Jove The lot on Ajax or on Tydeus son Or on Mycenae s wealthy King may fall Thus they then aged Nestor shook the helm And forth according to their wish was thrown The lot of Ajax then from left to right A herald show d to all the chiefs of Greece In turn the token they who knew it not Disclaim d it all but when to him he came Who mark d and threw it in Atrides helm The noble Ajax and approaching placed The token in his outstretch d hand forthwith He knew it and rejoic d before his feet He threw it down upon the ground and said O friends the lot is mine great is my joy And hope o er godlike Hector to prevail But now while I my warlike armour don Pray ye to Saturn s royal son apart In silence that the Trojans hear ye not Or ev n aloud for nought have we to fear No man against my will can make me fly By greater force or skill nor will I hope My inexperience in the field disgrace The teaching of my native Salamis Thus he and they to Saturn s royal son Address d their pray rs and looking heav nward said O Father Jove who rul saint on Ida s height Most great most glorious grant that Ajax now May gain the vict ry and immortal praise Or if thy love and pity Hector claim Give equal pow r and equal praise to both Ajax meanwhile in dazzling brass was clad And when his armour all was duly donn d Forward he mov d as when gigantic Mars Leads nations forth to war whom Saturn s son In life destroying conflict hath involv d So mov d the giant Ajax prop of Greece With sternly smiling mien with haughty stride He trod the plain and pois d his pond rous spear The Greeks rejoicing on their champion gaz d The Trojans limbs beneath them shook with fear Ev n Hector s heart beat quicker in his breast Yet quail he must not now nor back retreat Amid his comrades he the challenger Ajax approach d before him as a tow r His mighty shield he bore sev n fold brass bound The work of Tychius best artificer That wrought in leather he in Hyla dwelt Of sev n fold hides the pond rous shield was wrought Of lusty bulls the eighth was glitt ring brass This by the son of Telamon was borne Before his breast to Hector close he came And thus with words of haughty menace spoke Hector I now shall teach thee man to man The mettle of the chiefs we yet possess Although Achilles of the lion heart Mighty in battle be not with us still He by his ocean going ships indeed Against Atrides nurses still his wrath Yet are there those who dare encounter thee And not a few then now begin the fight To whom great Hector of the glancing helm Ajax brave leader son of Telamon Deal not with me as with a feeble child Or woman ign rant of the ways of war Of war and carnage every point I know And well I know to wield now right now left The tough bull s hide that forms my stubborn targe Well know I too my fiery steeds to urge And raise the war cry in the standing fight But not in secret ambush would I watch To strike by stealth a noble foe like thee But slay thee if I may in open fight He said and poising hurl d his pond rous spear The brazen cov ring of the shield it struck The outward fold the eighth above the sev n Of tough bull s hide through six it drove its way With stubborn force but in the seventh was stay d Then Ajax hurl d in turn his pond rous spear And struck the circle true of Hector s shield Right thro the glitt ring shield the stout spear pass d And thro the well wrought breastplate drove its way And underneath the linen vest it tore But Hector stooping shunn d the stroke of death Withdrawing then their weapons each on each They fell like lions fierce or tusked boars In strength the mightiest of the forest beasts Then Hector fairly on the centre struck The stubborn shield yet drove not through the spear For the stout brass the blunted point repell d But Ajax with a forward bound the shield Of Hector pierc d right through the weapon pass d Arrested with rude shock the warrior s course And graz d his neck that spouted forth the blood Yet did not Hector of the glancing helm Flinch from the contest stooping to the ground With his broad hand a pond rous stone he seiz d That lay upon the plain dark jagg d and huge And hurl d against the sev n fold shield and struck Full on the central boss loud rang the brass Then Ajax rais d a weightier mass of rock And sent it whirling giving to his arm Unmeasur d impulse with a millstone s weight It crush d the buckler Hector s knees gave way Backward he stagger d yet upon his shield Sustain d till Phoebus rais d him to his feet Now had they hand to hand with swords engag d Had not the messengers of Gods and men The heralds interpos d the one for Troy The other umpire for the brass clad Greeks Talthybius and Idaeus well approv d Between the chiefs they held their wands and thus Idaeus both with prudent speech address d No more brave youths no longer wage the fight To cloud compelling Jove ye both are dear Both valiant spearmen that we all have seen Night is at hand behoves us yield to night Whom answer d thus the son of Telamon Idaeus bid that Hector speak those words He challeng d all our chiefs let him begin If he be willing I shall not refuse To whom great Hector of the glancing helm Ajax since God hath giv n thee size and strength And skill and with the spear of all the Greeks None is thine equal cease we for to day The fight hereafter we may meet and Heav n Decide our cause and one with vict ry crown Night is at hand behoves us yield to night So by the ships shalt thou rejoice the Greeks And most of all thy comrades and thy friends And so shall I in Priam s royal town Rejoice the men of Troy and long rob d dames Who shall with grateful pray rs the temples throng But make we now an interchange of gifts That both the Trojans and the Greeks may say On mortal quarrel did those warriors meet Yet parted thence in friendly bonds conjoin d This said a silver studded sword he gave With scabbard and with well cut belt complete Ajax a girdle rich with crimson dye They parted Ajax to the Grecian camp And Hector to the ranks of Troy return d Great was the joy when him they saw approach Alive and safe escap d from Ajax might And arm invincible and tow rd the town They led him back beyond their hope preserv d While to Atrides tent the well greav d Greeks Led Ajax glorying in his triumph gain d But when to Agamemnon s tents they came The King of men to Saturn s royal son A bullock slew a male of five years old The carcase then they flay d and cutting up Sever d the joints then fixing on the spits Roasted with care and from the fire withdrew Their labours ended and the feast prepar d They shar d the social meal nor lack d there aught To Ajax then the chine s continuous length As honour s meed the mighty monarch gave The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied The aged Nestor first his mind disclos d He who before the sagest counsel gave Now thus with prudent speech began and said Atrides and ye other chiefs of Greece Since many a long hair d Greek hath fall n in fight Whose blood beside Scamander s flowing stream Fierce Mars has shed while to the viewless shades Their spirits are gone behoves thee with the morn The warfare of the Greeks to intermit Then we with oxen and with mules the dead From all the plain will draw and from the ships A little space remov d will burn with fire That we returning to our native land May to their children bear our comrades bones Then will we go and on the plain erect Around the pyre one common mound for all Then quickly build before it lofty tow rs To screen both ships and men and in the tow rs Make ample portals with well fitting gates That through the midst a carriage way may pass And a deep trench around it dig to guard Both men and chariots lest on our defence The haughty Trojans should too hardly press He said and all the Kings his words approv d Meanwhile on Ilium s height at Priam s gate The Trojan chiefs a troubled council held Which op ning thus the sage Antenor spoke Hear now ye Trojans Dardans and Allies The words I speak the promptings of my soul Back to the sons of Atreus let us give The Argive Helen and the goods she brought For now in breach of plighted faith we fight Nor can I hope unless to my advice Ye listen that success will crown our arms Thus having said he sat and next arose The godlike Paris fair hair d Helen s Lord Who thus with winged words the chiefs address d Hostile to me Antenor is thy speech Thy better judgment better counsel knows But if in earnest such is thine advice Thee of thy senses have the Gods bereft Now Trojans hear my answer I reject The counsel nor the woman will restore But for the goods whate er I hither brought To Troy from Argos I am well content To give them all and others add beside This said he sat and aged Priam next A God in council Dardan s son arose Who thus with prudent speech began and said Hear now ye Trojans Dardans and Allies The words I speak the promptings of my soul Now through the city take your wonted meal Look to your watch let each man keep his guard To morrow shall Idaeus to the ships Of Greece to both the sons of Atreus bear The words of Paris cause of all this war And ask besides if from the deadly strife Such truce they will accord us as may serve To burn the dead hereafter we may fight Till Heav n decide and one with vict ry crown He said and they obedient to his word Throughout the ranks prepar d the wonted meal But with the morning to the ships of Greece Idaeus took his way in council there By Agamemnon s leading ship he found The Grecian chiefs the ministers of Mars And mid them all the clear voic d herald spoke Ye sons of Atreus and ye chiefs of Greece From Priam and the gallant sons of Troy I come to bear if ye be pleas d to hear The words of Paris cause of all this war The goods which hither in his hollow ships Would he had perish d rather Paris brought He will restore and others add beside But further says the virgin wedded wife Of Menelaus though the general ral voice Of Troy should bid him he will not restore Then bids me ask if from the deadly strife Such truce ye will accord us as may serve To burn the dead hereafter we may fight Till Heav n decide and one with vict ry crown Thus he they all in silence heard at length Uprose the valiant Diomed and said Let none from Paris now propose to accept Or goods or Helen s self a child may see That now the doom of Troy is close at hand He said the sons of Greece with loud applause The speech of valiant Diomed confirm d Then to Idaeus Agamemnon thus Idaeus thou hast heard what answer give The chiefs of Greece their answer I approve But for the truce for burial of the dead I nought demur no shame it is to grace With fun ral rites the corpse of slaughter d foes Be witness Jove and guard the plighted truce He said and heav nward rais d his staff and back To Ilium s walls Idaeus took his way Trojans and Dardans there in council met Expecting sat till from the Grecian camp Idaeus should return he came and stood In mid assembly and his message gave Then all in haste their sev ral ways dispers d For fuel some and some to bring the dead The Greeks too from their well mann d ships went forth For fuel some and some to bring the dead The sun was newly glancing on the earth From out the ocean s smoothly flowing depths Climbing the Heav ns when on the plain they met Hard was it then to recognize the dead But when the gory dust was wash d away Shedding hot tears they plac d them on the wains Nor loud lament by Priam s high command Was heard in silence they with grief suppress d Heap d up their dead upon the fun ral pyre Then burnt with fire and back return d to Troy The well greav d Greeks they too with grief suppress d Heap d up their dead upon the fun ral pyre Then burnt with fire and to the ships return d But ere twas morn while daylight strove with night About the pyre a chosen band of Greeks Had kept their vigil and around it rais d Upon the plain one common mound for all And built in front a wall with lofty tow rs To screen both ships and men and in the tow rs Made ample portals with well fitting gates That through the midst a carriage way might pass Then dug a trench around it deep and wide And in the trench a palisade they fix d Thus labour d thro the night the long hair d Greeks The Gods assembled in the courts of Jove With wonder view d the mighty work and thus Neptune Earth shaking King his speech began O Father Jove in all the wide spread earth Shall men be found in counsel and design To rival us Immortals see saint thou not How round their ships the long hair d Greeks have built A lofty wall and dug a trench around Nor to the Gods have paid their off rings due Wide as the light extends shall be the fame Of this great work and men shall lightly deem Of that which I and Phoebus jointly rais d With toil and pain for great Laomedon To whom in wrath the Cloud compeller thus Neptune Earth shaking King what words are these This bold design to others of the Gods Of feebler hands and pow r less great than thine Might cause alarm but far as light extends Of this great work to thee shall be the fame When with their ships the long hair d Greeks shall take Their homeward voyage to their native land This wall shall by the waves be broken through And sink a shapeless ruin in the sea O er the wide shore again thy sands shall spread And all the boasted work of Greece o erwhelm Amid themselves such converse held the Gods The sun was set the Grecian work was done They slew and shar d by tents the ev ning meal From Lemnos isle a num rous fleet had come Freighted with wine and by Euneus sent Whom fair Hypsipyle to Jason bore For Atreus sons apart from all the rest Of wine the son of Jason had despatch d A thousand measures all the other Greeks Hasten d to purchase some with brass and some With gleaming iron other some with hides Cattle or slaves and joyous wax d the feast All night the long hair d Greeks their revels held And so in Troy the Trojans and Allies But through the night his anger Jove express d With awful thunderings pale they turn d with fear To earth the wine was from the goblets shed Nor dar d they drink until libations due Had first been pour d to Saturn s mighty son Then lay they down and sought the boon of sleep ARGUMENT THE SECOND BATTLE AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS Jupiter assembles a council of the deities and threatens them with the pains of Tartarus if they assist either side Minerva only obtains of him that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels The armies join battle Jupiter on Mount Ida weighs in his balances the fates of both and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings Nestor alone continues in the field in great danger Diomed relieves him whose exploits and those of Hector are excellently described Juno endeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks but in vain The acts of Teucer who is at length wounded by Hector and carried off Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians but are restrained by Iris sent from Jupiter The night puts an end to the battle Hector continues in the field the Greeks being driven to their fortifications before the ships and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the camp to prevent the enemy from re embarking and escaping by flight They kindle fires through all the field and pass the night under arms The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the poem to the end of this book The scene here except of the celestial machines lies in the field toward the sea shore BOOK VIII Now morn in saffron robe the earth o erspread And Jove the lightning s Lord of all the Gods A council held upon the highest peak Of many ridg d Olympus he himself Address d them they his speech attentive heard Hear all ye Gods and all ye Goddesses The words I speak the promptings of my soul Let none among you male or female dare To thwart my counsels rather all concur That so these matters I may soon conclude If from the rest apart one God I find Presuming or to Trojans or to Greeks To give his aid with ignominious stripes Back to Olympus shall that God be driv n Or to the gloom of Tartarus profound Far off the lowest abyss beneath the earth With gates of iron and with floor of brass Beneath the shades as far as earth from Heav n There will I hurl him and ye all shall know In strength how greatly I surpass you all Make trial if ye will that all may know A golden cord let down from Heav n and all Both Gods and Goddesses your strength apply Yet would ye fail to drag from Heav n to earth Strive as ye may your mighty master Jove But if I choose to make my pow r be known The earth itself and ocean I could raise And binding round Olympus ridge the cord Leave them suspended so in middle air So far supreme my pow r o er Gods and men He said and they confounded by his words In silence sat so sternly did he speak At length the blue ey d Goddess Pallas said O Father Son of Saturn King of Kings Well do we know thy pow r invincible Yet deeply grieve we for the warlike Greeks Condemn d to hopeless ruin from the fight Since such is thy command we stand aloof But yet some saving counsel may we give Lest in thine anger thou destroy them quite To whom the Cloud compeller smiling thus Be of good cheer my child unwillingly I speak yet will not thwart thee of thy wish He said and straight the brazen footed steeds Of swiftest flight with manes of flowing gold He harness d to his chariot all in gold Himself array d the golden lash he grasp d Of curious work and mounting on his car Urg d the fleet coursers nothing loth they flew Midway betwixt the earth and starry heav n To Ida s spring abounding hill he came And to the crest of Gargarus wild nurse Of mountain beasts a sacred plot was there Whereon his incense honour d altar stood There stay d his steeds the Sire of Gods and men Loos d from the car and veil d with clouds around Then on the topmost ridge he sat in pride Of conscious strength and looking down survey d The Trojan city and the ships of Greece Meantime the Greeks throughout their tents in haste Despatch d their meal and arm d them for the fight On th other side the Trojans donn d their arms In numbers fewer but with stern resolve By hard necessity constrain d to strive For wives and children in the stubborn fight The gates all open d wide forth pour d the crowd Of horse and foot and loud the clamour rose When in the midst they met together rush d Bucklers and lances and the furious might Of mail clad warriors bossy shield on shield Clatter d in conflict loud the clamour rose Then rose too mingled shouts and groans of men Slaying and slain the earth ran red with blood While yet twas morn and wax d the youthful day Thick flew the shafts and fast the people fell On either side but when the sun had reach d The middle Heav n th Eternal Father hung His golden scales aloft and plac d in each The fatal death lot for the sons of Troy The one the other for the brass clad Greeks Then held them by the midst down sank the lot Of Greece down to the ground while high aloft Mounted the Trojan scale and rose to Heav n two Then loud he bade the volleying thunder peal From Ida s heights and mid the Grecian ranks He hurl d his flashing lightning at the sight Amaz d they stood and pale with terror shook Then not Idomeneus nor Atreus son The mighty Agamemnon kept their ground Nor either Ajax ministers of Mars Gerenian Nestor aged prop of Greece Alone remain d and he against his will His horse sore wounded by an arrow shot By godlike Paris fair hair d Helen s Lord Just on the crown where close behind the head First springs the mane the deadliest spot of all The arrow struck him madden d with the pain He rear d then plunging forward with the shaft Fix d in his brain and rolling in the dust The other steeds in dire confusion threw And while old Nestor with his sword essay d To cut the reins and free the struggling horse Amid the rout down came the flying steeds Of Hector guided by no timid hand By Hector s self then had the old man paid The forfeit of his life but good at need The valiant Diomed his peril saw And loudly shouting on Ulysses call d Ulysses sage Laertes godlike son Why fliest thou coward like amid the throng And in thy flight to the aim of hostile spears Thy back presenting stay and here with me From this fierce warrior guard the good old man He said but stout Ulysses heard him not And to the ships pursued his hurried way But in the front Tydides though alone Remain d undaunted by old Nester s car He stood and thus the aged chief address d Old man these youthful warriors press thee sore Thy vigour spent and with the weight of years Oppress d and helpless too thy charioteer And slow thy horses mount my car and prove How swift my steeds or in pursuit or flight From those of Tros descended scour the plain My noble prize from great AEneas won Leave to th attendants these while mine we launch Against the Trojan host that Hector s self May know how strong my hand can hurl the spear He said and Nestor his advice obey d The two attendants valiant Sthenelus And good Eurymedon his horses took While on Tydides car they mounted both The aged Nestor took the glitt ring reins And urg d the horses Hector soon they met As on he came his spear Tydides threw Yet struck not Hector but his charioteer Who held the reins the brave Thebaeus son Eniopeus through the breast transfix d Beside the nipple from the car he fell The startled horses swerving at the sound And from his limbs the vital spirit fled Deep for his comrade slain was Hector s grief Yet him though griev d perforce he left to seek A charioteer nor wanted long his steeds A guiding hand for Archeptolemus Brave son of Iphitus he quickly found And bade him mount his swiftly flying car And to his hands the glitt ring reins transferr d Then fearful ruin had been wrought and deeds Untold achiev d and like a flock of lambs The adverse hosts been coop d beneath the walls Had not the Sire of Gods and men beheld And with an awful peal of thunder hurl d His vivid lightning down the fiery bolt Before Tydides chariot plough d the ground Fierce flash d the sulph rous flame and whirling round Beneath the yoke th affrighted horses quailed From Nestor s hand escap d the glitt ring reins And trembling thus to Diomed he spoke Turn we to flight Tydides see saint thou not That Jove from us his aiding hand withholds This day to Hector Saturn s son decrees The meed of vict ry on some future day If so he will the triumph may be ours For man how brave soe er cannot o errule The will of Jove so much the mightier he Whom answer d thus the valiant Diomed Truly old man and wisely dost thou speak But this the bitter grief that wrings my soul Some day amid the councillors of Troy Hector may say Before my presence scar d Tydides sought the shelter of the ships Thus when he boasts gape earth and hide my shame To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied Great son of Tydeus oh what words are these Should Hector brand thee with a coward s name No credence would he gain from Trojan men Or Dardan or from Trojan warriors wives Whose husbands in the dust thy hand hath laid He said and mid the general rout to flight He turn d his horses on the flying crowd With shouts of triumph Hector at their head The men of Troy their murd rous weapons show r d Loud shouted Hector of the glancing helm Tydides heretofore the warrior Greeks Have held thee in much honour plac d on high At banquets and with lib ral portions grac d And flowing cups but thou from this day forth Shalt be their scorn a woman s soul is thine Out on thee frighten d girl thou ne er shalt scale Our Trojan tow rs and see me basely fly Nor in thy ships our women bear away Ere such thy boast my hand shall work thy doom Thus he and greatly was Tydides mov d To turn his horses and confront his foe Thrice thus he doubted thrice at Jove s command From Ida s height the thunder peal d in sign Of vict ry swaying to the Trojan side Then to the Trojans Hector call d aloud Trojans and Lycians and ye Dardans fam d In close encounter quit ye now like men Put forth your wonted valour for I know That in his secret counsels Jove designs Glory to me disaster to the Greeks Fools in those wretched walls that put their trust Scarce worthy notice hopeless to withstand My onset and the trench that they have dug Our horses easily can overleap And when I reach the ships be mindful ye To have at hand the fire wherewith the ships We may destroy while they themselves shall fall An easy prey bewilder d by the smoke He said and thus with cheering words address d His horses Xanthus and Podargus thou AEthon and Lampus now repay the care On you bestow d by fair Andromache Eetion s royal daughter bear in mind How she with ample store of provender Your mangers still supplied before e en I Her husband from her hands the wine cup took Put forth your speed that we may make our prize Of Nestor s shield whose praise extends to Heav n Its handles and itself of solid gold And from the shoulders of Tydides strip His gorgeous breastplate work of Vulcan s hand These could we take methinks this very night Would see the Greeks embarking on their ships Such was his pray r but Juno on her throne Trembled with rage till great Olympus quak d And thus to Neptune mighty God she spoke O thou of boundless might Earth shaking God See saint thou unmov d the ruin of the Greeks Yet they in AEgae and in Helice With grateful off rings rich thine altars crown Then give we them the vict ry if we all Who favour Greece together should combine To put to flight the Trojans and restrain All seeing Jove he might be left alone On Ida s summit to digest his wrath To whom in anger Neptune thus replied O Juno rash of speech what words are these I dare not counsel that we all should join Gainst Saturn s son so much the stronger he Such converse held they all the space meanwhile Within the trench between the tow r and ships Was closely throng d with steeds and buckler d men By noble Hector brave as Mars and led By Jove to vict ry coop d in narrow space Who now had burnt with fire the Grecian ships But Juno bade Atrides haste to rouse Their fainting courage through the camp he pass d On his broad hand a purple robe he bore And stood upon Ulysses lofty ship The midmost whence to shout to either side Or to the tents of Ajax Telamon Or of Achilles who at each extreme Confiding in their strength had moor d their ships Thence to the Greeks he shouted loud and clear Shame on ye Greeks base cowards brave alone In outward semblance where are now the vaunts Which once so highly of ourselves we deem d Ye made vain glorious braggarts as ye were In Lemnos isle when feasting on the flesh Of straight horn d oxen and your flowing cups Crowning with ruddy wine not one of you But for a hundred Trojans in the field Or for two hundred deem d himself a match Now quail ye all before a single man Hector who soon will wrap our ships in fire O Father Jove what sov reign e er hast thou So far deluded of such glory robb d Yet ne er on this disastrous voyage bent Have I unheeded pass d thine altar by The choicest off rings burning still on each In hopes to raze the well built walls of Troy Yet to this pray r at least thine ear incline Grant that this coast in safety we may leave Nor be by Trojans utterly subdued He said and Jove with pity saw his tears And with a sign his people s safety vouch d He sent an eagle noblest bird that flies Who in his talons bore a wild deer s fawn The fawn he dropp d beside the holy shrine Where to the Lord of divination Jove The Greeks were wont their solemn rites to pay The sign from Heav n they knew with courage fresh Assail d the Trojans and the fight renew d Then none of all the many Greeks might boast That he before Tydides drove his car Across the ditch and mingled in the fight His was the hand that first a crested chief The son of Phradmon Agelaus struck He turn d his car for flight but as he turn d The lance of Diomed behind his neck Between the shoulders through his chest was driv n Headlong he fell and loud his armour rang Next to Tydides Agamemnon came And Menelaus Atreus godlike sons Th Ajaces both in dauntless courage cloth d Idomeneus with whom Meriones His faithful comrade terrible as Mars Eurypylus Euaemon s noble son The ninth was Teucer who with

of aegis bearing Jove And Pallas Ilium s well built walls we raze A gift of honour second but to mine I in thy hands will place a tripod bright Or with their car and harness two brave steeds Or a fair woman who thy bed may share To whom in answer valiant Teucer thus Most mighty son of Atreus why excite Who lacks not zeal To th utmost of my pow r Since first we drove the Trojans back I watch Unceasing every chance to ply my shafts Eight barbed arrows have I shot e en now And in a warrior each has found its mark That savage hound alone defeats my aim At Hector as he spoke another shaft He shot ambitious of so great a prize He miss d his aim but Priam s noble son Gorgythion through the breast his arrow struck Whom from AEsyme brought a wedded bride Of heavenly beauty Castianeira bore Down sank his head as in a garden sinks A ripen d poppy charg d with vernal rains So sank his head beneath his helmet s weight At Hector yet another arrow shot Teucer ambitious of so great a prize Yet

struck Near to the shoulder where the collar bone Joins neck and breast the spot most opportune And broke the tendon paralys d his arm Dropp d helpless by his side upon his knees He fell and from his hands let fall the bow Not careless Ajax saw his brother s fall But o er him spread in haste his cov ring shield Two faithful friends Mecisteus Echius son And brave Alastor from the press withdrew And bore him deeply groaning to the ships Then Jove again the Trojan courage fir d And backward to the ditch they forc d the Greeks Proud of his prowess Hector led them on And as a hound that fleet of

Could turn me from my purpose such my might And such the pow r of my resistless hand But ye were struck with terror ere ye saw The battle field and fearful deeds of war But this I say and bear it in

dread son of Saturn dost thou speak Well do we know thy pow r invincible Yet deeply grieve we for the warlike Greeks Condemn d to hopeless ruin from the fight Since such is thy command we stand aloof But yet some saving counsel may we give Lest in thine anger thou destroy them quite To whom the Cloud compeller thus replied Yet greater slaughter stag ey d Queen of Heav n To morrow shalt thou see if so thou list Wrought on the warrior Greeks by Saturn s son For Hector s proud career shall not be check d Until the wrath of Peleus godlike son Beside the ships be kindled in the day When round Patroclus corpse in narrow space E en by the vessels sterns the war shall rage Such is the voice of destiny for thee I reck not of thy wrath nor should I care Though thou wert thrust beneath the lowest deep Of earth and ocean where Iapetus And Saturn lie uncheer d by ray of sun Or breath of air in Tartarus profound Though there thou wert to banishment consign d I should not heed but thy reproaches hear Unmov d for viler thing is none than thou He said but white arm d Juno answer d not The sun now sunk beneath the ocean wave Drew o er the teeming earth the veil of night The Trojans saw reluctant day s decline But on the Greeks thrice welcome thrice invoked With earnest prayers the shades of darkness fell The noble Hector then to council call d The Trojan leaders from the ships apart He led them by the eddying river s side To a clear space of ground from corpses free They from their cars dismounting to the words Of godlike Hector listen d in his hand His massive spear he held twelve cubits long Whose glitt ring point flash d bright with hoop of gold Encircled round on this he leant and said Hear me ye Trojans Dardans and Allies I hop d that to the breezy heights of Troy We might ere now in triumph have return d The Grecian ships and all the Greeks destroy d But night hath come too soon and sav d awhile The Grecian army and their stranded ships Then yield we to the night prepare the meal Unyoke your horses and before them place Their needful forage from the city bring Oxen and sheep the luscious wine provide Bring bread from out our houses and collect Good store of fuel that the livelong night E en till the dawn of day may broadly blaze Our num rous watchfires and illume the Heav ns Lest e en by night the long hair d Greeks should seek O er the broad

haste and others too may fear To tempt with hostile arms the pow r of Troy Then let the sacred heralds voice proclaim Throughout the city that the stripling youths And hoary headed sires allot themselves In sev ral watches to the Heav n built tow rs Charge too the women in their houses each To kindle blazing fires let careful watch Be set lest in the absence of the men The town by secret ambush be surpris d Such valiant Trojans is th advice I give And what to night your wisdom shall approve Will I at morn before the Trojans speak Hopeful to Jove I pray and all the Gods To chase from hence these fate inflicted hounds By fate sent hither on their dark ribb d ships Now keep we through the night our watchful guard And with the early dawn equipp d in arms Upon their fleet our angry battle pour Then shall I know if Tydeus valiant son Back from the ships shall drive me to the walls Or I triumphant bear his bloody spoils To morrow morn his courage will decide If he indeed my onset will await But ere to morrow s sun be high in Heav n He mid the foremost if I augur right Wounded and bleeding in the dust shall lie And many a comrade round him Would to Heav n I were as sure to be from age and death Exempt and held in honour as a God Phoebus or Pallas as I am assur d The coming day is fraught with ill to Greece Thus Hector spoke the Trojans shouted loud Then from the yoke the sweating steeds they loos d And tether d each beside their sev ral cars Next from the city speedily they brought Oxen and sheep the luscious wine procur d Brought bread from out their houses and good store Of fuel gather d wafted from the plain The winds to Heav n the sav ry odours bore Full of proud hopes upon the pass of war All night they camp d and frequent blaz d their fires As when in Heav n around the glitt ring moon The stars shine bright amid the breathless air And ev ry crag and ev ry jutting peak Stands boldly forth and ev ry forest glade Ev n to the gates of Heav n is open d wide The boundless sky shines each particular star Distinct joy fills the gazing shepherd s heart So bright so thickly scatter d o er the plain Before the walls of Troy between the ships And Xanthus stream the Trojan watchfires blaz d A thousand fires burnt brightly and round each Sat fifty warriors in the ruddy glare Champing the provender before them laid Barley and rye the tether d horses stood Beside the cars and waited for the morn ARGUMENT THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES Agamemnon after the last day s defeat proposes to the Greeks to quit the siege and return to their country Diomed opposes this and Nestor seconds him praising his wisdom and resolution He orders the guard to be strengthened and a council summoned to deliberate what meabures were to be followed in this emergency Agamemnon pursues this advice and Nestor farther prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles in order to move him to a reconciliation Ulysses and Ajax are make choice of who are accompanied by old Phoenix They make each of them very moving and pressing speeches but are rejected with roughness by Achilles who notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent The ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp and the troops betake themselves to sleep This book and the next following take up the space of one night which is the twenty seventh from the beginning of the poem The scene lies on the sea shore the station of the Grecian ships BOOK IX Thus kept their watch the Trojans but the Greeks Dire Panic held companion of chill Fear Their bravest struck with grief unbearable As when two stormy winds ruffle the sea Boreas and Zephyr from the hills of Thrace With sudden gust descending the dark waves Rear high their angry crests and toss on shore Masses of tangled weed such stormy grief The breast of ev ry Grecian warrior rent Atrides heart struck wander d to and fro And to the clear voic d heralds gave command To call but not with proclamation loud Each sev ral man to council he himself Spar d not his labour mixing with the chiefs Sadly they sat in council Atreus son Weeping arose as some dark water d fount Pours o er a craggy steep its gloomy stream Then with deep groans th assembled Greeks address d O friends the chiefs and councillors of Greece Grievous and all unlook d for is the blow Which Jove hath dealt me by his promise led I hop d to raze the strong built walls of Troy And home return in safety but it seems He falsifies his word and bids me now Return to Argos frustrate of my hope Dishonour d and with grievous loss of men Such now appears th o er ruling sov reign will Of Saturn s son who oft hath sunk the heads Of many a lofty city in the dust And yet will sink for mighty is his hand Hear then my counsel let us all agree Home to direct our course since here in vain We strive to take the well built walls of Troy The monarch spoke they all in silence heard In speechless sorrow long they sat at length Rose valiant Diomed and thus he spoke Atrides I thy folly must confront As is my right in council thou O King Be not offended once among the Greeks Thou heldest light my prowess with the name Of coward branding me how justly so Is known to all the Greeks both young and old On thee the deep designing Saturn s son In diff ring measure hath his gifts bestow d A throne he gives thee higher far than all But valour noblest boon of Heav n denies How canst thou hope the sons of Greece shall prove Such heartless dastards as thy words suppose If homeward to return thy mind be fix d Depart the way is open and the ships Which from Mycenae follow d thee in crowds Are close at hand and ready to be launch d Yet will the other long hair d Greeks remain Till Priam s city fall nay though the rest Betake them to their ships and sail for home Yet I and Sthenelus we two will fight Till Troy be ours for Heav n is on our side Thus he the sons of Greece with loud applause The speech of valiant Diomed confirm d Then aged Nestor rose and thus began Tydides eminent thou art in war And In the council thy compeers in age Must yield to thee thy present words no Greek Can censure or gainsay and yet the end Thou hast not reach d and object of debate But thou art young and for thine age mightst be My latest born yet dost thou to the Kings Sage counsel give and well in season speak But now will I that am thine elder far Go fully through the whole and none my words May disregard not ev n Atrides self Outcast from kindred law and hearth is he Whose soul delights in fierce internal strife But yield we now to th influence of night Prepare the meal and let the sev ral guards Be posted by the ditch without the wall This duty on the younger men I lay Then Agamemnon thou thy part perform For thou art King supreme the Elders all As meet and seemly to the feast invite Thy tents are full of wine which Grecian ships O er the wide sea bring day by day from Thrace Nor lack saint thou aught thy guests to entertain And many own thy sway when all are met His counsel take who gives the best advice Great need we have of counsel wise and good When close beside our ships the hostile fires Are burning who can this unmov d behold This night our ruin or our safety sees He said and they assenting heard his speech Forth with their followers went th appointed guards The princely Thrasymedes Nestor s son Ascalaphus and bold Ialmenus Two valiant sons of Mars Meriones And Aphareus and brave Deipyrus And godlike Lycomedes Creon s son Sev n were the leaders and with each went forth A hundred gallant youths with lances arm d Between the ditch and wall they took their post There lit their fires and there the meal prepar d Then for th assembled Elders in his tent An ample banquet Agamemnon spread They on the viands set before them fell The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied The aged Nestor first his mind disclos d He who before the sagest counsel gave Now thus with prudent words began and said Most mighty Agamemnon King of men With thee Atrides my discourse shall end With thee begin o er many nations thou Hold saint sov reign sway since Jove to thee hath giv n The sceptre and the high prerogative To be thy people s judge and counsellor Tis thine to speak the word tis thine to hear And to determine when some other chief Suggestions offers in the general ral cause What counsel shall prevail depends on thee Yet will I say what seems to me the best Sounder opinion none can hold than this Which I maintain and ever have maintain d Ev n from the day when thou great King didst bear The fair Briseis from Achilles tent Despite his anger not by my advice I fain would have dissuaded thee but thou Following the dictates of thy wrathful pride Didst to our bravest wrong dishon ring him Whom ev n th Immortals honour d for his prize Thou took saint and still retain saint but let us now Consider if ev n yet with costly gifts And soothing words we may his wrath appease To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus Father too truly thou recall saint my fault I err d nor will deny it as a host Is he whom Jove in honour holds as now Achilles honorable ring he confounds the Greeks But if I err d by evil impulse led Fain would I now conciliate him and pay An ample penalty before you all I pledge myself rich presents to bestow Sev n tripods will I give untouch d by fire Of gold ten talents twenty caldrons bright Twelve pow rful horses on the course renown d Who by their speed have many prizes won Not empty handed could that man be deem d Nor poor in gold who but so much possess d As by those horses has for me been won Sev n women too well skill

whom from his tent I bore away and add a solemn oath I ne er approach d her bed nor held with her Such intercourse as man with woman holds All these shall now be his but if the Gods Shall grant us Priam s city to destroy Of gold and brass when we divide the spoil With countless heaps he shall a vessel freight And twenty captives he himself shall choose All only less than Argive Helen fair And if it be our fate to see again The teeming soil of Argos he shall be My son by marriage and in honour held As is Orestes who my only son Is rear d at home in luxury and ease Three daughters fair I have Chrysothemis Iphianassa and Laodice Of these whiche er he will to Peleus house No portion ask d for he shall take to wife And with her will I add such wedding gifts As never man before to daughter gave Sev n prosp rous towns besides Cardamyle And Enope and Ira s grassy plains And Pherae and Antheia s pastures deep AEpeia fair and vine clad Pedasus All by the sea by sandy Pylos bounds The dwellers there in flocks and herds are rich And as a God shall honour him with gifts And to his sceptre ample tribute pay This will I do so he his wrath remit Then let him yield Pluto alone remains Unbending and inexorable and thence Of all the Gods is most abhorr d of men To me submitting as in royal pow r Superior far and more advanc d in age To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied Most mighty Agamemnon King of men Atrides not unworthy are the gifts Which to Achilles thou design saint to send Then to the tent of Peleus son in haste Let us our chosen messengers despatch Whom I shall choose let them consent to go Then first of all let Phoenix lead the way Beloved of Jove the mighty Ajax next With them Ulysses sage and let them take Of heralds Hodius and Eurybates Bring now the hallowing water for our hands And bid be silent while to Saturn s son That he have mercy we address our pray r He said and well his counsel pleas d them all The heralds pour d the water on their hands The youths attending crown d the bowls with wine And in due order serv d the cups to all Then their libations made when each with wine Had satisfied his soul from out the tent Of Agamemnon Atreus son they pass d And many a caution aged Nestor gave With rapid glance to each Ulysses chief How best to soften Peleus matchless son Beside the many dashing ocean s shore They mov d along and many a pray r address d To Neptune Ocean s Earth surrounding God That he to gentle counsels would incline The haughty soul of great AEacides When to the ships and tents they came where lay The warlike Myrmidons their chief they found His spirit soothing with a sweet ton d lyre Of curious work with silver band adorn d Part of the spoil he took when he destroy d Eetion s wealthy town on this he play d Soothing his soul and sang of warriors deeds Before the chief in silence and alone Patroclus sat upon Achilles fix d His eyes awaiting till the song should cease The envoys forward stepp d Ulysses first And stood before him from his couch amaz d And holding still his lyre Achilles sprang Leaving the seat whereon they found him plac d And at their entrance rose Patroclus too Waving his hand Achilles swift of foot Addressed them Welcome friends as friends ye come Some great occasion surely to my tent Hath brought the men who are of all the Greeks Despite my anger dearest to my heart Thus as he spoke he led them in and plac d On couches spread with purple carpets o er Then thus address d Patroclus at his side Son of Menoetius set upon the board A larger bowl and stronger mix the wine And serve a cup

the Gods their honours due He in the fire the wonted off rings burnt They on the viands set before them fell The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied Ajax to Phoenix sign d Ulysses saw The sign and rising fill d a cup with wine And pledg d Achilles thus To thee I drink Achilles nobly is thy table spread As heretofore in Agamemnon s tent So now in thine abundant is the feast But not the pleasures of the banquet now We have in hand impending o er our arms Grave cause of fear illustrious chief we see Grave doubts to save or see destroy d our ships If thou great warrior put not forth thy might For close beside the ships and wall are camp d The haughty Trojans and renown d allies Their watch fires frequent burn throughout the camp And loud their boast that nought shall stay their hands Until our dark ribb d ships be made their prey Jove too for them with fav ring augury Sends forth his lightning boastful of his strength And firmly trusting in the aid of Jove Hector resistless rages nought he fears Or God or man with martial fury fir d He prays impatient for th approach of morn Then breaking through the lofty sterns resolv d To the devouring flames to give the ships And slay the crews bewilder d in the smoke And much my mind misgives me lest the Gods His threats fulfil and we be fated here To perish far from Argos grassy plains Up then if in their last extremity Thy spirit inclines though late to save the Greeks Sore press d by Trojan arms lest thou thyself Hereafter feel remorse the evil done Is past all cure then thou reflect betimes How from the Greeks to ward the day of doom Dear friend remember now thy father s words The aged Peleus when to Atreus son He sent thee forth from Phthia how he said My son the boon of strength if so they will Juno or Pallas have the pow r to give But thou thyself thy haughty spirit must curb For better far is gentle courtesy And cease from angry strife that so the Greeks The more may honour thee both young and old Such were the words thine aged father spoke Which thou hast now forgotten yet e en now Pause for awhile and let thine anger cool And noble gifts so thou thy wrath remit From Agamemnon shalt thou bear away Listen to me while I recount the gifts Which in his tent he pledg d him to bestow Sev n tripods promis d he untouch d by fire Of gold ten talents twenty caldrons bright Twelve pow rful horses in the course renown

her whom from thy tent He bore away and add a solemn oath He ne er approach d her bed nor held with her Such intercourse as man with woman holds All these shall now be thine but if the Gods Shall grant us Priam s city to destroy Of gold and brass when we divide the spoil With countless heaps a vessel shalt thou freight And twenty captives thou thyself shalt choose All only less than Argive Helen fair And if it be our fate to see again The teeming soil of Argos thou mayst be His son by marriage and in honour held As is Orestes who his only son Is rear d at home in luxury and ease Three daughters fair are his Chrysothemis Iphianassa and Laodice Of these whiche er thou wilt to Peleus house No portion ask d for thou shalt take to wife And with her will he add such wedding gifts As never man before to daughter gave Sev n prosp rous towns besides Cardamyle And Enope and Ira s grassy plains And Pherae and Antheia s pastures deep AEpeia fair and vine clad Pedasus All by the sea by sandy Pylos bounds The dwellers there in flocks and herds are rich And as a God will honour thee with gifts And to thy sceptre ample tribute pay All these he gives so thou thy wrath remit But if thou hold Atrides in such hate Him and his gifts yet let thy pity rest On all the other Greeks thus sore bested By whom thou shalt be honour d as a God For great the triumph that thou now mayst gain E en Hector s self is now within thy reach For he is near at hand and in his pride And martial fury deems that none of all Our ships contain can rival him in arms Whom answer d thus Achilles swift of foot Heav n born Ulysses sage in council son Of great Laertes I must frankly speak My mind at once my fix d resolve declare That from henceforth I may not by the Greeks By this man and by that be importun d Him as the gates of hell my soul abhors Whose outward words his secret thoughts belie Hear then what seems to me the wisest course On me nor Agamemnon Atreus son Nor others shall prevail since nought is gain d By toil unceasing in the battle field Who nobly fight but share with those who skulk Like honours gain the coward and the brave Alike the idlers and the active die And nought it profits me though day by day In constant toil I set my life at stake But as a bird though ill she fare herself Brings to her callow brood the food she takes So I through many a sleepless night have lain And many a bloody day have labour d through Engag d in battle on your wives behalf Twelve cities have I taken with my ships Eleven more by land on Trojan soil From all of these abundant stores of wealth I took and all to Agamemnon gave He safe beside his ships my spoils receiv d A few divided but the most retain d To other chiefs and Kings he meted out Their sev ral portions and they hold them still From me from me alone of all the Greeks He bore away and keeps my cherish d wife Well let him keep her solace of his bed But say then why do Greeks with Trojans fight Why hath Atrides brought this mighty host To Troy if not in fair hair d Helen s cause Of mortals are there none that love their wives Save Atreus sons alone or do not all Who boast the praise of sense and virtue love And cherish each his own as her I lov d E en from my soul though captive of my spear Now since he once hath robb d me and deceiv d Let him not seek my aid I know him now And am not to be won let him devise With thee Ulysses and the other Kings How best from hostile fires to save his ships He hath completed many mighty works Without my aid hath built a lofty wall And dug a trench around it wide and deep And in the trench hath fix d a palisade Nor so the warrior slayer Hector s might Can keep in check while I was in the field Not far without the walls would Hector range His line of battle nor beyond the Oak And Scaean gates would venture there indeed He once presum d to meet me hand to hand And from my onset narrowly escap d But as with Hector now no more I fight To morrow morn my off rings made to Jove And all the Gods and freighted well my ships And launch d upon the main thyself shall see If that thou care to see my vessels spread O er the broad bosom of the Hellespont My lusty crews plying the vig rous oar And if th Earth shaker send a fav ring breeze Three days will bear us home to Phthia s shore There did I leave abundant store of wealth When hitherward I took my luckless way Thither from hence I bear of ruddy gold And brass and women fair and iron hoar The share assign d me but my chiefest prize The monarch Agamemnon Atreus son Himself who gave with insult takes away To him then speak aloud the words I send That all may know his crimes if yet he hope Some other Greek by treach rous wiles to cheat Cloth d as he is in shamelessness my glance All brazen as he is he dare not meet I share no more his counsels nor his acts He hath deceiv d me once and wrong d again He shall not cozen me Of him enough I pass him by whom Jove hath robb d of sense His gifts I loathe and spurn himself I hold At a hair s worth and would he proffer me Tenfold or twentyfold of all he has Or ever may be his or all the gold Sent to Orchomenos or royal Thebes Egyptian treasurehouse of countless wealth Who boasts her hundred gates through each of which With horse and car two hundred warriors march Nay were his gifts in number as the sand Or dust upon the plain yet ne er will I By Agamemnon be prevail d upon Till I have paid him back my heart s offence Nor e er of Agamemnon Atreus son Will I a daughter wed not were she fair As golden Venus and in works renown d As Pallas blue ey d Maid yet her e en so I wed not let him choose some other Greek Some fitting match of nobler blood than mine But should the Gods in safety bring me home At Peleus hands I may receive a wife And Greece can boast of many a lovely maid In Hellas or in Phthia daughters fair Of chiefs who hold their native fortresses Of these at will a wife I may select And ofttimes hath my warlike soul inclin d To take a wedded wife a fitting bride And aged Peleus wealth in peace enjoy For not the stores which Troy they say contain d In peaceful times ere came the sons of Greece Nor all the treasures which Apollo s shrine The Archer God in rock built Pythos holds May weigh with life of oxen and of sheep Successful forays may good store provide And tripods may be gain d and noble steeds But when the

remaining round the walls of Troy I wage the war I ne er shall see my home But then undying glory shall be mine If I return and see my native land My glory all is gone but length of life Shall then be mine and death be long deferr d If others ask d my counsel I should say Homeward direct your course of lofty Troy Ye see not yet the end all seeing Jove O er her extends his hand on him relying Her people all with confidence are fill d Go then my answer to the chiefs of Greece Speak boldly such the privilege of age Bid that some better counsel they devise To save their ships and men their present scheme My anger unappeas d avails them nought But Phoenix here shall stay and sleep to night And with the morrow he with me shall sail And seek our native land if so he will For not by force will I remove him hence He said they all confounded by his words In silence heard so sternly did he speak At length in tears the aged Phoenix spoke For greatly fear d he for the ships of Greece If great Achilles on returning home Thy mind is set nor canst thou be induc d To save the ships from fire so fierce thy wrath How then dear boy can I remain behind Alone whom with thee aged Peleus sent That day when he in Agamemnon s cause From Phthia sent thee inexperienc d yet In all the duties of confed rate war And sage debate on which attends renown Me then he sent instructor of thy youth To prompt thy language and thine acts to guide So not from thee dear boy can I consent To part though Heav n should undertake my age To prompt thy language and thine acts to guide So not from thee dear

drench d Such care I had of thee such pains I took Rememb ring that by Heav n s decree no son Of mine I e er might see then thee I made Achilles rival of the Gods my son That thou mightst be the

Illustrious Ajax son of Telamon Without offence hast thou thy message giv n But fury fills my soul whene er I think How Agamemnon mid th assembled Greeks Insulting held me forth to public scorn As some dishonour d houseless vagabond But go ye now and bear my answer back No more in bloody war will I engage Till noble Hector Priam s godlike son O er slaughter d Greeks your ships enwrapp d in fire Shall reach the quarters of the Myrmidons Ere he assail my ship and tents I think That Hector valiant as he is will pause Thus he they each the double goblet rais d And to the Gods their due libations pour d Ulysses leading to the ships return d Meanwhile Patroclus bade th attendant maids Prepare a bed for Phoenix they obey d And quickly laid the bed with fleeces warm And rugs and linen light and

thee with the other chiefs concert The means thy people and thy ships to save And menaces himself at early dawn To launch his well trimm d vessels on the main Nay more he counsels others so he says Homeward to turn since here of lofty Troy We see not yet the end all seeing Jove O er her extends his hand on him relying Her people all with confidence are fill d Such was his language here before you stand Ajax and both the heralds sage grave men Who with me went and will confirm my words Old Phoenix left we there so will d the chief That with the morrow he with him may sail And seek their native land if so he will For not by force will he remove him hence Ulysses thus they all in silence heard Amaz d so stern the message that he bore Long time in silence sat the chiefs of Greece Outspoke at length the valiant Diomed Most mighty Agamemnon King of men Would that thou ne er hadst stoop d with costly gifts To sue for aid from Peleus matchless son For he before was over proud and now Thine offers will have tenfold swoll n his pride But leave we him according to his will To go or stay he then will join the fight When his own spirit shall prompt or Heav n inspire But hear ye all and do as I advise Refresh d with food and wine for therein lie Both strength and courage turn we to our rest And when the rosy finger d morn appears Thyself among the foremost with bold hearts Before our ships both horse and foot array He said and all the chiefs with loud applause His speech confirm d then due libations pour d Each to his sev ral tent they all withdrew Then laid them down and sought the boon of sleep ARGUMENT THE NIGHT ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army the distress of Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner He takes no rest that night but passes through the camp awaking the leaders and contriving all possible methods for the public safety Menelaus Nestor Ulysses and Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains They call a council of war and determine to send scouts into the enemy s camp to learn their posture and discover their intentions Diomed undertakes the hazardous enterprise and makes choice of Ulysses for his companion In their passage they surprise Dolon whom Hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians From him they are informed of the situation of the Trojans and auxiliary forces and particularly of Rhesus and the Thracians who were lately arrived They pass on with success kill Rhesus with several of his officers and seize the famous horses of that prince with which they return in triumph to the camp The same night continues the scene lies in the two camps BOOK X In night long slumbers lay the other chiefs Of all the Greeks by gentle sleep subdued But not on Agamemnon Atreus son By various cares oppress d sweet slumber fell As when from Jove the fair hair d Juno s Lord Flashes the lightning bringing in its train Tempestuous storm of mingled rain and hail Or snow by winter sprinkled o er the fields Or op ning wide the rav nous jaws of war So Agamemnon from his inmost heart Pour d forth in groans his multitudinous grief His spirit within him sinking On the plain He look d and there alarm d the watchfires saw Which far advanc d before the walls of Troy Blaz d numberless and thence of pipes and flutes He heard the sound and busy hum of men Upon the ships he look d and men of Greece And by the roots his hair in handfuls tore To Jove on high deep groan d his mighty heart Thus as he mus d the wisest course appear d With Nestor son of Neleus to confer If they some scheme in council might devise To ward destruction from the Grecian host He rose and o er his body drew his vest And underneath his well turn d feet he bound His sandals fair then o er his shoulders threw Down reaching to his feet a lion s skin Tawny and vast then grasp d his pond rous spear On Menelaus weigh d an equal dread Nor on his eyes that night had slumber sat Lest ill befall the Greeks who in his cause Crossing the wat ry waste had come to Troy And bold defiance to the Trojans giv n Round his broad chest a panther s skin he threw Then on his head his brazen helmet plac d And in his brawny hand a lance he bore To meet his brother went he forth of Greece The mighty monarch as a God rever d Him by the ship he found in act to arm And welcome was his presence to the King Then valiant Menelaus first began Why thus in arms good brother seek saint thou one The Trojan camp to spy I greatly fear That none will undertake the task alone To spy the movements of the hostile camp In the dark night stout hearted he must be To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus Great need my noble brother have we both Of sagest counsels if we hope the Greeks And Grecian ships from ruin to preserve Since turn d against us is the mind of Jove To Hector s off rings most his soul inclines For never have I seen or heard men tell How in one day one man has wrought such loss As Hector dear to Jove yet not the son Of God or Goddess on the Greeks has wrought Such deeds hath he achiev d such havoc made As we shall long in bitter mem ry keep Haste thou amid the ships and hither bring Idomeneus and Ajax I the while Will Nestor rouse and urge that he with us The outposts visit and instruct the guard To him they best will listen for his son Commands the watch with him Meriones The follower of the King Idomeneus To them by pref rence hath this charge been giv n He said and Menelaus answer d thus What wouldst thou have me do then here remain With them and wait thy coming or to them Thy message give and follow in thy steps Him answer d Agamemnon King of men Remain thou here lest haply we might fail To meet for in the camp are many paths But thou where er thou go saint each sev ral man Address and ask to rise to each his name And patronymic giving pay to each All due respect nor bear thee haughtily We like the rest must share the load of toil Which Jove assigns to all of mortal birth His brother thus with counsels wise dismiss d The King to aged Nestor took his way Him by his tent and dark ribb d ship he found On a soft couch beside him lay his arms His shield two lances and a glitt ring helm There lay the rich wrought belt the old man wore When to the battle arm d he led his troops For nought to age s weakness would he yield Raising his head and on his elbow propp d He question d thus Atrides Who art thou That wand rest through th encampment thus alone In the dark night when other mortals sleep Seek saint thou some mule broke loose or comrade lost Speak nor in silence come what wouldst thou here To whom thus Agamemnon King of men O Nestor son of Neleus pride of Greece Know me for Agamemnon Atreus son On whom hath Jove beyond the lot of men Laid grief that ne er shall end while I retain Breath in my lungs and vigour in my limbs I wander thus because these eyes of mine Sweet slumber visits not by cares of war Oppress d and harass d by the woes of Greece Much for the Greeks I fear nor keeps my mind Its wonted firmess I am ill at ease And leaps my troubled heart as tho twould burst My bosom s bounds my limbs beneath me shake But if thou wilt since thou too know saint not sleep Together to the outposts let us go And see if there by toil and sleep o erpow r d The guard repose neglectful of their watch The foe is close at hand nor are we sure He may not hazard e en a night attack To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied Most mighty Agamemnon King of men Not all the hopes that Hector entertains Shall by the Lord of counsel be fulfill d For him are toil and danger yet in store If but Achilles of his wrath repent Gladly will I attend thee others too Tydides spearman bold Ulysses sage Ajax the swift and Phyleus noble son Should all be summon d and twere well that one Across the camp should run to call in haste The godlike Ajax and Idomeneus Theirs are the farthest ships nor near at hand But dear to me as Menelaus is And highly honour d I must blame that thus Though thou shouldst take offence I needs must say He sleeps and leaves the toil to thee alone With all the chiefs he should be busied now Imploring aid in this our utmost need To whom thus Agamemnon King of men For other times old man reserve thy blame Sometimes I own he lags behind nor takes His share of labour not from indolence Or want of sense but still regarding me Waiting from me an impulse to receive But now before me he was up and came To visit me and I have sent him on To call those very men whom thou hast nam d Come then for we beside the gates and guard Shall find them there my orders were to meet To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied Then none can blame him nor can any Greek Justly refuse his summons to obey He said and round his body wrapped his vest Then on his feet his sandals fair he bound And o er his shoulders clasp d a purple cloak Doubled with ample folds and downy pile Then took his spear with point of sharpen d brass And through the camp prepar d to take his way Gerenian Nestor from his slumbers first Ulysses sage as Jove in council rous d Loud shouting soon the voice his senses reach d Forth from his tent he came and thus he spoke What cause so urgent leads you through the camp In the dark night to wander thus alone To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied Ulysses sage Laertes godlike son Be not offended such the stress that now Weighs down our army come thou then with us And others let us call with whom tis meet That we should counsel take to fight or fly He said Ulysses to the tent return d Then his broad shield across his shoulders thrown Came forth again and with them took his way To Diomed the son of Tydeus next They went and him they found beside his arms Without his tent his comrades slept around Their heads upon their bucklers laid their spears Stood upright on the butts the burnish d brass Like Heav n s own lightning flashing far around Stretch d on a wild bull s hide the chief repos d A gay wrought carpet roll d beneath his head Gerenian Nestor close behind him stood And touched him with his foot and thus in tone Reproachful spoke Arouse thee Tydeus son Why sleep saint thou thus all night or know saint thou not That on the very margin of the plain And close beside the ships the Trojans lie And little space between the camps is left Quick rous d from sleep thus answer d Diomed Beshrew thy heart old man no labour seems For thee too hard are there not younger men To run about the camp and summon all The sev ral chiefs thou dost too much old man To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied True friend and full of wisdom are thy words Good sons indeed I have and followers brave And many who might well my message bear But great is now the stress that lies on Greece For on a razor s edge is balanc d now To all the Greeks the chance of life or death Do thou then go for thou my younger art And if thou pity me thyself arouse Ajax the swift and Phyleus noble son He said the warrior round his shoulders threw Down reaching to his feet a lion s hide Tawny and dark and took his pond rous spear He went arous d and with him brought the chiefs When to the guard they came not sunk in sleep Found they the leaders but on wakeful watch Intent and all alert beside their arms As round a sheepfold keep their anxious watch The dogs who in the neighbouring thicket hear Some beast that bold in search of prey has come Down from the mountain loud the clamours rise Of men and dogs all sleep is banish d thence So from their eyes was banish d sleep who watch d Through that disastrous night still plainward turning At ev ry movement in the Trojan camp The old man saw well pleas d and thus address d With cheering words the captains of the guard Watch ever thus good youths nor be surpris d By slumber lest the foe a triumph gain This said he cross d the ditch and with him went The Grecian leaders to the council call d With them admitted to the conf rence went Meriones and Nestor s noble son The deep dug ditch they cross d and sat them down Upon an open space from corpses clear Where Hector from the slaughter of the Greeks Turn d back when Ev ning spread her veil around There sat they down and there the conf rence held Gerenian Nestor first took up the word O friends is any here with heart so bold Who dares self confident the Trojan camp To enter there some straggler he might take Or in the camp itself some tidings gain What are their secret counsels if they mean Here by the ships to hold their ground or back Sated with vict ry to the town retire This could he learn and hither scatheless bring His tidings high as Heav n in all men s mouths Would be his praise and ample his reward For ev ry captain of a ship should give A coal black ewe and at her foot a lamb A prize beyond compare and high should be His place at banquets and at solemn feasts He said but all the chiefs in silence heard Then rose the valiant Diomed and said Nestor that heart is mine I dare alone Enter the hostile camp so close at hand Yet were one comrade giv n me I should go With more of comfort more of confidence Where two combine one before other sees The better course and ev n though one alone The readiest way discover yet would be His judgment slower his decision less He said and many chiefs to Diomed Proffer d companionship stood forth at once With him to penetrate the Trojan camp The two Ajaces ministers of Mars Stood forth Meriones and eagerly Stood forth the son of Nestor Atreus son The royal Menelaus spearman bold And stout Ulysses whose enduring heart For ev ry deed of valour was prepar d Rose Agamemnon King of men and said Tydides comrade dearest to my soul Choose thou thine own companion whom thou wilt Of all the many here that proffer aid Him whom thou deem saint the best nor from respect To persons leave the better man behind And take the worse nor def rence show to rank Not though the purest royal blood were his In fear for Menelaus thus he spoke Then answer d valiant Diomed and said If my companion I may freely choose How can I pass the sage Ulysses by Of ready wit and dauntless courage prov d In ev ry danger and to Pallas dear I should not fear by him accompanied To pass through fire and safely both return So far in prudence he surpasses all Whom answer d thus Ulysses stout of heart Tydides nor exaggerated praise Bestow on me nor censure for thou speak saint To those who know me all for what I am But go we night wanes fast the morn is near The stars are high in Heav n and of the night Two thirds are spent one third alone remains He said and both prepar d to don their arms The youthful warrior Thrasymedes gave To Diomed a two edg d sword his own Had in the ship been left and ample shield Then on his brows a leathern headpiece plac d Without or peak or plume a simple casque Such as is worn by youths to guard their head A bow and well fill d quiver and a sword Meriones to sage Ulysses gave And on his brows a leathern headpiece plac d Well wrought within with num rous straps secur d And on th outside with wild boars gleaming tusks Profusely garnish d scatter d here and there By skilful hand the midst with felt was lin d This from Amyntor son of Ormenus Autolycus from Eleon bore away Spoil of his pillag d house Autolycus Gave to Amphidamas Cytheran chief Who in Scandea dwelt Amphidamas To Molus pledge of friendship he again Gave to his son Meriones from whom It now encircled sage Ulysses brow Thus with accoutrements and arms supplied They left their brother chiefs and took their way Then close beside their path by Pallas sent Rose on the right a heron through the gloom They saw it not indeed but heard the cry The fav ring sign with joy Ulysses hail d And thus to Pallas pray d Hear me thou child Of aegis bearing Jove who still hast stood In ev ry peril at my side whose eye My ev ry movement sees now Goddess now Befriend me grant that safe with triumph crown d We may return some great exploit achiev d Such as the Trojans long may bear in mind Him following thus the brave Tydides pray d My voice too child of Jove undaunted hear And be with me as with my father erst The godlike Tydeus when to Thebes he went An envoy in advance and left behind Upon Asopus banks the mail clad Greeks Smooth was the message which to Thebes he bore But great his mission ended were the deeds That with thine aid he wrought for Goddess thou Wast with him and thine arm was his defence So be thou now with me and me defend Then on thine altar will I sacrifice A yearling heifer broad of brow untam d Whereon no yoke hath mortal ever laid Her will I give and tip her horns with gold Thus as they pray d their pray r the Goddess heard Then their devotions ended on they far d Through the deep dead of night like lions twain Mid slaughter corpses arms and blacken d gore Nor in the Trojan camp did Hector leave The chiefs to rest but all to conf rence call d The leaders and the councillors of Troy To whom his prudent speech he thus address d Who is there here that for a rich reward A noble work will undertake A car And two strong collar d horses best of all That can be found within the Grecian lines Shall he receive who to his endless praise Shall dare approach the ships and learn if still They keep their wonted watch or by our arms Subdued and vanquished meditate retreat And worn with toil the nightly watch neglect Thus Hector spoke but all in silence heard There was one Dolon in the Trojan camp The herald s son Eumedes rich in gold And brass not fair of face but swift of foot Amid five sisters he the only son Who thus to Hector and the Trojans spoke Hector with dauntless courage I will dare Approach the ships and bring thee tidings sure But hold thou forth thy royal staff and swear That I the horses and the brass bound car Shall have the boast of Peleus matchless son Not vain shall be my errand nor deceive Thy hopes right through the camp I mean to pass To Agamemnon s tent where all the chiefs Debate in council or to fight or fly He said and Hector took his royal staff And swore to him Be witness Jove himself The Lord of thunder that no Trojan man Thyself except shall e er those horses drive For thee they are reserv d a glorious prize Thus Hector swore though unfulfill d the oath The hope to Dolon fresh assurance gave Forthwith his bow across his shoulders slung A grisly wolf skin o er it on his head A cap of marten s fur and in his hand A jav lin from the camp he took his way Straight to the Grecian ships but never thence Destin d to bring th expected tidings back The crowd of men and horses left behind Briskly he mov d along Ulysses first Mark d his approach and to Tydides said See from the camp where some one this way comes With what intent I know not if to play The spy about the ships or rob the dead Turn we aside and let him pass us by A little way we then with sudden rush May seize him or if he outstrip us both By speed of foot may urge him tow rd the ships Driving him still before us with our spears And from the city cutting off his flight Thus saying mid the dead beside the road They crouch d he all unconscious hasten d by But when such space was interpos d as leave Between the sluggish oxen and themselves three A team of mules so much the faster they Through the stiff fallow drag the jointed plough They rush d upon him at the sound he stopp d Deeming that from the Trojan camp they came By Hector sent to order his return Within a spear s length when they came or less For foes he knew them and to night address d His active limbs they rush d in hot pursuit And as two hounds well practis d in the chase With glist ning fangs unflagging strain to catch In woodland glade some pricket deer or hare That flies before them screaming so those two Tydides and Ulysses stout of heart With fiery zeal unflagging strain d to catch The flying Dolon from the camp cut off But when the fugitive approach d the ships Close by the guard fresh vigour Pallas gave To Diomed lest haply from the walls Some other might anticipate his blow And he himself but second honours gain Tydides then with threat ning gesture cried Stop or I hurl my spear and small thy chance If I assail thee of escape from death He said and threw his spear but by design It struck him not above his shoulder flew The polish d lance and quiver d in the ground Sudden he stopp d with panic paralys d His teeth all chatt ring pale with fear he stood With falt ring accents panting they came up And seiz d him in their grasp he thus in tears Spare but my life my life I can redeem For ample stores I have of gold and brass And well wrought iron and of these my sire Would pay a general rous ransom could he learn That in the Grecian ships I yet surviv d To whom Ulysses deep designing thus Be of good cheer nor let the fear of death Disturb thy mind but tell me truly this How is t that tow rd the ships thou com saint alone In the still night when other mortals sleep Com saint thou perchance for plunder of the dead Or seek saint upon our ships to play the spy By Hector sent or of thine own accord Then Dolon thus his knees with terror shook With much persuasion of my better mind Hector beguil d me off ring as my prize Achilles horses and his brass bound car Through the dark night he sent me and enjoin d Ent ring your hostile camp to learn if still Ye keep your wonted watch or by our arms Subdued and vanquish d meditate retreat And worn with toil your nightly watch neglect To whom Ulysses thus with scornful smile High soar d thy hopes indeed that thought to win The horses of Achilles hard are they For mortal man to harness or control Save for Achilles self the Goddess born But tell me truly this when here thou cam saint Where left saint thou Hector guardian chief of Troy Where are his warlike arms his horses where Where lie the rest and where are plac d their guards What are their secret counsels do they mean Here by the ships to keep their ground or back Sated with vict ry to the town return Whom Dolon answer d thus Eumedes son Thy questions all true answers shall receive Hector with those who share his counsels sits In conf rence far apart near Ilus tomb But for the guards thou speak saint of noble chief Not one is station d to protect the camp Around the Trojan fires indeed perforce A watch is kept and they among themselves Due caution exercise but for th Allies They sleep and to the Trojans leave the watch Since nor their children nor their wives are near To whom in answer sage Ulysses thus Say now where sleep they with the Trojans mix d Or separate explain that I may know Whom answer d Dolon thus Eumedes son To this too will I give ye answer true Next to the sea the Carian forces lie The Paeon archers and the Leleges The Caucons and the bold Pelasgians next On Thymbra s side the Lycians lot has fall n The Mysians brave the Phrygian cavalry And the Maeonians with their horsehair plumes But why of these enquire if ye intend An inroad on the camp apart from all New come the farthest off the Thracians lie Rhesus their King the son of Eioneus Sleeps in the midst no steeds that e er I saw For size and beauty can with his compare Whiter than snow and swifter than the wind With gold and silver is his chariot wrought His armour golden of gigantic size A marvel to behold it seems not meet For mortal man but for th immortal Gods But take me now in safety to the ships Or leave me here in fetters bound that so Ere ye return ye may approve my words And see if I have told you true or no To whom thus Diomed with stern regard Dolon though good thy tidings hope not thou Once in our hands to scape the doom of death For if we now should let thee go again In after times thou mightst our ships approach As secret spy or open enemy But if beneath my hands thou lose thy life No farther trouble shalt thou cause the Greeks He said and as the suppliant sought in vain To touch his beard imploring through his throat Both tendons sev ring drove his trenchant blade Ev n while he spoke his head was roll d in dust The cap of marten fur from off his head They took the wolf skin and the bow unstrung And jav lin these Ulysses held aloft And thus to Pallas pray d who gave the spoil Receive great Goddess these our gifts to thee Of all th Immortals on Olympus height Our off rings first we give conduct us now The Thracian camp and Thracian steeds to gain Thus as he spoke amid the tamarisk scrub Far off he threw the trophies then with reeds And twigs new broken from the tamarisk boughs He set a mark lest in the gloom of night Returning they might haply miss the spot Then on they pass d thro arms and blacken d gore And reach d the confines of the Thracian camp There found they all by sleep subdued their arms Beside them on the ground in order due In triple rows and by the side of each Harness d and yok d his horses ready stood Surrounded by his warriors Rhesus slept Beside him stood his coursers fleet their reins Suspended to the chariot s topmost rail Ulysses mark d him as he lay and said This is the man Tydides these the steeds To us by Dolon whom we slew describ d Now then put forth thy might beseems it not To stand thus idly with thine arms in hand Loose thou the horses or do thou the men Despatch and to my care the horses leave He said and Pallas vigour new inspir d That right and left he smote dire were the groans Of slaughter d men the earth was red with blood And as a lion on th untended flock Of sheep or goats with savage onslaught springs Ev n so Tydides on the Thracians sprang Till twelve were slain and as Tydides sword Gave each to death Ulysses by the feet Drew each aside reflecting that perchance The horses startled might refuse to pass The corpses for as yet they knew them not But when Tydides saw the sleeping King A thirteenth victim to his sword was giv n Painfully breathing for by Pallas art He saw that night as in an evil dream The son of OEneus standing o er his head Meanwhile Ulysses sage the horses loos d He gather d up the reins and with his bow For whip was none at hand he drove them forth Then softly whistling to Tydides gave A signal he the while remain d behind Musing what bolder deed he yet might do Whether the seat whereon the arms were laid To draw away or lifted high in air To bear it off in triumph on the car Or on the Thracians farther loss inflict But while he mus d beside him Pallas stood And said Bethink thee Tydeus son betimes Of thy return lest if some other God Should wake the Trojans thou shouldst need to fly She said the heav nly voice he recogniz d And mounted straight the car Ulysses touch d The horses with his bow and urg d to speed They tow rd the ships their rapid course pursued Nor idle watch Apollo kept who saw Tydides o er the plain by Pallas led With anger fill d the Trojan camp he sought And Rhesus kinsman good Hippocoon The Thracian councillor from sleep arous d Awaking when the vacant space he view d Where late had stood the horses and his friends Gasping in death and welt ring in their blood He groan d as on his comrade s name he call d Then loud the clamour rose and wild uproar Unspeakable of Trojans thronging round They marvell d at the deeds but marvell d more How they who wrought them had escap d unscath d Meantime arriv d where Hector s scout they slew Ulysses lov

on The fiery horses nothing loth they flew Nestor first heard the sound and cried O friends The leaders and the councillors of Greece Am I deceiv d or is it true methinks The sound of horses hurrying strikes mine ear Grant Heav n Ulysses and brave Diomed May bring those horses from the Trojan camp Yet much I fear our bravest may have met With some disaster mid the crowd of foes He scarce had ended when themselves appear d And from the car descended welcom d back With cordial grasp of hands and friendly words Gerenian Nestor first enquiring said Tell me renown d Ulysses pride of Greece Whence come these horses from the Trojan camp Or hath some God that met you by the way Bestow d them radiant as the beams of light Among the Trojans day by day I move Tis not my wont old warrior though I be To lag behind but horses such as these I never saw some God hath giv n them sure For Jove the Cloud compeller loves you both And Pallas child of aegis bearing Jove To whom again the sage Ulysses thus O Nestor son of Neleus pride of Greece Had they so will d the Gods so great their pow r E en better horses could have giv n than these But these old man are Thracians newly come Whose King the valiant Diomed hath slain And with him twelve the best of all his band A scout too have we slain by Hector sent And by the Trojan chiefs to spy our camp He said and o er the ditch the horses drove Exulting in their prize and with him went The other chiefs rejoicing through the camp Arriv d at Diomed s well order d tent First with strong halters to the rack where stood High fed with corn his own swift footed steeds The horses they secur d Ulysses then The bloody spoils of Dolon stow d away In the ship s stern till fitting sacrifice To Pallas might be offer d to the sea Descending then they wash d away the sweat Which on their necks and thighs and knees had dried The sweat wash d off and in the ocean waves Themselves refresh d they sought the polish d bath Then by the bath restor d and all their limbs Anointed freely with the lissom oil Sat down to breakfast and from flowing bowls In Pallas honour pour d the luscious wine ARGUMENT THE THIRD BATTLE AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON Agamemnon having armed himself leads the Grecians to battle Hector prepares the Trojans to receive them while Jupiter Juno and Minerva give the signals of war Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is commanded by Jupiter who sends Iris for that purpose to decline the engagement till the king should be wounded and retire from the field He then makes a great slaughter of the enemy Ulysses and Diomed put a stop to him for a time but the latter being wounded by Paris is obliged to desert his companion who is encompassed by the Trojans wounded and in the utmost danger till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him Hector comes against Ajax but that hero alone opposes multitudes and rallies the Greeks In the meantime Machaon in the other wing of the army is pierced with an arrow by Paris and carried from the fight in Nestor s chariot Achilles who overlooked the action from his ship sends Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that manner Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the accidents of the day and a long recital of some former wars which he had remembered tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight for his countrymen or at least to permit him to do it clad in Achilles armour Patroclus in his return meets Eurypylus also wounded and assists in that distress This book opens with the eight and twentieth day of the poem and the same day with its various actions and adventures is extended through the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and part of the eighteenth books The scene lies in the field near the monument of Ilus BOOK XI Now rose Aurora from Tithonus bed To mortals and Immortals bringing light When to the ships of Greece came Discord down Despatch d from Jove with dire portents of war Upon Ulysses lofty ship she stood The midmost thence to shout to either side Or to the tents of Ajax Telamon Or of Achilles who at each extreme Confiding in their strength had moor d their ships There stood the Goddess and in accents loud And dread she call d and fix d in ev ry breast The fierce resolve to wage unwearied war And dearer to their hearts than thoughts of home Or wish d return became the battle field Atrides loudly shouting call d the Greeks To arms himself his flashing armour donn d First on his legs the well wrought greaves he fix d Fasten d with silver clasps his ample chest A breastplate guarded giv n by Cinyras In pledge of friendship for in Cyprus isle He heard the rumour of the glorious fleet About to sail for Troy and sought with gifts To win the favour of the mighty King Ten bands were there inwrought of dusky bronze Twelve of pure gold twice ten of shining tin Of bronze six dragons upwards tow rds the neck Their length extended three on either side In colour like the bow which Saturn s son Plac d in the clouds a sign to mortal men Then o er his shoulder threw his sword bright flash d The golden studs the silver scabbard shone With golden baldrick fitted next his shield He took full siz d well wrought well prov d in fight Around it ran ten circling rims of brass With twenty bosses round of burnish d tin And in the centre one of dusky bronze A Gorgon s head with aspect terrible Was wrought with Fear and Flight encircled round Depending from a silver belt it hung And on the belt a dragon wrought in bronze Twin d his lithe folds and turn d on ev ry side Sprung from a single neck his triple head Then on his brow his lofty helm he plac d Four crested double peak d with horsehair plumes That nodded fearful from the warrior s head Then took two weighty lances tipp d with brass Which fiercely flash d against the face of Heav n Pallas and Juno thund ring from on high In honour of Mycenae s wealthy lord Forthwith they order d each his charioteer To

between But Jove with dire confusion fill d their ranks Who sent from Heav n a show r of blood stain d rain In sign of many a warrior s coming doom Soon to the viewless shades untimely sent Meanwhile upon the slope beneath the plain The Trojan chiefs were gather d Hector s self Polydamas AEneas as a God In reverend rence held Antenor s three brave sons Agenor s godlike presence Polybus And heav

So now in front was Hector seen and now Pass d to the rear exhorting all in brass His burnish d arms like Jove s own lightning flash d As in the corn land of some wealthy Lord The rival bands of reapers mow the swathe Barley or wheat and fast the trusses fall So Greeks and Trojans mow d th opposing ranks Nor these admitted thought of faint retreat But still made even head while those like wolves Rush d to the onset Discord Goddess dire Beheld rejoicing of the heav nly pow rs She only mingled with the combatants The others all were absent they serene Repos d in gorgeous palaces for each Amid Olympus deep recesses built Yet all the cloud girt son of Saturn blam d Who will d the vict ry to the arms of Troy He heeded not their anger but withdrawn Apart from all in pride of conscious strength Survey d the walls of Troy the ships of Greece The flash of arms the slayers and the slain While yet twas morn and wax d the youthful day Thick flew the shafts and fast the people fell On either side but when the hour was come When woodmen in the forest s deep recess Prepare their food and wearied with the toil Of felling loftiest trees with aching arms Turn with keen relish to their midday meal Then Grecian valour broke th opposing ranks As each along the line encourag d each First sprang the monarch Agamemnon forth And brave Bienor slew his people s guard And with the chief his friend and charioteer Oileus he down leaping from the car Stood forth defiant but between his brows The monarch s spear was thrust nor aught avail d The brass bound helm to stay the weapon s point Through helm and bone it pass d and all the brain Was shatter d forward as he rush d he fell Them left he there their bare breasts gleaming white Stripp d of their arms and hasten d in pursuit Of Antiphus and Isus Priam s sons A bastard one and one legitimate Both on one car the bastard held the reins Beside him stood the gallant Antiphus Them as they fed their flocks on Ida s heights Achilles once had captive made and bound With willow saplings till for ransom freed The mighty monarch Agamemnon drove Through Isus breast his spear his weighty sword Descended on the head of Antiphus Beside the ear and hurl d him from his car These of their armour he despoil d in haste Known to him both for he had seen them oft Beside the ships when thither captive brought From Ida by Achilles swift of foot As when a lion in their lair hath seiz d The helpless offspring of a mountain doe And breaks their bones with ease and with strong teeth Crushes their tender life nor can their dam Though close at hand she be avail them aught For she herself by deadly terror seiz d Through the thick coppice and the forest flies Panting and bath d in sweat the monster s rush So dar d no Trojan give those brethren aid Themselves in terror of the warlike Greeks Peisander next and bold Hippolochus Sons of Antimachus twas he who chief Seduc d by Paris gold and splendid gifts Advis d the restitution to

Atreus suppliant in the car They clasp d his knees Give quarter Atreus son Redeem our lives our sire Antimachus Possesses goodly store of brass and gold And well wrought iron and of these he fain Would pay a noble ransom could he hear That in the Grecian ships we yet surviv d Thus they with gentle words and tears imploring But all ungentle was the voice they heard In answer If indeed ye be the sons Of that Antimachus who counsel gave When noble Menelaus came to Troy With sage Ulysses as ambassadors To slay them both nor suffer their return Pay now the forfeit of your father s guilt He said and with a spear thrust through his breast Peisander dash d to earth backward he fell Down leap d Hippolochus but Atreus son Severing his hands and neck amid the throng Sent whirling like a bowl the gory head These left he there and where the thickest throng Maintain d the tug of war thither he flew And with him eager hosts of well greav d Greeks Soon on the Trojans flight enforc d they hung Destroying foot on foot and horse on horse While from the plain thick clouds of dust arose Beneath the armed hoofs of clatt ring steeds And on the monarch Agamemnon press d Still slaying urging still the Greeks to arms As when amid a densely timber d wood Light the devouring flames by eddying winds Hither and thither borne fast falls the copse Prostrate beneath the fire s impetuous course So thickly fell the flying Trojans heads Beneath the might of Agamemnon s arm And here and there athwart the pass of war Was many an empty car at random whirl d By strong neck d steeds of guiding hands bereft Stretch d on the plain they lay more welcome sight To carrion birds than to their widow d wives But Hector from the fray and din of war And dust and blood and carnage Jove withdrew Still on Atrides press d the Greek pursuit With eager shouts exciting past the tomb Of Ilus ancient son of Dardanus And tow rd the fig tree midway o er the plain Straining to gain the town the Trojans fled While loudly shouting his unconquer d hands With carnage dyed Atrides urg d their flight But when the Scaean gates and oak were reach d They made a stand and fac d the foe s assault Some o er the open plain were yet dispers d As heifers by a lion scatter d wide At dead of night all fly on one descends The doom of death her with his pow rful teeth He seizes and her neck first broken rends And on her entrails gorging laps her blood So these the monarch Agamemnon chas d Slaying the hindmost they in terror fled Some headlong backward some Atrides hand Hurl d from their chariot many a warrior bold So forward and so fierce he bore his spear But as he near d the city and stood beneath The lofty wall the Sire of Gods and men From Heav n descended on the topmost height Of Ida s spring abounding hill he sat And while his hand the lightning grasp d he thus To golden winged Iris gave command Haste thee swift Iris and to Hector bear From me this message bid him that as long As Agamemnon in the van appears Raging and dealing death among the ranks He from the battle keep himself aloof But urge the rest undaunted to maintain The stubborn fight but should Atrides struck By spear or arrow to his car withdraw He shall from me receive such pow r to slay As to the ships shall bear him ere the sun Decline and Darkness spread her hallowing shade Thus he to Troy obedient to his word From Ida s heights swift footed Iris sped Amid the horses and the well fram d cars The godlike Hector Priam s son she found And stood beside him and address d him thus Hector thou son of Priam sage as Jove In council he the Universal Lord Sends thee by me this message that as long As Agamemnon in the van appears Raging and dealing death amid the ranks Thou from the battle keep thyself aloof But urge the rest undaunted to maintain The stubborn fight but should Atrides struck By spear or arrow to his car withdraw Thou shalt from him receive such pow r to slay As to the ships shall bear thee ere the sun Decline and Darkness spread her hallowing shade Swift footed Iris said and disappear d But from his chariot Hector leap d to earth Hither and thither passing through the ranks With brandish d jav lins urging to the fight Loud at his bidding rose the battle cry Back roll d the tide again they fac d the Greeks On th other side the Greeks their masses form d In line of battle rang d opposed they stood And in the front to none content to cede The foremost place was Agamemnon seen Say now ye Nine who on Olympus dwell Of all the Trojans and their fam d Allies Who first oppos d to Agamemnon stood Iphidamas Antenor s gallant son Stalwart and brave in fertile Thracia bred Mother of flocks him in his infant years His grandsire Cisseus fair Theano s sire In his own palace rear d and when he reach

beaked ships he sailed That owned his sway these on Percote s shore He left and came himself on foot to Troy Who now confronted Atreus godlike son When near they drew Atrides miss d his aim His spear diverging then Iphidamas Beneath the breastplate striking on his belt Strove with strong hand to drive the weapon home Yet could not pierce the belt s close plaited work The point encounter d by the silver fold Was bent like lead then with his pow rful hand The monarch Agamemnon seiz d the spear And tow rd him drew and with a lion s strength Wrench d from his foeman s grasp then on his neck Let fall his sword and slack d his limbs in death There falling in his country s cause he slept The iron sleep of death unhappy he Far from his virgin bride yet unpossess d Though bought with costly presents first he gave A hundred steers and promis d thousands more Of sheep and goats from out his countless flocks Him Agamemnon of his arms despoil d And to the crowd of Greeks the trophies bore But when Antenor s eldest born beheld Coon th observ d of all men bitt rest grief His eyes o ershadow d for his brother s fate And unperceiv d by Atreus godlike son Standing aside he struck him with his spear Through the mid arm beneath the elbow s bend And drove right through the weapon s glitt ring point Writh d with the pain the mighty King of men Yet from the combat flinch d he not nor quail

Beneath the bossy shield the monarch thrust His brass clad spear and slack d his limbs in death Then near approaching ev n upon the corpse Of dead Iphidamas struck off his head So by Atrides hand Antenor s sons Their doom accomplish d to the shades were sent Then through the crowded ranks with spear and sword And massive stones he held his furious course While the hot blood was welling from his arm But when the wound was dry and stanch d the blood Keen anguish then Atrides might subdued As when a woman in her labour throes Sharp pangs encompass by Lucina sent Who rules o er child birth travail ev n so keen The pangs that then Atrides might subdued Mounting his car he bade his charioteer Drive to the ships for sore his spirit was pain d But loud and clear he shouted to the Greeks O friends the chiefs and councillors of Greece Yours be it now our sea borne ships to guard Since Jove the Lord of counsel through the day Wills not that I the battle should maintain He said and swiftly to the ships were driv n His sleek skinn d coursers nothing loth they flew With foam their chests were fleck d with dust their flanks As from the field their wounded Lord they bore But Hector as he saw the King retire To Trojans and to Lycians call d aloud Trojans and Lycians and ye Dardans fam d In close encounter quit ye now like men Put forth your wonted valour from the field Their bravest has withdrawn and Jove on me Great glory hath shed now headlong on the Greeks Urge your swift steeds and endless honour gain His words fresh courage rous d in ev ry breast And as a hunter cheers his

Opites and Opheltius Dolops son Of Clytus and AEsumnus Agelas And Orus and brave Hipponous All these the chiefs of Greece the nameless crowd He scatter d next as when the west wind drives The clouds and battles with the hurricane Before the clearing blast of Notus driv n The big waves heave and roll and high aloft The gale careering flings the ocean spray So thick and furious fell on hostile heads The might of Hector Now had fearful deeds Been done and Greeks beside their ships had fall n In shameful rout had not Ulysses thus To Diomed the son of Tydeus call d Why son of Tydeus should we thus relax Our warlike courage come stand by me now True friend if Hector of the glancing helm Our ships should capture great were our disgrace Whom answer d thus the valiant Diomed Beside thee will I stand and still endure But brief will be the term of our success Since Jove the Cloud compeller not to us But to the Trojans wills the victory He said and from his car Thymbraeus hurl d Through the left breast transfix d Ulysses hand His charioteer the brave Molion slew These left they there no more to share the fight Then turning spread confusion mid the crowd As turn two boars upon the hunter s pack With desp rate courage turning so to bay Those two the Trojans scatt ring gave the Greeks From Hector flying time again to breathe A car they seiz d which bore two valiant chiefs Sons of Percotian Merops he o er all In lore prophetic skill d would fain at home Have kept them from the life destroying war But they by adverse fate impell d to seek Their doom of death his warning voice despis d These two of strength and life at once bereft The son of Tydeus valiant Diomed Stripp d of their armour while Ulysses slew Hippodamus and bold Hyperochus Thus Jove from Ida s height beholding held His even scale each party slaught ring each Then with his spear Tydides through the loins Agastrophus the son of Paeon smote No car had he at hand whereto to fly But ill advis d had in th attendants charge His horses left far off while he himself Rush d mid the throng on foot and met his doom Hector s quick glance athwart the files beheld And to the rescue with a shout he sprang The Trojan columns following not unmov d The valiant Diomed his coming saw And thus bespoke Ulysses at his side On us this plague this mighty Hector falls Yet stand we firm and boldly meet the shock He said and poising hurl d his pond rous spear And not in vain on Hector s head it struck His helmet s crest but brass encount ring brass Himself it reach d not for the visor d helm Apollo s gift three plated stay d its force Yet backward Hector sprang amid the crowd And on his knees he dropp d his stalwart hand Propp d on the ground while darkness veil d his eyes But ere Tydides following up his spear Attain d from far the spot whereon he fell Hector reviv d and mounting quick his car Drove mid the crowd and scap d the doom of death Then thus with threat ning spear Tydides cried Yet once again vile hound hast thou escap d Thy doom was nigh but thee thy God hath sav d Phoebus to whom amid the clash of spears Well mayst thou pray We yet shall meet again When I shall end thee if a guardian God I too may claim meanwhile from thee I turn And others seek on whom my hap may light He said and turn d him of his arms to strip The son of Paeon but beside the stone That mark d where men of old had rais d a mound To Ilus Dardan s son the ancient chief There crouching Paris fair hair d Helen s Lord Against the son of Tydeus bent his bow He from the breast of brave Agastrophus Had

sland rer and seducer if indeed Thou durst in arms oppos d to me to stand Nought would avail thy arrows and thy bow And now because thy shaft hath graz d my foot Thou mak saint thine empty boast I heed thee not More than a woman or a puny child A worthless coward s weapon hath no point Tis diff rent far with me though light it fall My spear is sharp and whom it strikes it slays His widow s cheeks are mark d with scars of grief His children orphans rotting on the ground Red with his blood he lies his fun ral rites By carrion birds and not by women paid Thus while he spoke Ulysses spearman bold Drew near and stood before him he behind Sat down protected and from out his foot The arrow drew whereat sharp anguish shot Through all his flesh and mounting on his car He bade his faithful charioteer in haste Drive to the ships for pain weigh d down his soul Alone Ulysses stood of all the Greeks Not one beside him all were panic struck Then with his spirit perturb d he commun d thus Me miserable which way shall I choose Twere ill indeed that I should turn to flight By hostile numbers daunted yet twere worse Here to be caught alone and Saturn s son With panic fear the other Greeks hath fill d Yet why my soul admit such thoughts as these I know that cowards from the battle fly But he who boasts a warrior s name must learn Wounded or wounding firmly still to stand While in his mind and spirit thus he mus d Onward the buckler d ranks of Trojans came And to their harm encircled him around As when a boar by dogs and stalwart youths Attack d the shelt ring thicket leaves and whets The tusks that gleam between his curved jaws They crowd around though ring his clatt ring tusks And fearful though it be await his rush So crowded round Ulysses dear to Jove The Trojans he with brandish d spear aloft Sprang forth and through the shoulder from above Deiopites wounded Thoon next He slew and Ennomus then with his spear Chersidamas in act to quit his car Thrust through the loins below his bossy shield Prone in the dust he clutch d the blood stain d soil From these he turn d and wounded with his spear Charops the high born Socus brother son Of Hippasus then forward sprang to aid His brother godlike Socus close he stood Before Ulysses and address d him thus Far fam d Ulysses as in arms in wiles Unwearied thou this day o er both the sons Of Hippasus two mighty warriors slain And of their armour spoil d shalt make thy boast Or by my spear thyself shalt lose thy life He said and on the shield s broad circle struck Through the bright shield the sturdy weapon drove And through the rich wrought baldrick from the ribs Tearing the flesh away but Pallas seiz d And turn d it from the vital parts aside The wound Ulysses knew was not to death And back he drew and thus to Socus cried Ill fated thou thy doom hath found thee now Me hast thou hinder d from the war awhile But thee to swift destruction and dark death This day I doom great glory of thee subdued Shall I obtain and Hades take thy soul Thus he and Socus turning sought to fly But as he turn d him round Ulysses spear Behind his neck between the shoulder blades Was driv n and through his chest thund ring he fell And o er his fall Ulysses vaunting thus Socus thou son of warlike Hippasus Here hast thou found nor couldst escape thy doom Ill fated thou nor sire s nor mother s hand Shall gather up thy bones but carrion birds O er thee shall flap their baleful wings and tear Thy mangled flesh for me whene er I die The sons of Greece will build my fun ral pile From out his flesh and from the bossy

retiring shouted loud To call his comrades loud as head of man Could bear he shouted thrice and thrice his shout The warlike Menelaus heard and thus To Ajax standing by his side he spoke Ajax thou Heav n born son of Telamon Great chief of men methinks I hear the voice Of stout Ulysses as though left alone And in the stubborn fight cut off from aid By Trojans overmaster d Haste we then For so twere best to give him present aid Brave though he be yet left alone I fear Great cause we Greeks may have to mourn his loss He spoke and led the way the godlike chief Follow d his steps Ulysses dear to Jove Surrounded by the Trojan host they found As hungry jackals on the mountain side Around a stag that from an archer s hand Hath taken hurt yet while his blood was warm And limbs yet serv d has baffled his pursuit But when the fatal shaft has drain d his strength Thirsting for blood beneath the forest shade The jackals seize their victim then if chance A hungry lion pass the jackals shrink In terror back while he devours the prey So round Ulysses sage in council press d The Trojans many and brave yet nobly he Averted spear in hand the fatal hour Till with his tow r like shield before

car drew near Then Ajax on the Trojans springing slew Doryclus royal Priam s bastard son Next Pyrasus he smote and Pandocus Lysander and Pylartes as a stream Swoll n by the rains of Heav n that from the hills Pours down its wintry torrent on the plain And many a blighted oak and many a pine It bears with piles of drift wood to the sea So swept illustrious Ajax o er the plain O erthrowing men and horses though unknown To Hector he upon Scamander s banks Was warring on the field s extremest left Where round great Nestor and the warlike King Idomeneus while men were falling fast Rose irrepressible the battle cry Hector mid these was working wondrous deeds With spear and car routing th opposed youth Yet had the Greeks ev n so their ground maintain d But godlike Paris fair hair d Helen s Lord Through the right shoulder with a three barb d shaft As in the front he fought Machaon quell d For him the warrior Greeks were sore afraid Lest he as back the line of battle roll d Might

drew near and said Hector we here on th outskirts of the field O erpow r the Greeks on th other side our friends In strange confusion mingled horse and man Are driv n among them Ajax spreads dismay

the battle cry He said and with the pliant lash he touch d The sleek skinn d horses springing at the sound Between the Greeks and Trojans light they bore The flying car o er bodies of the slain And broken bucklers trampling all beneath Was plash d with blood the axle and the rails Around the car as from the horses feet And from the felloes of the wheels were thrown The bloody gouts yet on he sped to join The strife of men and break th opposing ranks His coming spread confusion mid the Greeks His spear awhile withheld then through the rest With sword and spear and pond rous stones he rush

fell midway on the plain Fix d in the ground in vain athirst for blood Him thus hard press d by thick thrown spears beheld Eurypylus Euaemon s noble son He hasten d up and aim d his glitt ring spear

stoop d From Apisaon s corpse to strip his arms Against Eurypylus he bent his bow And his right thigh transfix d the injur d limb Disabling in the wound the arrow broke He mid his friends escaping death withdrew And to the Greeks with piercing shout he call d O friends the chiefs and councillors of Greece Turn yet again and from the doom of death Great Ajax save hard press d by hostile spears Scarce can I hope he may escape with life The desp rate fight yet bravely stand and aid The mighty Ajax son of Telamon Thus spoke the wounded hero round him they With sloping shields and spears

Nestor and Machaon from the field Achilles saw and mark d them where he stood Upon his lofty vessel s prow and watch d The grievous toil the lamentable rout Then on his friend Patroclus from the ship He call d aloud he heard his voice and forth As Mars majestic from the tent he came That day commenc d his evil destiny And thus Menoetius noble son began Why call saint thou me what wouldst thou Peleus son To whom Achilles swift of foot replied Son of Menoetius dearest to my soul Soon must the suppliant Greeks before me kneel So insupportable is now their need But haste thee now Patroclus dear to Jove Enquire of Nestor from the battle field Whom brings he wounded looking from behind Most like he seem d to AEsculapius son Machaon but his face I could not see So swiftly past the eager

how stern his mood Nay sometimes blames he where no blame is due To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied Whence comes Achilles pity for the Greeks By Trojan weapons wounded knows he not What depth of

and bade us sit Dispensing all the hospitable rites With food and wine recruited I began My speech and urg d ye both to join the war Nor were ye loth to go much sage advice Your elders gave old Peleus bade his son To aim at highest honours and surpass His comrades all Menoetius Actor s son To thee this counsel gave My son he said Achilles is by birth above thee far Thou art in years the elder he in strength Surpasses thee do thou with prudent words And timely speech address him and advise And guide him he will to his good obey Such were the old man s words but thou hast let His counsel slip thy mem ry yet ev n now Speak to Achilles thus and stir his soul If haply he will hear thee and who knows But by the grace of Heav n thou mayst prevail For great is oft a friend s persuasive pow r But if the fear of evil prophesied Or message by his Goddess mother brought From Jove restrain him let him send thee forth With all his force of warlike Myrmidons That thou mayst be the saving light of Greece Then let him bid thee to the battle bear His glitt ring arms if so the men of Troy Scar d by his likeness may forsake the field And breathing time afford the sons of Greece Toil worn for little pause has yet been theirs Fresh and unwearied ye with ease may drive To their own city from our ships and tents The Trojans worn and battle wearied men Thus he Patroclus spirit within him burn d And tow rd Achilles tent in haste he sped But running as Ulysses ship he pass d Where was the Council and the Justice seat And where were built the altars of the Gods There met him halting from the battle field Shot through the thigh Euaemon s Heav n born son Eurypylus his head and shoulders dank With clammy sweat while from his grievous wound Stream d the dark blood yet firm was still his soul Menoetius noble son with pity saw And deeply sorrowing thus address d the chief Woe for the chiefs and councillors of Greece And must ye far from friends and native home Glut with your flesh the rav

Heav n born Patroclus have the Greeks Of aid but all must perish by their ships For in the ships lie all our bravest late By spear or arrow struck by Trojan hands And fiercer hour by hour their onset

lay reclin d Patroclus with his dagger from the thigh Cut out the biting shaft and from the wound With tepid water cleans d the clotted blood Then pounded in his hands a root applied Astringent anodyne which all his pain Allay d the wound was dried and stanch d the blood ARGUMENT THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL The Greeks having retired into their entrenchments Hector attempts to force them but it proving impossible to pass the ditch Polydamas advises to quit their chariots and manage the attack on foot The Trojans follow his counsel and having divided their army into five bodies of foot begin the assault But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons which appeared on the left hand of the Trojans Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again This Hector opposes and continues the attack in which after many actions Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall Hector also casting a stone of a vast size forces open one of the gates and enters at the head of his troops who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to their ships BOOK XII Thus o er the wounded chief Eurypylus Watch d in his tent Menoetius noble son But hand to hand the Greeks and Trojans fought Nor longer might the ditch th assault repel Nor the broad wall above which Greeks had built To guard their ships and round it dug the ditch But to the Gods no hecatombs had paid That they the ships and all the stores within Might safely keep against the will of Heav n The work was done and thence not long endur d While Hector liv d and Peleus son his wrath Retain d and Priam s city untaken stood So long the Grecian wall remain d entire But of the Trojans when the best had fall n Of Greeks when some were slain some yet surviv d When the tenth year had seen the fall of Troy And Greeks embark d had ta en their homeward way Then Neptune and Apollo counsel took To sap the wall by aid of all the streams That seaward from the heights of Ida flow Rhesus Caresus and Heptaporus Granicus and AEsepus Rhodius Scamander s stream divine and Simois Where helms and shields lay buried in the sand And a whole race of warrior demigods These all Apollo to one channel turn d Nine days against the wall the torrent beat And Jove sent rain continuous that the wall Might sooner be submerg d while Neptune s self His trident in his hand led on the stream Washing away the deep foundations laid Laborious by the Greeks with logs and stones Now by fast flowing Hellespont dispers d The wall destroy d o er all the shore he spread A sandy drift and bade the streams return To where of old their silver waters flow d Such were in future days to be the works Of Neptune and Apollo but meanwhile Fierce rag d the battle round the firm built wall And frequent clatter d on the turrets beams The hostile missiles by the scourge of Jove Subdued the Greeks beside their ships were hemm d By Hector scar d fell minister of Dread Who with the whirlwind s force as ever fought As when by dogs and hunters circled round A boar or lion in his pride of strength Turns on his foes while they in close array Stand opposite and frequent shoot their darts Nor yet his spirit quails but firm he stands With suicidal courage swift he turns Where best to break the circling ranks where er He makes his rush the circling ranks give way So Hector here and there amid the crowd Urg d his companions on to cross the ditch The fiery steeds shrank back and snorting stood Upon the topmost brink for the wide ditch Withheld them easy nor to leap nor cross For steep arose on either side the banks And at the top with sharpen d stakes were crown d Thick set and strong which there the sons of Greece Had planted to repel th invading foes Scarce might a horse with well wheel d car attach d Essay the passage but on foot they burn d To make th attempt and thus Polydamas Approaching near to valiant Hector spoke Hector and all ye other chiefs of Troy And brave Allies in vain we seek to drive Our horses o er the ditch tis hard to cross Tis crown d with pointed stakes and them behind Is built the Grecian wall there to descend And from our cars in narrow space to fight Were certain ruin If it be indeed The will of Jove high thund ring to confound The Greeks in utter rout and us to aid I should rejoice that ev ry Greek forthwith Far from his home should fill a nameless grave But should they turn and we again be driv n Back from the ships and hurried down the ditch Such were our loss that scarce a messenger Would live to bear the tidings to the town Of our destruction by the rallied Greeks Hear then my counsel let us all agree With our attendants here upon the bank To leave our horses and ourselves on foot All arm d press on where Hector leads the Greeks If that their doom be nigh will make no stand Thus spoke Polydamas his counsel pleas d And Hector sprang in arms from off his car Nor long the noble Hector when they saw Delay d the other chiefs then gave command Each to his own attendant by the ditch To keep the chariots all in due array Then parting form d in order of attack In five divisions with their sev ral chiefs Round Hector throng d and bold Polydamas The best and bravest they who long d the most To storm the wall and fight beside the ships With them Cebriones for Hector left To guard the horses one of lesser note The nest division was by Paris led Agenor and Alcathous the third By Helenus and brave Deiphobus Two sons of Priam Asius was the third Asius the son of Hyrtacus who brought His tow ring fiery steeds from Selles stream Hard by Arisba stout AEneas led The fourth Anchises son Archilochus With him and Acamas Antenor s sons Both skill d alike in ev ry point of war Of the far fam d Allies Sarpedon held The chief command and for his comrades chose Asteropaeus and the warlike might Of Glaucus these o er all the rest he held Pre eminent in valour save himself Who o er them all superior stood confess d These interlac d their shields of tough bull s hide With eager step advanc d and deem d the Greeks Would unresisting fall before their ships The other Trojans and renown d Allies The words of wise Polydamas obey d But Asius son of Hyrtacus refus d His horses and his charioteer to leave With them advancing to assail the ships Blind fool unconscious from before those ships Escap d from death with horses and with car Triumphant to the breezy heights of Troy He never shall return ill omen d fate O ershadowing dooms him by the spear to fall Of brave Idomeneus Deucalion s son He tow rd the left inclin d what way the Greeks With horse and chariot from the plain return d That way he drove his horses and the gates Unguarded found by bolt or massive bar Their warders held them open d wide to save Perchance some comrade flying from the plain Thither he bent his course with clamours loud Follow d his troops nor deem d they that the Greeks Would hold their ground but fall amid their ships Little they knew before the gates they found Two men two warriors of the prime two sons Illustrious of the spear skill d Lapithae Stout Polypoetes one Pirithous son With whom Leonteus bold as blood stain d Mars So stood these two before the lofty gates As on the mountain side two tow ring oaks Which many a day have borne the wind and storm Firm rifted by their strong continuous roots So in their arms and vigour confident Those two great Asius charge undaunted met On th other side with shouts and wild uproar Their bull s hide shields uplifted high advanc d Against the well built wall Asius the King Iamenus Orestes Acamas The son of Asius and OEnomaus And Thoon those within to save the ships Calling meanwhile on all the well greav d Greeks But when they saw the wall by Trojans scal d And heard the cry of Greeks in panic fear Sprang forth those two before the gates to fight As when two boars upon the mountain side Await th approaching din of men and dogs Then sideways rushing snap the wood around Ripp d from the roots loud clash their clatt ring tusks Till to the huntsman s spear they yield their lives So clatter d on those champions brass clad breasts The hostile weapons stubbornly they fought Relying on their strength and friends above For from the well built tow rs huge stones were hurl d By those who for themselves their tents and ships Maintain d defensive warfare thick they fell As wintry snow flakes which the boist rous wind Driving the shadowy clouds spreads fast and close O er all the surface of the fertile earth So thick from Grecian and from Trojan hands The weapons flew on helm and bossy shield With grating sound the pond rous masses rang Then deeply groaning as he smote his thigh Thus spoke dismay d the son of Hyrtacus O Father Jove how hast thou lov d our hopes To falsify who deem d not that the Greeks Would stand our onset and resistless arms But they as yellow banded wasps or bees That by some rocky pass have built their nests Abandon not their cavern d home but wait Th attack and boldly for their offspring fight So from the gates these two though two alone Retire not till they be or ta en or slain He said but Jove regarded not his words So much on Hector s triumph he was bent Like battle rag d round th other gates but hard It were for me with godlike pow r to paint Each sev ral combat for around the wall A more than human storm of stone was pour d On ev ry side the Greeks hard press d perforce Fought for their ships while all the Gods look d on Indignant who the Grecian cause upheld Fiercely the Lapithae sustain d the war Stout Polypoetes first Pirithous son Smote through the brass cheek d helmet Damasus Nor stay d the brazen helm the spear whose point Went crashing through the bone that all the brain Was shatter d onward as he rush d he fell Then Pylon next and Ormenus he slew Meantime Leonteus scion true of Mars Struck with unerring spear Hippomachus Son of Antimachus below the waist Then drawing from the sheath his trenchant sword Dash d through the crowd and hand to hand he smote Antiphates he backward fell to earth Menon Iamenus Orestes next In quick succession to the ground he brought From these while they their glitt ring armour stripp d Round Hector throng d and bold Polydamas The bravest and the best who long d the most To storm the wall and burn with fire the ships Yet on the margin of the ditch they paus d For as they sought to cross a sign from Heav n Appear d to leftward of th astonish d crowd A soaring eagle in his talons bore A dragon huge of size of blood red hue Alive and breathing still nor yet subdued For twisting backward through the breast he pierc d His bearer near the neck he stung with pain Let fall his prey which dropp d amid the crowd Then screaming on the blast was borne away The Trojans shudd ring in their midst beheld The spotted serpent dire portent of Jove Then to bold Hector thus Polydamas Hector in council thou reprov saint me oft For good advice it is not meet thou say saint That private men should talk beside the mark In council or in war but study still Thine honour to exalt yet must I now Declare what seems to me the wisest course Let us not fight the Greeks beside their ships For thus I read the future if indeed To us about to cross this sign from Heav n Was sent to leftward of th astonish d crowd A soaring eagle bearing in his claws A dragon huge of size of blood red hue Alive yet dropp d him ere he reach d his home Nor to his nestlings bore th intended prey So we e en though our mighty strength should break The gates and wall and put the Greeks to rout By the same road not scatheless should return But many a Trojan on the field should leave Slain by the Greeks while they their ships defend So would a seer well vers d in augury Worthy of public credit read this sign To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm Replied with stern regard Polydamas This speech of thine is alien to my soul Thy better judgment better counsel knows But if in earnest such is thine advice Thee of thy senses have the Gods bereft Who fain wouldst have us disregard the word And promise by the nod of Jove confirm d And put our faith in birds expanded wings Little of these I reck nor care to look If to the right and tow rd the morning sun Or to the left and shades of night they fly Put we our trust in Jove s eternal will Of mortals and Immortals King supreme The best of omens is our country s cause Why shouldst thou tremble at the battle strife Though ev ry Trojan else were doom d to die Beside the ships no fear lest thou shouldst fall Unwarlike is thy soul nor firm of mood But if thou shrink or by thy craven words Turn back another Trojan from the fight My spear shall take the forfeit of thy life This said he led the way with joyous shouts They follow d all then Jove the lightning s Lord From Ida s heights a storm of wind sent down Driving the dust against the Grecian ships Which quell d their courage and to Hector gave And to the Trojans fresh incitement they On their own strength and heav nly signs relying Their force address d to storm the Grecian wall They raz d the counterscarp the battlements Destroy d and the projecting buttresses Which to sustain the tow rs the Greeks had fix d Deep in the soil with levers undermin d These once withdrawn they hop d to storm the wall Nor from the passage yet the Greeks withdrew But closely fencing with their bull s hide shields The broken battlements they thence hurl d down A storm of weapons on the foe beneath Commanding from the tow r in ev ry place Were seen th Ajaces urging to the fight Imploring these and those in sterner tones Rebuking who their warlike toil relax d Friends Grecians all ye who excel in war And ye of mod rate or inferior strength Though all are not with equal pow rs endued Yet here is work for all bear this in mind Nor tow rd the ships let any turn his face By threats dismay d but forward press and each Encourage each if so the lightning s Lord Olympian Jove may grant us to repel And backward to his city chase the foe Thus they with cheering words sustain d the war Thick as the snow flakes on a wintry day When Jove the Lord of counsel down on men His snow storm sends and manifests his pow r Hush d are the winds the flakes continuous fall That the high mountain tops and jutting crags And lotus cover d meads are buried deep And man s productive labours of the field On hoary Ocean s beach and bays they lie Th approaching waves their bound o er all beside Is spread by Jove the heavy veil of snow So thickly new the stones from either side By Greeks on Trojans hurl d by these on Greeks And clatter d loud through all its length the wall Nor yet the Trojans though by Hector led The gates had broken and the massive bar But Jove against the Greeks sent forth his son Sarpedon as a lion on a herd His shield s broad orb before his breast he bore Well wrought of beaten brass which th arm rer s hand Had beaten out and lin d with stout bull s hide With golden rods continuous all around He thus equipp d two jav lins brandishing Strode onward as a lion mountain bred Whom fasting long his dauntless courage leads To assail the flock though in well guarded fold And though the shepherds there he find prepar d With dogs and lances to protect the sheep Not unattempted will he leave the fold But springing to the midst he bears his prey In triumph thence or in the onset falls Wounded by jav lins hurl

that in Lycian land We two at feasts the foremost seats may claim The largest portions and the fullest cups Why held as Gods in honour why endow d With ample heritage by Xanthus banks Of vineyard and

Allegiance they on richest viands feed Of luscious flavour drink the choicest wine But still their valour brightest shows and they Where Lycians war are foremost in the fight O friend if we survivors of this war Could live from age and death for ever free Thou shouldst not see me foremost in the fight Nor would I urge thee to the glorious field But since on man ten thousand forms of death Attend which none may scape then on that we May glory on others gain or they on us Thus he nor Glaucus from his bidding shrank And forward straight they led the Lycian pow rs Menestheus son of Peteus with dismay Observ d their movement for on his command Inspiring terror their attack was made He look d around him to the Grecian tow rs If any chief might there be found to save His comrades from

clatt ring shields and horsehair crested helms And batter d gates now all at once assail d Before them fiercely strove th assaulting bands To break their way he then Thootes sent His herald to th Ajaces craving aid Haste thee Thootes on th Ajaces call Both if it may be so we best may hope To scape the death which else is near at hand So fierce the pressure of the Lycian chiefs Undaunted now as ever in the fight But if they too are hardly press d at least Let Ajax son of Telamon be spar d And with him Teucer skilled to draw the bow He said the herald heard and straight obey d Along the wall where stood the brass clad Greeks He ran and standing near th Ajaces said Ajaces leaders of the brass clad Greeks The son of Heav n born Peteus craves your aid To share awhile the labours of his guard Both if it may be so he best may hope To scape the death which else is near at hand So fierce the pressure of the Lycian chiefs Undaunted now as ever in the fight But if ye too are hardly press d at

Greeks the struggle to maintain While I go yonder to affront the war To aid their need and back return in haste Thus saying Ajax Telamon set forth And with him Teucer went his father s son While by Pandion Teucer s bow was borne At brave Menestheus tow r within the wall Arriv d sore press d they found the garrison For like a whirlwind on the ramparts pour d The Lycians valiant councillors and chiefs They quickly join d the fray and loud arose The battle cry first Ajax Telamon Sarpedon s comrade brave Epicles slew Struck by a rugged stone within the wall Which lay the topmost of the parapet Of size prodigious which with both his hands A man in youth s full vigour scarce could raise As men are now he lifted it on high And downward hurl d the four peak d helm it broke Crushing the bone and shatt ring all the skull He like a diver from the lofty tow r Fell headlong down and life forsook his bones Teucer meanwhile from off the lofty wall The valiant Glaucus pressing to the fight Struck with an arrow where he saw his arm Unguarded he no longer brook d the fray Back from the wall he sprang in hopes to hide From Grecian eyes his wound that none might see And triumph o er him with insulting words With grief Sarpedon saw his friend withdraw Yet not relax d his efforts Thestor s son Alcmaon with his spear he stabb d and back The weapon drew he following prostrate fell And loudly rang his arms of polish d brass Then at the parapet with stalwart hand Sarpedon tugg d and yielding to his force Down fell the block entire the wall laid bare To many at once the breach gave open way Ajax and Teucer him at once assail d This with an arrow struck the glitt ring belt Around his breast whence hung his pond rous shield But Jove who will d not that his son should fall Before the ships the weapon turn d aside Then forward Ajax sprang and with his spear Thrust at the shield the weapon pass d not through Yet check d his bold advance a little space Back he recoil d but not the more withdrew His soul on glory intent and rallying quick Thus to the warlike Lycians shouted loud Why Lycians thus your wonted might relax Tis hard for one alone how brave soe er E en though he break the rampart down to force A passage to the ships but on with me For work is here for many hands to do He said and by the King s rebuke abash d With fiercer zeal the Lycians press d around Their King and councillor on th other side Within the wall the Greeks their squadrons mass d Then were great deeds achiev d nor thro the breach Could the brave troops of Lycia to the ships Their passage force nor could the warrior Greeks Repel the Lycians from the ground where they Before the wall had made their footing good As when two neighbours in a common field Each line in hand within a narrow space About the limits of their land contend Between them thus the rampart drew the line O er which the full orb d shields of tough bull s hide And lighter bucklers on the warriors breasts On either side they clove and many a wound The pitiless weapons dealt on some who turn d Their neck and back laid bare on many more Who full in front and through their shields were struck On ev ry side the parapet and tow rs With Greek and Trojan blood were spatter d o er Nor yet e en so the Greeks to flight were driv n But as a woman that for wages spins Honest and true with wool and weights in hand In even balance holds the scales to mete Her humble hire her children s maintenance So even hung the balance of the war Till Jove with highest honour Hector crown d The son of Priam he the foremost scal d The wall and loudly on the Trojans call d On valiant Trojans on the Grecian wall Break down and wrap their ships in blazing fires Thus he exhorting spoke they heard him all And to the wall rush d numberless and swarm d Upon the ramparts bristling thick with spears Then Hector stooping seiz d a pond rous stone That lay before the gates twas broad below But sharp above and scarce two lab ring men The strongest from the ground could raise it up And load upon a wain as men are now But he unaided lifted it with ease So light it seem d by grace of Saturn s son As in one hand a shepherd bears with ease A full siz d fleece and scarcely feels the weight So Hector tow rd the portals bore the stone Which clos d the lofty double folding gates Within defended by two massive bars Laid crosswise and with one cross bolt secur d Close to the gate he stood and planting firm His foot to give his arm its utmost pow r Full on the middle dash d the mighty mass The hinges both gave way the pond rous stone Fell inwards widely gap d the op ning gates Nor might the bars within the blow sustain This way and that the sever d portals flew Before the crashing missile dark as night His low ring brow great Hector sprang within Bright flash d the brazen armour on his breast As through the gates two jav lins in his hand He sprang the Gods except no pow r might meet That onset blaz d his eyes with lurid fire Then to the Trojans turning to the throng He call d aloud to scale the lofty wall They heard and straight obey d some scal d the wall Some through the strong built gates continuous pour d While in confusion irretrievable Fled to their ships the panic stricken Greeks END OF VOLUME I VOLUME II ARGUMENT THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS THE ACTS OF IDOMENEUS Neptune concerned for the loss of the Grecians upon seeing the fortification forced by Hector who had entered the gate near the station of the Ajaces assumes the shape of Calchas and inspires those heroes to oppose him then in the form of one of the generals encourages the other Greeks who had retired to their vessels The Ajaces form their troops into a close phalanx and put a stop to Hector and the Trojans Several deeds of valour are performed Meriones losing his spear in the encounter repairs to seek another at the tent of Idomeneus this occasions a conversation between these two warriors who return together to the battle Idomeneus signalizes his courage above the rest he kills Othryoneus Asius and Alcathous Deiphobus and AEneas march against him and at length Idomeneus retires Menelaus wounds Helenus and kills Peisander The Trojans are repulsed in the left wing Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces till being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers Polydamas advises to call a council of war Hector approves his advice but goes first to rally the Trojans upbraids Paris rejoins Polydamas meets Ajax again and renews the attack The eight and twentieth day still continues The scene is between the Grecian wall and the sea shore BOOK XIII When Jove had Hector and the Trojans brought Close to the ships he left them there to toil And strife continuous turning his keen glance To view far off th equestrian tribes of Thrace The warlike Mysians and the men who feed On milk of mares thence Hippemolgi term d A peaceful race the justest of mankind On Troy

he sat Aloft on wooded Samos topmost peak Samos of Thrace whence Ida s heights he saw And Priam s city and the ships of Greece Thither ascended from the sea he sat And thence the Greeks by Trojans overborne Pitying he saw and deeply wroth with Jove Then down the mountain s craggy side he pass d With rapid step and as he mov d along Beneath th immortal feet of Ocean s Lord Quak d the huge mountain and the shadowy wood Three strides he took the fourth he reach d his goal AEgae where on the margin of the bay His temple stood all glitt ring all of gold Imperishable there arriv d he yok d

God your hearts inspire yourselves Firmly to stand and cheer your comrades on So from your swiftly sailing ships ye yet May drive the foe how bold soe er he be Though by Olympian Jove himself upheld So spake th Earth shaker Circler of the Earth And with his sceptre touching both the chiefs Fill d them with strength and courage and their limbs Their feet and hands with active vigour strung Then like a swift wing d falcon sprang to flight Which down the sheer face of some lofty rock Swoops on the plain to seize his feather d prey So swiftly Neptune left the chiefs him first Departing knew

If meaner men should from the battle shrink I might not blame them but that such as ye Should falter indignation fills my soul Dear friends from this remissness must accrue Yet greater evils but with

with the increasing clamour of the war and hastens to Agamemnon on his way he meets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses whom he informs of the extremity of the danger Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night which Ulysses withstands to which Diomed adds his advice that wounded as they were they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence which advice is pursued Juno seeing the partiality of Jupiter to the Trojans forms a design to overreach him she sets off her charms with the utmost care and the more surely to enchant him obtains the magic girdle of Venus She then applies herself to the god of Sleep and with some difficulty persuades him to seal the eyes of Jupiter this done she goes to Mount Ida where the god at first sight is ravished with her beauty sinks in her embraces and is laid asleep Neptune takes advantage of his slumber and succours the Greeks Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax and carried off from the battle several

eyes of Jove for I In sweet unconsciousness have drown d his sense Beguil d by Juno in whose arms he lies He said and vanish d mid the tribes of men But fir d with keener zeal to aid the Greeks Neptune sprang forth in front and call d aloud Again ye Greeks shall our remissness yield The victory to Hector Priam s son To seize our ships and endless glory gain Such is his boast and menace since in wrath Achilles still beside his ships remains Yet him we scarce should miss if we the rest But firmly stood for mutual defence Hear then my counsel let us all agree Girt with our best and broadest shields our heads With flashing helmets guarded in our hands Grasping our longest spears to dare the fight Myself will lead you on and Priam s son Though bold he be will fear with me to cope And if among our bravest any bear Too small a buckler with some meaner man Let him exchange and don the larger shield He said and they assenting heard his speech The Kings themselves Ulysses Diomed And

armour all were girt Forward they mov d th Earth shaker led them on In his broad hand an awful sword he bore Long bladed vivid as the lightning s flash Yet in the deadly strife he might not join But kindled terror in the minds of men Hector meantime the Trojan troops array d Then fiercer grew and more intense the strain Of furious fight when Ocean s dark hair d King And Priam s noble son were met in arms And aided this the Trojans that the Greeks High tow rd the tents uprose the surging sea As with loud clamour met th opposing hosts Less loud the roar of Ocean s wave that driv n By stormy Boreas breaks upon the beach Less loud the crackling of the flames that rage In the deep forest of some mountain glen Less loud the wind to wildest fury rous d Howls in the branches of the lofty oaks Than rose the cry of Trojans and of Greeks As each with furious shout encounter d each At Ajax first who straight before him stood Great Hector threw his spear nor miss d his aim Where the two belts the one which bore his shield His silver studded sword the other met Across his breast these two his life preserv d Hector was wroth that from his stalwart hand The spear had flown in vain and back he sprang For safety to his comrades shelt ring ranks But mighty Ajax Telamon upheav d A pond rous stone of many all around That scatter d lay beneath the warriors feet And serv d to prop the ships with one of these As Hector backward stepp d above the shield He smote him on the breast below the throat With whirling motion circling as it flew The mass he hurl d As by the bolt of Heav n Uprooted prostrate lies some forest oak The sulph rous vapour taints the air appall d Bereft of strength the near beholder stands And awestruck hears the thunder peal of Jove So in the dust the might of Hector lay Dropp d from his hand the spear the shield and helm Fell with him loud his polished armour rang On rush d with joyous shout the sons of Greece In hope to seize the spoil thick flew the spears Yet none might reach or wound the fallen chief For gather d close around the bravest all Valiant AEneas and Polydamas Godlike Agenor and the Lycian chief Sarpedon and the noble Glaucus stood Nor did the rest not aid their shields broad orbs Before him still they held while in their arms His comrades bore him from the battle field To where with charioteer and well wrought car Beyond the fight his flying coursers stood Which bore him deeply groaning tow rd the town But when the ford was reach d of Xanthus stream Broad flowing eddying by immortal Jove Begotten on the ground they laid him down And dash d the cooling water on his brow Reviv d he lifted up awhile his eyes Then on his knees half rising he disgorg d The clotted blood but backward to the earth Still by the blow subdu d again he fell And darkling shades of night his eyes o erspread Onward with zeal redoubled press d the Greeks When Hector from the field they saw withdrawn Foremost of all Oileus active son With sudden spring assailing Satnius slew Him a fair Naiad nymph to OEnops bore Who by the banks of Satnois kept his herds Him then approaching near Oileus son Thrust through the flank he fell and o er his corpse Trojans and Greeks in stubborn fight engag d But Panthous son a swift avenger came Polydamas with brandish d spear and struck Through the right shoulder Prothoenor son Of Areilycus right through was

Guarding his brother s body with his spear Slew the Boeotian Promachus who fain Would by the feet have drawn away the dead Then Acamas exulting cried aloud Ye wretched Greeks in boasting measureless Not ours alone the labour and the loss Of battle ye too have your share of death Behold where lies your Promachus subdued Beneath my spear not long unpaid the debt Due for my brother s blood Tis well for him Who leaves a brother to avenge his fate Thus he the Greeks with pain his vaunting heard But chief it rous d the spirit within the breast Of Peneleus on Acamas he sprang Who waited not th encounter next he slew Ilioneus the son of Phorbas Lord Of num rous flocks of all the Trojans most Belov d of Hermes who his wealth increas d To him Ilioneus an only son His mother bore who now

grinding spear Drain d all his vitals through the gaping wound His spirit escap d and darkness clos d his eyes But chiefest slaughter of the Trojans wrought Oileus active son of all the Greeks No foot so swift as his when Jove had fill d Their souls with fear to chase the flying foe ARGUMENT THE FIFTH BATTLE AT THE SHIPS AND THE ACTS OF AJAX Jupiter awaking sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches Hector in a swoon and Neptune at the head of the Greeks he is highly incensed at the artifice of Juno who appeases him by her submissions she is then sent to Iris and Apollo Juno repairing to the assembly of the gods attempts with extraordinary address to incense them against Jupiter in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment he is ready to take arms but is prevented by Minerva Iris and Apollo obey the orders of Jupiter Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle to which after much reluctance and passion he consents Apollo reinspires Hector with vigour brings him back to the battle marches before him with his aegis and turns the fortune of the fight He breaks down the first part of the Grecian wall the Trojans rush in and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet but are yet repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter BOOK XV Now when the Trojans had recross d the trench And palisades and in their headlong flight Many had fall n by Grecian swords the rest Routed and pale with fear made head awhile Beside their cars then Jove on Ida s height At golden throned Juno s side awoke Rising he saw the Trojans and the Greeks Those in confusion while behind them press d The Greeks triumphant Neptune in their midst He saw too Hector stretch d upon the plain His comrades standing round senseless he lay Drawing short breath blood gushing from his mouth For by no feeble hand the blow was dealt Pitying the Sire of Gods and men beheld And thus with sternest glance to Juno spoke This Juno is thy work thy wicked wiles Have Hector quell d and Trojans driv n to flight Nor know I but thyself mayst reap the fruit By shameful scourging of thy vile deceit Hast thou forgotten how in former times I hung thee from on high and to thy feet Attach d two pond rous anvils and thy hands With golden fetters bound which none might break There didst thou hang amid the clouds of Heav n Through all Olympus breadth the Gods were wroth Yet dar d not one approach to set thee free If any so had ventur d him had I Hurl d from Heav n s threshold till to earth he fell With little left of life Yet was not quench d My wrath on godlike Hercules account Whom thou with Boreas o er the wat ry waste With fell intent didst send and tempest toss d Cast him ashore on Coos fruitful isle I rescued him from thence and brought him back After long toil to Argos grassy plains This to thy mind I bring that thou mayst learn To cease thy treach rous wiles nor hope to gain By all thy lavish d blandishments of love Wherewith thou hast deceived me and betray d He said and terror seiz d the stag ey d Queen Who thus with winged words address d her Lord By Earth I swear and yon broad Heav n above And Stygian stream beneath the weightiest oath Of solemn pow r to bind the blessed Gods By thine own sacred head our nuptial bed Whose holy tie I never could forswear That not by my suggestion and advice Earth shaking Neptune on the Trojan host And Hector pours his wrath and aids the Greeks In this he but obeys his own desire Who looks with pity on the Grecian host Beside their ships o erborne and could my words Prevail my counsel were to shape his course O cloud girt King obedient to thy will She said the Sire of Gods and men well pleas d Her answer heard and thus with gracious smile If stag ey d Queen in synod of the Gods Thy counsels shall indeed with mine agree Neptune how strong soe er his wish must change His course obedient to thy will and mine And if in all sincerity thou speak Go to th assembled Gods and hither send Iris and Phoebus of the silver bow That she may to the Grecian camp repair And bid that Neptune from the battle field Withdraw and to his own domain retire While Phoebus Hector to the fight restores Inspiring new born vigour and allaying The mortal pains which bow his spirit down Then heartless fear infusing in the Greeks Put them to flight that flying they may fall Beside Achilles ships his comrade then Patroclus he shall send to battle forth To be by Hector slain in front of Troy Yet not to fall till many valiant youths Have felt his prowess and amid the rest My son Sarpedon by his comrade s death Enrag d Achilles Hector shall subdue Thenceforth my counsel is that from the ships The Trojan force shall still be backward driv n Until at length by Pallas deep designs The Greeks possess the lofty walls of Troy Yet will not I my anger intermit Nor suffer other of th immortal Gods To aid the Greeks till Peleus son behold His wish accomplish d and the boon obtain d I promis d once and with a nod confirm d That day when sea born Thetis clasp d my knees And pray d me to avenge her warrior son Thus he the white arm d Queen of Heav n submiss His mandate heard and from th Idaean mount With rapid flight to

intervening space Olympus heights she reach d and in the house Of Jove appear d amid th assembled Gods They at her coming rose with golden cups Greeting their Queen s approach the rest she pass d And from the hand of fair fac d Themis took The proffer d cup who first had run to meet And thus with winged words address d the Queen Juno why com saint thou hither and with looks Of one distraught with fear hath Saturn s son Thy mighty Lord thus sore affrighted thee To whom the white arm d Goddess Juno thus Forbear thy questions Themis well thou know saint How haughty and imperious is his mind Thou for the Gods in haste prepare the feast Then shalt thou learn amid th Immortals all What evil he designs nor all I ween His counsels will approve or men or Gods Though now in blissful ignorance they feast She said and sat the Gods oppress d with care Her farther speech awaited on her lips There dwelt indeed a smile but not a ray Pass d o er her dark ning brow as thus her wrath Amid th assembled Gods found vent in words Fools are we all who madly strive with Jove Or hope by access to his throne to sway By word or deed his course from all apart He all our counsels heeds not but derides And boasts o er all th immortal Gods to reign In unapproach d pre eminence of pow r Prepare then each his sev ral woe to bear On Mars e en now methinks the blow hath fall n Since in the fight the man he loves the best And boasts his son Ascalaphus is slain She said and Mars enrag d his brawny thigh Smote with his hands and thus lamenting spoke Blame not ye Gods who on Olympus dwell That to the Grecian ships I haste to avenge My slaughter d son though blasted by Heav n s fire Twere mine mid corpses blood and dust to lie He said and gave command to Fear and Flight To yoke his ear and donn d his glitt ring arms Then from the throne of Jove had heavier wrath And deeper vengeance on th Immortals fall n But Pallas in alarm for all the Gods Quitting in haste the throne whereon she sat Sprang past the vestibule and from his head The helmet lifted from his arm the shield Took from his sturdy hand and rear d upright The brazen spear then with reproachful words She thus assail d th impetuous God of War Frantic and passion maddened thou art lost Hast thou no ears to hear or are thy mind And sense of reverend rence utterly destroyed Or heard saint thou not what white arm d Juno spoke Fresh from the presence of Olympian Jove Wouldst thou thine evil destiny fulfill d By hard constraint despite thy grief be driv n Back to Olympus and to all the rest Confusion and disaster with thee bring At once from valiant Trojans and from Greeks His thoughts would be diverted and his wrath Embroil Olympus and on all alike Guilty or not his anger would be pour d Waive then thy vengeance for thy gallant son Others as brave of heart as strong of arm Have fall n and yet must fall and vain th attempt To watch at once o er all the race of men Thus saying to his seat again she forc d Th impetuous Mars meanwhile without the house Juno by Jove s command Apollo call d And Iris messenger from God to God And thus to both her winged words address d Jove bids you with all speed to Ida haste And when arriv d before his face ye stand Whate er he orders that observe and do Thus Juno spoke and to her throne return d While they to spring abounding Ida s heights Wild nurse of forest beasts pursued their way Th all seeing son of Saturn there they found Upon the topmost crag of Gargarus An incense breathing cloud around him spread Before the face of cloud compelling Jove They stood well pleas d he witness d their approach In swift obedience to his consort s words And thus to Iris first his speech address d Haste thee swift Iris and to Ocean s King My message bear nor misreporting aught Nor aught omitting from the battle field Bid him retire and join th assembled Gods Or to his own domain of sea withdraw If my commands he heed not nor obey Let him consider in his inmost soul If mighty though he be he dare await My hostile coming mightier far than him His elder born nor may his spirit aspire To rival me whom all regard with awe He said swift footed Iris at the word From Ida s heights to sacred Ilium sped Swift as the snow flakes from the clouds descend Or wintry hail before the driving blast Of Boreas ether born so swift to Earth Descended Iris by his side she stood And with these words th Earth shaking God address d A message dark hair d Circler of the Earth To thee I bring from AEgis bearing Jove He bids thee straightway from the battle field Retire and either join th assembled Gods Or to thine own domain of sea withdraw If his commands thou heed not nor obey Hither he menaces himself to come And fight against thee but he warns thee first Beware his arm as mightier far than thee Thine elder born nor may thy spirit aspire To rival him whom all regard with awe To whom in tow ring wrath th Earth shaking God By Heav n though great he be he yet presumes Somewhat too far if me his equal born He seeks by force to baffle of my will We were three brethren all of Rhaea born To Saturn Jove and I and Pluto third Who o er the nether regions holds his sway Threefold was our partition each obtain d His meed of honour due the hoary Sea By lot my habitation was assign d The realms of Darkness fell to Pluto s share Broad Heav n amid the sky and clouds to Jove But Earth and high Olympus are to all A common heritage nor will I walk To please the will of Jove though great he be With his own third contented let him rest Nor let him think that I as wholly vile Shall quail before his arm his lofty words Were better to his daughters and his sons Address d his own begotten who perforce Must listen to his mandates and obey To whom swift footed Iris thus replied Is this then dark hair d Circler of the Earth The message stern and haughty which to Jove Thou bidd saint me bear perchance thine angry mood May bend to better counsels noblest minds Are easiest bent and o er superior age Thou know saint th avenging Furies ever watch To whom Earth shaking Neptune thus replied Immortal Iris weighty are thy words And in good season spoken and tis well When envoys are by sound discretion led Yet are my heart and mind with grief oppress d When me his equal both by birth and fate He seeks with haughty words to overbear I yield but with indignant sense of wrong This too I say nor shall my threat be vain Let him remember if in my despite Gainst Pallas Juno s Hermes Vulcan s will He spare to overthrow proud Ilium s tow rs And crown with victory the Grecian arms The feud between us never can be heal d Th Earth shaker said and from the field withdrew Beneath the ocean wave the warrior Greeks His loss deploring to Apollo then The Cloud compeller thus his speech address d Go straight to Hector of the brazen helm Good Phoebus for beneath the ocean wave Th Earth shaker hath withdrawn escaping thus My high displeasure had he dar d resist The tumult of our strife had reach d the Gods Who in the nether realms with Saturn dwell Yet thus tis better both for me and him That though indignant to my will he yields For to compel him were no easy task Take thou and wave on high thy tassell d shield The Grecian warriors daunting thou thyself Far darting King thy special care bestow On noble Hector so restore his strength And vigour that in panic to their ships And the broad Hellespont the Greeks be driv n Then will I so by word and deed contrive That they may gain fresh respite from their toil He said nor did Apollo not obey His Sire s

great is oft a friend s persuasive pow r He said and quickly on his errand sped Meanwhile the Greeks in firm array endur d The onset of the Trojans nor could these The assailants though in numbers less repel Nor those again the Grecian masses break And force their passage through the ships and tents As by a rule in cunning workman s hand Who all his art by Pallas aid has learnt A vessel s plank

Ajax from his post could move And burn the ship with fire nor he repel The foe who came protected by a God Then noble Ajax with his jav lin smote Caletor son of Clytius through the breast As tow rd

call d Good Teucer we have lost a faithful friend The son of Mastor our Cytheran guest Whom as a father all rever d who now Lies slain by noble Hector Where are then Thine arrows swift wing d messengers of fate And where thy trusty bow Apollo s gift Thus Ajax Teucer heard and ran in haste And stood beside him with his bended bow And well stor d quiver on the Trojans fast He pour d his shafts and struck Pisenor s son Clitus the comrade of Polydamas The noble son of Panthous he the reins Held in his hand and all his care bestow d To guide his horses for where er the throng Was thickest there in Hector s cause and Troy s He still was found but o er him hung the doom Which none might turn aside for from behind The fateful arrow struck him through the neck Down from the car he fell swerving aside The startled horses whirl d the empty car Them first the King Polydamas beheld And stay d their course to Protiaon s son Astynous then he gave them with command To keep good watch and still be near at hand Then mid the foremost join d again the fray Again at Hector of the brazen helm An arrow Teucer aim d and had the shaft The life of Hector quench d in mid career Not long the

tipp d arrow flew Wide of the mark and dropp d his hand the bow Then to his brother all aghast he cried O Heav n some God our best laid schemes of war Confounds who from my hand hath wrench d the bow And snapp d the newly twisted string which I But late attach d my swift wing d shafts to bear Whom answer d thus great Ajax Telamon O friend leave there thine arrows and thy bow Marr d by some God who grudges our renown But take in hand thy pond rous spear and cast Thy shield about thy shoulders and thyself Stand forth and urge the rest to face the foe Let us not tamely yield if yield we must Our well built ships but nobly dare the fight Thus Ajax spoke and Teucer in the tent Bestowed his bow and o er his shoulders threw His fourfold shield and on his firm set head A helm he plac d well wrought with horsehair plume That nodded fearful o er his brow his hand Grasp d the firm spear with sharpen d point of brass Then ran and swiftly stood by Ajax side Hector meanwhile who saw the weapon marr d To Trojans and to Lycians call d aloud Trojans and Lycians and ye Dardans fam d In close encounter quit ye now like men Against the ships your wonted valour show E en now before our eyes hath Jove destroy d A chieftain s weapon Easy tis to trace O er human wars th o erruling hand of Jove To whom he gives the prize of victory And whom withholding aid he minishes As now the Greeks while we his favour gain Pour then your force united on the ships And if there be among you who this day Shall meet his doom by sword or arrow slain E en let him die a glorious death is his Who for his country falls and dying leaves Preserv d from danger children wife and home His heritage uninjur d when the Greeks Embarking hence shall take their homeward way His words fresh courage rous d in ev ry breast Ajax on th other side address d the Greeks Shame on ye Greeks this very hour decides If we must perish or be sav d and ward Destruction from our ships and can ye hope That each if Hector of the glancing helm Shall burn our ships on foot can reach his home Or hear ye not how burning to destroy Our vessels Hector cheers his forces on Not to the dance but to the fight he calls Nor better counsel can for us be found Than in close fight with heart and hand to join Twere better far at once to die than live Hemm d in and straiten d thus in dire distress Close to our ships by meaner men beset His words fresh courage rous d in ev ry breast Then Hector Schedius Perimedes son The Thracian leader slew on th other side Ajax the captain of the foot o ercame Laodamas Antenor s noble son While of his arms Polydamas despoil d Cyllenian Otus friend of Phyleus son The proud Epeians leader Meges saw And rush d upon him but Polydamas Stooping the blow evaded him he miss d For Phoebus will

Antilochus but not unmark d Of Hector s eye who hast ning through the press Advanc d to meet him waited not th attack Bold warrior as he was Antilochus But trembling fled as when a beast of prey Conscious of evil deed amid the herd The guardian dog or herdsman s self has slain And flies ere yet th avenging crowd collect So fled the son of Nestor onward press d By Hector led the Trojans loud their shouts As on the Greeks their murd rous shafts they pour d Yet turn d he when his comrades ranks he reach d Then on the ships as rav ning lions fell The Trojans they but work d the will of Jove Who still their courage rais d and quell d the Greeks Of vict ry these debarr d and those inspir d For so he will d that Hector Priam s son Should wrap in fire the beaked ships of Greece And Thetis to

Greeks the final triumph leave With such design to seize the ships he fir d Th already burning zeal of Priam s son Fiercely he rag d as terrible as Mars With brandish d spear or as a raging fire Mid

as a craggy rock upstanding high Close by the hoary sea which meets unmov d The boist rous currents of the whistling winds And the big waves that bellow round its base So stood unmov d the Greeks and undismay d At length all blazing in his arms he sprang Upon the mass so plunging down as when On some tall vessel from beneath the clouds A giant billow tempest nurs d descends The deck is drench d in

heifers falls which on some marshy mead Feed numberless beneath the care of one Unskill d from beasts of prey to guard his charge And while beside the front or rear he walks The lion on th unguarded

sent His envoy to the might of Hercules Far nobler than the father was the son In speed of foot in warlike might in mind In all among Mycenians foremost he Who now on Hector fresh renown conferr d For

remember now Your wonted valour think ye in your rear To find supporting forces or some fort Whose walls may give you refuge from your foe No city is nigh whose well appointed tow rs Mann d by a

to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks with Achilles troops and armour He agrees to it but at the same time charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet without farther pursuit of the enemy The armour horses soldiers and officers of Achilles are described Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle The Trojans at the sight of Patroclus in Achilles armour taking him for that hero are cast into the utmost consternation he beats them off from the vessels Hector himself flies Sarpedon is killed though Jupiter was averse to his fate Several other particulars of the battle are described in the heat of which Patroclus neglecting the orders of Achilles pursues the foe to the walls of Troy where Apollo repulses and disarms him Euphorbus wounds him and Hector kills him which concludes the book BOOK XVI Thus round the well mann d ship they wag d the war Meanwhile by Peleus son Patroclus stood Weeping hot tears as some dark water d fount Pours o er a craggy rock its gloomy stream Achilles swift of foot with pity saw And to his friend these winged words address d Why weeps Patroclus like an infant girl That prays her mother by whose side she runs To take her up and clinging to her gown Impedes her way and still with tearful eyes Looks in her face until she take her up Ev n as that girl Patroclus such art

ships They who were late their bravest and their best Sore wounded all by spear or arrow lie The valiant son of Tydeus Diomed Pierc d by a shaft Ulysses by a spear And Agamemnon s self Eurypylus By a sharp arrow through the thigh transfix d For these the large resources of their art The leeches ply and on their wounds attend While thou Achilles still remain saint unmov d Oh be it never mine to nurse such hate As thou retain saint inflexibly severe Who e er may hope in future days by thee To profit if thou now forbear to save The Greeks from shame and loss Unfeeling man Sure Peleus horseman brave was ne er thy sire Nor Thetis bore thee from the cold grey sea And craggy rocks thou hadst thy birth so hard And stubborn is thy soul But if the fear Of evil prophesied thyself restrain Or message by thy Goddess mother brought From Jove yet send me forth with all thy force Of Myrmidons to be the saving light Of Greece and let me to the battle bear Thy glitt ring arms if so the men of Troy Scar d by thy likeness may forsake the field And breathing time afford the sons of Greece Toil worn for little pause has yet been theirs Fresh and unwearied we may drive with ease To their own

say and so for me obtain Honour and glory in the eyes of Greece And that the beauteous maiden to my arms They may restore with costly gifts to boot The ships reliev d return forthwith and though The Thund rer Juno s Lord should crown thine arms With triumph be not rash apart from me In combat with the warlike sons of Troy So should my name in less repute be held Nor in the keen excitement of the

and turn it in thy mind If to his home Sarpedon thou restore Alive bethink thee will not other Gods Their sons too from the stubborn fight withdraw For in the field around the walls of Troy Are many sons of Gods in all of whom This act of thine will angry feelings rouse But if thou love him and thy soul deplore His coming doom yet in the stubborn fight Leave him beneath Patroclus hand to fall Then when his spirit hath fled the charge assign To Death and gentle Sleep that in their arms They bear him safe to Lycia s wide spread plains There shall his brethren and his friends perform His fun

objects to Hector as a flight who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from Patroclus and renews the battle The Greeks give way till Ajax rallies them AEneas sustains the Trojans AEneas and Hector attempt the chariot of Achilles which is borne off by Automedon The horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus Jupiter covers his body with a thick darkness the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles with the news of Patroclus s death then returns to the fight where though attacked with the utmost fury he and Meriones assisted by the Ajaces bear off

ring his eyes the wrinkles of his brow So o er Patroclus mighty Ajax stood And by his side his heart with grief oppress d The warlike Menelaus Atreus son Then Glaucus leader of the Lycian host To Hector thus with scornful glance address d His keen reproaches Hector fair of form How art thou wanting in the fight thy fame Coward and runaway thou hast belied Bethink thee now if thou alone canst save The city aided but by Trojans born Henceforth no Lycian will go forth for Troy To fight with Greeks since favour none we gain By unremitting toil against the foe How can a meaner man expect thine aid Who basely to the Greeks a prize and spoil Sarpedon leav saint thy comrade and thy guest Greatly he serv d the city and thyself While yet he liv d and now thou dar saint not save His body from the dogs By my advice If Lycians will be rul d we take at once Our homeward way and Troy may meet her doom But if in Trojan bosoms there abode The daring dauntless courage meet for men Who in their country s cause against the foe Endure both toil and war we soon should see Patroclus brought within the walls of Troy Him from the battle could we bear away And lifeless bring to royal Priam s town Soon would the Greeks Sarpedon s arms release And we to Ilium s heights himself might bear For with his valiant comrades there lies slain The follower of the bravest chief of Greece But thou before the mighty Ajax stood saint With downcast eyes nor durst in manly fight Contend with one thy better far confess d To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm With stern regard replied Why Glaucus speak Brave as thou art in this o erbearing strain Good friend I heretofore have held thee wise O er all who dwell in Lycia s fertile soil But now I change and hold thy judgment cheap Who chargest me with flying from the might Of giant Ajax never have I shrunk From the stern fight and clatter of the cars But all o erruling is the mind of Jove Who strikes with panic and of vict ry robs The bravest and anon excites to war Stand by me now and see if through the day I prove myself the coward that thou say saint Or suffer that a Greek how brave soe er Shall rescue from my hands Patroclus corpse He said and loudly on the Trojans call d Trojans and Lycians and ye Dardans fam d In close encounter quit ye now like men Maintain awhile the stubborn fight while I The splendid armour of Achilles don My glorious prize from slain Patroclus torn So saying Hector of the glancing helm Withdrawing from the field with rapid steps His comrades follow d and ere long o ertook Who tow rd the town Achilles armour bore Then standing from the bloody fight aloof The armour he exchang d his own he bade The warlike Trojans to the city bear While he of Peleus son Achilles donn d The heav nly armour which th immortal Gods Gave to his sire he to his son convey d Yet in that armour grew not old that son Him when apart the Cloud compeller saw Girt with the arms of Peleus godlike son He shook his head and inly thus he mus d Ah hapless little deem saint thou of thy fate Though now so nigh Thou of the prime of men The dread of all hast donn d th immortal arms Whose comrade brave and good thy hand hath slain And sham d him stripping from his head and breast Helmet and cuirass yet thy latest hours Will I with glory crown since ne er from thee Eeturn d from battle shall Andromache Receive the spoils of Peleus godlike son He said and nodded with his shadowy brows Then with the armour fitted to his form By Jove himself was Hector girt by Mars The fierce and terrible with vig rous strength His limbs were strung as mid his brave allies He sprang loud shouting glitt ring in his arms To all he seem d Achilles godlike self To each and all in cheering tones he spoke Mesthles and Glaucus and Thersilochus Asteropaeus and Hippothous Medon Deisenor Phoreys Chromius And Ennomus the seer to all of these His winged words he cheeringly address d Hear me ye countless tribes that dwelling round Assist our cause You from your sev ral homes Not for display of numbers have I call d But that with willing hearts ye should defend Our wives and infants from the warlike Greeks For this I drain my people s stores for food And gifts for you exalting your estate Then who will boldly onward he may fall Or safe escape such is the chance of war But who within our valiant Trojans ranks Shall but the body of Patroclus bring Despite the might of Ajax half the spoils To him I give the other half myself Retaining and his praise shall equal mine He said and onward with uplifted spears They march d upon the Greeks high rose their hopes From Ajax Telamon to snatch the dead Vain hopes which cost them many a life Then thus To valiant Menelaus Ajax spoke O Heav n born Menelaus noble friend For safe return I dare no longer hope Not for Patroclus corpse so much I fear Which soon will glut the dogs and birds of Troy As for my life and thine I tremble now For like a war cloud Hector s might I see O ershadowing all around now is our doom Apparent but do thou for succour call On all the chiefs if haply they may hear Thus Ajax spoke obedient to his word On all the chiefs Atrides call d aloud O friends the chiefs and councillors of Greece All ye that banquet at the general ral cost With Atreus sons and o er your sev ral states Dominion hold whose honour is of Jove Twere hard to call by name each single man So fierce the combat rages but let each And all their aid afford and deem it shame Patroclus corpse should glut the dogs of Troy He said first heard Oileus active son And hast ning through the fray beside him stood Next him Idomeneus with whom there came Valiant as Mars his friend Meriones But who can know or tell the names of all Who following swell d the battle of the Greeks Onward the Trojans press d by Hector led With such a sound as when the ocean wave Meets on the beach th outpouring of a stream Swoll n by the rains of Heav n the lofty cliffs Resound and bellows the

long Endur d their flight them Ajax rallied soon In form pre eminent and deeds of arms O er all the Greeks save Peleus matchless son Onward he sprang as springs a mountain boar Which turning in the forest glade to bay Scatters with ease both dogs and stalwart youths So Ajax scatter d soon the Trojan ranks That round Patroclus closing hop d to bear With glory to themselves his corpse to Troy Hippothous Pelasgian Lethus son Was dragging by the feet the noble dead A leathern belt around his ancles bound Seeking the favour of the men of Troy But on himself he brought destruction down Which none might turn aside for from the crowd Outsprang the son of Telamon and struck In close encounter on the brass cheek d helm The plumed helm was shiver d by the blow Dealt by a weighty spear and

Far from his own Larissa s teeming soil Not destin d he his parents to repay Their early care for short his term of life By godlike Ajax mighty spear subdu d At Ajax Hector threw his glitt ring spear

Their numbers and their troops undaunted hearts I see their cause maintaining if when Jove Rather to us than them the vict ry wills With fear unspeakable ye shun the fight He said the presence of the Archer God AEneas knew and loud to Hector call d Hector and all ye other chiefs of Troy And brave Allies foul shame it were that we O ercome by panic should to Ilium now In flight be driv n before the warlike Greeks And by my side but now some God there stood And told how Jove the sov reign arbiter Of battle on our side bestow d his aid On then nor undisturbed allow the Greeks To bear Patroclus body to their ships He said and far before the ranks advanc d They rallying turn d and fac d again the Greeks Then first AEneas spear the comrade brave Of Lycomedes struck Laocritus Son of Arisbas Lycomedes saw With pitying eyes his gallant comrade s fall And standing near his glitt ring spear he threw And through the midriff Apisaon struck His people s guardian chief the valiant son Of Hippasus and slack d his limbs in death He from Paeonia s fertile fields had come O er all his comrades eminent in fight All save Asteropaeus who with eyes Of pity saw his gallant comrade s fall And forward sprang to battle with the Greeks Yet could not force his way for all around Patroclus rose a fence of serried shields And spears projecting such the orders giv n By Ajax and with earnest care enforc d That from around the dead should none retire Nor any to the front advance alone Before his fellows but their steady guard Maintain and hand to hand the battle wage So order d Ajax then with crimson blood The earth was wet and hand to hand they fell Trojans alike and brave Allies and Greeks For neither these a bloodless fight sustain d Though fewer far their losses for they stood Of mutual succour mindful and support Thus furious as the rage of fire they fought Nor might ye deem the glorious sun himself Nor moon was safe for darkest clouds of night O erspread the warriors who the battle wag d Around the body of Menoetius son Elsewhere the Trojans and the well greav d Greeks Fought undisturb d in the clear light of day The sun s bright beams were shed abroad no cloud Lay on the

Throughout the livelong day that weary fight Reek d with continuous toil and sweat the knees And legs and feet the arms and eyes of all Who round Achilles faithful comrade fought As when a chief his

his doom foretold Revealing to her son the mind of Jove Yet ne er had warn d him of such grief as this Which now befell his dearest comrade s loss Still round the dead they held their pointed spears Fought hand to hand and mutual slaughter dealt And thus perchance some brass clad Greek would say O friends twere shameful should we to the ships Ingloriously return ere that should be Let earth engulph us all so better far Than let these Trojans to their city bear Our dead and boast them of their triumph gain d On th other hand some valiant Trojan thus Would shout O friends tho fate decreed that here We all should die yet let not one give way Thus cheering each his comrades would they speak And thus they fought the iron clangour pierc d The empty air and brazen vault of Heav n But from

Beneath the splendid car they stood their heads Down drooping to the ground while scalding tears Dropp d earthward from their eyelids as they mourn d Their charioteer and o er the yoke band shed Down

Swiftly again assail d them in pursuit Yet speedy to pursue he could not slay Nor in the car alone had pow r at once To guide the flying steeds and hurl the spear At length a comrade brave Alcimedon Laerces son beheld behind the car He stood and thus Automedon address d Automedon what God has fill d thy mind With counsels vain and thee of sense bereft That with the Trojans in the foremost ranks Thou fain wouldst fight alone thy comrade slain While Hector proudly on his breast displays The glorious arms of great AEacides To whom Automedon Diores son Alcimedon since none of all the Greeks May

Automedon and loudly call d On Menelaus and th Ajaces both Ye two Ajaces leaders of the host And Menelaus with our bravest all Ye on the dead alone your care bestow To guard him and stave off the hostile ranks But haste and us the living save from death For Hector and AEneas hitherward With weight o erpow ring through the bloody press The bravest of the Trojans force their way Yet is the issue

fight For deeply by his death my heart is touch d But valiant Hector with the strength of fire Still rages and destruction deals around For Jove is with him and his triumph wills He said the blue ey d Goddess heard with joy That chief of all the Gods her aid he sought She gave fresh vigour to his arms and knees And to his breast the boldness of the fly Which oft repell d by man renews th assault Incessant lur d by taste of human blood Such boldness in Atrides manly breast Pallas inspir d beside Patroclus corpse Again he stood and pois d his glitt ring spear There was one Podes in the Trojan

flash his volleying thunder roar That shook the mountain and with vict ry crown d The Trojan arms and panic struck the Greeks The first who turn d to fly was Peneleus Boeotian chief him facing still

triumph has decreed Their weapons all by whomsoever thrown Or weak or strong attain their mark for Jove Directs their course while ours upon the plain Innocuous fall But take we counsel now How from the fray to bear away our dead And by our own return rejoice those friends Who look with sorrow on our plight and deem That we all pow rless to resist the might Of Hector s arm beside the ships must fall Would that some comrade were at hand to bear A message to Achilles him I ween As yet the mournful tidings have not reach d That on the field his dearest friend lies dead But such I see not for a veil of cloud O er men and horses all around is spread O Father Jove from o er the sons of Greece Remove this cloudy darkness clear the sky That we may see our fate and die at least If such thy will in th open light of day He said and pitying Jove beheld his tears The clouds he scatter d and the mist dispers d The sun shone forth and all the field was clear Then Ajax thus to Menelaus spoke Now Heav n born Menelaus look around If haply mid the living thou mayst see Antilochus the noble Nester s son And bid him to Achilles bear in haste The tidings that his dearest friend lies dead He said nor did Atrides not comply But slow as moves a lion from the fold Which dogs and youths with ceaseless toil hath worn Who all night long have kept their watch to guard From his assault the choicest of the herd He hunger pinch d hath oft th attempt renew d But nought prevail d by spears on ev ry side And jav lins met wielded by stalwart hands And blazing torches which his courage daunt Till with the morn he sullenly withdraws So from Patroclus with reluctant step Atrides mov d for much he fear d the Greeks Might to the Trojans panic struck the dead Abandon and departing he besought The two Ajaces and Meriones Ye two Ajaces leaders of the Greeks And thou Meriones remember now Our lost Patroclus gentle courtesy How kind and genial was his soul to all While yet he liv d now sunk alas in death Thus saying Menelaus took his way Casting his glance around on ev ry side Like to an eagle fam d of sharpest sight Of all that fly beneath the vault of Heav n Whom soaring in the clouds the crouching hare Eludes not though in leafiest covert hid But swooping down he rends her life away So Menelaus through the ranks of war Thy piercing glances ev ry way were turn d If Nestor s son alive thou mightst descry Him on the field s extremest left he found Cheering his friends and urging to the fight He stood beside him and address d him thus Antilochus come hither godlike friend And woful tidings hear which would to Heav n I had not to impart thyself thou seest How Jove hath heap d disaster on the Greeks And vict ry giv n to Troy but one has fallen Our bravest best Patroclus lies in death And deeply must the Greeks his loss deplore But haste thee to the ships to Peleus son The tidings bear if haply he may save The body of Patroclus from the foe His naked body for his arms are now The prize of Hector of the glancing helm He said and at his words Antilochus Astounded stood long time his tongue in vain For utt rance strove his eyes were fill d with tears His cheerful voice was mute yet not the less To Menelaus bidding gave his care Swiftly he sped but to Laodocus His comrade brave who waited with his car In close attendance first consign d his arms Then from the field with active limbs he flew Weeping with mournful news to Peleus son Nor noble Menelaus did thy heart Incline thee to remain and aid thy friends Where from their war worn ranks the Pylian troops Deplor d the absence of Antilochus But these in godlike Thrasymedes charge He left and to Patroclus hast ning back Beside th Ajaces stood as thus he spoke Him to Achilles to the ships in haste I have despatch d yet fiercely as his wrath May burn tow rd Hector I can scarce expect His presence here for how could he unarm d With Trojans fight But take we counsel now How from the field to bear away our dead And scape ourselves from death by Trojan hands Whom answer d thus great Ajax Telamon Illustrious Menelaus all thy words Are just and true then from amid the press Thou and Meriones take up in haste And bear away the body while behind We two in heart united as in name Who side by side have still been wont to fight Will Hector and his Trojans hold at bay He said they lifting in their arms the corpse Uprais d it high in air then from behind Loud yell d the Trojans as they saw the Greeks Retiring with their dead and on they rush d As dogs that in advance of hunter youths Pursue a wounded boar awhile they run Eager for blood but when in pride of strength He turns upon them backward they recoil This way and that in fear of death dispers d So onward press d awhile the Trojan crowd With thrust of swords and double pointed spears But ever as th Ajaces turn d to bay Their colour chang d to pale not one so bold As dashing on to battle for the corpse Thus they with anxious care from off the field Bore tow rd the ships their dead but on their track Came sweeping on the storm of battle fierce As on a sudden breaking forth the fire Seizes some populous city and devours House after house amid the glare and blaze While roar the flames before the gusty wind So fiercely pressed upon the Greeks retreat The clatt ring tramp of steeds and armed men But as the mules with stubborn strength endued That down the mountain through the trackless waste Drag some huge log or timber for the ships And spent with toil and sweat still labour on Unflinching so the Greeks with patient toil Bore on their dead th Ajaces in their rear Stemming the war as stems the torrent s force Some wooded cliff far stretching o er the plain Checking the mighty river s rushing stream And flinging it aside upon the plain Itself unbroken by the strength of flood So firmly in the rear th Ajaces stemm d The Trojan force yet these still onward press d And mid their comrades proudly eminent Two chiefs AEneas old Anchises son And glorious Hector in the van were seen Then as a cloud of starlings or of daws Fly screaming as they see the hawk approach To lesser birds the messenger of death So before Hector and AEneas fled Screaming forgetful of their warlike fame The sons of Greece and scatter d here and there Around the ditch lay store of goodly arms By Greeks abandon d in their hasty flight Yet still unintermitted rag d the war ARGUMENT THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by Antilochus Thetis hearing his lamentations comes with all her sea nymphs to comfort him The speeches of the mother and son on this occasion Iris appears to Achilles by command of Juno and orders him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments The sight of him turns the fortune of the day and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the Greeks The Trojans call a council where Hector and Polydamas disagree in their opinions but the advice of the former prevails to remain encamped in the field The grief of Achilles over the body of Patroclus Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son The description of the wonderful works of Vulcan and lastly that noble one of the shield of Achilles The latter part of the nine and twentieth day and the night ensuing take up this book The scene is at Achilles tent on the seashore from whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan BOOK XVIII Thus furious as the rage of fire they fought Meantime Antilochus to Peleus son Swift footed messenger his tidings bore Him by the high beak d ships he found his mind Th event presaging fill d with anxious thoughts As thus he commun d with his mighty heart Alas what means it that the long hair d Greeks Chas d from the plain are thronging round the ships Let me not now ye Gods endure the grief My mother once foretold that I should live To see the bravest of the Myrmidons Cut off by Trojans from the light of day Menoetius noble son has surely fall n Foolhardy yet I warn d him and besought Soon as the ships from hostile fires were safe Back to return nor Hector s onset meet While in his mind and spirit thus he mus d Beside him stood the noble Nestor s son And weeping thus his mournful message gave Alas great son of Peleus woful news Which would to Heav n I had not to impart To thee I bring Patroclus lies in death

seiz d And pour d upon his head the grimy dust Marring his graceful visage and defil d With black ning ashes all his costly robes Stretch d in the dust his lofty stature lay As with his hands his flowing locks he tore Loud was the wailing of the female band Achilles and Patroclus prize of war As round Achilles rushing out of doors Beating their breasts with tott ring limbs they press d In tears beside him stood Antilochus And in his own Achilles hand he held Groaning in spirit fearful lest for grief In his own bosom he should sheathe his sword Loud were his moans his Goddess mother heard Beside her aged father where she sat In the deep ocean caves she heard and wept The Nereids all in ocean s depths who dwell Encircled her around Cymodoce five Nesaee Spio and Cymothoe The stag ey d Halia and Amphithoe Actaea Limnorea Melite Doris and Galatea Panope There too were Oreithyia Clymene And Amathea with the golden hair And all the denizens of ocean s depths Fill d was the glassy cave in unison They beat their breasts as Thetis led the wail Give ear my sister Nereids all and learn How deep the grief that in my breast I bear Me miserable me of noblest son Unhappiest mother me a son who bore My brave my beautiful of heroes chief Like a young tree he throve I tended him In a rich vineyard as the choicest plant Till in the beaked ships I sent him forth To war with Troy him ne

dearest child and learn What grief hath reach d him from the war withdrawn She said and left the cave with her they went Weeping before them parted th ocean wave But when they reach d the fertile shore of Troy In order due they landed on the beach Where frequent round Achilles swift of foot Were moor d the vessels of the Myrmidons There as he groan d aloud beside him stood His Goddess mother weeping in her hands She held his head while pitying thus she spoke Why weeps my son and what his cause of grief Speak out and nought conceal for all thy pray r Which with uplifted hands thou mad saint to Jove He hath fulfill d that flying to their ships The routed sons of Greece should feel how much They need thine aid and mourn their insult past To whom Achilles deeply groaning thus Mother all this indeed hath Jove fulfill d Yet what avails it since my dearest friend Is slain Patroclus whom I honour d most Of all my comrades lov d him as my soul Him have I lost and Hector from his corpse Hath stripp d those arms those weighty beauteous arms A marvel to behold which from the Gods Peleus receiv d a glorious gift that day When they consign d thee to a mortal s bed How better were it if thy lot had been Still mid the Ocean deities to dwell And Peleus had espous d a mortal bride For now is bitter grief for thee in store Mourning thy son whom to his home return d Thou never more shalt see nor would I wish To live and move amid my fellow men Unless that Hector vanquish d by my spear May lose his forfeit life and pay the price Of foul dishonour to Patroclus done To whom her tears o erflowing Thetis thus E en as thou sayst my son thy term is short Nor long shall Hector s fate precede thine own Achilles answ ring spoke in passionate grief Would I might die this hour who fail d to save My comrade slain far from his native land He died sore needing my protecting arm And I who ne er again must see my home Nor to Patroclus nor the many Greeks Whom Hector s hand hath

violence provokes E en temp rate souls though sweeter be its taste Than dropping honey in the heart of man Swelling like smoke such anger in my soul Hath Agamemnon kindled King of men But pass we that though still my heart be sore Yet will I school my angry spirit down In search of Hector now of him who slew My friend I go prepar d to meet my death When Jove shall will it and th Immortals all From death not e en the might of Hercules Though best belov d of Saturn s son could fly By fate and Juno s bitter wrath subdued I too since such my doom must lie in death Yet ere I die immortal fame will win And from their delicate cheeks deep bosom d dames Dardan and Trojan bitter tears shall wipe And groan in anguish then shall all men know How long I have been absent from the field Then though thou love me seek not from the war To stay my steps for bootless were thy speech Whom answer d thus the silver footed Queen True are thy words my son and good it is And commendable from the stroke of death To save a worsted comrade but thine arms Thy brazen flashing arms the Trojans hold Them Hector of the glancing helm himself Bears on his breast exulting yet not long Shall be his triumph for his doom is nigh But thou engage not in the toils of war Until thine eyes again behold me here For with to morrow s sun will I return With arms of heav nly mould by Vulcan wrought Thus saying from her son she turn d away And turning to her sister Nereids spoke Back to the spacious bosom of the deep Retire ye now and to my father s house The aged Ocean God your tidings bear While I to high Olympus speed to crave At Vulcan s hand the skill d artificer A boon of dazzling armour for my son She said and they beneath the ocean wave Descended while to high Olympus sped The silver footed Goddess thence in hope To bear the dazzling armour to her son She to Olympus sped the Greeks meanwhile Before the warrior slayer Hector fled With wild tumultuous uproar till they reach d Their vessels and the shore of Hellespont Nor had the well greav d Greets Achilles friend Patroclus from amid the fray withdrawn For close upon him follow d horse and man And Hector son of Priam fierce as flame Thrice noble Hector seizing from behind Sought by the feet to drag away the dead Cheering his friends thrice clad in warlike might The two Ajaces drove him from his prey Yet fearless in his strength now rushing on He dash d amid the fray now shouting loud Stood firm but backward not a step retir d As from a carcase herdsmen strive in vain To scare a tawny lion hunger pinch d E en so th Ajaces mail clad warriors

sent Unknown to Jove and to th Immortals all She stood beside him and address d him thus Up son of Peleus up thou prince of men Haste to Patroclus rescue whom around Before the ships is wag d a fearful war With mutual slaughter these the dead defending And those to Ilium s breezy heights intent To bear the body noble Hector chief Who longs to sever from the tender neck And fix upon the spikes thy comrade s head Up then delay no longer deem it shame Patroclus corpse should glut the dogs of Troy Dishon ring thee if aught dishonour him Whom answer d thus Achilles swift of foot Say heav

Olympus snowy summit dwell To whom again Achilles swift of foot How in the battle toil can I engage My arms are with the Trojans and to boot My mother warn d me not to arm for fight Till I again should see her for she hop d To bring me heav nly arms by Vulcan wrought Nor know I well whose armour I could wear Save the broad shield of Ajax Telamon And he methinks amid the foremost ranks Ev n now is fighting o er Patroclus corpse Whom answer d storm swift Iris Well we know Thy glorious arms are by the Trojans held But go thou forth and from above the ditch Appear before them daunted at the sight Haply the Trojans may forsake the field And breathing time afford the sons of Greece Toil worn for little pause has yet been theirs Swift Iris said and vanish d then uprose Achilles dear to Jove and Pallas threw Her tassell d aegis o er his shoulders broad His head encircling with a coronet Of golden cloud whence fiery flashes gleam d As from an island city up to Heav n The smoke ascends which hostile forces round Beleaguer and all day with cruel war From its own state cut off but when the sun Hath set blaze frequent forth the beacon fires High rise the flames and to the dwellers round Their signal flash if haply o er the sea May come the needful aid so brightly flash d That fiery light around Achilles head He left the wall and stood above the ditch But from the Greeks apart rememb ring well His mother s prudent counsel there he stood And shouted loudly Pallas join d her voice And fill d with terror all the Trojan host Clear as the trumpet s sound which calls to arms Some town encompass d round with hostile bands Rang out the voice of great AEacides But when Achilles voice of brass they heard They quail d in spirit the sleek skin d steeds themselves Conscious of coming ill bore back the cars Their charioteers dismay d beheld the flame Which kindled by the blue ey d Goddess blaz d Unquench d around the head of Peleus son Thrice shouted from the ditch the godlike chief Thrice terror struck both Trojans and Allies And there and then beside their chariots fell Twelve of their bravest while the Greeks well pleas d Patroclus body from the fray withdrew And on a litter laid around him stood His comrades mourning with them Peleus son Shedding hot tears as on his friend he gaz d Laid on the bier and pierc d with deadly wounds Him to the war with horses and with

fear had fallen on all when reappear d Achilles from the battle long withdrawn First Panthous son the sage Polydamas Address d th assembly his sagacious mind Alone beheld the future and the past The friend of Hector born the selfsame night One in debate the other best in arms Who thus with prudent speech began and said Be well advis d my friends my counsel is That we regain the city nor the morn Here in the plain beside the ships await So far remov d from our protecting walls While fiercely burn d gainst Atreus godlike son That mighty warrior s wrath twas easier far With th other Greeks to deal and I rejoic d When by the ships we pass d the night in hopes We soon might call them ours but now I own Achilles swift of foot excites my fear His proud impetuous spirit will spurn the plain Where Greeks and Trojans oft in warlike strife Their balanc d strength exert if he come forth Our fight will be to guard our homes and wives Gain we the city trust me so twere best Now for a while ambrosial night detains The son of Peleus but at early morn If issuing forth in arms he find us here His prowess we shall know and happy he Who flying shall in safety reach the walls Of sacred Troy for many a Trojan slain Shall feed the vultures Heav n avert such fate But if though loth ye will by me be rul d This night in council husband we our strength While tow rs and lofty gates and folding doors Close join d well fitting shall our city guard Then issuing forth in arms at early morn Man we the tow rs so harder were his task If from the ships advancing round the wall He offer battle bootless to return His strong neck d horses worn with labour vain In coursing purposeless around the town To force an entrance or the town destroy Is not his aim and ere that end be gain d The dogs of Troy upon his flesh shall feed To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm With stern regard Polydamas thy words Are such as grate unkindly on mine ear Who fain wouldst have us to the walls retire What have ye not already long enough Been coop d within the tow rs the wealth of Troy Its brass its gold were once the common theme Of ev ry tongue our hoarded treasures now Are gone to Phrygian and Maeonian shores For sale exported costly merchandise Since on our city fell the wrath of Jove And now when deep designing Saturn s son Such glory gives me as to gain the ships And crowded by the sea hem in the Greeks Fool put not thou these timid counsels forth Which none will follow nor will I allow But hear ye all and do as I advise Share now the meal by ranks throughout the host Then set your watch and each keep careful guard And whom his spoils o erload if such there be Let him divide them with the general ral crowd Better that they should hold them than the Greeks And with the morn in arms beside the ships Will we again awake the furious war But if indeed Achilles by the ships Hath reappear d himself if so he choose Shall be the suff rer from the perilous strife I will not shrink but his encounter meet So he or I shall gain immortal fame Impartial Mars hath oft the slayer slain Thus Hector spoke the Trojans cheer d aloud Fools and by Pallas of their sense bereft Who all applauded Hector s ill advice None the sage counsel of Polydamas Then through the camp they shar d the ev ning meal Meantime the Greeks all night with tears and groans Bewail d Patroclus on his comrade s breast Achilles laid his murder dealing hands And led with bitter groans the loud lament As when the hunters in the forest s depth Have robb d a bearded lion of his cubs Too late arriving he

alas the promise which I gave Seeking the brave Menoetius to console To bring to Opus back his gallant son Rich with his share of spoil from Troy o erthrown But Jove fulfils not all that man designs For us hath fate decreed that here in Troy We two one soil should redden with our blood Nor me returning to my native land Shall aged Peleus in his halls receive Nor Thetis here must earth retain my bones But since Patroclus I am doom d on earth Behind thee to remain thy fun ral rites I will not celebrate till Hector s arms And head thy haughty slayer s here I bring And on thy pyre twelve noble

commands him to assemble the army to declare his resentment at an end Agamemnon and Achilles are solemnly reconciled the speeches presents and ceremonies on that occasion Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of Ulysses The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles where Briseis laments over the body of Patroclus The hero obstinately refuses all repast and gives himself up to lamentations for his friend Minerva descends to strengthen him by the order of Jupiter He arms for the fight his appearance described He addresses himself to his horses and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus One of them is miraculously endued with voice and inspired to prophesy his fate but the hero not astonished

Lord of all around Who on this day shall be of woman born Of mortal men who trace to thee their blood She said and Jove the snare unseeing swore A solemn oath but found his error soon Down from Olympus height she sped in haste To Argos of Achaia for the wife Of Sthenelus the son of Perseus there She knew was sev n months pregnant of a son Whom though untimely born she brought to light Staying meanwhile Alcmena s labour pangs To Saturn s son herself the tidings brought And thus address d him Jove the lightning s Lord I bring thee news this day a mighty man By thee ordain d to be the

the ships of food and wine Wherein are strength and courage first partake For none throughout the day till set of sun Fasting from food may bear the toils of war His spirit may still be eager for the fray Yet are his limbs by slow degrees weigh d down Himself by thirst and hunger worn his knees Unable as he moves to bear his weight But he who first with food and wine refresh d All day maintains the combat with the foe His spirit retains unbroken and his limbs Unwearied till both armies quit the field Disperse then now the crowd and bid prepare The morning meal meantime to public view Let Agamemnon King of men display His costly gifts that all the Greeks may see And that thy heart within thee melt with joy And there in full assembly let him swear A solemn oath that he hath ne er

there Neptune sat And with him the other Gods a veil of cloud Impenetrable around their shoulders spread On th other side upon the fair hill s brow Phoebus with Mars the fort destroyer sat On either

Anchises son AEneas and Achilles godlike might AEneas first with threat ning mien advanc d Nodding his pond rous helm before his breast His shield he bore and pois d his brazen spear Him met Achilles from th opposing ranks Fierce as a rav ning lion whom to slay Pour forth the stalwart youths th united strength Of the rous d village he unheeding moves At first but wounded by a jav lin thrown By some bold youth he turns with gaping jaws And frothing fangs collecting for the spring His breast too narrow for his mighty heart And with his tail he lashes both his flanks And sides as though to rouse his utmost rage Then on in pride of strength with glaring eyes He dashes if some hunter he may slay Or in the foremost rank himself be slain So mov d his dauntless spirit Peleus son AEneas to confront when near they came Thus first Achilles swift of foot began AEneas why so far before the ranks Advanc d dost thou presume with me to fight Perchance expecting that the throne of Troy And Priam s royal honours may be thine E en if thou slay me deem not to obtain Such boon from Priam valiant sons are his And he not weak but bears a constant mind Or have the Trojans set apart for thee Some favour d spot the fairest of the land Orchard or corn land shouldst thou work my death Which thou shalt find I trust too hard a task Already hast thou fled before my spear Hast thou forgotten how amid thy herds Alone I found thee and with flying foot Pursued thee down the steep of Ida s hill Nor didst thou dare to turn or pause in flight Thou to Lyrnessus fledd saint Lyrnessus I With Pallas aid and Jove s assail d and took Their women thence their days of freedom lost I bore away my captives thee from death Jove and the other Gods defended then But will not now bestow though such thy hope Their succour then I warn thee while tis time Ere ill betide thee to the general ral throng That thou withdraw nor stand to me oppos d After th event may e en a fool be wise To whom in answer thus AEneas spoke Achilles think not me as though a fool To daunt with lofty speech I too could well With cutting words and insult answer thee Each other s race and parents well we know From tales of ancient days although by sight Nor mine to thee nor thine to me are known To noble Peleus thou tis said wast born Of Thetis fair hair d daughter of the sea Of great Anchises Heav n descended chief I boast me sprung to him by Venus borne Of these shall one or other have this day To mourn their son since not with empty words Shall thou and I from mortal combat part But if thou farther wouldst enquire and learn The race I spring from not unknown to men By Dardanus of cloud compelling Jove Begotten was Dardania peopled first Ere sacred Ilium populous city of men Was founded on the plain as yet they dwelt On spring abounding Ida s lowest spurs To Dardanus was Erichthonius born Great King the wealthiest of the sons of men For him were pastur d in the marshy mead Rejoicing with their foals three thousand mares Them Boreas in the pasture where they fed Beheld enamour d and amid the herd In likeness of a coal black steed appear d Twelve foals by him conceiving they produc d These o er the teeming corn fields as they flew Skimm d o er the standing ears nor broke the haulm And o er wide Ocean s bosom as they flew Skimm d o er the topmost spray of th hoary sea Again to Erichthonius Tros was born The King of Troy three noble sons were his Ilus Assaracus and Ganymede The fairest he of all the sons of men Him for his beauty bore the Gods away To minister as cup bearer to Jove And dwell amid th Immortals Ilus next Begot a noble son Laomedon Tithonus he and Priam Clytius Lampus and Icetaon plant of Mars Capys begotten of Assaracus Begot Anchises and Anchises me To Priam godlike Hector owes his birth Such is my race and such the blood I boast But Jove at will to mortals valour gives Or minishes for he is Lord of all Then cease we now like babbling fools to prate Here in the centre of the coming fight Terms of reproach we both might find whose weight Would sink a galley of a hundred oars For glibly runs the tongue and can at will Give utt rance to discourse in ev ry vein Wide is the range of language and such words As one may speak another may return What need that we should insults interchange Like women who some paltry quarrel wage Scolding and brawling in the public street And in opprobrious terms their anger vent Some true some false for so their rage suggests With words thou shalt not turn me from the field Till we have met in arms then try we now Each other s prowess with our brazen spears He said and hurl d against the mighty shield His brazen spear loud rang the weapon s point And at arm s length Achilles held the shield With his broad hand in fear that through its folds AEneas spear would easy passage find Blind fool forgetful that the glorious gifts Bestow d by Gods are not with ease o ercome Nor yield before th assaults of mortal men So broke not through AEneas sturdy spear Stay d by the golden plate the gift of Heav n Yet through two plates it pass d but three remain d For five were in the shield by Vulcan wrought Two were of brass the inner two of tin And one of gold which stay d the brazen spear Achilles threw in turn his pond rous spear And struck the circle of AEneas shield Near the first rim where thinnest lay the brass And thinnest too th o erlying hide right through The Pelian shaft was driv n wide gap d the shield AEneas crouch d in fear as o er his head He held his shield the eager weapon pass d Through both the circles of his ample shield And in the ground behind him quiv ring stood Escap d the pond rous weapon sharpest pain Flashing across his eyes in fear he stood So close the spear had pass d him onward then Drawing his trenchant blade Achilles rush d With fearful shout a rocky fragment then AEneas lifted up a mighty mass Which scarce two men as men are now could bear But he unaided lifted it with ease Then had AEneas with the massive stone Or on the helmet or the shield his death Averting struck Achilles and himself Had by the sword of Peleus son been slain Had not th Earth shaking God his peril seen And to th Immortals thus address d his speech Oh woe is me for great AEneas sake Who by Achilles slain must visit soon The viewless shades insensate who relied On Phoebus words yet nought shall he avail From death to save him Yet oh why should he Blameless himself the guilt of others rue Who still his grateful sacrifice hath paid To all the Gods in wide spread Heav n who dwell Let us then interpose to guard his life Lest if Achilles slay him Saturn s son Be mov d to anger for his destiny Would have him live lest heirless from the earth Should perish quite the race of Dardanus By Saturn s son the best belov d of all His sons to him by mortal women born For Jove the race of Priam hath abhorr d But o er the Trojans shall AEneas reign And his sons sons through ages yet unborn Whom answer d thus the stag ey d Queen of Heav n Neptune do thou determine for thyself AEneas to withdraw or leave to fall Good as he is beneath Achilles sword But we before th immortal Gods are bound Both I and Pallas

And through the throng of spears until he came Where great Achilles and AEneas stood Around the eyes of Peleus son he spread A veil of mist then from AEneas shield The brass tipp d spear withdrawing laid it down Before Achilles feet and lifting up AEneas bore him high above the ground O er many a rank of warriors and of cars AEneas flew supported by the God Till to the field s extremest verge he

to contend Thy stronger far and dearer to the Gods If e er he cross thy path do thou retire Lest e en despite of fate thou find thy death But when Achilles hath to fate succumb d Then fearless with the foremost join the fray No other Greek shall bear away thy spoils Thus plainly warn d AEneas there he left Then from Achilles eyes he purg d the film Astonish d he with eyes wide open gaz d As thus he commun d with his mighty heart O Heav n what marvel do mine eyes behold My spear before me laid and vanish d he At whom I hurl d it with intent to slay Then is AEneas of th immortal Gods In truth belov d though vain I deem d his boast A curse go with him yet methinks not soon Will he again presume to prove my might Who gladly now in flight escapes from death Then to the valiant Greeks my orders giv n Let me some other Trojan s mettle prove Then tow rd the ranks he sprang each sev ral man Exhorting From the Trojans valiant Greeks No longer stand aloof but man to man Confront the foe and nobly dare the fight Twere hard for me brave warrior though I be To face such numbers and to fight with all Not Mars nor Pallas though immortal Gods Could face and vanquish such a mighty mass But what my single arm and feet and strength May profit not a jot will I relax Right through the ranks I mean to force my way And small shall be that Trojan s cause for joy Who comes within the compass of my spear Thus he exhorting Hector cheering on Meanwhile the Trojans with assurance giv n That he himself Achilles would confront Ye valiant Trojans fear not Peleus son I too in words could with the Gods contend Though not in arms so much the stronger they Not all his words Achilles shall make good Fulfilling some in others he shall fail His course midway arrested Him will I Encounter though his hands were hands of fire Of fire his hands his strength as burnish d steel Thus he exhorting with uplifted spears Advanc d the Trojans from the mingling hosts Loud rose the clamour then at Hector s side Apollo stood and thus address d the chief Hector forbear Achilles to defy And mid the crowd withdraw thee from the fray Lest with the spear he slay thee thrown from far Or with the sword in combat hand to hand He said and troubled by the heav nly voice Hector amid the throng of men withdrew Then girt with might amid the Trojans sprang With fearful shouts Achilles first he slew Otryntes son Iphition valiant chief Of num rous warriors him a Naiad nymph In Hyde s fertile vale beneath the feet Of snow clad Tmolus to Otryntes bore At him as on he rush d Achilles hurl d And through his

waves Neptune and Pallas assist the hero Simois joins Scamander at length Vulcan by the instigation of Juno almost dries up the river This combat ended the other gods engage each other Meanwhile Achilles continues the slaughter and drives the rest into Troy Agenor only makes a stand and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo who to delude Achilles takes upon him Agenor s shape and while he pursues him in that disguise gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into their city The same day continues The scene is on the banks and in the stream of Scamander BOOK XXI But when they came to

his grasp a fourth attempt He made to bend and break the sturdy shaft But him preventing Peleus godlike son With deadly stroke across the belly smote And gush d his bowels forth upon the ground Gasping he lay and darkness seal d his eyes Then on his breast Achilles sprang and stripp d His armour off and thus with vaunting speech So lie thou there tis hard for thee to fight Though river born against the progeny Of mighty Jove a widely flowing stream Thou claim saint as author of thy parentage My high descent from Jove himself I boast My father Peleus son of AEacus Reigns o er the num rous race of Myrmidons The son of Jove himself was AEacus High o er all rivers that to th ocean flow Is Jove exalted and in like degree Superior is his race in pow r to theirs A mighty River hast thou here at hand If that might aught avail thee but his pow r Is impotent to strive with Saturn s son With him not Achelous King of streams Presumes to vie nor e en the mighty strength Of deeply flowing wide Oceanus From whom all rivers all the boundless sea All fountains all deep wells derive their source Yet him appals the lightning bolt of Jove And thunder pealing from the vault of Heav n He said and from the cliff withdrew his spear Him left he lifeless there upon the sand Extended o er him the dark waters wash d And eels and fishes thronging gnaw d his flesh Then mid the Paeons plumed host he rush d Who fled along the eddying stream when him Their bravest in the stubborn fight they saw Slain by the sword and arm of Peleus son Thersilochus and Mydon then he slew Mnesus and Thrasius and Astypylus AEnius and Ophelestes and yet more Had been the slaughter by Achilles wrought But from his eddying depths in human form With wrathful tone the mighty River spoke In strength Achilles and in deeds of arms All mortals thou surpassest for the Gods Themselves attend thee and protect from harm If Saturn s son have given thee utterly The Trojans to destroy yet ere thou slay Far from my waters drive them o er the plain For now my lovely stream is fill d with dead Nor can I pour my current to the sea With floating corpses chok d whilst thou pursuest The work of death insatiate stay thy hand With horror I behold thee mighty chief Whom answer d thus Achilles swift of foot Be it as thou wilt Scamander Heav n born stream Yet cease I not to slay until I drive These vaunting Trojans to their walls and prove The force of Hector if in single fight I be by him or he by me subdued He said and fiercely on the Trojans rush d A God in might to Phoebus then his speech The deeply eddying River thus address d God of the silver bow great son of Jove Obey saint thou thus the will of Saturn s son Who charg d thee by the Trojans still to stand And aid their cause till ev ning s late approach Should cast its shadows o er the fertile earth Thus as he spoke from off the lofty bank Achilles springing in mid current plung d Then high the swelling stream tumultuous rose In all its angry flood and with a roar As of a bellowing bull cast forth to land The num rous corpses by Achilles slain And many living in his cavern d bed Conceal d behind the whirling waters sav d Fierce round Achilles rose the boiling wave And on his shield descending drove him down Nor might he keep his foothold but he grasp d A lofty elm well grown which from the cliff Uprooted all the bank had torn away And with its tangled branches check d the flow Of the fair river which with all its length It bridg d across then springing from the deep Swiftly he fled in terror o er the plain Nor ceas d the mighty River but pursued With darkly ruffling crest intent to stay Achilles course and save the Trojan host Far as a jav lin s flight he rush d in speed Like the dark hunter eagle strongest deem d And swiftest wing d of all the feather d race So on he sped loud rattled on his breast His brazen armour as before the God Cow ring he fled the God behind him still With thund ring sound pursued As when a man From some dark water d spring through trenches leads Mid plants and gardens th irrigating stream And spade in hand th appointed channel clears Down flows the stream anon its pebbly bed Disturbing fast it flows with bubbling sound Down the steep slope o ertaking him who leads Achilles so th advancing wave o ertook Though great his speed but man must yield to Gods Oft as Achilles swift of foot essay d To turn and stand and know if all the Gods Who dwell in Heav n were leagued to daunt his soul So oft the Heav n born River s mighty wave Above his shoulders dash d in deep distress He sprang on high then rush d the flood below And bore him off his legs and wore away The soil beneath his feet then groaning thus As up to Heav n he look d Achilles cried O Father Jove will none of all the Gods In pity save me from this angry flood Content thereafter would I meet my fate Of all the pow rs of Heav n my mother most Hath wrong d me who hath buoy d me up with hope Delusive that before the walls of Troy I should by Phoebus swift wing d arrows fall Would that by Hector s hand twere mine to die The bravest of their brave a warrior so Were by a warrior slain now am I doom d Ignobly here to sink the mighty flood O erwhelming me like some poor shepherd lad Borne down in crossing by a wintry brook He said and quickly cloth d in mortal form Neptune and Pallas at his side appear d With cheering words they took him by the hand And thus th Earth shaking God his speech began Achilles fear not thou nor be dismay d Such pow rful aid by Jove s consent we bring Pallas and I from Heav n tis not decreed That thou shouldst by the River be o erwhelm d He shall retire ere long and thou shalt see And more if thou wilt hear we undertake That from the war thine arm shall not be stay d Till thou shalt drive beneath the walls of Troy The crowd of flying Trojans thou thyself Shalt Hector slay and safe regain the ships Such high renown we give thee to achieve They to the other Gods this said return d He greatly strengthen d by the voice divine Press d onwards to the plain the plain he found All flooded o er and floating armour fair And many a corpse of men in battle slain Yet onward lifting high his feet he press d Right tow rd the stream nor could the mighty stream Check his advance such vigour Pallas gave Nor did Scamander yet his fury stay But fiercer rose his rage and rearing high His crested wave to Simois thus he cried Dear brother aid me with united force This mortal s course to check he unrestrain d Will royal Priam s city soon destroy Nor will the Trojans his assault endure Haste to the rescue then and from their source Fill all thy stream and all thy channels swell Rouse thy big waves and roll a torrent down Of logs and stones to whelm this man of might Who triumphs now and bears him as a God Nought shall his strength or beauty then avail Or gallant arms beneath the waters sunk Deep buried in the mud himself will I In sand imbed and o er his corpse a pile Of shingly gravel heap nor shall the Greeks Be able to collect his bones encas d By me so deep in slime His monument They here may raise but when they celebrate His fun ral rites no mound will he require He said and on Achilles from on high Came boiling rushing down with thund ring roar With foam and blood and corpses intermix d High rose the Heav n born River s darkling wave And bore Achilles downward then in fear Lest the broad waters of the eddying stream Should quite o erwhelm him Juno cried aloud And Vulcan thus her son in haste address d Up Vulcan up my son for we had deem d That eddying Xanthus

no God against thy pow r can stand Nor with thy fiery flames will I contend Restrain thy wrath though Peleus godlike son Should from their city drive the Trojans straight With rival parties what

he flies Achilles pursues him thrice round the walls of Troy The gods debate concerning the fate of Hector at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles She deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus he stands the combat and is slain Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of Priam and Hecuba Their lamentations tears and despair Their cries reach the ears of Andromache who ignorant of this was retired into the inner part of the palace she mounts up to the walls and beholds her dead husband She swoons at the spectacle Her excess of grief and lamentation The thirtieth

Greece There rac d they one in flight and one pursuing Good he who fled but better who pursu d With fiery speed for on that race was stak d No common victim no ignoble ox The prize at stake was mighty Hector s life As when the solid footed horses fly Around the course contending for the prize Tripod or woman of her lord bereft So rac d they thrice around the walls of Troy With active feet and all the Gods beheld Then thus began the Sire of Gods and men A woful sight mine eyes behold a man I love in flight around the walls my heart For Hector grieves who now upon the crown Of deeply furrow d Ida now again On Ilium s heights with fat of choicest bulls Hath pil d mine altar whom around the walls With flying speed Achilles now pursues Give me your counsel Gods and say from death If we shall rescue him or must he die Brave as he is beneath Pelides hand To whom the blue ey d Goddess Pallas thus O Father lightning flashing cloud girt King What words are these wouldst thou a mortal man Long doom d by fate again from death preserve Do as thou wilt but not with our consent To whom the Cloud compeller thus replied Be of good cheer my child unwillingly I speak yet both thy wishes to oppose Have then thy will and draw not back thy hand His words fresh impulse gave to Pallas zeal And from Olympus heights in haste she sped Meanwhile on Hector with untiring hate The swift Achilles press d as when a hound Through glen and tangled brake pursues a fawn Rous d from its lair upon the mountain side And if awhile it should evade pursuit Low crouching in the copse yet quests he back Searching unwearied till he find the trace So Hector sought to baffle but in vain The keen pursuit of Peleus active son Oft as he sought the shelter of the gates Beneath the well built tow rs if haply thence His comrades weapons might some aid afford So oft his foeman with superior speed Would cut him off and turn him to the plain He tow rd the city still essay d his flight And as in dreams when one pursues in vain One seeks in vain to fly the other seeks As vainly to pursue so could not now Achilles reach nor Hector quit his foe Yet how should Hector now the doom of death Have scap d had not Apollo once again And for the last time to his rescue come And giv n him strength and suppleness of limb Then to the crowd Achilles with his head Made sign that none at Hector should presume To cast a spear lest one might wound and so The greater glory obtain while he himself Must be contented with the second place But when the fourth time in their rapid course The founts were reach d th Eternal Father hung His golden scales aloft and plac d in each The lots of doom for great Achilles one For Hector one and held them by the midst Down sank the scale weighted with Hector s death Down to the shades and Phoebus left his side Then to Pelides came the blue ey d Maid And stood beside him and bespoke him thus Achilles lov d of Heav n I trust that now To thee and me great glory shall accrue In Hector s fall insatiate of the fight Escape he cannot now though at the feet Of aegis bearing Jove on his behalf With earnest pray r Apollo prostrate fall But stay thou here and take thy breath while I Persuade him to return and dare the fight So Pallas spoke and he with joy obeying Stood leaning on his brass barb d ashen spear The Goddess left him there and went the form And voice assuming of Deiphobus In search of godlike Hector him she found And standing near with winged words address d Sorely good brother hast thou been bested By fierce Achilles who around the walls Hath chas d thee with swift foot now stand we both For mutual succour and his onset wait To whom great Hector of the glancing helm Deiphobus of all my brothers sons Of Hecuba and Priam thou hast been Still dearest to my heart and now the more I honour thee who dar saint on my behalf Seeing my peril from within the walls To sally forth while others skulk behind To whom the blue ey d Goddess thus replied With many pray rs good brother both our sire And honour d mother and our comrades all Successively implored me to remain Such fear is fall n on all but in my soul On thine account too deep a grief I felt Now forward boldly spare we not our spears Make trial if Achilles to the ships From both of us our bloody spoils can bear Or by thine arm himself may be subdued Thus Pallas lur d him on with treach rous wile But when the two were met and close at hand First spoke great Hector of the glancing helm No more before thee Peleus son I fly Thrice have I fled around the walls nor dar d Await thine onset now my spirit is rous d To stand before thee to be slain or slay But let us first th immortal Gods invoke The surest witnesses and guardians they Of compacts at my hand no foul disgrace Shalt thou sustain if Jove with victory Shall crown my firm endurance and thy life To me be forfeit of thine armour stripp d I promise thee Achilles to the Greeks Thy body to restore do thou the like With fierce regard Achilles answer d thus Hector thou object of my deadly hate Talk not to me of compacts as tween men And lions no firm concord can exist Nor wolves and lambs in harmony unite But ceaseless enmity between them dwells So not in friendly terms nor compact firm Can thou and I unite till one of us Glut with his blood the mail clad warrior Mars Mind thee of all thy fence behoves thee now To prove a spearman skill d and warrior brave For thee escape is none now by my spear Hath Pallas doom d thy death my comrades blood Which thou hast shed shall all be now aveng d He said and poising hurl d his weighty spear But Hector saw and shunn d the blow he stoop d And o er his shoulder flew the brass tipp d spear And in the ground was fix d but Pallas drew The weapon forth and to Achilles hand All unobserv d of Hector gave it back Then Hector thus to Peleus matchless son Thine aim has fail d nor truly has my fate Thou godlike son of Peleus been to thee From Heav n reveal d such was indeed thy boast But flippant was thy speech and subtly fram d To scare me with big words and make me prove False to my wonted prowess and renown Not in my back will I receive thy spear But through my breast confronting thee if Jove Have to thine arm indeed such triumph giv n Now if thou canst my spear in turn elude May it be deeply buried in thy flesh For lighter were to Troy the load of war If thou the greatest of her foes wert slain He said and poising hurl d his pond rous spear Nor miss d his aim full in the midst he struck Pelides shield but glancing from the shield The weapon bounded off Hector was griev d That thus his spear had bootless left his hand He stood aghast no second spear was nigh And loudly on Deiphobus he call d A spear to bring but he was far away Then Hector knew that he was dup d and cried Oh Heav n the Gods above have doom d my death I deem d indeed that brave Deiphobus Was near at hand but he within the walls Is safe and I by Pallas am betray d Now is my death at hand nor far away Escape is none since so hath Jove decreed And Jove s far darting son who heretofore Have been my guards my fate hath found me now Yet not without a struggle let me die Nor all inglorious but let some great act Which future days may hear of mark my fall Thus as he spoke his sharp edged sword he drew Pond rous and vast suspended at his side Collected for the spring and forward dash d As when an eagle bird of loftiest flight Through the dark clouds swoops downward on the plain To seize some tender lamb or cow ring hare So Hector rush d and wav d his sharp edg d sword Achilles wrath was rous d with fury wild His soul was fill d before his breast he bore His well wrought shield and fiercely on his brow Nodded the four plum d helm as on the breeze Floated the golden hairs with which the crest By Vulcan s hand was thickly interlac d And as amid the stars unnumber d host When twilight yields to night one star appears Hesper the brightest star that shines in Heav n Gleam d the sharp pointed lance which in his right Achilles pois d on godlike Hector s doom Intent and scanning eagerly to see Where from attack his body least was fenc d All else the glitt ring armour guarded well Which Hector from Patroclus corpse had stripp d One chink appear d just where the collar bone The neck and shoulder parts beside the throat Where lies expos d the swiftest road of death There levell d he as Hector onward rush d Right through the yielding neck the lance was driv n But sever d not the windpipe nor destroy d His pow r of speech prone in the dust he fell And o er him vaunting thus Achilles spoke Hector Patroclus stripping of his arms Thy hope was that thyself wast safe and I Not present brought no terror to thy soul Fool in the hollow ships I yet remain d I his avenger mightier far than he I who am now thy conqu ror By the dogs And vultures shall thy corpse be foully torn While him the Greeks with fun ral rites shall grace Whom answer d Hector of the glancing helm Prostrate and helpless By thy soul thy knees Thy parents heads Achilles I beseech Let not my corpse by Grecian dogs be torn Accept the ample stores of brass and gold Which as my ransom by my honour d sire And mother shall be paid thee but my corpse Restore that so the men and wives of Troy May deck with honours due my fun ral pyre To whom with fierce aspect Achilles thus Knee me no knees vile hound nor prate to me Of parents such my hatred that almost I could persuade myself to tear and eat Thy mangled flesh such wrongs I have to avenge He lives not who can save thee from the dogs Not though with ransom ten and twenty fold He here should stand and yet should promise more No not though Priam s royal self should sue To be allow d for gold to ransom thee No not e en so thy mother shall obtain To lay thee out upon the couch and mourn O er thee her offspring but on all thy limbs Shall dogs and carrion vultures make their feast To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm Dying I know thee well nor did I hope To change thy purpose iron is thy soul But see that on thy head I bring not down The wrath of Heav n when by the Scaean gate The hand of Paris with Apollo s aid Brave warrior as thou art shall strike thee down E en as he spoke his eyes were clos d in death And to the viewless shades his spirit fled Mourning his fate his youth and vigour lost To him though dead Achilles thus replied Die thou my fate I then shall meet whene er Jove and th immortal Gods shall so decree He said and from the corpse his spear withdrew And laid aside then stripp d the armour off With blood besmear d the Greeks around him throng d Gazing on Hector s noble form and face And none approach d that did not add a wound And one to other look d and said Good faith Hector is easier far to handle now Then when erewhile he wrapp d our ships in fire Thus would they say then stab the dead anew But when the son of Peleus swift of foot Had stripp d the armour from the corpse he rose And standing thus th assembled Greeks address d O friends the chiefs and councillors of Greece Since Heav n hath granted us this man to slay Whose single arm hath wrought us more of ill Than all the rest combin d advance we now Before the city in arms and trial make What is the mind of Troy if Hector slain They from the citadel intend retreat Or still despite their loss their ground maintain But wherefore entertain such thoughts my soul Beside the ships unwept unburied lies Patroclus whom I never can forget While number d with the living and my limbs Have pow r to move in Hades though the dead May be forgotten yet e en there will I The mem ry of my lov d companion keep Now to the ships return we sons of Greece Glad paeans singing with us he shall go Great glory is ours the godlike Hector slain The pride of Troy and as a God rever d He said and foully Hector s corpse misus d Of either foot he pierc d the tendon through That from the ancle passes to the heel And to his chariot bound with leathern thongs Leaving the head to trail along the ground Then mounted with the captur d arms his car And urg d his horses nothing loth they flew A cloud of dust the trailing body rais d Loose hung his glossy hair and in the dust Was laid that noble head so graceful once Now to foul insult doom d by Jove s decree In his own country by a foeman s hand So lay the head of Hector at the sight His aged mother tore her hair and far From off her head the glitt ring veil she threw And with loud cries her slaughter d son bewail d Piteous his father groan d and all around Was heard the voice of wailing and of woe Such was the cry as if the beetling height Of Ilium all were smould ring in the fire Scarce in his anguish could the crowd restrain The old man from issuing through the Dardan gates Low in the dust he roll d imploring all Entreating by his name each sev ral man Forbear my friends though sorrowing stay me not Leave me to reach alone the Grecian ships And there implore this man of violence This haughty chief if haply he my years May reverend rence and have pity on my age For he too has a father like to me Peleus by whom he was begot and bred The bane of Troy and most of all to me The cause of endless grief who by his hand Have been of many stalwart sons bereft Yet all though griev d for all I less lament Than one whose loss will sink me to the grave Hector oh would to Heav n that in mine arms He could have died with mourning then and tears We might have satisfied our grief both she Who bore him hapless mother and myself Weeping he spoke and with him wept the crowd Then mid the women Hecuba pour d forth Her vehement grief My child oh whither now Heart stricken shall I go of thee bereft Of thee who wast to me by night and day A glory and a boast the strength of all The men of Troy and women as a God They worshipp d thee for in thy life thou wast The glory of all but fate hath found thee now Weeping she spoke but nought as yet was known To Hector s wife to her no messenger Had brought the tidings that without the walls Remained her husband in her house withdrawn A web she wove all purple double woof With varied flow rs in rich embroidery And to her neat hair d maidens gave command To place the largest caldrons on the fire That with warm baths returning from the fight Hector might be refresh d unconscious she That by Achilles hand with Pallas aid Far from the bath was godlike Hector slain The sounds of wailing reach d her from the tow r Totter d her limbs the distaff left her hand And to her neat hair d maidens thus she spoke Haste follow me some two that I may know What mean these sounds my honour d mother s voice I hear and in my breast my beating heart Leaps to my mouth my limbs refuse to move Some evil sure on Priam s house impends Be unfulfill d my words yet much I fear Lest my brave Hector be cut off alone By great Achilles from the walls of Troy Chas d to the plain the desp rate courage quench d Which ever led him from the general ral ranks Far in advance and bade him yield to none Then from the house she rush d like one distract With beating heart and with her went her maids But when she reach d the tow r where stood the crowd And mounted on the wall she look d around And saw the body which with insult foul The flying steeds were dragging towards the ships Then sudden darkness overspread her eyes Backward she fell and gasp d her spirit away Far off were flung th adornments of her head The net the fillet and the woven bands The nuptial veil by golden Venus giv n That day when Hector of the glancing helm Led from Eetion s house his wealthy bride The sisters of her husband round her press d And held as in the deadly swoon she lay But when her breath and spirit return d again With sudden burst of anguish thus she cried Hector oh woe is me to misery We both were born alike thou here in Troy In Priam s royal palace I in Thebes By wooded Placos in Eetion s house Who nurs d my infancy unhappy he Unhappier I would I had ne er been born Now thou beneath the depths of earth art gone Gone to the viewless shades and me hast left A widow in thy house in deepest woe Our child an infant still thy child and mine Ill fated parents both nor thou to him Hector shalt be a guard nor he to thee For though he scape this tearful war with Greece Yet nought for him remains but ceaseless woe And strangers on his heritage shall seize No young companions own the orphan boy With downcast eyes and cheeks bedew d with tears His father s friends approaching pinch d with want He hangs upon the skirt of one of one He plucks the cloak perchance in pity some May at their tables let him sip the cup Moisten his lips but scarce his palate touch While youths with both surviving parents bless d May drive him from their feast with blows and taunts Begone thy father sits not at our board Then weeping to his widow d mother s arms He flies that orphan boy Astyanax Who on his father s knees erewhile was fed On choicest marrow and the fat of lambs And when in sleep his childish play was hush d Was lull d to slumber in his nurse s arms On softest couch by all delights surrounded But grief his father lost awaits him now Astyanax of Trojans so surnam d Since thou alone wast Troy s defence and guard But now on thee beside the beaked ships Far from thy parents when the rav ning dogs Have had their fill the wriggling worms shall feed On thee all naked while within thy house Lies store of raiment rich and rare the work Of women s hands these will I burn with fire Not for thy need thou ne er shalt wear them more But for thine honour in the sight of Troy Weeping she spoke the women join d her wail ARGUMENT FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS Achilles and the Myrmidons do honour to the body of Patroclus After the funeral feast he retires to the sea shore where falling asleep the ghost of his friend appears to him and demands the rites of burial the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood for the pyre The funeral procession and the offering their hair to the dead Achilles sacrifices several animals and lastly twelve Trojan captives at the pile then sets fire to it He pays libations to the winds which at the instance of Iris rise and raise the flame When the pile has burned all night they gather the bones place them in an urn of gold and raise the tomb Achilles institutes the funeral games the chariot race the fight of the caestus the wrestling the footrace the single combat the discus the shooting with arrows the darting the javelin the various descriptions of which and the various success of the several antagonists make the greatest part of the book In this book ends the thirtieth day the night following the ghost of Patroclus appears to Achilles the one and thirtieth day is employed in felling the timber for the pile the two and thirtieth in burning it and the three and thirtieth in the games The scene is generally on the sea shore BOOK XXIII Thus they throughout the city made their moan But when the Greeks had come where lay their ships By the broad Hellespont their sev ral ways They each pursu d dispersing yet not so Achilles let his Myrmidons disperse But thus his warlike comrades he address d My faithful comrades valiant Myrmidons Loose we not yet our horses from the cars But for Patroclus mourn approaching near

Conducted yet with him they scarce prevail d So fierce his anger for his comrade s death But when to Agamemnon s tent they came He to the clear voic d heralds gave command An ample tripod on the fire

not touch This head of mine till on the fun ral pyre I see the body of Patroclus laid And build his tomb and cut my votive hair For while I live and move mid mortal men No second grief like this can pierce my soul Observe we now the mournful fun ral feast But thou great Agamemnon King of men Send forth at early dawn and to the camp Bring store of fuel and all else prepare That with provision meet the dead may pass Down to the realms of night so shall the fire From out our sight consume our mighty dead And to their wonted tasks the troops return He said they listen d and his words obey d Then busily the ev ning meal prepar d And shar d the social feast nor lack d there aught The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied Each to their sev ral tents the rest repair d But on the many dashing ocean

heart to rest O ercame his senses for the hot pursuit Of Hector round the breezy heights of Troy His active limbs had wearied as he slept Sudden appear d Patroclus mournful shade His very self his height and beauteous eyes And voice the very garb he wont to wear Above his head it stood and thus it spoke Sleep saint thou Achilles mindless of thy friend Neglecting not the living but the dead Hasten my fun ral rites that I may pass Through Hades gloomy gates ere those be done The spirits and spectres of departed men Drive me far from them nor allow to cross Th abhorred river but forlorn and sad I wander through the wide spread realms of night And give me now thy hand whereon to weep For never more when laid upon the pyre Shall I return from Hades never more Apart from all our comrades shall we two As friends sweet counsel take for me stern Death The common lot of man has op d his mouth Thou too Achilles rival of the Gods Art destin d here beneath the walls of Troy To meet thy doom yet one thing must I add And make if thou wilt grant it one request Let not my bones be laid apart from thine Achilles but together as our youth Was spent together in thy father s house Since

longing arms But nought he clasp d and with a wailing cry Vanish d like smoke the spirit beneath the earth Up sprang Achilles all amaz d and smote His hands together and lamenting cried O Heav n there

ancient follower to observe The course assign d and true report to make Then all at once their whips they rais d and urg d By rein and hand and voice their eager steeds They from the ships pursued their rapid course Athwart the distant plain beneath their chests Rose like a cloud or hurricane the dust Loose floated on the breeze their ample manes The cars now skimm d along the fertile ground Now bounded high in air the charioteers Stood up aloft and ev ry bosom beat With hope of vict ry each with eager shout Cheering his steeds that scour d the dusty plain But when the farthest limits of the course Attain d they turn d beside the hoary sea Strain d to their utmost speed were plainly seen The qualities of each then in the front Appear d Eumelus flying mares and next The Trojan horses of Tydides came Nor these were far behind but following close They seem d in act to leap upon the car Eumelus on his neck and shoulders broad Felt their warm breath for o er him as they flew Their heads were downward bent and now perchance Had he or pass d or made an even race But that incens d with valiant Diomed Apollo wrested from his hands the whip Then tears of anger from his eyelids fell As gaining more and more the mares he saw While urg d no more his horses slack d their speed But Pallas mark d Apollo s treach rous wile And hasting to the chief restor d his whip And to his horses strength and courage gave The Goddess then Admetus son pursued And snapp d his chariot yoke the mares releas d Swerv d from the track the pole upon the ground Lay loosen d from the car and he himself Beside the wheel was from the chariot hurl d From elbows mouth and nose the skin was torn His forehead crush d and batter d in his eyes Were fill d with tears and mute his cheerful voice Tydides turn d aside and far ahead Of all the rest pass d on for Pallas gave His horses courage and his triumph will d Next him the fair hair d Menelaus came The son of Atreus but Antilochus Thus to his father s horses call d aloud Forward and stretch ye to your utmost speed I ask you not with those of Diomed In vain to strive whom Pallas hath endued With added swiftness and his triumph will d But haste ye and o ertake Atrides car Nor be by AEthe by a mare disgrac d Why my brave horses why be left behind This too I warn ye and will make it good No more at Nestor s hand shall ye receive Your provender but with the sword be slain If by your faults a lower prize be ours Then rouse ye now and put forth all your speed And I will so contrive as not to fail Of slipping past them in the narrow way He said the horses of his voice in awe Put forth their pow rs awhile before them soon Antilochus the narrow pass espied It was a gully where the winter s rain Had lain collected and had broken through A length of road and hollow d out the ground There Menelaus held his cautious course Fearing collision but Antilochus Drawing his steeds a little from the track Bore down upon him sideways then in fear The son of Atreus to Antilochus Shouted aloud Antilochus thou driv saint Like one insane hold in awhile thy steeds Here is no space where wider grows the road There thou mayst pass but here thou wilt but cause Our cars to clash and bring us both to harm He said but madlier drove Antilochus Plying the goad as though he heard him not Far as a discus flight by some stout youth That tests his vigour from the shoulder hurl d So far they ran together side by side Then dropp d Atrides horses to the rear For he himself forbore to urge their speed Lest meeting in the narrow pass the cars Should be o erthrown and they themselves in haste To gain the vict ry in the dust be roll d Then thus reproachful to Antilochus Antilochus thou most perverse of men Beshrew thy heart we Greeks are much deceiv d Who give thee fame for wisdom yet e en now Thou shalt not gain but on thine oath the prize He said and to his horses call d aloud Slack not your speed nor as defeated mourn Their legs and feet will sooner tire than yours For both are past the vigour of their youth Thus he the horses of his voice in awe Put forth their pow rs and soon the leaders near d Meanwhile the chieftains seated in the ring Look d for the cars that scour d the dusty plain The first to see them was Idomeneus The Cretan King for he without the ring Was posted high aloft and from afar He heard and knew the foremost horseman s voice Well too he knew the gallant horse that led All bay the rest but on his front alone A star of white full orbed as the moon Then up he rose and thus the Greeks address d O friends the chiefs and councillors of Greece Can ye too see or I alone the cars A diff rent chariot seems to me in front A diff rent charioteer and they who first Were leading must have met with some mischance I saw them late ere round the goal they turn d But see them now no more though all around My eyes explore the wide spread plain of Troy Perchance the charioteer has dropp d the reins Or round the goal he could not hold the mares Perchance has miss d the turn and on the plain Is lying now beside his broken car While from the course his mettled steeds have flown Stand up and look yourselves I cannot well Distinguish but to me it seems a chief Who reigns o er Greeks though of AEtolian race The son of Tydeus valiant Diomed Sharply Oileus active son replied Idomeneus why thus before the time So rashly speak while the high stepping steeds Are speeding yet across the distant plain Thine eyes are not the youngest in the camp Nor look they out the sharpest from thy head But thou art ever hasty in thy speech And ill becomes thee this precipitance Since others are there here thy betters far The same are leading now that led at first Eumelus mares tis he that holds the reins To whom in anger thus the Cretan chief Ajax at wrangling good in judgment naught And for aught else among the chiefs of Greece Of small account so stubborn is thy soul Wilt thou a tripod or a caldron stake And Agamemnon Atreus son appoint The umpire to decide whose steeds are first So shalt thou gain thy knowledge at thy cost He said up sprang Oileus active son In anger to reply and farther yet Had gone the quarrel but Achilles self Stood up and thus the rival chiefs address d Forbear both Ajax and Idomeneus This bitter interchange of wordy war It is not seemly and yourselves I know Another would condemn who so should speak But stay ye here and seated in the ring Their coming wait they hurrying to the goal Will soon be here and then shall each man know Whose horses are the second whose the first Thus he but Tydeus son drew near his lash Still laid upon his horses shoulder points As lightly they high stepping scour d the plain Still on the charioteer the dust was flung As close upon the flying footed steeds Follow d the car with gold and tin inlaid And lightly as they flew along were left Impress d the wheel tracks on the sandy plain There in the midst he stood the sweat profuse Down pouring from his horses heads and chests Down from the glitt ring car he leap d to earth And lean d his whip against the chariot yoke Nor long delay d the valiant Sthenelus But eagerly sprang forth to claim the prize Then to his brave companions gave in charge To lead away the woman and to bear The tripod while himself unyok d the steeds Nest came the horses of Antilochus Who had by stratagem and not by speed O er Menelaus triumph d yet e en so Atrides flying coursers press d him hard For but so far as from the chariot wheel A horse when harness d to a royal car Whose tail back streaming with the utmost hairs Brushes the felloes close before the wheel Small space between he scours the wide spread plain So far was Menelaus in the rear Of Nestor s son at first a discus cast Between them lay but rapidly his ground He gain d so well the speed and courage serv d Of AEthe Agamemnon s beauteous mare And but a little farther were the course Had pass d him by nor left the race in doubt Behind the noble son of Atreus came A jav lin s flight apart Meriones The faithful follower of Idomeneus His were the slowest horses and himself The least experienc d in the rapid race Dragging his broken car came last of all His horses driv n in front Admetus son Achilles swift of foot with pity saw And to the Greeks his winged words address d See where the best of all the last appears But let him take as meet the second prize The first belongs of right to Tydeus son Thus he they all assented to his words And by the general ral voice of Greece the mare Had now been his but noble Nestor s son Antilochus stood up his right to claim And to Achilles Peleus son replied Achilles thou wilt do me grievous wrong If thou thy words accomplish for my prize Thou tak saint away because mishap befell His car and horses by no fault of his Yet had he to th Immortals made his pray r He surely had not thus been last of all But pitying him if so thy mind incline Thy tents contain good store of gold and brass And sheep and female slaves and noble steeds For him of these hereafter mayst thou take A prize of higher value or e en now And with th applause of all but for the mare I will not give her up and let who will Stand forth my own right hand shall guard my prize He said and smil d Achilles swift of foot Delighted for he lov d the noble youth To whom his winged words he thus address d Antilochus if such be thy request That for Eumelus I should add a prize This too I grant thee and to him I give My breastplate from Asteropaeus won Of brass around whose edge is roll d a stream Of shining tin a gift of goodly price He said and bade Automedon his friend And comrade bring the breastplate from his tent He went and brought it in Eumelus hand He plac d it he with joy the gift receiv d Then Menelaus sad at heart arose Burning with wrath against Antilochus And while the herald in the monarch s hand His royal sceptre plac d and bade the Greeks Keep silence thus the godlike hero spoke Antilochus till now reputed wise What hast thou done thou hast impugn d my skill And sham d my horses who hast brought thine own Inferior far before them to the goal But come ye chiefs and councillors of Greece Judge ye between us fav ring neither side That none of all the brass clad Greeks may say That Menelaus hath by false reports O erborne Antilochus and holds his prize His horses fairly worsted and himself Triumphant only by superior pow r Or come now I myself will judgment give Nor deem I any Greek will find to blame In my decision for tis fair and just Antilochus come forward noble chief And standing as tis meet before the car And horses in thy hand the slender whip Wherewith thou drov saint upon the horses lay Thy hand and by Earth shaking Neptune swear That not of malice and by set design Thou didst by fraud impede my chariot s course To whom Antilochus with prudent speech Have patience with me yet for I O King O Menelaus am thy junior far My elder and superior thee I own Thou know saint th o er eager vehemence of youth How quick in temper and in judgment weak Set then thy heart at ease the mare I won I freely give and if aught else of mine Thou shouldst desire would sooner give it all Than all my life be low r d illustrious King In thine esteem and sin against the Gods Thus saying noble Nestor s son led forth And plac d in Menelaus hands the mare The monarch s soul was melted like the dew Which glitters on the ears of growing corn That bristle o er the plain e en so thy soul O Menelaus melted at his speech To whom were thus address d thy winged words Antilochus at once I lay aside My anger thou art prudent and not apt To be thus led astray but now thy youth Thy judgment hath o erpow r d seek not henceforth By trick ry o er thine elders to prevail To any other man of all the Greeks I scarce so much had yielded but for that Thyself hast labour d much and much endur d Thou thy good sire and brother in my cause I yield me to thy pray rs and give to boot The mare though mine of right that these may know I am not of a harsh unyielding mood He said and to Noemon gave in charge The faithful comrade of Antilochus The mare himself the glitt ring caldron took Of gold two talents to the fourth assign d Fourth in the race Meriones receiv d Still the fifth prize a vase with double cup Remain d Achilles this to Nestor gave Before th assembled Greeks as thus he spoke Take this old man and for an heirloom keep In mem ry of Patroclus fun ral games Whom thou no more amid the Greeks shalt see Freely I give it thee for thou no more Canst box or wrestle or in sportive strife The jav lin throw or race with flying feet For age with heavy hand hath bow d thee down He said and plac d it in his hand th old man Beceiv d with joy the gift and thus replied All thou hast said my son is simple truth No firmness now my limbs and feet retain Nor can my arms with freedom as of old Straight from the shoulder right and left strike out Oh that such youth and vigour yet were mine As when th Epeians in Buprasium held The royal Amarynceus fun ral games And when the monarch s sons his prizes gave Then could not one of all th Epeian race Or Pylians or AEtolians vie with me In boxing Clytomedes OEnops son I vanquished then Anchaeus who stood up To wrestle with me I with ease o erthrew Iphiclus I outran though fleet of foot In hurling with the spear with Phyleus strove And Polydorus and surpass d them both The sons of Actor in the chariot race Alone o ercame me as in number more eight And grudging more my triumph since remain d This contest to reward the richest prize They were twin brothers one who held the reins Still drove and drove the other plied the whip Such was I once but now must younger men Engage in deeds like these and I the chief Of heroes once must bow to weary age But honour thou with fitting fun ral games Thy comrade I accept well pleas d thy gift My heart rejoicing that thou still retain saint Of me a kindly mem ry nor o erlook saint The place of honour which among the Greeks Belongs to me of right for this the Gods Reward thee with a worthy recompense He said Achilles listen d to the praise Of Neleus son then join d the general ral throng Next he set forth the prizes to reward The labours of the sturdy pugilists A hardy mule he tether d in the ring Unbroken six years old most hard to tame And for the vanquished man a double cup Then rose and to the Greeks proclaim d aloud Thou son of Atreus and ye well greav d Greeks For these we bid two champions brave stand forth And in the boxer s manly toil contend And he whose stern endurance Phoebus crowns With vict ry recogniz d by all the Greeks He to his tent shall lead the hardy mule The loser shall the double cup receive He said up sprang Epeius tall and stout A boxer skill d the son of Panopeus Who laid his hand upon the mule and said Stand forth if any care the cup to win The mule methinks no Greek can bear away From me who glory in the champion s name Is t not enough that in the battle field I claim no special praise tis not for man In all things to excel but this I say And will make good my words who meets me here I mean to pound his flesh and smash his bones See that his seconds be at hand and prompt To bear him from the ring by me subdued He said they all in silence heard his speech Only Euryalus a godlike chief Son of Mecistheus Talaion s son Stood forth opposing he had once in Thebes Join d in the fun ral games of OEdipus And there had vanquish d all of Cadmian race On him attended valiant Diomed With cheering words and wishes of success Around his waist he fasten d first the belt Then gave the well cut gauntlets for his hands Of wild bull s hide When both were thus equipp d Into the centre of the ring they stepp d There face to face with sinewy arms uprais d They stood awhile then clos d strong hand with hand Mingling in rapid interchange of blows Dire was the clatter of their jaws the sweat Pour d forth profuse from ev ry limb then rush d Epeius on and full upon the cheek Half turn d aside let fall a stagg ring blow Nor stood Euryalus but legs and feet Knock d from beneath him prone to earth he fell And as a fish that flounders on the sand Thrown by rude Boreas on the weedy beach Till cover d o er by the returning wave So flounder d he beneath that stunning blow But brave Epeius took him by the hand And rais d him up his comrades crowded round And bore him from the field with dragging steps Spitting forth clotted gore his heavy head Rolling from side to side within his tent They laid him down unconscious to the ring Then back returning bore away the cup Achilles next before the Greeks display d The prizes of the hardy wrestlers skill The victor s prize a tripod vast fire proof And at twelve oxen by the Greeks apprais d And for the vanquish d man a female slave Pric d at four oxen skill d in household work Then rose and loudly to the Greeks proclaim d Stand forth whoe er this contest will essay He said and straight uprose the giant form Of Ajax Telamon with him uprose Ulysses skill d in ev ry crafty wile Girt with the belt within the ring they stood And each with stalwart grasp laid hold on each As stand two rafters of a lofty house Each propping each by skilful architect Design d the tempest s fury to withstand Creak d their backbones beneath the tug and strain Of those strong arms their sweat pour d down like rain And bloody weals of livid purple hue Their sides and shoulders streak d as sternly they For vict ry and the well wrought tripod strove Nor could Ulysses Ajax overthrow Nor Ajax bring Ulysses to the ground So stubbornly he stood but when the Greeks Were weary of the long protracted strife Thus to Ulysses mighty Ajax spoke Ulysses sage Laertes godlike son Or lift thou me or I will thee uplift The issue of our struggle rests with Jove He said and rais d Ulysses from the ground Nor he his ancient craft remember d not But lock d his leg around and striking sharp Upon the hollow of the knee the joint Gave way the giant Ajax backwards fell Ulysses on his breast the people saw And marvell d Then in turn Ulysses strove Ajax to lift a little way he mov d But fail d to lift him fairly from the ground Yet crook d his knee that both together fell And side by side defil d with dust they lay And now a third encounter had they tried But rose Achilles and the combat stay d Forbear nor waste your strength in farther strife Ye both are victors both then bear away An equal meed of honour and withdraw That other Greeks may other contests wage Thus spoke Achilles they his words obey d And brushing off the dust their garments donn d The prizes of the runners swift of foot Achilles next set forth a silver bowl Six measures its content for workmanship Unmatch d on earth of Sidon s costliest art The product rare thence o er the misty sea Brought by Phoenicians who in port arriv d Gave it to Thoas by Euneus last The son of Jason to Patroclus paid In ransom of Lycaon Priam s son Which now Achilles on his friend s behalf Assign d as his reward whoe er should prove The lightest foot and speediest in the race A steer well fatten d was the second prize And half a talent for the third of gold He rose and to the Greeks proclaim d aloud Stand forth whoe er this contest will essay He said uprose Oileus active son Uprose Ulysses skill d in ev ry wile And noble Nestor s son Antilochus Who all the youth in speed of foot surpass d They stood in line Achilles pointed out The limits of the course as from the goal They stretch d them to the race Oileus son First shot ahead Ulysses following close Nor farther than the shuttle from the breast Of some fair woman when her outstretch d arm Has thrown the woof athwart the warp and back Withdraws it tow rd her breast so close behind Ulysses press d on Ajax and his feet Trod in his steps ere settled yet the dust His breath was on his shoulders as the plain He lightly skimm d the Greeks with eager shouts Still cheering as he strain d to win the prize But as they near d the goal Ulysses thus To blue ey d Pallas made his mental pray r Now hear me Goddess and my feet befriend Thus as he pray d his pray r the Goddess heard And all his limbs with active vigour fill d And as they stretch d their hands to seize the prize Tripp d up by Pallas Ajax slipp d and fell Amid the offal of the lowing kine Which o er Patroclus Peleus son had slain His mouth and nostrils were with offal fill d First in the race Ulysses bore away The silver bowl the steer to Ajax fell And as upon the horn he laid his hand Sputt ring the offal out he call d aloud Lo how the Goddess has my steps bewray d Who guards Ulysses with a mother s care Thus as he spoke loud laugh d the merry Greeks Antilochus the sole remaining prize Receiv d and laughing thus the Greeks address d I tell you friends but what yourselves do know How of the elder men th immortal Gods Take special care for Ajax years not much Exceed mine own but here we see a man One of a former age and race of men A hale old man we call him but for speed Not one can match him save Achilles self Thus he with praise implied of Peleus son To whom in answer thus Achilles spoke Antilochus not unobserv d of me Nor unrewarded shall thy praise remain To thy half talent add this second half Thus saying in his hand he plac d the gold Antilochus with joy the gift receiv d Next in the ring the son of Peleus laid A pond rous spear a helmet and a shield The spoil Patroclus from Sarpedon won Then rose and loudly to the Greeks proclaim d For these we call upon two champions brave To don their arms their sharp edg d weapons grasp And public trial of their prowess make And he who first his rival s flesh shall reach And through his armour piercing first draw blood He shall this silver studded sword receive My trophy from Asteropaeus won Well wrought of Thracian metal but the arms In common property they both shall hold And in my tent a noble banquet share He said uprose great Ajax Telamon And Tydeus son the valiant Diomed First from the crowd apart they donn d their arms Then eager for the fight with haughty stare Stood in the midst the Greeks admiring gaz d When each approaching other near they came Thrice rush d they on and thrice in combat clos d Then through the buckler round of Diomed Great Ajax drove his spear nor reach d the point Tydides body by the breastplate stay d While aim d above the mighty shield s defence His glitt ring weapon flash d at Ajax throat For Ajax fearing shouted then the Greeks To cease the fight and share alike the prize But from Achilles hand the mighty sword With belt and scabbard Diomed receiv d Next in the ring the son of Peleus plac d A pond rous mass of iron as a quoit Once wielded by Eetion s giant strength But to the ships with other trophies borne When by Achilles hand Eetion fell Then rose and loudly to the Greeks proclaim d Stand forth whoe er this contest will essay This prize who wins though widely may extend His fertile fields for five revolving years It will his wants supply nor to the town For lack of iron with this mass in store Need he his shepherd or his ploughman send He said and valiant Polypoetes rose Epeius and Leonteus godlike strength And mighty Ajax son of Telamon In turns they took their stand Epeius first Uprais d the pond rous mass and through the air Hurl d it amid the laughter of the Greeks Next came Leonteus scion true of Mars The third was Ajax from whose stalwart hand Beyond the farthest mark the missile flew But when the valiant Polypoetes took The quoit in hand far as a herdsman throws His staff that whirling flies among the herd So far beyond the ring s extremest bound He threw the pond rous mass loud were the shouts And noble Polypoetes comrades rose And to the ships the monarch s gift convey d The archers prizes next of iron hoar Ten sturdy axes double edg d he plac d And single hatchets ten then far away Rear d on the sand a dark prow d vessel s mast On which with slender string a tim rous dove Was fasten d by the foot the archers mark That who should strike the dove should to his tent The axes bear away but who the string Should sever but should fail to strike the bird As less in skill the hatchets should receive Thus spoke Achilles straight uprose the might Of royal Teucer and Meriones The faithful follower of Idomeneus They in a brass bound helmet shook the lots The first was Teucer s with impetuous force He shot but vow d not to the Archer King Of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb The dove he struck not for the Archer God Withheld his aid but close beside her foot The arrow sever d the retaining string The bird releas d soar d heav nward while the string Dropp d from the mast suspended tow rds the earth And loudly shouted their applause the Greeks Then snatch d Meriones in haste the bow From Teucer s hand his own already held His arrow pointed straight he drew the string And to the far destroying King he vow d Of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb Aloft amid the clouds he mark d the dove And struck her as she soar d beneath the wing Right through the arrow pass

crowd with wonder gaz d Meriones the axes bore away While Teucer to the ships the hatchets bore Last in the ring the son of Peleus laid A pond rous spear and caldron burnish d bright Pric d at an ox s worth untouch d by fire For those who with the jav lin would contend Uprose then Agamemnon King of men The son of Atreus and Meriones The faithful follower of Idomeneus But Peleus godlike son address d them thus How far Atrides thou excell saint us all And with the jav lin what thy pow r and skill Pre eminent we know take thou this prize And bear it to thy ships and let us give To brave Meriones the brazen spear If so it please thee such were my advice He said and Agamemnon King of men Assenting gave to brave Meriones The brazen spear while in Talthybius care His herald plac d the King his noble prize ARGUMENT THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector s body Jupiter sends Thetis to Achilles to dispose him for the restoring it and Iris to Priam to encourage him to go in person and treat for it The old king notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen makes ready for the journey to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter He sets forth in his chariot with a waggon loaded with presents under the charge of Idaeus the herald Mercury descends in the shape of a young man and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles Their conversation on the way Priam finds Achilles at his table casts himself at his feet and begs for the body of his son Achilles moved with compassion grants his request detains him one night in his tent and the next morning sends him home with the body the Trojans run out to meet him The lamentation of Andromache Hecuba and Helen with the solemnities of the funeral The time of twelve days is employed in this book while the body of Hector lies in the tent of Achilles And as many more are spent in the truce allowed for his interment The scene is partly in Achilles camp and partly in Troy BOOK XXIV The games were ended and the multitude Amid the ships their sev ral ways dispers d Some to their supper some to gentle sleep Yielding delighted but Achilles still Mourn d o er his lov d companion not on him Lighted all conqu ring sleep but to and fro Restless he toss d and on Patroclus thought His vigour and his courage all the deeds They two together had achiev d the toils The perils they had undergone amid The strife of warriors and the angry waves Stirr d by such mem ries bitter tears he shed Now turning on his side and now again Upon his back then prone upon his face Then starting to his feet along the shore All objectless despairing would he roam Nor did the morn above the sea appearing Unmark d of him arise his flying steeds He then would harness and behind the car The corpse of Hector trailing in the dust Thrice make the circuit of Patroclus tomb Then would he turn within his tent to rest Leaving the prostrate corpse with dust defil d But from unseemly marks the valiant dead Apollo guarded who with pity view d The hero though in death and round him threw His golden aegis nor though dragg d along Allow d his body to receive a wound Thus foully did Achilles in his rage Misuse the mighty dead the blessed Gods With pitying grief beheld the sight and urg d That Hermes should by stealth the corpse remove The counsel pleas d the rest but Juno still And Neptune and the blue ey d Maid retain d The hatred unappeas d with which of old Troy and her King and people they pursued Since Paris to the rival Goddesses Who to his sheepfold came gave deep offence Preferring her who brought him in return The fatal boon of too successful love But when the twelfth revolving day was come Apollo thus th assembled Gods address d Shame on ye Gods ungrateful have ye not At Hector s hand of bulls and choicest goats Receiv d your off rings meet and fear ye now E en his dead corpse to save and grant his wife His mother and his child his aged sire And people to behold him and to raise His fun ral pile and with due rites entomb But fell Achilles all your aid commands Of mind unrighteous and inflexible His stubborn heart his thoughts are all of blood E en as a lion whom his mighty strength And dauntless courage lead to leap the fold And mid the trembling flocks to seize his prey E en so Achilles hath discarded ruth And conscience arbiter of good and ill A man may lose his best lov d friend a son Or his own mother s son a brother dear He mourns and weeps but time his grief allays For fate to man a patient mind hath giv n But godlike Hector s body after death Achilles unrelenting foully drags Lash d to his car around his comrade s tomb This is not to his praise though brave he be Yet thus our anger he may justly rouse Who in his rage insults the senseless clay To whom indignant white arm d Juno thus Some show of reason were there in thy speech God of the silver bow could Hector boast Of equal dignity with Peleus son A mortal one and nurs d at woman s breast The other of a Goddess born whom I Nurtur d and rear d and to a mortal gave In marriage gave to Peleus best belov d By all th Immortals of the race of man Ye Gods attended all the marriage rites Thou too companion base false friend wast there And playing on thy lyre didst share the feast To whom the Cloud compeller answer d thus Juno restrain thy wrath they shall not both Attain like honour yet was Hector once Of all the mortals that in Ilium dwell Dearest to all the Gods and chief to me For never did he fail his gifts to bring And with burnt off rings and libations due My altars crown such worship I receiv d Yet shall bold Hector s body not without The knowledge of Achilles be remov d For day and night his Goddess mother keeps Her constant watch beside him Then some God Bid Thetis hither to my presence haste And I with prudent words will counsel her That so Achilles may at Priam s hand Large ransom take and set brave Hector free He said and promptly on his errand sprang The storm swift Iris in the dark blue sea She plung d midway twixt Imbros rugged shore And Samos isle the parting waters plash d As down to ocean s lowest depths she dropp d Like to a plummet which the fisherman Lets fall encas d in wild bull s horn to bear Destruction to the sea s voracious tribes There found she Thetis in a hollow cave Around her rang d the Ocean Goddesses She in the midst was weeping o er the fate Her matchless son awaiting doom d to die Far from his home on fertile plains of Troy Swift footed Iris at her side appear d And thus address d her Hasten Thetis Jove Lord of immortal counsel summons thee To whom the silver footed Goddess thus What would with me the mighty King of Heav n Press d as I am with grief I am asham d To mingle with the Gods yet will I go Nor shall he speak in vain whate er his words Thus as she spoke her veil the Goddess took All black than which none deeper could be found She rose to go the storm swift Iris led The way before her ocean s parted waves Around their path receded to the beach Ascending upwards straight to Heav n they sprang Th all seeing son of Saturn there they found And rang d around him all th immortal Gods Pallas made way and by the throne of Jove Sat Thetis Juno proff ring to her hand A goblet fair of gold and adding words Of welcome she the cup receiv d and drank Then thus began the sire of Gods and men Thou Thetis sorrowing to Olympus com saint Borne down by ceaseless grief I know it well Yet hear the cause for which I summon d thee About Achilles thy victorious son And valiant Hector s body for nine days Hath contest been in Heav n and some have urg d That Hermes should by stealth the corpse remove This to Achilles praise I mean to turn And thus thy reverend rence and thy love retain Then haste thee to the camp and to thy son My message bear tell him that all the Gods Are fill d with wrath and I above the rest Am angry that beside the beaked ships He mad with rage the corpse of Hector keeps So may he fear me and restore the dead Iris meantime to Priam I will send And bid him seek the Grecian ships and there Obtain his son s release and with him bring Such presents as may melt Achilles heart He said the silver footed Queen obey d Down from Olympus heights in haste she sped And sought her son him found she in his tent Groaning with anguish while his comrades round Plying their tasks prepar d the morning meal For them a goodly sheep full fleec d was slain Close by his side his Goddess mother stood And gently touch d him with her hand and said How long my son wilt thou thy soul consume With grief and mourning mindful nor of food Nor sleep nor dost thou wisely to abstain From woman s love for short thy time on earth Death and imperious fate are close at hand Hear then my words a messenger from Jove To thee I come to tell thee that the Gods Are fill d with wrath and he above the rest Is angry that beside the beaked ships Thou mad with rage the corpse of Hector keep saint Then ransom take and liberate the dead To whom Achilles swift of foot replied So be it ransom let him bring and bear His dead away if such the will of Jove Thus in the concourse of the ships they two Mother and son their lengthen d converse held Then Saturn s son to Iris gave command Haste thee swift Iris from Olympus height To Troy to royal Priam bear my words And bid him seek the Grecian ships and there Obtain his son s release and with him take Such presents as may melt Achilles heart Alone no Trojan with him must he go Yet may a herald on his steps attend Some aged man his smoothly rolling car And mules to drive and to the city back To bring his dead whom great Achilles slew Nor let the fear of death disturb his mind Hermes shall with him as his escort go And to Achilles presence safely bring Arriv d within the tent nor he himself Will slay him but from others will protect Not ignorant is he nor void of sense Nor disobedient to the Gods behest But will with pitying eyes his suppliant view He said and on his errand sped in haste The storm swift Iris when to Priam s house She came the sounds of wailing met her ear Within the court around their father sat His sons their raiment all bedew d with tears And in the midst close cover d with his robe Their sire his head and neck with dirt defil d Which wallowing on the earth himself had heap d With his own hands upon his hoary head Throughout the house his daughters loudly wail d In mem ry of the many and the brave Who lay in death by Grecian warriors slain Beside him stood the messenger of Jove And whisper d while his limbs with terror shook Fear nothing Priam son of Dardanus Nor let thy mind be troubled not for ill But here on kindly errand am I sent To thee I come a messenger from Jove Who from on high looks down on thee with eyes Of pitying love he bids thee ransom home The godlike Hector s corpse and with thee take Such presents as may melt Achilles heart Alone no Trojan with thee must thou go Yet may a herald on thy steps attend Some aged man thy smoothly rolling car And mules to drive and to the city back To bring thy dead whom great Achilles slew Nor let the fear of death disturb thy mind Hermes shall with thee as thine escort go And to Achilles presence safely bring Arriv d within the tent nor he himself Will slay thee but from others will protect Not ignorant is he nor void of sense Nor disobedient to the Gods behest But will with pitying eyes his suppliant view Swift footed Iris said and vanish d straight He to his sons commandment gave the mules To yoke beneath the smoothly rolling car And on the axle fix the wicker seat Himself the lofty cedar chamber sought Fragrant high roof d with countless treasures stor d And call d to Hecuba his wife and said Good wife a messenger from Jove hath come Who bids me seek the Grecian ships and there Obtain my son s release and with me take Such presents as may melt Achilles heart Say then what think saint thou for my mind inclines To seek the ships within the Grecian camp So he but Hecuba lamenting cried Alas alas where are thy senses gone And where the wisdom once of high repute Mid strangers and mid those o er whom thou reign saint How canst thou think alone to seek the ships Ent ring his presence who thy sons hath slain Many and brave an iron heart is thine Of that bloodthirsty and perfidious man If thou within the sight and reach shalt come No pity will he feel no reverend rence show Rather remain we here apart and mourn For him when at his birth his thread of life Was spun by fate twas destin d that afar From home and parents he should glut the maw Of rav ning dogs by that stern warrior s tent Whose inmost heart I would I could devour Such for my son were adequate revenge Whom not in ignominious flight he slew But standing thoughtless of escape or flight For Trojan men and Troy s deep bosom d dames To whom in answer Priam godlike sire Seek not to hinder me nor be thyself A bird of evil omen in my house For thou shalt not persuade me If indeed This message had been brought by mortal man Prophet or seer or sacrificing priest I should have deem d it false and laugh d to scorn The idle tale but now for I myself Both saw and heard the Goddess I must go Nor unfulfill d shall be the words I speak And if indeed it be my fate to die Beside the vessels of the brass clad Greeks I am content by fierce Achilles hand Let me be slain so once more in my arms I hold my boy and give my sorrow vent Then raising up the coffer s polish d lid He chose twelve gorgeous shawls twelve single cloaks As many rugs as many splendid robes As many tunics then of gold he took Ten talents full two tripods burnish d bright Four caldrons then a cup of beauty rare A rich possession which the men of Thrace Had giv n when there he went ambassador E en this he spar d not such his keen desire His son to ransom From the corridor With angry words he drove the Trojans all Out with ye worthless rascals vagabonds Have ye no griefs at home that here ye come To pester me or is it not enough That Jove with deep affliction visits me Slaying my bravest son ye to your cost Shall know his loss since now that he is gone The Greeks shall find you easier far to slay But may my eyes be clos d in death ere see The city sack d and utterly destroy d He said and with his staff drove out the crowd Before the old man s anger fled they all Then to his sons in threat ning tone he cried To Paris Helenus and Agathon Pammon Antiphonus Polites brave Deiphobus and bold Hippothous And godlike Dius all these nine with threats And angry taunts the aged sire assail d Haste worthless sons my scandal and my shame Would that ye all beside the Grecian ships In Hector s stead had died Oh woe is me Who have begotten sons in all the land The best and bravest now remains not one Mestor and Troilus dauntless charioteer And Hector who a God mid men appear d Nor like a mortal s offspring but a God s All these hath Mars cut off and left me none None but the vile and refuse liars all Vain skipping coxcombs in the dance alone And in nought else renown d base plunderers From their own countrymen of lambs and kids When laggards will ye harness me the car Equipp d with all things needed for the way He said they quail d beneath their father s wrath And brought the smoothly running mule wain out Well fram d new built and fix d the wicker seat Then from the peg the mule yoke down they took Of boxwood wrought with boss and rings complete And with the yoke the yoke band brought they forth Nine cubits long and to the polish d pole At the far end attach d the breast rings then Fix d to the pole piece and on either side Thrice round the knob the leathern thong they wound And bound it fast and inward turn d the tongue Then the rich ransom from the chambers brought Of Hector s head upon the wain they pil d And yok d the strong hoof d mules to harness train d The Mysians splendid present to the King To Priam s car they harness d then the steeds Which he himself at polish d manger fed Deep thoughts revolving in the lofty halls Were met the herald and the aged King When Hecuba with troubled mind drew near In her right hand a golden cup she bore Of luscious wine that ere they took their way They to the Gods might due libations pour Before the car she stood and thus she spoke Take and to father Jove thine off ring pour And pray that he may bring thee safely home From all thy foes since sore against my will Thou needs wilt venture to the ships of Greece Then to Idaean Jove the cloud girt son Of Saturn who th expanse of Troy surveys Prefer thy pray r beseeching him to send On thy right hand a winged messenger The bird he loves the best of strongest flight That thou thyself mayst see and know the sign And firm in faith approach the ships of Greece But should all seeing Jove the sign withhold Then not with my consent shouldst thou attempt Whate er thy wish to reach the Grecian ships To whom in answer godlike Priam thus O woman I refuse not to obey Thy counsel good it is to raise the hands In pray r to Heav n and Jove s protection seek The old man said and bade th attendant pour Pure water on his hands with ewer she And basin stood beside him from his wife The due ablutions made he took the cup Then in the centre of the court he stood And as he pour d the wine look d up to Heav n And thus with voice uplifted pray d aloud O father Jove who rul saint on Ida s height Most great most glorious grant that I may find Some pity in Achilles heart and send On my right hand a winged messenger The bird thou lov saint the best of strongest flight That I myself may see and know the sign And firm in faith approach the ships of Greece Thus as he pray d the Lord of counsel heard And sent forthwith an eagle feather d king Dark bird of chase and Dusky thence surnam d Wide as the portals well secur d with bolts That guard some wealthy monarch s lofty hall On either side his ample pinions spread On the right hand appear d he far above The city soaring they the fav ring sign With joy beheld and ev ry heart was cheer d Mounting his car in haste the aged King Drove thro the court and thro the echoing porch The mules in front by sage Idaeus driv n That drew the four wheel d wain behind them came The horses down the city s steep descent Urg d by th old man to speed the crowd of friends That follow d mourn d for him as doom d to death Descended from the city to the plain His sons and sons in law to Ilium took Their homeward way advancing o er the plain They two escap d not Jove s all seeing eye Pitying he saw the aged sire and thus At once to Hermes spoke his much lov d son Hermes for thou in social converse lov saint To mix with men and hear saint whome er thou wilt Haste thee and Priam to the Grecian ships So lead that none of all the Greeks may see Ere at Achilles presence he attain He said nor disobey d the heav nly Guide His golden sandals on his feet he bound Ambrosial work which bore him o er the waves Swift as the wind and o er the wide spread earth Then took his rod wherewith he seals at will The eyes of men and wakes again from sleep This in his hand he bore and sprang for flight Soon the wide Hellespont he reach d and Troy And pass d in likeness of a princely youth In op ning manhood fairest term of life The twain had pass d by Ilus lofty tomb And halted there the horses and the mules Beside the margin of the stream to drink For darkness now was creeping o er the earth When through the gloom the herald Hermes saw Approaching near to Priam thus he cried O son of Dardanus bethink thee well Of prudent counsel great is now our need A man I see and fear he means us ill Say with the horses shall we fly at once Or clasp his knees and for his mercy sue The old man heard his mind confus d with dread So grievously he fear d that ev ry hair Upon his bended limbs did stand on end He stood astounded but the Guardian God Approach d and took him by the hand and said Where father goest thou thus with horse and mule In the still night when men are sunk in sleep And fear saint thou not the slaughter breathing Greeks Thine unrelenting foes and they so near If any one of them should see thee now So richly laden in the gloom of night How wouldst thou feel thou art not young thyself And this old man thy comrade would avail But little to protect thee from assault I will not harm thee nay will shield from harm For like my father s is methinks thy face To whom in answer Priam godlike sire Tis as thou say saint fair son yet hath some God Extended o er me his protecting hand Who sends me such a guide so opportune Bless d are thy parents in a son so grac d In face and presence and of mind so wise To whom in answer thus the Guardian God O father well and wisely dost thou speak But tell me this and truly dost thou bear These wealthy treasures to some foreign land That they for thee in safety may be stor d Or have ye all resolv d to fly from Troy In fear your bravest slain thy gallant son Who never from the Greeks encounter flinch d To whom in answer Priam godlike sire Who art thou noble Sir and what thy race That speak saint thus fairly of my hapless son To whom in answer thus the Guardian God Try me old man of godlike Hector ask For often in the glory giving fight These eyes have seen him chief when to the ships The Greeks he drove and with the sword destroy d We gaz d in wonder from the fight restrain d By Peleus son with Agamemnon wroth His follower I one ship convey d us both One of the Myrmidons I am my sire Polyctor rich but aged e en as thou Six sons he hath besides myself the sev nth And I by lot was drafted for the war I from the ships am to the plain come forth For with the dawn of day the keen ey d Greeks Will round the city marshal their array They chafe in idleness the chiefs in vain Strive to restrain their ardour for the fight To whom in answer Priam godlike sire If of Achilles Peleus son thou art Indeed a follower tell me all the truth Lies yet my son beside the Grecian ships Or hath Achilles torn him limb from limb And to his dogs the mangled carcase giv n To whom in answer thus the Guardian God On him old man nor dogs nor birds have fed But by the ship of Peleus son he lies Within the tent twelve days he there hath lain Nor hath corruption touch d his flesh nor worms That wont to prey on men in battle slain The corpse indeed with each returning morn Around his comrade s tomb Achilles drags Yet leaves it still uninjur d thou thyself Mightst see how fresh as dew besprent he lies From blood stains cleans d and clos d his many wounds For many a lance was buried in his corpse So e en in death the blessed Gods above Who lov d him well protect thy noble son He said th old man rejoicing heard his words And answer d See my son how good it is To give th immortal Gods their tribute due For never did my son while yet he liv d Neglect the Gods who on Olympus dwell And thence have they remember d him in death Accept I pray this goblet rich emboss d Be thou my guard and under Heav n my guide Until I reach the tent of Peleus son To whom in answer thus the Guardian God Old father me thy younger wouldst thou tempt In vain who bidd saint me at thy hands accept Thy proffer d presents to Achilles wrong I dread his anger and should hold it shame To plunder him through fear of future ill But as thy guide I could conduct thee safe As far as Argos journeying by thy side On ship board or on foot nor by the fault Of thy conductor shouldst thou meet with harm Thus spoke the Guardian God and on the car Mounting in haste he took the whip and reins And with fresh vigour mules and horses fill d When to the ship tow rs and the trench they came The guard had late been busied with their meal And with deep sleep the heav nly Guide o erspread The eyes of all then open d wide the gates And push d aside the bolts and led within Both Priam and the treasure laden wain But when they reach d Achilles lofty tent Which for their King the Myrmidons had built Of fir trees fell d and overlaid the roof With rushes mown from off the neighb ring mead And all around a spacious court enclos d With cross set palisades a single bar Of fir the gateway guarded which to shut Three men of all the others scarce suffic d And three to open but Achilles hand Unaided shut with ease the massive bar Then for the old man Hermes op d the gate And brought within the court the gifts design d For Peleus godlike son then from the car Sprang to the ground and thus to Priam spoke Old man a God hath hither been thy guide Hermes I am and sent to thee from Jove Father of all to bring thee safely here I now return nor to Achilles eyes Will I appear beseems it not a God To greet a mortal in the sight of all But go thou in and clasp Achilles knees And supplicate him for his father s sake His fair hair d mother s and his child s that so Thy words may stir an answer in his heart Thus saying Hermes to Olympus heights Return d and Priam from his chariot sprang And left Idaeus there in charge to keep The horses and the mules while he himself Enter d the dwelling straight where wont to sit Achilles lov d of Heav n The chief he found Within his followers seated all apart Two only in his presence minister d The brave Automedon and Alcimus A warrior bold scarce ended the repast Of food and wine the table still was set Great Priam enter d unperceiv d of all And standing by Achilles with his arms Embrac d his knees and kiss d those fearful hands Blood stain d which many of his sons had slain As when a man by cruel fate pursued In his own land hath shed another s blood And flying seeks beneath some wealthy house A foreign refuge wond ring all behold On godlike Priam so with wonder gaz d Achilles wonder seiz d th attendants all And one to other looked then Priam thus To Peleus son his suppliant speech address d Think great Achilles rival of the Gods Upon thy father e en as I myself Upon the threshold of unjoyous age And haply he from them that dwell around May suffer wrong with no protector near To give him aid yet he rejoicing knows That thou still liv saint and day by day may hope To see his son returning safe from Troy While I all hapless that have many sons The best and bravest through the breadth of Troy Begotten deem that none are left me now Fifty there were when came the sons of Greece Nineteen the offspring of a single womb The rest the women of my household bore Of these have many by relentless Mars Been laid in dust but he my only one The city s and his brethren s sole defence He bravely fighting in his country s cause Hector but lately by thy hand hath fall n On his behalf I venture to approach The Grecian ships for his release to thee To make my pray r and priceless ransom pay Then thou Achilles reverence the Gods And for thy father s sake look pitying down On me more needing pity since I bear Such grief as never man on earth hath borne Who stoop to kiss the hand that slew my son Thus as he spoke within Achilles breast Fond mem ry of his father rose he touch d The old man s hand and gently put him by Then wept they both by various mem ries stirr d One prostrate at Achilles feet bewail d His warrior son Achilles for his sire And for Patroclus wept his comrade dear And through the house their weeping loud was heard But when Achilles had indulg d his grief And eas d the yearning of his heart and limbs Uprising with his hand the aged sire Pitying his hoary head and hoary beard He rais d and thus with gentle words address d Alas what sorrows poor old man are thine How couldst thou venture to the Grecian ships Alone and to the presence of the man Whose hand hath slain so many of thy sons Many and brave an iron heart is thine But sit thou on this seat and in our hearts Though filled with grief let us that grief suppress For woful lamentation nought avails Such is the thread the Gods for mortals spin To live in woe while they from cares are free Two coffers lie beside the door of Jove With gifts for man one good the other ill To whom from each the Lord of lightning gives Him sometimes evil sometimes good befalls To whom the ill alone him foul disgrace And grinding mis ry o er the earth pursue By God and man alike despis d he roams Thus from his birth the Gods to Peleus gave Excellent gifts with wealth and substance bless d Above his fellows o er the Myrmidons He rul d with sov reign sway and Heav n bestow d On him a mortal an immortal bride Yet this of ill was mingled in his lot That in his house no rising race he saw Of future Kings one only son he had One doom d to early death nor is it mine To tend my father s age but far from home Thee and thy sons in Troy I vex with war Much have we heard too of thy former wealth Above what Lesbos northward Macar s seat Contains and Upper Phrygia and the shores Of boundless Hellespont tis said that thou In wealth and number of thy sons wast bless d But since on thee this curse the Gods have brought Still round thy city war and murder rage Bear up nor thus with grief incessant mourn Vain is thy sorrow for thy gallant son Thou canst not raise him and mayst suffer more To whom in answer Priam godlike sire Tell me not yet illustrious chief to sit While Hector lies uncar d for in the tent But let me quickly go that with mine eyes I may behold my son and thou accept The ample treasures which we tender thee Mayst thou enjoy them and in safety reach Thy native land since thou hast spar d my life And bidd saint me still behold the light of Heav n To whom Achilles thus with stern regard Old man incense me not I mean myself To give thee back thy son for here of late Despatch d by Jove my Goddess mother came The daughter of the aged Ocean God And thee too Priam well I know some God I cannot err hath guided to our ships No mortal though in vent rous youth would dare Our camp to enter nor could hope to pass Unnotic d by the watch nor easily Remove the pond rous bar that guards our doors But stir not up my anger in my grief Lest suppliant though thou be within my tent I brook thee not and Jove s command transgress He said the old man trembled and obey d Then to the door way with a lion s spring Achilles rush d not unaccompanied With him Automedon and Aleimus His two attendants of his followers all Next to the lost Patroclus best esteem d They from the yoke the mules and horses loos d Then led the herald of the old man in And bade him sit and from the polish d wain The costly ransom took of Hector s head Two robes they left and one well woven vest To clothe the corpse and send with honour home Then to the female slaves he gave command To wash the body and anoint with oil Apart that Priam might not see his son Lest his griev d heart its passion unrestrain d Should utter and Achilles rous d to wrath His suppliant slay and Jove s command transgress When they had wash d the body and with oil Anointed and around it wrapp d the robe And vest Achilles lifted up the dead With his own hands and laid him on the couch Which to the polish d wain his followers rais d Then groaning on his friend by name he call d Forgive Patroclus be not wroth with me If in the realm of darkness thou shouldst hear That godlike Hector to his father s arms For no mean ransom I restore whereof A fitting share for thee I set aside This said Achilles to the tent return d On the carv d couch from whence he rose he sat Beside the wall and thus to Priam spoke Old man thy son according to thy pray r Is giv n thee back upon the couch he lies Thyself shalt see him at the dawn of day Meanwhile the ev ning meal demands our care Not fair hair d Niobe abstain d from food When in the house her children lay in death Six beauteous daughters and six stalwart sons The youths Apollo with his silver bow The maids the Archer Queen Diana slew With anger fill d that Niobe presum d Herself with fair Latona to compare Her many children with her rival s two So by the two were all the many slain Nine days in death they lay and none was there To pay their fun ral rites for Saturn s son Had given to all the people hearts of stone At length th immortal Gods entomb d the dead Nor yet did Niobe when now her grief Had worn itself in tears from food refrain And now in Sipylus amid the rocks And lonely mountains where the Goddess nymphs That love to dance by Achelous stream Tis said were cradled she though turn d to stone Broods o er the wrongs inflicted by the Gods So we too godlike sire the meal may share And later thou thy noble son mayst mourn To Troy restor d well worthy he thy tears This said he slaughter d straight a white fleec d sheep His comrades then the carcase flay d and dress d The meat prepar d and fasten d to the spits Roasted with care and from the fire withdrew The bread Automedon from baskets fair Apportion d out the meat Achilles shar d They on the viands set before them fell The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied In wonder Priam on Achilles gaz d His form and stature as a God he seem d And he too look d on Priam and admir d His venerable face and gracious speech With mutual pleasure each on other gaz d Till godlike Priam first address d his host Dismiss me now illustrious chief to rest And lie we down in gentle slumbers wrapp d For never have mine eyes been clos d in sleep Since by thy hand my gallant son was slain But groaning still I brood upon my woes And in my court with dust my head defile Now have I tasted bread now ruddy wine Hath o er my palate pass d but not till now Thus he his comrades and th attendant maids Achilles order d in the corridor Two mattresses to place with blankets fair Of purple wool o erlaid and on the top Rugs and soft sheets for upper cov ring spread They from the chamber torch in hand withdrew And with obedient haste two beds prepar d Then thus Achilles spoke in jesting tone Thou needs must sleep without my good old friend Lest any leader of the Greeks should come As is their custom to confer with me Of them whoe er should find thee here by night Forthwith to Agamemnon would report And Hector might not be so soon restor d But tell me truly this how many days For godlike Hector s fun ral rites ye need That for so long a time I may myself Refrain from combat and the people stay To whom in answer Priam godlike sire If by thy leave we may indeed perform His fun ral rites to thee Achilles great Will be our gratitude if this thou grant Thou know saint how close the town is hemm d around And from the mountain distant as it is The Trojans well may fear to draw the wood Nine days to public mourning would we give The tenth to fun ral rites and fun ral feast Then on th eleventh would we raise his mound The twelfth renew the war if needs we must To whom Achilles swift of foot replied So shall it be old Priam I engage To stay the battle for the time requir d Thus speaking with his hand the old man s wrist He grasp d in token that he need not fear Then in the corridor lay down to rest Old Priam and the herald Elders sage While in his tent s recess Achilles slept The fair Briseis resting by his side In night long slumbers lay the other Gods And helmed chiefs by gentle sleep subdued But on the eyes of Hermes Guardian God No slumber fell deep pond ring in his mind How from the ships in safety to conduct The royal Priam and the guard elude Above the sleeper s head he stood and cried Old man small heed thou tak saint of coining ill Who when Achilles gives thee leave to go Sleep saint undisturb d surrounded by thy foes Thy son hath been restor d and thou hast paid A general rous price but to redeem thy life If Agamemnon and the other Greeks Should know that thou art here full thrice so much Thy sons who yet are left would have to pay He said the old man trembled and arous d The herald while the horses and the mules Were yok d by Hermes who with silent speed Drove through th encampment unobserv d of all But when they came to eddying Xanthus ford Fair flowing stream born of immortal Jove To high Olympus Hermes took his flight As morn in saffron robe o er all the earth Was light diffusing they with fun ral wail Drove cityward the horses following came The mules that drew the litter of the dead The plain they travers d o er observ d of none Or man or woman till Cassandra fair As golden Venus from the topmost height Of Pergamus her father in his car Upstanding saw the herald at his side Him too she saw who on the litter lay Then lifted up her voice and cried aloud To all the city Hither Trojans come Both men and women Hector see restor d If while he liv d returning from the fight Ye met him e er rejoicing who indeed Was all the city s chiefest joy and pride She said nor man nor woman then was left Within the city o er the minds of all Grief pass d resistless to the gates in throngs They press d to crowd round him who brought the dead The first to clasp the body were his wife And honour d mother eagerly they sprang On the smooth rolling wain to touch the head Of Hector round them weeping stood the crowd Weeping till sunset all the live long day Had they before the gates for Hector mourn d Had not old Priam from the car address d The crowd Make way that so the mules may pass When to my house I shall have brought my dead Ye there may vent your sorrow as ye will Thus as he spoke obedient to his word They stood aside and for the car made way But when to Priam s lordly house they came They laid him on a rich wrought couch and call d The minstrels in who by the hero s bed Should lead the melancholy chorus they Pour d forth the music of the mournful dirge While women s voices join d in loud lament White arm d Andromache the wail began The head of Hector clasping in her hands My husband thou art gone in pride of youth And in thine house hast left me desolate Thy child an infant still thy child and mine Unhappy parents both nor dare I hope That he may reach the ripeness of his youth For ere that day shall Troy in ruin fall Since thou art gone her guardian thou whose arm Defended her her wives and helpless babes They now shall shortly o er the sea be borne And with them I shall go thou too my child Must follow me to servile labour doom d The suff ring victim of a tyrant Lord Unless perchance some angry Greek may seize And dash thee from the tow r a woful death Whose brother or whose father or whose son By Hector hath been slain for many a Greek By Hector s hand hath bit the bloody dust Not light in battle was thy father s hand Therefore for him the general ral city mourns Thou to thy parents bitter grief hast caus d Hector but bitt rest grief of all hast left To me for not to me was giv n to clasp The hand extended from thy dying bed Nor words of wisdom catch which night and day With tears I might have treasur d in my heart Weeping she spoke the women join d the wail Then Hecuba took up the loud lament Hector of all my children dearest thou Dear to th Immortals too in life wast thou And they in death have borne thee still in mind For other of my sons his captives made Across the wat ry waste to Samos isle Or Imbros or th inhospitable shore Of Lemnos hath Achilles swift of foot To slav ry sold thee when his sharp edg d spear Had robb d thee of thy life he dragg d indeed Around Patroclus tomb his comrade dear Whom thou hadst slain yet so he rais d not up Ilis dead to life again now liest thou here All fresh and fair as dew besprent like one Whom bright Apollo with his arrows keen God of the silver bow hath newly slain Weeping she spoke and rous d the general ral grief Then Helen third the mournful strain renew d Hector of all my brethren dearest thou True godlike Paris claims me as his wife Who bore me hither would I then had died But twenty years have pass d since here I came And left my native land yet ne er from thee I heard one scornful one degrading word And when from others I have borne reproach Thy brothers sisters or thy brothers wives Or mother for thy sire was ever kind E en as a father thou hast check d them still With tender feeling and with gentle words For thee I weep and for myself no less For through the breadth of Troy none love me now None kindly look on me but all abhor Weeping she spoke and with her wept the crowd At length the aged Priam gave command Haste now ye Trojans to the city bring Good store of fuel fear no treach rous wile For when he sent me from the dark ribb d ships Achilles promis d that from hostile arms Till the twelfth morn we should no harm sustain He said and they the oxen and the mules Yok d to the wains and from the city throng d Nine days they labour d and brought back to Troy Good store of wood but when the tenth day s light Upon the earth appear d weeping they bore Brave Hector out and on the fun ral pile Laying the glorious dead applied the torch While yet the rosy finger d morn was young Round noble Hector s pyre the people press d When all were gather d round and closely throng d First on the burning mass as far as spread The range of fire they pour d the ruddy wine And quench d the flames his brethren then and friends Weeping the hot tears flowing down their cheeks Collected from the pile the whiten d bones These in a golden casket they enclos d And o er it spread soft shawls of purple dye Then in a grave they laid it and in haste With stone in pond rous masses cover d o er And rais d a mound and watch d on ev ry side From sudden inroad of the Greeks to guard The mound erected back they turn d and all Assembled duly shar d the solemn feast In Priam s palace Heav n descended King Such were the rites to glorious Hector paid END OF VOLUME II THE END FOOTNOTES one The text of the original leaves it somewhat in doubt whether the anger of the Greeks were directed against Thersites or Agamemnon I believe the preponderance of authority ancient and modern is in favour of the former interpretation but the latter is not without the support of some eminent scholars and after much consideration I have been induced to adopt it The original represents the Greeks as filled with anger and resentment against some one Thersites was an object of general contempt but he had done nothing to excite those feelings indeed apart from the offensiveness of his tone the public sympathy was with him for the army was deeply dissatisfied and resented the conduct of Agamemnon against Achilles mainly perhaps because they had ceased to be enriched with the plunder of his successful forays see i two hundred two and ix three hundred eighty seven This dissatisfaction and resentment are referred to by Neptune xiii one hundred twenty six and by Agamemnon himself xiv fifty five They had lately manifested themselves in the alacrity with which the whole army had caught at the insidious suggestion of abandoning the war and just before the second assembly Thersites avails himself of the general feeling constituting himself the representative of a popular grievance to vent his personal spite against Agamemnon Ulysses saw how dangerous such a display might be at such a moment and artfully assuming line two hundred eighty one that the feeling was confined to Thersites alone though in his subsequent speech line three hundred thirty five he admits and excuses the general discontent he proceeds to cut short its expression by summary chastisement Thereupon the fickle multitude despite their anger against Agamemnon cannot refrain from laughing at the signal discomfiture of their self constituted champion This view is very fully set forth in a note on the passage appended to a translation of the Iliad by mister Barter published in eighteen fifty nine but which I have only seen since the publication of this work two See also Book xxii l two hundred fifty two Milton in the corresponding passage at the close of the fourth Book of Paradise Lost reverses the sign and represents the scale of the vanquished as flying up and kicking the beam The Fiend look d up and knew His mounted scale aloft nor more but fled Murm ring and with him fled the shades of night three This comparison does not afford a very accurate criterion of the space interposed which cannot be estimated without knowing the total distance within which the faster was to outstrip the slower team four This passage would seem to be the result of an oversight on the part of the Poet who apparently had forgotten that Pylasmenes the Paphlagonian Chief had himself been killed by Menelaus some time before the death of his son See Book V l six hundred fifty six five Line forty five et seqq I hope I may be pardoned for having somewhat curtailed the list of these ladies which in the original extends over ten lines of names only In doing so I have followed the example of Virgil who represents the same ladies G four three hundred thirty six in attendance on Cyrene and has not only reduced the list but added some slight touches illustrating their occupations and private history a liberty permissible to an imitator but not to a translator six L one hundred fifty one Chthizos yesterday But either the word must have a more extended signification than is usually given to it or Homer must here have fallen into an error for two complete nights and one day that on which Patroclus met his death had intervened since the visit of Ajax and Ulysses to the tent of Achilles See also l two hundred fifteen seven L five hundred forty seven The terms made use of in this line and in four hundred eighty one may appear somewhat coarse as addressed by one Goddess to another but I assure the English reader that in this passage especially I have greatly softened down the expression of the original a literal translation of which however forcible would shock even the least fastidious critic It must indeed be admitted that the mode in which the white armed Goddess proceeds to execute her threat is hardly more dignified than the language in which it is conveyed is refined eight Line seven hundred thirty seven They being two while I was only one Such I believe to be the true interpretation of this passage which however is one of admitted difficulty According to our modern notions it is not very evident what advantage two men in a car would have over one in another nor what would be gained by the division of labour which assigned the reins to one and the whip to the other but such from line seven hundred forty seven hundred forty one appears to have been the view taken by Homer End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Iliad by
