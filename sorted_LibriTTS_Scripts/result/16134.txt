Thor Then Winfried told the story of Bethlehem I THE CALL OF THE WOODSMAN I The day before Christmas in the year of our Lord seven hundred twenty two Broad snow meadows glistening white along the banks of the river Moselle pallid hill sides blooming with mystic roses where the glow of the setting sun still lingered upon them an arch of clearest faintest azure bending overhead in the center of the aerial landscape of the massive walls of the cloister of Pfalzel gray to the east purple to the west silence over all a gentle eager conscious stillness diffused through the air like perfume as if earth and sky were hushing themselves to hear the voice of the river faintly murmuring down the valley In the cloister too there was silence at the sunset hour All day long there had been a strange and joyful stir among the nuns A breeze of curiosity and excitement had swept along the corridors and through every quiet cell The elder sisters the provost the deaconess the stewardess the portress with her huge bunch of keys jingling at her girdle had been hurrying to and fro busied with household cares In the huge kitchen there was a bustle of hospitable preparation The little bandy legged dogs that kept the spits turning before the fires had been trotting steadily for many an hour until their tongues hung out for want of breath The big black pots swinging from the cranes had bubbled and gurgled and shaken and sent out puffs of appetizing steam saint Martha was in her element It was a field day for her virtues The younger sisters the pupils of the convent had forsaken their Latin books and their embroidery frames their manuscripts and their miniatures and fluttered through the halls in little flocks like merry snow birds all in black and white chattering and whispering together This was no day for tedious task work no day for grammar or arithmetic no day for picking out illuminated letters in red and gold on stiff parchment or patiently chasing intricate patterns over thick cloth with the slow needle It was a holiday A famous visitor had come to the convent It was Winfried of England whose name in the Roman tongue was Boniface and whom men called the Apostle of Germany A great preacher a wonderful scholar he had written a Latin grammar himself think of it and he could hardly sleep without a book under his pillow but more than all a great and daring traveller a venturesome pilgrim a high priest of romance He had left his home and his fair estate in Wessex he would not stay in the rich monastery of Nutescelle even though they had chosen him as the abbot he had refused a bishopric at the court of King Karl Nothing would content him but to go out into the wild woods and preach to the heathen Up and down through the forests of Hesse and Thuringia and along the borders of Saxony he had wandered for years with a handful of companions sleeping under the trees crossing mountains and marshes now here now there never satisfied with ease and comfort always in love with hardship and danger What a man he was Fair and slight but straight as a spear and strong as an oaken staff His face was still young the smooth skin was bronzed by wing and sun His gray eyes clear and kind flashed like fire when he spoke of his adventures and of the evil deeds of the false priests with whom he had contended What tales he had told that day Not of miracles wrought by sacred relics nor of courts and councils and splendid cathedrals though he knew much of these things and had been at Rome and received the Pope s blessing But to day he had spoken of long journeyings by sea and land of perils by fire and flood of wolves and bears and fierce snowstorms and black nights in the lonely forest of dark altars of heaven gods and weird bloody sacrifices and narrow escapes from wandering savages The little novices had gathered around him and their faces had grown pale and their eyes bright as they listened with parted lips entranced in admiration twining their arms about one another s shoulders and holding closely together half in fear half in delight The older nuns had turned from their tasks and paused in passing by to hear the pilgrim s story Too well they knew the truth of what he spoke Many a one among them had seen the smoke rising from the ruins of her father s roof Many a one had a brother far away in the wild country to whom her heart went out night and day wondering if he were still among the living But now the excitements of that wonderful day were over the hours of the evening meal had come the inmates of the cloister were assembled in the refectory On the dais sat the stately Abbess Addula daughter of King Dagobert looking a princess indeed in her violet tunic with the hood and cuffs of her long white robe trimmed with fur and a snowy veil resting like a crown on her snowy hair At her right hand was the honoured guest and at her left hand her grandson the young Prince Gregor a big manly boy just returned from school The long shadowy hall with its dark brown raters and beams the double rows of nuns with their pure veils and fair faces the ruddy flow of the slanting sunbeams striking upwards through the tops of the windows and painting a pink glow high up on the walls it was all as beautiful as a picture and as silent For this was the rule of the cloister that at the table all should sit in stillness for a little while and then one should read aloud while the rest listened It is the turn of my grandson to read to day said the abbess to Winfried we shall see how much he has learned in the school Read Gregor the place in the book is marked The tall lad rose from his seat and turned the pages of the manuscript It was a copy of Jerome s version of the Scriptures in Latin and the marked place was in the letter of saint Paul to the Ephesians the passage where he describes the preparation of the Christian as the arming of a warrior for glorious battle The young voice rang out clearly rolling the sonorous words without slip or stumbling to the end of the chapter Winfried listened smiling My son said he as the reader paused that was bravely read Understandest thou what thou readest Surely father answered the boy it was taught me by the masters at Treves and we have read this epistle clear through from beginning to end so that I almost know it by heart Then he began again to repeat the passage turning away from the page as if to show his skill But Winfried stopped him with a friendly lifting of the hand No so my son that was not my meaning When we pray we speak to God when we read it is God who speaks to us I ask whether thou hast heard what He has said to thee in thine own words in the common speech Come give us again the message of the warrior and his armour and his battle in the mother tongue so that all can understand it The boy hesitated blushed stammered then he came around to Winfried s seat bringing the book Take the book my father he cried and read it for me I cannot see the meaning plain though I love the sound of the words Religion I know and the doctrines of our faith and the life of priests and nuns in the cloister for which my grandmother designs me though it likes me little And fighting I know and the life of warriors and heroes for I have read of it in Virgil and the ancients and heard a bit from the soldiers at Treves and I would fain taste more of it for it likes me much But how the two lives fit together or what need there is of armour for a clerk in holy orders I can never see Tell me the meaning for if there is a man in all the world that knows it I am sure it is none other than thou So Winfried took the book and closed it clasping the boy s hand with his own Let us first dismiss the others to their vespers said he lest they should be weary A sign from the abbess a chanted benediction a murmuring of sweet voices and a soft rustling of many feet over the rushes on the floor the gentle tide of noise flowed out through the doors and ebbed away down the corridors the three at the head of the table were left alone in the darkening room Then Winfried began to translate the parable of the soldier into the realities of life At every turn he knew how to flash a new light into the picture out of his own experience He spoke of the combat with self and of the wrestling with dark spirits in solitude He spoke of the demons that men had worshipped for centuries in the wilderness and whose malice they invoked against the stranger who ventured into the gloomy forest Gods they called them and told strange tales of their dwelling among the impenetrable branches of the oldest trees and in the caverns of the shaggy hills of their riding on the wind horses and hurling spears of lightning against their foes Gods they were not but foul spirits of the air rulers of the darkness Was there not glory and honour in fighting with them in daring their anger under the shield of faith in putting them to flight with the sword of truth What better adventure could a brave man ask than to go forth against them and wrestle with them and conquer them Look you my friends said Winfried how sweet and peaceful is this convent to night on the eve of the nativity of the Prince of Peace It is a garden full of flowers in the heart of winter a nest among the branches of a great tree shaken by the winds a still haven on the edge of a tempestuous sea And this is what religion means for those who are chosen and called to quietude and prayer and meditation But out yonder in the wide forest who knows what storms are raving to night in the hearts of men though all the woods are still who knows what haunts of wrath and cruelty and fear are closed to night against the advent of the Prince of Peace And shall I tell you what religion means to those who are called and chosen to dare and to fight and to conquer the world for Christ It means to launch out into the deep It means to go against the strongholds of the adversary It means to struggle to win an entrance for their Master everywhere What helmet is strong enough for this strife save the helmet of salvation What breastplate can guard a man against these fiery darts but the breastplate of righteousness What shoes can stand the wear of these journeys but the preparation of the gospel of peace Shoes he cried again and laughed as if a sudden thought had struck him He thrust out his foot covered with a heavy cowhide boot laced high about his leg with thongs of skin See here how a fighting man of the cross is shod I have seen the boots of the Bishop of Tours white kid broidered with silk a day in the bogs would tear them to shreds I have seen the sandals that the monks use on the highroads yes and worn them ten pair of them have I worn out and thrown away in a single journey Now I shoe my feet with the toughest hides hard as iron no rock can cut them no branches can tear them Yet more than one pair of these have I outworn and many more shall I outwear ere my journeys are ended And I think if God is gracious to me that I shall die wearing them Better so than in a soft bed with silken coverings The boots of a warrior a hunter a woodsman these are my preparation of the gospel of peace Come Gregor he said laying his brown hand on the youth s shoulder come wear the forester s boots with me This is the life to which we are called Be strong in the Lord a hunter of the demons a subduer of the wilderness a woodsman of the faith Come The boy s eyes sparkled He turned to his grandmother She shook her head vigorously Nay father she said draw not the lad away from my side with these wild words I need him to help me with my labours to cheer my old age Do you need him more than the Master does asked Winfried and will you take the wood that is fit for a bow to make a distaff But I fear for the child Thy life is too hard for him He will perish with hunger in the woods Once said Winfried smiling we were camped by the bank of the river Ohru The table was spread for the morning meal but my comrades cried that it was empty the provisions were exhausted we must go without breakfast and perhaps starve before we could escape from the wilderness While they complained a fish hawk flew up from the river with flapping wings and let fall a great pike in the midst of the camp There was food enough and to spare Never have I seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread But the fierce pagans of the forest cried the abbess they may pierce the boy with their arrows or dash out his brains with their axes He is but a child too young for the dangers of strife A child in years replied Winfried but a man in spirit And if the hero must fall early in the battle he wears the brighter crown not a leaf withered not a flower fallen The aged princess trembled a little She drew Gregor close to her side and laid her hand gently on his brown hair I am not sure that he wants to leave me yet Besides there is no horse in the stable to give him now and he cannot go as befits the grandson of a king Gregor looked straight into her eyes Grandmother said he dear grandmother if thou wilt not give me a horse to ride with this man of God I will go with him afoot Illustration The fields around lay bare to the moon II THE TRAIL THROUGH THE FOREST II Two years had passed to a day almost to an hour since that Christmas eve in the cloister of Pfalzel A little company of pilgrims less than a score a men were creeping slowly northward through the wide forest that rolled over the hills of central Germany At the head of the band marched Winfried clad in a tunic of fur with his long black robe girt high about his waist so that it might not hinder his stride His hunter s boots were crusted with snow Drops of ice sparkled like jewels along the thongs that bound his legs There was no other ornament to his dress except the bishop s cross hanging on his breast and the broad silver clasp that fastened his cloak about his neck He carried a strong tall staff in his hand fashioned at the top into the form of a cross Close beside him keeping step like a familiar comrade was the young Prince Gregor Long marches through the wilderness had stretched his limbs and broadened his back and made a man of him in stature as well as in spirit His jacket and cap were of wolfskin and on his shoulder he carried an axe with broad shining blade He was a mighty woodsman now and could make a spray of chips fly around him as he hewed his way through the trunk of spruce tree Behind these leaders followed a pair of teamsters guiding a rude sledge loaded with food and the equipage of the camp and drawn by two big shaggy horses blowing thick clouds of steam from their frosty nostrils Tiny icicles hung from the hairs on their lips Their flanks were smoking They sank above the fetlocks at every step in the soft snow Last of all came the rear guard armed with bows and javelins It was no child s play in those days to cross Europe afoot The weird woodland sombre and illimitable covered hill and vale tableland and mountain peak There were wide moors where the wolves hunted in packs as if the devil drove them and tangled thickets where the lynx and the boar made their lairs Fierce bears lurked among the rocky passes and had not yet learned to fear the face of man The gloomy recesses of the forest gave shelter to inhabitants who were still more cruel and dangerous than beasts of prey outlaws and sturdy robbers and mad were wolves and bands of wandering pillagers The pilgrim who would pass from the mouth of the Tiber to the mouth of the Rhine must travel with a little army of retainers or else trust in God and keep his arrows loose in the quiver The travellers were surrounded by an ocean of trees so vast so full of endless billows that it seemed to be pressing on every side to overwhelm them Gnarled oaks with branches twisted and knotted as if in rage rose in groves like tidal waves Smooth forests of beech trees round and gray swept over the knolls and slopes of land in a mighty ground swell But most of all the multitude of pines and firs innumerable and monotonous with straight stark trunks and branches woven together in an unbroken Hood of darkest green crowded through the valleys and over the hills rising on the highest ridges into ragged crests like the foaming edge of breakers Through this sea of shadows ran a narrow stream of shining whiteness an ancient Roman road covered with snow It was as if some great ship had ploughed through the green ocean long ago and left behind it a thick smooth wake of foam Along this open track the travellers held their way heavily for the drifts were deep warily for the hard winter had driven many packs of wolves down from the moors The steps of the pilgrims were noiseless but the sledges creaked over the dry snow and the panting of the horses throbbed through the still cold air The pale blue shadows on the western side of the road grew longer The sun declining through its shallow arch dropped behind the tree tops Darkness followed swiftly as if it had been a bird of prey waiting for this sign to swoop down upon the world Father said Gregor to the leader surely this day s march is done It is time to rest and eat and sleep If we press onward now we cannot see our steps and will not that be against the word of the psalmist David who bids us not to put confidence in the legs of a man Winfried laughed Nay my son Gregor said he thou hast tripped even now upon thy text For David said only I take no pleasure in the legs of a man And so say I for I am not minded to spare thy legs or mine until we come farther on our way and do what must be done this night Draw the belt tighter my son and hew me out this tree that is fallen across the road for our campground is not here The youth obeyed two of the foresters sprang to help him and while the soft fir wood yielded to the stroke of the axes and the snow flew from the bending branches Winfried turned and spoke to his followers in a cheerful voice that refreshed them like wine Courage brothers and forward yet a little The moon will light us presently and the path is plain Well know I that the journey is weary and my own heart wearies also for the home in England where those I love are keeping feast this Christmas eve But we have work to do before we feast to night For this is the Yuletide and the heathen people of the forest have gathered at the thunder oak of Geismar to worship their god Thor Strange things will be seen there and deeds which make the soul black But we are sent to lighten their darkness and we will teach our kinsmen to keep a Christmas with us such as the woodland has never known Forward then and let us stiffen up our feeble knees A murmur of assent came from the men Even the horses seemed to take fresh heart They flattened their backs to draw the heavy loads and blew the frost from their nostrils as they pushed ahead The night grew broader and less oppressive A gate of brightness was opened secretly somewhere in the sky higher and higher swelled the clear moon flood until it poured over the eastern wall of forest into the road A drove of wolves howled faintly in the distance but they were receding and the sound soon died away The stars sparkled merrily through the stringent air the small round moon shone like silver little breaths of the dreaming wind wandered whispering across the pointed fir tops as the pilgrims toiled bravely onward following their clue of light through a labyrinth of darkness After a while the road began to open out a little There were spaces of meadow land fringed with alders behind which a boisterous river ran clashing through spears of ice Rude houses of hewn logs appeared in the openings each one casting a patch of inky blackness upon the snow Then the travellers passed a larger group of dwellings all silent and unlighted and beyond they saw a great house with many outbuildings and enclosed courtyards from which the hounds bayed furiously and a noise of stamping horses came from the stalls But there was no other sound of life The fields around lay bare to the moon They saw no man except that once on a path that skirted the farther edge of a meadow three dark figures passed by running very swiftly Then the road plunged again into a dense thicket traversed it and climbing to the left emerged suddenly upon a glade round and level except at the northern side where a swelling hillock was crowned with a huge oak tree It towered above the heath a giant with contorted arms beckoning to the host of lesser trees Here cried Winfried as his eyes flashed and his hand lifted his heavy staff here is the Thunder oak and here the cross of Christ shall break the hammer of the false god Thor Illustration The sacred hammer of the god Thor III THE SHADOW OF THE THUNDER OAK III 
8113_301693_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Withered leaves still clung to the branches of the oak torn and faded banners of the departed summer 
8113_301693_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The bright crimson of autumn had long since disappeared bleached away by the storms and the cold 
8113_301693_000004_000002	train-clean-360	But to night these tattered remnants of glory were red again ancient bloodstains against the dark blue sky 
none	none	For an immense fire had been kindled in front of the tree Tongues of ruddy flame fountains of ruby sparks ascended through the spreading limbs and flung a fierce illumination upward and around ward and around The pale pure moonlight that bathed the surrounding forests was quenched and eclipsed here Not a beam of it sifted down ward through the branches of the oak It stood like a pillar of cloud between the still light of heaven and the crackling flashing fire of earth But the fire itself was invisible to Winfried and his companions A great throng of people were gathered around it in a half circle their backs to the open glade their faces towards the oak 
8113_301693_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Seen against that glowing background it was but the silhouette of a crowd vague black formless mysterious 
8113_301693_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The travellers paused for a moment at the edge of the thicket and took counsel together 
8113_301693_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 It is the assembly of the tribe said one of the foresters the great night of the council 
8113_301693_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I heard of it three days ago as we passed through one of the villages 
8113_301693_000007_000002	train-clean-360	All who swear by the old gods have been summoned 
none	none	They will sacrifice a steed to the god of war and drink blood and eat horse flesh to make them strong 
8113_301693_000007_000004	train-clean-360	It will be at the peril of our lives if we approach them 
8113_301693_000007_000005	train-clean-360	At least we must hide the cross if we would escape death 
none	none	Hide me no cross cried Winfried lifting his staff for I have come to show it and to make these blind folk see its power There is more to be done here to night than the slaying of a steed and a greater evil to be stayed than the shameful eating of meat sacrificed to idols 
8113_301693_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I have seen it in a dream 
8113_301693_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Here the cross must stand and be our rede 
none	none	At his command the sledge was left in the border of the wood with two of the men to guard it and the rest of the company moved forward across the open ground 
8113_301693_000009_000001	train-clean-360	They approached unnoticed for all the multitude were looking intently towards the fire at the foot of the oak 
none	none	Then Winfried s voice rang out Hail ye sons of the forest 
8113_301693_000010_000001	train-clean-360	A stranger claims the warmth of your fire in the winter night 
none	none	Swiftly and as with a single motion a thousand eyes were bent upon the speaker The semicircle opened silently in the middle Winfried entered with his followers it closed again behind them Then as they looked round the curving ranks they saw that the hue of the assemblage was not black but white dazzling radiant solemn White the robes of the women clustered together at the points of the wide crescent white the glittering byrnies of the warriors standing in close ranks white the fur mantles of the aged men who held the central place in the circle white with the shimmer of silver ornaments and the purity of lamb s wool the raiment of a little group of children who stood close by the fire white with awe and fear the faces of all who looked at them and over all the flickering dancing radiance of the flames played and glimmered like a faint vanishing tinge of blood on snow 
8113_301693_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The only figure untouched by the glow was the old priest Hunrad with his long spectral robe flowing hair and beard and dead pale face who stood with his back to the fire and advanced slowly to meet the strangers 
8113_301693_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Who are you 
8113_301693_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Whence come you and what seek you here His voice was heavy and toneless as a muffled bell 
none	none	You kinsman am I of the German brotherhood answered Winfried and from England beyond the sea have I come to bring you a greeting from that land and a message from the All Father whose servant I am Welcome then said Hunrad welcome kinsman and be silent for what passes here is too high to wait and must be done before the moon crosses the middle heaven unless indeed thou hast some sign or token from the gods 
8113_301693_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Canst thou work miracles 
8113_301693_000017_000000	train-clean-360	The question came sharply as if a sudden gleam of hope had flashed through the tangle of the old priest s mind 
none	none	But Winfried s voice sank lower and a cloud of disappointment passed over his face as he replied Nay miracles have I never wrought though I have heard of many but the All Father has given no power to my hands save such as belongs to common man
8113_301693_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Stand still then thou common man said Hunrad scornfully and behold what the gods have called us hither to do 
none	none	This night is the death night of the sun god Baldur the Beautiful beloved of gods and men 
8113_301693_000018_000002	train-clean-360	This night is the hour of darkness and the power of winter of sacrifice and mighty fear 
none	none	This night the great Thor the god of thunder and war to whom this oak is sacred is grieved for the death of Baldur and angry with this people because they have forsaken his worship Long is it since an offering has been laid upon his altar long since the roots of his holy tree have been fed with blood Therefore its leaves have withered before the time and its boughs are heavy with death Therefore the Slavs and the Wends have beaten us in battle Therefore the harvests have failed and the wolf hordes have ravaged the folds and the strength has departed from the bow and the wood of the spear has broken and the wild boar has slain the huntsman Therefore the plague has fallen on our dwellings and the dead are more than the living in all our villages Answer me ye people are not these things true A hoarse sound of approval ran through the circle A chant in which the voices of the men and women blended like the shrill wind in the pine trees above the rumbling thunder of a waterfall rose and fell in rude cadences O Thor the Thunderer Mighty and merciless Spare us from smiting Heave not thy hammer Angry against us Plague not thy people Take from our treasure Richest of ransom Silver we send thee Jewels and javelins Goodliest garments All our possessions Priceless we proffer Sheep will we slaughter Steeds will we sacrifice Bright blood shall bathe thee O tree of Thunder Life floods shall lave thee Strong wood of wonder Mighty have mercy Smite us no more Spare us and save us Spare us Thor Thor With two great shouts the song ended and a stillness followed so intense that the crackling of the fire was heard distinctly 
8113_301693_000021_000001	train-clean-360	The old priest stood silent for a moment 
8113_301693_000021_000002	train-clean-360	His shaggy brows swept down over his eyes like ashes quenching flame 
8113_301693_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Then he lifted his face and spoke 
8113_301693_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 None of these things will please the god 
8113_301693_000022_000001	train-clean-360	More costly is the offering that shall cleanse your sin more precious the crimson dew that shall send new life into this holy tree of blood 
8113_301693_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Thor claims your dearest and your noblest gift 
none	none	Hunrad moved nearer to the handful of children who stood watching the red mines in the fire and the swarms of spark serpents darting upward They had heeded none of the priest s words and did not notice now that he approached them so eager were they to see which fiery snake would go highest among the oak branches Foremost among them and most intent on the pretty game was a boy like a sunbeam slender and quick with blithe brown eyes and laughing lips The priest s hand was laid upon his shoulder The boy turned and looked up in his face
8113_301693_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Here said the old man with his voice vibrating as when a thick rope is strained by a ship swinging from her moorings here is the chosen one the eldest son of the Chief the darling of the people 
8113_301693_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Hearken Bernhard wilt thou go to Valhalla where the heroes dwell with the gods to bear a message to Thor 
8113_301693_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The boy answered swift and clear 
8113_301693_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes priest I will go if my father bids me 
8113_301693_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Is it far away Shall I run quickly 
8113_301693_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Must I take my bow and arrows for the wolves 
none	none	The boy s father the Chieftain Gundhar standing among his bearded warriors drew his breath deep and leaned so heavily on the handle of his spear that the wood cracked And his wife Irma bending forward from the ranks of women pushed the golden hair from her forehead with one hand 
8113_301693_000027_000002	train-clean-360	The other dragged at the silver chain about her neck until the rough links pierced her flesh and the red drops fell unheeded on the snow of her breast 
none	none	A sigh passed through the crowd like the murmur of the forest before the storm breaks Yet no one spoke save Hunrad
8113_301693_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes my Prince both bow and spear shalt thou have for the way is long and thou art a brave huntsman 
8113_301693_000029_000001	train-clean-360	But in darkness thou must journey for a little space and with eyes blindfolded 
8113_301693_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Fearest thou 
8113_301693_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Naught fear I said the boy neither darkness nor the great bear nor the were wolf 
none	none	For I am Gundhar s son and the defender of my folk 
8113_301693_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Then the priest led the child in his raiment of lamb s wool to a broad stone in front of the fire 
8113_301693_000031_000001	train-clean-360	He gave him his little bow tipped with silver and his spear with shining head of steel 
8113_301693_000031_000002	train-clean-360	He bound the child s eyes with a white cloth and bade him kneel beside the stone with his face to the east 
none	none	Unconsciously the wide arc of spectators drew inward toward the centre as the ends of the bow draw together when the cord is stretched 
8113_301693_000031_000004	train-clean-360	Winfried moved noiselessly until he stood close behind the priest 
8113_301693_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The old man stooped to lift a black hammer of stone from the ground the sacred hammer of the god Thor 
8113_301693_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Summoning all the strength of his withered arms he swung it high in the air 
8113_301693_000032_000002	train-clean-360	It poised for an instant above the child s fair head then turned to fall 
8113_301693_000033_000000	train-clean-360	One keen cry shrilled out from where the women stood Me take me 
8113_301693_000033_000001	train-clean-360	not Bernhard 
none	none	The flight of the mother towards her child was swift as the falcon s swoop 
8113_301693_000034_000001	train-clean-360	But swifter still was the hand of the deliverer 
8113_301693_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Winfried s heavy staff thrust mightily against the hammer s handle as it fell 
8113_301693_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Sideways it glanced from the old man s grasp and the black stone striking on the altar s edge split in twain 
none	none	A shout of awe and joy rolled along the living circle 
8113_301693_000035_000003	train-clean-360	The branches of the oak shivered 
none	none	The flames leaped higher As the shout died away the people saw the lady Irma with her arms clasped round her child and above them on the altar stone Winfried his face shining like the face of an angel Illustration Then Winfried told the story of Bethlehem IV THE FELLING OF THE TREE IV 
8113_301694_000004_000000	train-clean-360	A swift mountain flood rolling down its channel a huge rock tumbling from the hill side and falling in mid stream the baffled waters broken and confused pausing in their flow dash high against the rock foaming and murmuring with divided impulse uncertain whether to turn to the right or the left 
8113_301694_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Even so Winfried s bold deed fell into the midst of the thoughts and passions of the council 
8113_301694_000005_000001	train-clean-360	They were at a standstill 
none	none	Anger and wonder reverence and joy and confusion surged through the crowd They knew not which way to move to resent the intrusion of the stranger as an insult to their gods or to welcome him as the rescuer of their darling prince 
8113_301694_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The old priest crouched by the altar silent 
8113_301694_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Conflicting counsels troubled the air 
8113_301694_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Let the sacrifice go forward the gods must be appeased 
none	none	Nay the boy must not die bring the chieftain s best horse and slay it in his stead it will be enough the holy tree loves the blood of horses 
8113_301694_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Not so there is a better counsel yet seize the stranger whom the gods have led hither as a victim and make his life pay the forfeit of his daring 
none	none	The withered leaves on the oak rustled and whispered overhead The fire flared and sank again 
8113_301694_000007_000002	train-clean-360	The angry voices clashed against each other and fell like opposing waves 
8113_301694_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Then the chieftain Gundhar struck the earth with his spear and gave his decision 
8113_301694_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 All have spoken but none are agreed 
8113_301694_000008_000001	train-clean-360	There is no voice of the council 
8113_301694_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Keep silence now and let the stranger speak 
8113_301694_000008_000003	train-clean-360	His words shall give us judgment whether he is to live or to die 
8113_301694_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Winfried lifted himself high upon the altar drew a roll of parchment from his bosom and began to read 
none	none	A letter from the great Bishop of Rome who sits on a golden throne to the people of the forest Hessians and Thuringians Franks and Saxons In nomine Domini sanctae et individuae trinitatis amen 
8113_301694_000011_000000	train-clean-360	A murmur of awe ran through the crowd 
none	none	It is the sacred tongue of the Romans the tongue that is heard and understood by the wise men of every land 
8113_301694_000011_000002	train-clean-360	There is magic in it 
none	none	Listen Winfried went on to read the letter translating it into the speech of the people We have sent unto you our Brother Boniface and appointed him your bishop that he may teach you the only true faith and baptize you and lead you back from the ways of error to the path of salvation 
8113_301694_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Hearken to him in all things like a father 
8113_301694_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Bow your hearts to his teaching 
8113_301694_000013_000003	train-clean-360	He comes not for earthly gain but for the gain of your souls 
8113_301694_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Depart from evil works 
8113_301694_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Worship not the false gods for they are devils 
8113_301694_000013_000006	train-clean-360	Offer no more bloody sacrifices nor eat the flesh of horses but do as our Brother Boniface commands you 
8113_301694_000013_000007	train-clean-360	Build a house for him that he may dwell among you and a church where you may offer your prayers to the only living God the Almighty King of Heaven 
8113_301694_000014_000000	train-clean-360	It was a splendid message proud strong peaceful loving 
8113_301694_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The dignity of the words imposed mightily upon the hearts of the people 
8113_301694_000014_000002	train-clean-360	They were quieted as men who have listened to a lofty strain of music 
8113_301694_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell us then said Gundhar what is the word that thou bringest to us from the Almighty 
none	none	What is thy counsel for the tribes of the woodland on this night of sacrifice This is the word and this is the counsel answered Winfried Not a drop of blood shall fall to night save that which pity has drawn from the breast of your princess in love for her child 
8113_301694_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Not a life shall be blotted out in the darkness tonight but the great shadow of the tree which hides you from the light of heaven shall be swept away 
none	none	For this is the birth night of the white Christ son of the All Father and Saviour of mankind Fairer is He than Baldur the Beautiful greater than Odin the Wise kinder than Freya the Good 
8113_301694_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Since He has come to earth the bloody sacrifices must cease 
8113_301694_000016_000005	train-clean-360	The dark Thor on whom you vainly call is dead 
none	none	Deep in the shades of Niffelheim he is lost forever 
8113_301694_000016_000007	train-clean-360	His power in the world is broken 
8113_301694_000016_000008	train-clean-360	Will you serve a helpless god 
8113_301694_000016_000009	train-clean-360	See my brothers you call this tree his oak 
8113_301694_000016_000010	train-clean-360	Does he dwell here 
8113_301694_000016_000011	train-clean-360	Does he protect it 
8113_301694_000017_000000	train-clean-360	A troubled voice of assent rose from the throng 
8113_301694_000017_000001	train-clean-360	The people stirred uneasily 
8113_301694_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Women covered their eyes 
8113_301694_000017_000003	train-clean-360	Hunrad lifted his head and muttered hoarsely Thor take vengeance 
none	none	Thor 
8113_301694_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Winfried beckoned to Gregor 
8113_301694_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 Bring the axes thine and one for me 
8113_301694_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Now young woodsman show thy craft 
8113_301694_000018_000003	train-clean-360	The king tree of the forest must fall and swiftly or all is lost 
8113_301694_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The two men took their places facing each other one on each side of the oak 
none	none	Their cloaks were flung aside their heads bare Carefully they felt the ground with their feet seeking a firm grip of the earth 
8113_301694_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Firmly they grasped the axe helves and swung the shining blades 
8113_301694_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Tree god cried Winfried art thou angry 
none	none	Thus we smite thee Tree god answered Gregor art thou mighty 
8113_301694_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Thus we fight thee 
none	none	Clang clang the alternate strokes beat time upon the hard ringing wood 
8113_301694_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The axe heads glittered in their rhythmic flight like fierce eagles circling about their quarry 
8113_301694_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The broad flakes of wood flew from the deepening gashes in the sides of the oak 
none	none	The huge trunk quivered There was a shuddering in the branches 
8113_301694_000023_000003	train-clean-360	Then the great wonder of Winfried s life came to pass 
8113_301694_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Out of the stillness of the winter night a mighty rushing noise sounded overhead 
none	none	Was it the ancient gods on their white battle steeds with their black hounds of wrath and their arrows of lightning sweeping through the air to destroy their foes 
8113_301694_000026_000000	train-clean-360	A strong whirling wind passed over the tree tops 
8113_301694_000026_000001	train-clean-360	It gripped the oak by its branches and tore it from its roots 
none	none	Backward it fell like a ruined tower groaning and crashing as it split asunder in four great pieces 
8113_301694_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Winfried let his axe drop and bowed his head for a moment in the presence of almighty power 
8113_301694_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Then he turned to the people Here is the timber he cried already felled and split for your new building 
8113_301694_000028_000001	train-clean-360	On this spot shall rise a chapel to the true God and his servant saint Peter 
none	none	And here said he as his eyes fell on a young fir tree standing straight and green with its top pointing towards the stars amid the divided ruins of the fallen oak here is the living tree with no stain of blood upon it that shall be the sign of your new worship See how it points to the sky 
8113_301694_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Let us call it the tree of the Christ child 
8113_301694_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Take it up and carry it to the chieftain s hall 
8113_301694_000029_000004	train-clean-360	You shall go no more into the shadows of the forest to keep your feasts with secret rites of shame 
8113_301694_000029_000005	train-clean-360	You shall keep them at home with laughter and song and rites of love 
none	none	The thunder oak has fallen and I think the day is coming when there shall not be a home in all Germany where the children are not gathered around the green fir tree to rejoice in the birth night of Christ So they took the little fir from its place and carried it in joyous procession to the edge of the glade and laid it on the sledge 
8113_301694_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The horses tossed their heads and drew their load bravely as if the new burden had made it lighter 
none	none	When they came to the house of Gundhar he bade them throw open the doors of the hall and set the tree in the midst of it 
8113_301694_000031_000001	train-clean-360	They kindled lights among the branches until it seemed to be tangled full of fire flies 
none	none	The children encircled it wondering and the sweet odour of the balsam filled the house Then Winfried stood beside the chair of Gundhar on the dais at the end of the hall and told the story of Bethlehem of the babe in the manger of the shepherds on the hills of the host of angels and their midnight song 
8113_301694_000032_000001	train-clean-360	All the people listened charmed into stillness 
none	none	But the boy Bernhard on Irma s knee folded by her soft arm grew restless as the story lengthened and began to prattle softly at his mother s ear Mother whispered the child why did you cry out so loud when the priest was going to send me to Valhalla Oh hush my child answered the mother and pressed him closer to her side
8113_301694_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Mother whispered the boy again laying his finger on the stains upon her breast see your dress is red 
8113_301694_000035_000001	train-clean-360	What are these stains Did some one hurt you 
none	none	The mother closed his mouth with a kiss
8113_301694_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 Dear be still and listen 
8113_301694_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The boy obeyed 
8113_301694_000037_000001	train-clean-360	His eyes were heavy with sleep 
8113_301694_000037_000002	train-clean-360	But he heard the last words of Winfried as he spoke of the angelic messengers flying over the hills of Judea and singing as they flew 
none	none	The child wondered and dreamed and listened 
8113_301694_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Suddenly his face grew bright He put his lips close to Irma s cheek again 
8113_301694_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mother he whispered very low do not speak 
8113_301694_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Do you hear them 
8113_301694_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Those angels have come back again 
8113_301694_000038_000003	train-clean-360	They are singing now behind the tree 
8113_301694_000039_000000	train-clean-360	And some say that it was true but others say that it was only Gregor and his companions at the lower end of the hall chanting their Christmas hymn 
8113_301694_000040_000000	train-clean-360	All glory be to God on high And to the earth be peace Good will henceforth from heaven to men Begin and never cease
