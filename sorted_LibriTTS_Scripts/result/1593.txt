Kits And throws them in Catniption fits Illustration The Ibis The Ibiscus Illustration The Ibis The Ibiscus The sacred Ibis tells his beads And gravely from his prayer book reads The Ibis therfore we may say Is classified a bird of prey Ibiscus we have heard related The Crimson Eye is designated Their difference is plain indeed The flower is red the bird can read The Butter ball The Butter cup Illustration The Butter ball The Butter cup The little Butter cup can sing From morn till night like anything The quacking of the Butter ball Cannot be called a song at all We thus the flower may learn to know Its song is reproduced below Illustration The Bay The Jay Illustration The Bay The Jay The Blue Jay as we plainly see Resembles much the green Bay tree The difference between the two Is ob vi ous ly one of hue Though this is not the only way To tell the Blue Jay from the Bay The Pipe The Snipe Illustration The Pipe The Snipe Observe the common Indian Pipe Likewise the high bred English Snipe Who is distinguished as we see By his superior pedigree Illustration Two crosses botonny bend sinister Illustration Fess argent mantlets sable The Roc The Shamrock Illustration The Roc The Shamrock Observe how peacefully the Cows Among the little Shamrocks browse In contrast with their actions frantic When they perceive the Roc gigantic We need but watch thei r oc upation And seek no other explanation The Lark The Larkspur Illustration The Lark The Larkspur The Larkspur s likeness to the Lark Is surely worthy of remark Although to see it we require The aid of a small magnifier Which circumstance of course implies Their difference is one of size Puffin Nuffin Illustration Puffin Nuffin Upon this cake of ice is perched The paddle footed Puffin To find his double we have searched But have discovered Nuffin Author s Apology Not every one is always able To recognize a vegetable For some are guided by tradition While others use their intuition And even I make no pretense Of having more than common sense Indeed these strange homologies Are in most flornithologies And I have freely drawn upon The works of Gray and Audubon Avoiding though the frequent blunders Of those
