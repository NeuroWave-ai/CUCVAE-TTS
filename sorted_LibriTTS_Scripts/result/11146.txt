TRAGIC FATE BY ELIZA P DONNER HOUGHTON Illustration Eliza P Donner Houghton PREFACE Out of the sunshine and shadows of sixty eight years come these personal recollections of California of the period when American civilization first crossed its mountain heights and entered its overland gateways I seem to hear the tread of many feet the lowing of many herds and know they are the re echoing sounds of the sturdy pioneer home seekers Travel stained and weary yet triumphant and happy most of them reach their various destinations and their trying experiences and valorous deeds are quietly interwoven with the general history of the State Not so however the Donner Party of which my father was captain Like fated trains of other epochs whose privations sufferings and self sacrifices have added renown to colonization movements and served as danger signals to later wayfarers that party began its journey with song of hope and within the first milestone of the promised land ended it with a prayer for help Help for the helpless in the storms of the Sierra Nevada Mountains And I a child then scarcely four years of age was too young to do more than watch and suffer with other children the lesser privations of our snow beleaguered camp and with them survive because the fathers and mothers hungered in order that the children might live Scenes of loving care and tenderness were emblazoned on my mind Scenes of anguish pain and dire distress were branded on my brain during days weeks and months of famine famine which reduced the party from eighty one souls to forty five survivors before the heroic relief men from the settlements could accomplish their mission of humanity Who better than survivors knew the heart rending circumstances of life and death in those mountain camps Yet who can wonder that tenderest recollections and keenest heartaches silenced their quivering lips for many years and left opportunities for false and sensational details to be spread by morbid collectors of food for excitable brains and for prolific historians who too readily accepted exaggerated and unauthentic versions as true statements Who can wonder at my indignation and grief in little girlhood when I was told of acts of brutality inhumanity and cannibalism attributed to those starved parents who in life had shared their last morsels of food with helpless companions Who can wonder that I then resolved that When I grow to be a woman I shall tell the story of my party so clearly that no one can doubt its truth Who can doubt that my resolve has been ever kept fresh in mind by eager research for verification and by diligent communication with older survivors and rescuers sent to our relief who answered my many questions and cleared my obscure points And now when blessed with the sunshine of peace and happiness I am finishing my work of filial love and duty to my party and the State of my adoption who can wonder that I find on my chain of remembrance countless names marked forget me not Among the many to whom I became greatly indebted in my young womanhood for valuable data and gracious encouragement in my researches are General William Tecumseh Sherman General John A Sutter missus Ulysses S Grant missus Jessie Benton Fremont Honorable Allen Francis and C F McGlashan author of the History of the Donner Party My fondest affection must ever cling to the dear quaint old pioneer men and women whose hand clasps were warmth and cheer and whose givings were like milk and honey to my desolate childhood For each and all of them I have full measure of gratitude often pressed down and now overflowing to their sons and daughters for with keenest appreciation I learned that on June ten nineteen ten the order of Native Sons of the Golden West laid the corner stone of Donner Monument on the old emigrant trail near the beautiful lake which bears the party s name There the Native Sons of the Golden West aided by the Native Daughters of the Golden West propose to erect a memorial to all overland California pioneers In a letter to me from doctor C W Chapman chairman of that monument committee is the following forceful paragraph The Donner Party has been selected by us as the most typical and as the most varied and comprehensive in its experiences of all the trains that made these wonderful journeys of thousands of miles so unique in their daring so brave so worthy of the admiration of man ELIZA P DONNER HOUGHTON Los Angeles California September nineteen eleven CONTENTS CHAPTER I THE PACIFIC COAST IN eighteen forty five SPEECHES OF SENATOR

DONNER PARTY CHAPTER I THE PACIFIC COAST IN eighteen forty five SPEECHES OF SENATOR BENTON AND REPORT OF captain FREMONT MY FATHER AND HIS FAMILY INTEREST AWAKENED IN THE NEW TERRITORY FORMATION OF THE FIRST EMIGRANT PARTY FROM ILLINOIS TO CALIFORNIA PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY THE START ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF CIVILIZATION Prior to the year eighteen forty five that great domain lying west of the Rocky Mountains and extending to the Pacific Ocean was practically unknown About that time however the spirit of inquiry was awakening The powerful voice of Senator Thomas H Benton was heard both in public address and in the halls of Congress calling attention to Oregon and California Captain John C Fremont s famous topographical report and maps had been accepted by Congress and ten thousand copies ordered to be printed and distributed to the people throughout the United States The commercial world was not slow to appreciate the value of those distant and hitherto unfrequented harbors Tales of the equable climate and the marvellous fertility of the soil spread rapidly and it followed that before the close of eighteen forty five pioneers on the western frontier of our ever expanding republic were preparing to open a wagon route to the Pacific coast After careful investigation and consideration my father George Donner and his elder brother Jacob decided to join the westward migration selecting California as their destination My mother was in accord with my father s wishes and helped him to carry out his plan At this time he was sixty two years of age large fine looking and in perfect health He was of German parentage born of Revolutionary stock just after the close of the war The spirit of adventure with which he was strongly imbued had led him in his youth from North Carolina his native State to the land of Daniel Boone thence to Indiana to Illinois to Texas and ultimately back to Illinois while still in manhood s prime By reason of his geniality and integrity he was widely known as Uncle George in Sangamon County Illinois where he had broken the virgin soil two and a half miles from Springfield when that place was a small village There he built a home acquired wealth and took an active part in the development of the country round about Twice had he been married and twice bereft by death when he met my mother Tamsen Eustis Dozier then a widow whom he married May twenty four eighteen thirty nine She was a native of Newburyport Massachusetts She was cultured and had been a successful teacher and writer Their home became the local literary centre after she was installed as its mistress My father had two sons and eight daughters when she became his wife but their immediate family circle consisted only of his aged parents and Elitha and Leanna young daughters of his second marriage until July eight eighteen forty when blue eyed Frances Eustis was born to them On the fourth of December eighteen forty one brown eyed Georgia Ann was added to the number and on the eighth of March eighteen forty three I came into this world I grew to be a healthy self reliant child a staff to my sister Georgia who on account of a painful accident and long illness during her first year did not learn to walk steadily until after I was strong enough to help her to rise and lead her to a sand pile near the orchard where we played away the bright days of two uneventful years With the approaching Winter of eighteen forty five popular interest in the great territory to the west of us spread to our community Maps and reports were eagerly studied The few old letters which had been received from traders and trappers along the Pacific coast were brought forth for general perusal The course of the reading society which met weekly at our home was changed in order that my mother might read to those assembled the publications which had kindled in my father and uncle the desire to migrate to the land so alluringly described Prominent among these works were Travels Among the Rocky Mountains Through Oregon and California by Lansford W Hastings and also the Topographical Report with Maps Attached by Captain Fremont which has been already mentioned The Springfield Journal published by mister Allen Francis appeared with glowing editorials strongly advocating emigration to the Pacific coast and its columns contained notices of companies forming in Southern and Southwestern States each striving to be ready to join the Great Overland Caravan scheduled to leave Independence Missouri for Oregon early in May eighteen forty six mister James F Reed a well known resident of Springfield was among those who urged the formation of a company to go directly from Sangamon County to California Intense interest was manifested and had it not been for the widespread financial depression of that year a large number would have gone from that vicinity The great cost of equipment however kept back many who desired to make the long journey As it was James F Reed his wife and four children and missus Keyes the mother of missus Reed Jacob Donner his wife and seven children and George Donner his wife and five children also their teamsters and camp assistants thirty two persons all told constituted the first emigrant party from Illinois to California The plan was to join the Oregon caravan at Independence Missouri continue with it to Fort Hall and thence follow Fremont s route to the Bay of San Francisco The preparations made for the journey by my parents were practical Strong commodious emigrant wagons were constructed especially for the purpose The oxen to draw them were hardy well trained and rapid walkers Three extra yoke were provided for emergencies Cows were selected to furnish milk on the way A few young beef cattle five saddle horses and a good watch dog completed the list of live stock After carefully calculating the requisite amount of provisions father stored in his wagons a quantity that was deemed more than sufficient to last until we should reach California Seed and implements for use on the prospective farms in the new country also constituted an important part of our outfit Nor was that all There were bolts of cheap cotton prints red and yellow flannels bright bordered handkerchiefs glass beads necklaces chains brass finger rings earrings pocket looking glasses and divers other knickknacks dear to the hearts of aborigines These were intended for distribution as peace offerings among the Indians Lastly there were rich stores of laces muslins silks satins velvets and like cherished fabrics destined to be used in exchange for Mexican land grants in that far land to which we were bound My mother was energetic in all these preparations but her special province was to make and otherwise get in readiness a bountiful supply of clothing She also superintended the purchase of materials for women s handiwork apparatus for preserving botanical specimens water colors and oil paints books and school supplies these latter being selected for use in the young ladies seminary which she hoped to establish in California A liberal sum of money for meeting incidental expenses and replenishing supplies on the journey if need be was stored in the compartments of two wide buckskin girdles to be worn in concealment about the person An additional sum of ten thousand dollars cash was stitched between the folds of a quilt for safe transportation This was a large amount for those days and few knew that my parents were carrying it with them I gained my information concerning it in later years from mister Francis to whom they showed it To each of his grown children my father deeded a fair share of his landed estate reserving one hundred and ten acres near the homestead for us five younger children who in course of time might choose to return to our native State As time went on our preparations were frequently interrupted by social obligations farewell visits dinners and other merrymakings with friends and kindred far and near Thursday April fifteen eighteen forty six was the day fixed for our departure and the members of our household were at work before the rosy dawn We children were dressed early in our new linsey travelling suits and as the final packing progressed we often peeped out of the window at the three big white covered wagons that stood in our yard In the first were stored the merchandise and articles not to be handled until they should reach their destination in the second provisions clothing camp tools and other necessaries of camp life The third was our family home on wheels with feed boxes attached to the back of the wagon bed for Fanny and Margaret the favorite saddle horses which were to be kept ever close at hand for emergencies Early in the day the first two wagons started each drawn by three yoke of powerful oxen whose great moist eyes looked as though they too had parting tears to shed The loose cattle quickly followed but it was well on toward noon before the family wagon was ready Then came a pause fraught with anguish to the dear ones gathered about the homestead to say farewell Each tried to be courageous but not one was so brave as father when he bade good bye to his friends to his children and to his children s children I sat beside my mother with my hand clasped in hers as we slowly moved away from that quaint old house on its grassy knoll from the orchard the corn land and the meadow as we passed through the last pair of bars her clasp tightened and I glancing up saw tears in her eyes and sorrow in her face I was grieved at her pain and in sympathy nestled closer to her side and sat so quiet that I soon fell asleep When I awoke the sun still shone but we had encamped for the night on the ground where the State House of Illinois now stands mister Reed and family and my uncle Jacob and family with their travelling equipments and cattle were already settled there Under father s direction our own encampment was soon accomplished By nightfall the duties of the day were ended and the members of our party gathered around one fire to spend a social hour Presently the clatter of galloping horses was heard and shortly thereafter eight horsemen alighted and with merry greetings joined our circle They were part of the reading society and had come to hold its last reunion beside our first camp fire mister Francis was among them and took an inventory of the company s outfit for the benefit of the readers of The Springfield Journal They piled more wood on the blazing fire making it a beacon light to those who were watching from afar they sang songs told tales and for the time being drove homesickness from our hearts Then they rode away in the moonlight and our past was a sweet memory our future a beautiful dream William Donner my half brother came to camp early next morning to help us to get the cattle started and to accompany us as far as the outskirts of civilization We reached Independence Missouri on the eleventh of May with our wagons and cattle in prime condition and our people in the best of spirits Our party encamped near that bustling frontier town and were soon a part of the busy crowds making ready for the great prairie on the morrow Teams thronged the highways troops of men women and children hurried nervously about seeking information and replenishing supplies Jobbers on the street were crying their wares anxious to sell anything or everything required from a shoestring to a complete outfit for a four months journey across the plains Beads of sweat clung to the merchants faces as they rushed to and fro filling orders Brawny blacksmiths with breasts bared and sleeves rolled high hammered and twisted red hot metal into the divers forms necessary to repair yokes and wagons Good fellowship prevailed as strangers met each anxious to learn something of those who might by chance become his neighbors in line Among the pleasant acquaintances made that day was mister J Q Thornton a young attorney from Quincy Illinois who with his invalid wife was emigrating to Oregon He informed us that himself and wife and ex Governor Boggs and family of Missouri were hourly expecting Alphonso Boone grandson of Daniel Boone and that as soon as Boone and his family should arrive from Kentucky they would all hasten on to join Colonel Russell s California company which was already on the way but had promised to await them somewhere on the Kansas River It was then believed that at least seven thousand emigrant wagons would go West through Independence that season Obviously the journey should be made while pasturage and water continued plentiful along the route Our little party at once determined to overtake Colonel Russell and apply for admission to his train and for that purpose we resumed travel early on the morning of May twelfth As we drove up Main Street delayed emigrants waved us a light hearted good bye and as we approached the building of the American Tract Society its agent came to our wagons and put into the hand of each child a New Testament and gave to each adult a Bible and also tracts to distribute among the heathen in the benighted land to which we were going Near the outskirts of town we parted from William Donner took a last look at Independence turned our backs to the morning sun and became pioneers indeed to the Far West Illustration THE CAMP ATTACKED BY INDIANS Illustration OUR STEALTHY FOES CHAPTER II IN THE TERRITORY OF KANSAS PRAIRIE SCHOONERS FROM SANTA FE TO INDEPENDENCE MO LIFE en route THE BIG BLUE CAMP GOVERNMENT THE Blue Rover During our first few days in the Territory of Kansas we passed over good roads and through fields of May blossoms musical with the hum of bees and the songs of birds Some of the party rode horseback others walked in advance of the train but each father drove his own family team We little folk sat in the wagons with our dolls watching the huge white covered prairie schooners coming from Santa Fe to Independence for merchandise We could hear them from afar for the great wagons were drawn by four or five span of travel worn horses or mules and above the hames of each poor beast was an arch hung with from three to five clear toned bells that jingled merrily as their carriers moved along guided by a happy go lucky driver usually singing or whistling a gleeful tune Both man and beast looked longingly toward the town which promised companionship and revelry to the one and rest and fodder to the other We overtook similar wagons heavily laden with goods bound for Santa Fe Most of the drivers were shrewd all of them civil They were of various nationalities some comfortably clad others in tatters and a few in picturesque threadbare costumes of Spanish finery Those hardy wayfarers gave us much valuable information regarding the route before us and the Indian tribes we should encounter We were now averaging a distance of about two and a half miles an hour and encamping nights where fuel and water could be obtained Early on the nineteenth of May we reached Colonel Russel s camp on Soldiers Creek a tributary of the Kansas River The following account of the meeting held by the company after our arrival is from the journal of mister Edwin Bryant author of What I Saw in California May nineteen eighteen forty six A new census of our party was taken this morning and it was found to consist of ninety eight fighting men fifty women forty six wagons and three hundred fifty cattle Two divisions were made for convenience in travelling We were joined to day by nine wagons from Illinois belonging to mister Reed and Messrs Donner highly respectable and intelligent gentlemen with interesting families They were received into the company by a unanimous vote Our cattle were allowed to rest that day and while the men were hunting and fishing the women spread the family washings on the boughs and bushes of that well wooded stream We children who had been confined to the wagon so many hours each day stretched our limbs and scampered off on Mayday frolics We waded the creek made mud pies and gathered posies in the narrow glades between the cottonwood beech and alder trees Colonel Russell was courteous to all visited the new members and secured their cheerful indorsement of his carefully prepared plan of travel He was at the head of a representative body of pioneers including lawyers journalists teachers students farmers and day laborers also a minister of the gospel a carriage maker a cabinet maker a stonemason a jeweller a blacksmith and women versed in all branches of woman s work The government of these emigrant trains was essentially democratic and characteristically American A captain was chosen and all plans of action and rules and regulations were proposed at a general assembly and accepted or rejected by majority vote Consequently Colonel Russell s function was to preside over meetings lead the train locate camping ground select crossings over fordable streams and direct the construction of rafts and other expedients for transportation over deep waters A trumpet call aroused the camp at dawn the following morning by seven o clock breakfast had been cooked and served and the company was in marching order The weather was fine and we followed the trail of the Kansas Indians toward the Big Blue At nooning our teams stood in line on the road chewing the cud and taking their breathing spell while families lunched on the grass in restful picnic style Suddenly a gust of wind swept by the sky turned a greenish gray black clouds drifted over the face of the sun ominous sounds came rumbling from distant hills and before our effects could be collected and returned to cover a terrific thunderstorm was upon us We were three hours distance from our evening camp ground and our drivers had to walk and face that buffeting storm in order to keep control of the nervous cattle It was still raining when we reached the knoll where we could spend the night Our men were tired and drenched some of them cross fires were out of the question until fuel could be cut and brought from the edge of a swamp a mile from camp When brought the green wood smoked so badly that suppers were late and rather cheerless still there was spirit enough left in those stalwart hearts to start some mirth provoking ditty or indulge in good natured raillery over the joys and comforts of pioneering Indians had followed our train all day and as we had been warned against leaving temptation within reach the cattle were corralled early and their guards doubled Happily the night passed without alarm or losses The following day we were joined by ex Governor Boggs and companions and lost mister Jordan and friends of Jackson Missouri who drew their thirteen wagons out of line saying that their force was strong enough to travel alone and that Captain Russell s company had become too large for rapid or convenient handling We covered fourteen miles that day over a beautiful rolling prairie dotted with Indian lodges Frequently their owners walked or rode beside our wagons asking for presents missus Kehi go wa chuck ee was made happy by the gift of a dozen strings of glass beads and the chief also kindly accepted a few trinkets and a contribution of tobacco and provisions after which he made the company understand that for a consideration payable in cotton prints tobacco salt pork and flour he himself and his trusted braves would become escort to the train in order to protect its cattle from harm and its wagons from the pilfering hands of his tribesmen His offer was accepted with the condition that he should not receive any of the promised goods until the last wagon was safe beyond his territory This bargain was faithfully kept and when we parted from the Indians they proceeded to immediate and hilarious enjoyment of the unwonted luxuries thus earned We were now in line with spring storms which made us victims of frequent downpours and cyclonic winds The roads were heavy and the banks of streams so steep that often the wagons had to be lowered by aid of rope and chain Fortunately our people were able to take these trying situations philosophically and were ever ready to enjoy the novelties of intervening hours of calm and sunshine The staid and elderly matrons spent most of their time in their wagons knitting or patching designs for quilts The younger ones and the girls passed theirs in the saddle They would scatter in groups over the plains to investigate distant objects then race back and with song and banter join husband and brother driving the loose cattle in the rear The wild free spirit of the plain often prompted them to invite us little ones to seats behind them and away we would canter with the breeze playing through our hair and giving a ruddy glow to our cheeks mister Edwin Bryant mister and missus Thornton and my mother were enthusiastic searchers for botanical and geological specimens They delved into the ground turning over stones and scraping out the crevices and zealously penetrated the woods to gather mosses roots and flowering plants Of the rare floral specimens and perishable tints my mother made pencil and water color studies having in view the book she was preparing for publication On ascending the bluff overlooking the Big Blue early on the afternoon of the twenty sixth of May we found the river booming and the water still rising Driftwood and good sized logs were floating by on a current so strong that all hope of fording it vanished even before its depth was measured We encamped on the slope of the prairie near a timber of cottonwood oak beech and sycamore trees where a clear brook rushed over its stony bed to join the Big Blue Captain Russell with my father and other sub leaders examined the river banks for marks of a ford By sunset the river had risen twenty inches and the water at the ford was two hundred yards in width A general meeting was called to discuss the situation Many insisted that the company being comfortably settled should wait until the waters receded but the majority agreeing with the Captain voted to construct a raft suitable to carry everything except the live stock which could be forced to swim The assembly was also called upon to settle a difference between two members of our Oregon contingent friendly intervention having induced the disputants to suspend hostilities until their rights should be thus determined The assembly however instead of passing upon the matter appointed a committee to devise a way out of the difficulty J Q Thornton s work Oregon and California has this reference to that committee whose work was significant as developed by later events Ex Governor Boggs mister James F Reed mister George Donner and others myself included convened in a tent according to appointment of a general assembly of the emigrants with the design of preparing a system of laws for the purpose of preserving order et cetera We proposed a few laws without however believing that they would possess much authority Provision was made for the appointment of a court of arbitrators to hear and decide disputes and to try offenders against the peace and good order of the company The fiercest thunderstorm that we had yet experienced raged throughout that night and had we not been protected by the bluff on one side and the timber on the other our tents would have been carried away by the gale The Big Blue had become so turbulent that work on the prospective craft was postponed and our people proceeded to make the most of the unexpected holiday Messrs Grayson and Branham found a bee tree and brought several buckets of delicious honey into camp mister Bryant gathered a quantity of wild peas and distributed them among the friends who had spices to turn them into sweet pickles The evening was devoted to friendly intercourse and the camp was merry with song and melodies dear to loved ones around the old hearthstones Meanwhile Captain Russell had drawn a plan of the craft that should be built and had marked the cottonwood trees on the river bank half a mile above camp that would furnish the necessary materials Bright and early the following morning volunteer boat builders went to work with a will and by the close of day had felled two trees about three and a half feet in diameter had hollowed out the trunks and made of them a pair of canoes twenty five feet in length In addition to this they had also prepared timbers for the frames to hold them parallel and insure the wagon wheels a steady place while being ferried across the river The workers were well satisfied with their accomplishment There was however sorrow instead of rejoicing in camp for missus Reed s aged mother who had been failing for some days died that night At two o clock the next afternoon she was buried at the foot of a monarch oak in a neat cottonwood coffin made by men of the party and her grave was marked by a headstone Illustration GOVERNOR L W BOGGS Illustration CORRAL SUCH AS WAS FORMED BY EACH SECTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF ITS CATTLE The craft being finished on the morning of the thirtieth of May was christened Blue Rover and launched amid cheers of the company Though not a thing of beauty she was destined to fulfil the expectations of our worthy Captain One set of guide ropes held her in place at the point of embarkation while swimmers on horseback carried another set of ropes across the river and quickly made them fast Only one wagon at a time could cross and great difficulty was experienced in getting the vehicles on and off the boat Those working near the bank stood in water up to their arm pits and frequently were in grave peril By the time the ninth wagon was safely landed darkness fell The only unforeseen delay that had occurred was occasioned by an awkward slip of the third wagon while being landed The Blue Rover groaned under the shock leaned to one side and swamped one of the canoes However the damage was slight and easily repaired The next day was Sunday but the work had to go on and the reverend mister Cornwall was as ready for it as the rest of the toilers Much anxiety was experienced when the cattle were forced into the water and they had a desperate struggle in crossing the current but they finally reached the opposite bank without accident Each family embarked in its own wagon and the last was ferried over in the rain at nine o clock that night The ropes were then detached from the Blue Rover and she drifted away in the darkness Captain Russell had despatched matters vigorously and tactfully and when the labors of that day were completed still had a word of cheer for the shivering hungry travellers whom he led into camp one mile west of the memorable Big Blue Despite stiff joints and severe colds all were anxious to resume travel at the usual hour next day June the first CHAPTER III IN THE HAUNTS OF THE PAWNEES LETTERS OF missus GEORGE DONNER HALT AT FORT BERNARD SIOUX INDIANS AT FORT LARAMIE We were now near the haunts of the Pawnee Indians reported to be vicious savages and daring thieves Before us also stretched the summer range of the antelope deer elk and buffalo The effort to keep out of the way of the Pawnees and the desire to catch sight of the big game urged us on at a good rate of speed but not fast enough to keep our belligerents on good behavior Before night they had not only renewed their former troubles but come to blows and insulted our Captain who had tried to separate them How the company was relieved of them is thus told in mister Bryant s Journal June two eighteen forty six the two individuals at variance about their oxen and wagon were emigrants to Oregon and some eighteen or twenty wagons now travelling with us were bound to the same place It was proposed in order to relieve ourselves from consequences of dispute in which we had no interest that all Oregon emigrants should in respectful manner and friendly spirit be requested to separate themselves from the California and start on in advance of us The proposition was unanimously carried and the spirit in which it was made prevented any bad feeling which otherwise might have resulted from it The Oregon emigrants immediately drew their wagons from the corrals and proceeded on their way The Oregon company was never so far in advance that we could not hear from it and on various occasions some of its members sent to us for medicines and other necessaries Our fear of the Pawnees diminished as we proceeded and met in their haunts only friendly Indians returning from the hunt with ponies heavily laden with packs of jerked meats and dried buffalo tongues At least one brave in each party could make himself understood by word or sign Many could pronounce the one word hogmeat and would show what they had to exchange for the coveted luxury Others also begged for tobac and sugar and generally got a little A surprising number of trappers and traders returning to the United States with their stocks of peltry camped near us from time to time They were glad to exchange information and kept us posted in regard to the condition of the migrants and the number of wagons on the road in advance These rough looking fellows courteously offered to carry the company s mail to the nearest post office mister Bryant and my mother availed themselves of the kindness and sent letters to the respective journals of which they were correspondents Another means of keeping in touch with travelling parties in advance was the accounts that were frequently found written on the bleaching skulls of animals or on trunks of trees from which the bark had been stripped or yet again on pieces of paper stuck in the clefts of sticks driven into the ground close to the trail Thus each company left greetings and words of cheer to those who were following Lost cattle were also advertised by that means and many strays or convalescents were found and driven forward to their owners Early June afforded rarest sport to lovers of the chase and our company was kept bountifully supplied with choicest cuts of antelope deer and elk meat also juicy buffalo steak By the middle of the month however our surroundings were less favorable We entered a region of oppressive heat Clouds of dust enveloped the train Wood became scarce and water had to be stored in casks and carried between supply points We passed many dead oxen also a number of poor cripples that had been abandoned by their unfeeling owners Our people heeding these warnings gave our cattle extra care and lost but few Through the kindness of the honorable Allen Francis U S Consul at Victoria British Columbia for a long term of years and in his earlier career editor of The Springfield Journal I have in my possession two letters written by my mother for this paper They give a glimpse of the party en route The interval of time which elapsed between the date of writing and that of publication indicates how much faster our trapper letter carriers must have travelled on horseback than we had by ox train The following was published on the twenty third of July NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH PLATTE June sixteen eighteen forty six MY OLD FRIEND We are now on the Platte two hundred miles from Fort Laramie Our journey so far has been pleasant the roads have been good and food plentiful The water for part of the way has been indifferent but at no time have our cattle suffered for it Wood is now very scarce but buffalo chips are excellent they kindle quickly and retain heat surprisingly We had this morning buffalo steaks broiled upon them that had the same flavor they would have had upon hickory coals We feel no fear of Indians our cattle graze quietly around our encampment unmolested Two or three men will go hunting twenty miles from camp and last night two of our men lay out in the wilderness rather than ride their horses after a hard chase Indeed if I do not experience something far worse than I have yet done I shall say the trouble is all in getting started Our wagons have not needed much repair and I can not yet tell in what respects they could be improved Certain it is they can not be too strong Our preparations for the journey might have been in some respects bettered Bread has been the principal article of food in our camp We laid in one hundred fifty pounds of flour and seventy five pounds of meat for each individual and I fear bread will be scarce Meat is abundant Rice and beans are good articles on the road cornmeal too is acceptable Linsey dresses are the most suitable for children Indeed if I had one it would be acceptable There is so cool a breeze at all times on the plains that the sun does not feel so hot as one would suppose We are now four hundred and fifty miles from Independence Our route at first was rough and through a timbered country which appeared to be fertile After striking the prairie we found a first rate road and the only difficulty we have had has been in crossing the creeks In that however there has been no danger I never could have believed we could have travelled so far with so little difficulty The prairie between the Blue and the Platte rivers is beautiful beyond description Never have I seen so varied a country so suitable for cultivation Everything was new and pleasing the Indians frequently come to see us and the chiefs of a tribe breakfasted at our tent this morning All are so friendly that I can not help feeling sympathy and friendship for them But on one sheet what can I say Since we have been on the Platte we have had the river on one side and the ever varying mounds on the other and have travelled through the bottom lands from one to two miles wide with little or no timber The soil is sandy and last year on account of the dry season the emigrants found grass here scarce Our cattle are in good order and when proper care has been taken none have been lost Our milch cows have been of great service indeed They have been of more advantage than our meat We have plenty of butter and milk We are commanded by Captain Russell an amiable man George Donner is himself yet He crows in the morning and shouts out Chain up boys chain up with as much authority as though he was something in particular John Denton is still with us We find him useful in the camp Hiram Miller and Noah James are in good health and doing well We have of the best people in our company and some too that are not so good Buffaloes show themselves frequently We have found the wild tulip the primrose the lupine the eardrop the larkspur and creeping hollyhock and a beautiful flower resembling the blossom of the beech tree but in bunches as large as a small sugar loaf and of every variety of shade to red and green I botanize and read some but cook heaps more There are four hundred and twenty wagons as far as we have heard on the road between here and Oregon and California Give our love to all inquiring friends God bless them Yours truly missus GEORGE DONNER The following extract is part of a letter which appeared in The Springfield Journal of July thirty eighteen forty six one SOUTH FORK OF THE NEBRASKA TEN MILES FROM THE CROSSING Tuesday June sixteen eighteen forty six DEAR FRIEND To day at nooning there passed going to the States seven men from Oregon who went out last year One of them was well acquainted with Messrs Ide and Cadden Keyes the latter of whom he says went to California They met the advance Oregon caravan about one hundred fifty miles west of Fort Laramie and counted in all for Oregon and California excepting ours four hundred seventy eight wagons There are in our company over forty wagons making five hundred eighteen in all and there are said to be yet twenty behind To morrow we cross the river and by reckoning will be over two hundred miles from Fort Laramie where we intend to stop and repair our wagon wheels They are nearly all loose and I am afraid we will have to stop sooner if there can be found wood suitable to heat the tires There is no wood here and our women and children are out now gathering buffalo chips to burn in order to do the cooking These chips burn well missus GEORGE DONNER On the eighteenth of June Captain Russell who had been stricken with bilious fever resigned his office of leader My father and other subordinate officers also resigned their positions The assembly tendered the retiring officials a vote of thanks for faithful service and by common consent ex Governor Boggs moved at the head of the train and gave it his name Illustration FORT LARAMIE AS IT APPEARED WHEN VISITED BY THE DONNER PARTY Illustration CHIMNEY ROCK We had expected to push on to Fort Laramie without stopping elsewhere but when we reached Fort Bernard a small fur trading post ten miles east of Fort Laramie we learned that the Sioux Indians were gathering on Laramie Plain preparing for war with the Crows and their allies the Snakes also that the emigrants already encamped there found pasturage very short Consequently our train halted at this more advantageous point where our cattle could be sent in charge of herders to browse along the Platte River and where the necessary materials could be obtained to repair the great damage which had been done to our wagon wheels by the intense heat of the preceding weeks Meanwhile Messrs Russell and Bryant with six young bachelor friends found an opportunity to finish their journey with pack animals They exchanged with traders from New Mexico their wagons and teams for the requisite number of saddle horses mules pack saddles and other equipment which would enable them to reach California a month earlier than by wagon route Both parties broke camp at the same hour on the last day of June they taking the bridle trail to the right and we turning to the left across the ridge to Fort Laramie Not an emigrant tent was to be seen as we approached the fort but bands of horses were grazing on the plain and Indians smeared with war paint and armed with hunting knives tomahawks bows and arrows were moving about excitedly They did not appear to notice us as we drove to the entrance of the strongly fortified walls surrounding the buildings of the American Fur Company yet by the time we were ready to depart large crowds were standing close to our wagons to receive the presents which our people had to distribute among them Many of the squaws and papooses were gorgeous in white doe skin suits gaudily trimmed with beads and bows of bright ribbons They formed a striking contrast to us travel stained wayfarers in linsey dresses and sun bonnets Most of the white men connected with the fort had taken Indian wives and many little children played around their doors mister Bourdeau the general manager at the fort explained to us that the emigrants who had remained there up to the previous Saturday were on that day advised by several of the Sioux chiefs for whom he acted as spokesman to resume their journey before the coming Tuesday and to unite in strong companies because their people were in large force in the hills preparing to go out on the war path in the country through which the travellers had yet to pass that they were not pleased with the whites that many of their warriors were cross and sulky in anticipation of the work before them and that any white persons found outside the fort upon their arrival might be subject to robbery and other bad treatment This advice of the chiefs had awakened such fear in the travellers that every camp fire was deserted before sunrise the ensuing morning We in turn were filled with apprehension and immediately hurried onward in the ruts made by the fleeing wagons of the previous day Before we got out of the country of the Sioux we were overtaken by about three hundred mounted warriors They came in stately procession two abreast rode on in advance of our train halted and opened ranks and as our wagons passed between their lines the warriors took from between their teeth green twigs and tossed them toward us in pledge of friendship then turned and as quietly and solemnly as they had come to us rode toward the hills A great sigh of relief expressed the company s satisfaction at being again alone still no one could feel sure that we should escape a night attack Our trail led up into the hills and we travelled late into the night and were again on the way by morning starlight We heard wolf yelps and owl hoots in the distance but were not approached by prowlers of any kind Footnote one When mister Francis was appointed U S Consul by President Lincoln he stored his flies of The Springfield Illinois Journal and upon his return from Victoria B C found the files almost destroyed by attic rodents and my mother s earlier contributions in verse and prose as well as her letters while en route to California were practically illegible CHAPTER IV FOURTH OF JULY IN AN EMIGRANT PARTY OPEN LETTER OF LANSFORD HASTINGS GEORGE DONNER ELECTED CAPTAIN OF PARTY BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA ENTERING THE GREAT DESERT INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF FOOD VOLUNTEERS COMMISSIONED BY MY FATHER TO HASTEN TO SUTTER S FORT FOR RELIEF On the second of July we met mister Bryant returning to prevail on some man of our company to take the place of mister Kendall of the bridle party who had heard such evil reports of California from returning trappers that his courage had failed and he had deserted his companions and joined the Oregon company Hiram Miller who had driven one of my father s wagons from Springfield took advantage of this opportunity for a faster method of travel and left with mister Bryant The following evening we encamped near the re enforced bridle party and on the morning of the Fourth Messrs Russell and Bryant came over to help us to celebrate our national holiday A salute was fired at sunrise and later a platform of boxes was arranged in a grove close by and by half past nine o clock every one in camp was in holiday attire and ready to join the procession which marched around the camp and to the adjacent grove There patriotic songs were sung the Declaration of Independence was read and Colonel Russell delivered an address After enjoying a feast prepared by the women of the company and drinking to the health and happiness of friends and kindred in reverent silence with faces toward the east our guests bade us a final good bye and godspeed We had on many occasions entertained eastward bound rovers whose varied experiences on the Pacific coast made them interesting talkers Those who favored California extolled its excellence and had scant praise for Oregon Those who loved Oregon described its marvellous advantages over California and urged home seekers to select it as the wiser choice consequently as we neared the parting of the ways some of our people were in perplexity which to choose On the nineteenth of July we reached the Little Sandy River and there found four distinct companies encamped in neighborly groups among them our friends the Thorntons and reverend mister Cornwall Most of them were listed for Oregon and were resting their cattle preparatory to entering upon the long dry drive of forty miles known as Greenwood s Cut off There my father and others deliberated over a new route to California They were led to do so by An Open Letter which had been delivered to our company on the seventeenth by special messenger on horseback The letter was written by Lansford W Hastings author of Travel Among the Rocky Mountains Through Oregon and California It was dated and addressed At the Headwaters of the Sweetwater To all California Emigrants now on the Road and intimated that on account of war between Mexico and the United States the Government of California would probably oppose the entrance of American emigrants to its territory and urged those on the way to California to concentrate their numbers and strength and to take the new and better route which he had explored from Fort Bridger by way of the south end of Salt Lake It emphasized the statement that this new route was nearly two hundred miles shorter than the old one by way of Fort Hall and the headwaters of Ogden s River and that he himself would remain at Fort Bridger to give further information and to conduct the emigrants through to the settlement The proposition seemed so feasible that after cool deliberation and discussion a party was formed to take the new route My father was elected captain of this company and from that time on it was known as the Donner Party It included our original Sangamon County folks except missus Keyes and Hiram Miller and the following additional members Patrick Breen wife and seven children Lewis Keseberg wife and two children missus Lavina Murphy a widow and five children William Eddy wife and two children William Pike wife and two children William Foster wife and child William McCutchen wife and child mister Wolfinger and wife Patrick Dolan Charles Stanton Samuel Shoemaker Hardcoop Spitzer Joseph Rhinehart James Smith Walter Herron and Luke Halloran While we were preparing to break camp the last named had begged my father for a place in our wagon He was a stranger to our family afflicted with consumption too ill to make the journey on horseback and the family with whom he had travelled thus far could no longer accommodate him His forlorn condition appealed to my parents and they granted his request All the companies broke camp and left the Little Sandy on the twentieth of July The Oregon division with a section for California took the right hand trail for Fort Hall and the Donner Party the left hand trail to Fort Bridger After parting from us mister Thornton made the following note in his journal July twenty eighteen forty six The Californians were much elated and in fine spirits with the prospect of better and nearer road to the country of their destination missus George Donner however was an exception She was gloomy sad and dispirited in view of the fact that her husband and others could think of leaving the old road and confide in the statement of a man of whom they knew nothing but was probably some selfish adventurer Five days later the Donner Party reached Fort Bridger and were informed by Hastings s agent that he had gone forward as pilot to a large emigrant train but had left instructions that all later arrivals should follow his trail Further that they would find an abundant supply of wood water and pasturage along the whole line of road except one dry drive of thirty miles or forty at most that they would have no difficult canons to pass and that the road was generally smooth level and hard At Fort Bridger my father took as driver for one of his wagons John Baptiste Trubode a sturdy young mountaineer the offspring of a French father a trapper and a Mexican mother John claimed to have a knowledge of the languages and customs of various Indian tribes through whose country we should have to pass and urged that this knowledge might prove helpful to the company The trail from the fort was all that could be desired and on the third of August we reached the crossing of Webber River where it breaks through the mountains into the canon There we found a letter from Hastings stuck in the cleft of a projecting stick near the roadside It advised all parties to encamp and await his return for the purpose of showing them a better way than through the canon of Webber River stating that he had found the road over which he was then piloting a train very bad and feared other parties might not be able to get their wagons through the canon leading to the valley of the Great Salt Lake Illustration JOHN BAPTISTE TRUBODE Illustration FRANCES DONNER missus WM R WILDER Illustration GEORGIA ANN DONNER missus W A BABCOCK He referred however to another route which he declared to be much better as it avoided the canon altogether To prevent unnecessary delays Messrs Reed Pike and Stanton volunteered to ride over the new route and if advisable bring Hastings back to conduct us to the open valley After eight days mister Reed returned alone and reported that he and his companions overtook Hastings with his train near the south end of Salt Lake that Hastings refused to leave his train but was finally induced to go with them to the summit of a ridge of the Wahsatch Mountains and from there point out as best he could the directions to be followed While exploring on the way back mister Reed had become separated from Messrs Pike and Stanton and now feared they might be lost He himself had located landmarks and blazed trees and felt confident that by making occasional short clearings we could get our wagons over the new route as outlined by Hastings Searchers were sent ahead to look up the missing men and we immediately broke camp and resumed travel The following evening we were stopped by a thicket of quaking ash through which it required a full day s hard work to open a passageway Thence our course lay through a wilderness of rugged peaks and rock bound canons until a heavily obstructed gulch confronted us Believing that it would lead out to the Utah River Valley our men again took their tools and became roadmakers They had toiled six days when W F Graves wife and eight children J Fosdick wife and child and John Snyder with their teams and cattle overtook and joined our train With the assistance of these three fresh men the road eight miles in length was completed two days later It carried us out into a pretty mountain dell not the opening we had expected Fortunately we here met the searchers returning with Messrs Pike and Stanton The latter informed us that we must turn back over our newly made road and cross a farther range of peaks in order to strike the outlet to the valley Sudden fear of being lost in the trackless mountains almost precipitated a panic and it was with difficulty that my father and other cool headed persons kept excited families from scattering rashly into greater dangers We retraced our way and after five days of alternate travelling and road making ascended a mountain so steep that six and eight yoke of oxen were required to draw each vehicle up the grade and most careful handling of the teams was necessary to keep the wagons from toppling over as the straining cattle zigzaged to the summit Fortunately the slope on the opposite side was gradual and the last wagon descended to camp before darkness obscured the way The following morning we crossed the river which flows from Utah Lake to Great Salt Lake and found the trail of the Hastings party We had been thirty days in reaching that point which we had hoped to make in ten or twelve The tedious delays and high altitude wrought distressing changes in mister Halloran s condition and my father and mother watched over him with increasing solicitude But despite my mother s unwearying ministrations death came on the fourth of September Suitable timber for a coffin could not be obtained so his body was wrapped in sheets and carefully enclosed in a buffalo robe then reverently laid to rest in a grave on the shore of Great Salt Lake near that of a stranger who had been buried by the Hastings party a few weeks earlier mister Halloran had appreciated the tender care bestowed upon him by my parents and had told members of our company that in the event of his death on the way his trunk and its contents and his horse and its equipments should belong to Captain Donner When the trunk was opened it was found to contain clothing keepsakes a Masonic emblem and fifteen hundred dollars in coin A new inventory taken about this time disclosed the fact that the company s stock of supplies was insufficient to carry it through to California A call was made for volunteers who should hasten on horseback to Sutter s Fort procure supplies and returning meet the train en route mister Stanton who was without family and mister McCutchen whose wife and child were in the company heroically responded They were furnished with necessaries for their personal needs and with letters to Captain Sutter explaining the company s situation and petitioning for supplies which would enable it to reach the settlement As the two men rode away many anxious eyes watched them pass out of sight and many heartfelt prayers were offered for their personal safety and the success of their mission In addressing this letter to Captain Sutter my father followed the general example of emigrants to California in those days for Sutter great hearted and generous was the man to whom all turned in distress or emergencies He himself had emigrated to the United States at an early age and after a few years spent in saint Louis Missouri had pushed his way westward to California There he negotiated with the Russian Government for its holdings on the Pacific coast and took them over when Russia evacuated the country He then established himself on the vast estates so acquired which in memory of his parentage he called New Helvetia The Mexican Government however soon assumed his liabilities to the Russian Government and exercised sovereignty over the territory Sutter s position nevertheless was practically that of a potentate He constructed the well known fort near the present site of the city of Sacramento as protection against Indian depredations and it became a trading centre and rendezvous for incoming emigrants CHAPTER V BEWILDERING GUIDE BOARD SOUL TRYING STRUGGLES FIRST SNOW REED SNYDER TRAGEDY HARDCOOP S FATE Our next memorable camp was in a fertile valley where we found twenty natural wells some very deep and full to the brim of pure cold water They varied from six inches to several feet in diameter the soil around the edges was dry and hard and as fast as water was dipped out a new supply rose to the surface two Grass was plentiful and wood easily obtained Our people made much of a brief stay for though the weather was a little sharp the surroundings were restful Then came a long dreary pull over a low range of hills which brought us to another beautiful valley where the pasturage was abundant and more wells marked the site of good camping grounds Close by the largest well stood a rueful spectacle a bewildering guide board flecked with bits of white paper showing that the notice or message which had recently been pasted and tacked thereon had since been stripped off in irregular bits In surprise and consternation the emigrants gazed at its blank face then toward the dreary waste beyond Presently my mother knelt before it and began searching for fragments of paper which she believed crows had wantonly pecked off and dropped to the ground Spurred by her zeal others also were soon on their knees scratching among the grasses and sifting the loose soil through their fingers What they found they brought to her and after the search ended she took the guide board laid it across her lap and thoughtfully began fitting the ragged edges of paper together and matching the scraps to marks on the board The tedious process was watched with spell bound interest by the anxious group around her The writing was that of Hastings and her patchwork brought out the following words two days two nights hard driving cross desert reach water This would be a heavy strain on our cattle and to fit them for the ordeal they were granted thirty six hours indulgence near the bubbling waters amid good pasturage Meanwhile grass was cut and stored water casks were filled and rations were prepared for desert use We left camp on the morning of September nine following dimly marked wagon tracks courageously and entered upon the dry drive which Hastings and his agent at Fort Bridger had represented as being thirty five miles or forty at most After two days and two nights of continuous travel over a waste of alkali and sand we were still surrounded as far as eye could see by a region of fearful desolation The supply of feed for our cattle was gone the water casks were empty and a pitiless sun was turning its burning rays upon the glaring earth over which we still had to go mister Reed now rode ahead to prospect for water while the rest followed with the teams All who could walk did so mothers carrying their babes in their arms and fathers with weaklings across their shoulders moved slowly as they urged the famishing cattle forward Suddenly an outcry of joy gave hope to those whose courage waned A lake of shimmering water appeared before us in the near distance we could see the wavy grasses and a caravan of people moving toward it It may be Hastings was the eager shout Alas as we advanced the scene vanished A cruel mirage in its mysterious way had outlined the lake and cast our shadows near its shore Disappointment intensified our burning thirst and my good mother gave her own and other suffering children wee lumps of sugar moistened with a drop of peppermint and later put a flattened bullet in each child s mouth to engage its attention and help keep the salivary glands in action Then followed soul trying hours Oxen footsore and weary stumbled under their yokes Women heartsick and exhausted could walk no farther As a last resort the men hung the water pails on their arms unhooked the oxen from the wagons and by persuasion and force drove them onward leaving the women and children to await their return Messrs Eddy and Graves got their animals to water on the night of the twelfth and the others later As soon as the poor beasts were refreshed they were brought back with water for the suffering and also that they might draw the wagons on to camp My father s wagons were the last taken out They reached camp the morning of the fifteenth Thirty six head of cattle were left on that desert some dead some lost Among the lost were all mister Reed s herd except an ox and a cow His poor beasts had become frenzied in the night as they were being driven toward water and with the strength that comes with madness had rushed away in the darkness Meanwhile mister Reed unconscious of his misfortune was returning to his family which he found by his wagon some distance in the rear At daylight he with his wife and children on foot overtook my Uncle Jacob s wagons and were carried forward in them until their own were brought up After hurriedly making camp all the men turned out to hunt the Reed cattle In every direction they searched but found no clue Those who rode onward however discovered that we had reached only an oasis in the desert and that six miles ahead of us lay another pitiless barren stretch Anguish and dismay now filled all hearts Husbands bowed their heads appalled at the situation of their families Some cursed Hastings for the false statements in his open letter and for his broken pledge at Fort Bridger They cursed him also for his misrepresentation of the distance across this cruel desert traversing which had wrought such suffering and loss Mothers in tearless agony clasped their children to their bosoms with the old old cry Father Thy will not mine be done It was plain that try as we might we could not get back to Fort Bridger We must proceed regardless of the fearful outlook After earnest consultation it was deemed best to dig a trench and cache all mister Reed s effects except such as could be packed into one wagon and were essential for daily use This accomplished Messrs Graves and Breen each loaned him an ox and these in addition to his own ox and cow yoked together formed his team Upon examination it was found that the woodwork of all the wagons had been shrunk and cracked by the dry atmosphere One of mister Keseberg s and one of my father s were in such bad condition that they were abandoned left standing near those of mister Reed as we passed out of camp The first snow of the season fell as we were crossing the narrow strip of land upon which we had rested and when we encamped for the night on its boundary the waste before us was as cheerless cold and white as the winding sheet which enfolds the dead At dawn we resumed our toilful march and travelled until four o clock the following morning when we reached an extensive valley where grass and water were plentiful Several oxen had died during the night and it was with a caress of pity that the surviving were relieved of their yokes for the day The next sunrise saw us on our way over a range of hills sloping down to a valley luxuriant with grass and springs of delicious water where antelope and mountain sheep were grazing and where we saw Indians who seemed never to have met white men before We were three days in crossing this magnificent stretch of country which we called Valley of Fifty Springs In it several wagons and large cases of goods were cached by our company and secret marks were put on trees near by so that they could be recovered should their owners return for them While on the desert my father s wagons had travelled last in the train in order that no one should stray or be left to die alone But as soon as we reached the mountainous country he took the lead to open the way Uncle Jacob s wagons were always close to ours for the two brothers worked together one responding when the other called for help and with the assistance of their teamsters they were able to free the trail of many obstructions and prevent unnecessary delays From the Valley of Fifty Springs we pursued a southerly course over more hills and through fertile valleys where we saw Indians in a state of nudity who looked at us from a distance but never approached our wagons nor molested any one On the twenty fourth of September we turned due north and found the tracks of wagon wheels which guided us to the valley of Mary s River or Ogden s River and on the thirtieth put us on the old emigrant road leading from Fort Hall This welcome landmark inspired us with renewed trust and the energizing hope that Stanton and McCutchen would soon appear strengthened our sorely tried courage This day was also memorable because it brought us a number of Indians who must have been Fremont s guides for they could give information and understand a little English They went into camp with us and by word and sign explained that we were still far from the sink of Mary s River but on the right trail to it After another long day s drive we stopped on a mountain side close to a spring of cold sweet water While supper was being prepared one of the fires crept beyond bounds spread rapidly and threatened destruction to part of our train At the critical moment two strange Indians rushed upon the scene and rendered good service After the fire was extinguished the Indians were rewarded and were also given a generous meal at the tent of mister Graves Later they settled themselves in friendly fashion beside his fire and were soon fast asleep Next morning the Indians were gone and had taken with them a new shirt and a yoke of good oxen belonging to their host Within the week Indians again sneaked up to camp and stole one of mister Graves s saddle horses These were trials which made men swear vengeance yet no one felt that it would be safe to follow the marauders Who could know that the train was not being stealthily followed by cunning plunderers who would await their chance to get away with the wagons if left weakly guarded Conditions now were such that it seemed best to divide the train into sections and put each section under a sub leader Our men were well equipped with side arms rifles and ammunition nevertheless anxious moments were common as the wagons moved slowly and singly through dense thickets narrow defiles and rugged mountain gorges one section often being out of sight of the others and each man realizing that there could be no concerted action in the event of a general attack that each must stay by his own wagon and defend as best he could the lives committed to his care No one rode horseback now except the leaders and those in charge of the loose cattle When darkness obscured the way and after feeding time each section formed its wagons into a circle to serve as cattle corral and night watches were keenly alert to give a still alarm if anything unusual came within sight or sound Day after day from dawn to twilight we moved onward never stopping except to give the oxen the necessary nooning or to give them drink when water was available Gradually the distance between sections lengthened and so it happened that the wagons of my father and my uncle were two days in advance of the others on the eighth of October when mister Reed on horseback overtook us He was haggard and in great tribulation His lips quivered as he gave substantially the following account of circumstances which had made him the slayer of his friend and a lone wanderer in the wilderness On the morning of October five when mister Reed s section broke camp he and mister Eddy ventured off to hunt antelope and were shot at a number of times by Indians with bows and arrows Empty handed and disappointed the two followed and overtook their companions about noon at the foot of a steep hill near Gravelly Ford where the teams had to be doubled for the ascent All the wagons except Pike s and Reed s and one of Graves s in charge of John Snyder had already been taken to the top Snyder was in the act of starting his team when Milton Elliot driving Reed s oxen with Eddy s in the lead also started Suddenly the Reed and Eddy cattle became unmanageable and in some way got mixed up with Snyder s team This provoked both drivers and fierce words passed between them Snyder declared that the Reed team ought to be made to drag its wagon up without help Then he began to beat his own cattle about the head to get them out of the way mister Reed attempted to remonstrate with him for his cruelty at which Snyder became more enraged and threatened to strike both Reed and Elliot with his whip for interfering mister Reed replied sharply that they would settle the matter later This Synder took as a threat and retorted No we ll settle it right here and struck Reed over the head with the butt end of his whip cutting an ugly scalp wound missus Reed who rushed between the two men for the purpose of separating them caught the force of the second blow from Snyder s whip on her shoulder While dodging the third blow Reed drew his hunting knife and stabbed Snyder in the left breast Fifteen minutes later John Snyder with his head resting on the arm of William Graves died and mister Reed stood beside the corpse dazed and sorrowful Near by sections were immediately called into camp and gloom consternation and anger pervaded it mister Reed and family were taken to their tent some distance from the others and guarded by their friends Later an assembly was convened to decide what should be done The majority declared the deed murder and demanded retribution mister Eddy and others pleaded extenuating circumstances and proposed that the accused should leave the camp After heated discussion this compromise was adopted the assembly voting that mister Reed should be banished from the company mister Reed maintained that the deed was not prompted by malice that he had acted in self defence and in defence of his wife and that he would not be driven from his helpless dependent family The assembly promised that the company would care for his family and limited his stay in camp His wife fearing the consequence of noncompliance with the sentence begged him to abide by it and to push on to the settlement procure food and assistance and return for her and their children The following morning after participating in the funeral rites over the lamented dead mister Reed took leave of his friends and sorrowing family and left the camp The group around my father s wagon were deeply touched by mister Reed s narrative Its members were friends of the slain and of the slayer Their sympathies clustered around the memory of the dead and clung to the living They deplored the death of a fellow traveller who had manfully faced many hardships and was young genial and full of promise They regretted the act which took from the company a member who had been prominent in its organization had helped to formulate its rules and had up to that unfortunate hour been a company worker with the other leading spirits for its best interests It was plain that the hardships and misfortunes of the journey had sharpened the tempers of both men and the vexations of the morning had been too much for the overstrained nerves mister Reed breakfasted at our tent but did not continue his journey alone Walter Herron one of my father s helpers decided to accompany him and after hurried preparations they went away together bearing an urgent appeal from my father to Captain Sutter for necessary teams and provisions to carry the company through to California also his personal pledge in writing that he would be responsible for the payment of the debt as soon as he should reach the settlement My father believed the two men would reach their destination long before the slowly moving train Immediately after the departure of Messrs Reed and Herron our wagons moved onward Night overtook us at a gruesome place where wood and feed were scarce and every drop of water was browned by alkali There hungry wolves howled and there we found and buried the bleaching bones of mister Salle a member of the Hastings train who had been shot by Indians After his companions had left his grave the savages had returned dug up the body robbed it of its clothing and left it to the wolves At four o clock the following morning October ten the rest of the company having travelled all night drove into camp Many were in a state of great excitement and some almost frenzied by the physical and mental suffering they had endured Accounts of the Reed Snyder tragedy differed somewhat from that we had already heard The majority held that the assembly had been lenient with mister Reed and considerate for his family that the action taken had been largely influenced by rules which Messrs Reed Donner Thornton and others had suggested for the government of Colonel Russell s train and that there was no occasion for criticism since the sentence was for the transgression and not for the individual The loss of aged mister Hardcoop whose fate was sealed soon after the death of John Synder was the subject of bitter contention The old man was travelling with the Keseberg family and in the heavy sand when that family walked to lighten the load he was required to do likewise The first night after leaving Gravelly Ford he did not come into camp with the rest The company fearing something amiss sent a man on horseback to bring him in He was found five miles from camp completely exhausted and his feet in a terrible condition The following morning he again started with Keseberg and when the section had been under way only a short time the old man approached mister Eddy and begged for a place in some other wagon saying he was sick and exhausted and that Keseberg had put him out to die The road was still through deep loose sand and mister Eddy told him if he would only manage to go forward until the road should be easier on the oxen he himself would take him in Hardcoop promised to try yet the roads became so heavy that progress was yet slower and even the small children were forced to walk nor did any one see when mister Hardcoop dropped behind mister Eddy had the first watch that night and kept a bright fire burning on the hillside in hopes that it would guide the belated into camp Milton Elliot went on guard at midnight and kept the fire till morning yet neither sign nor sound of the missing came over that desolate trail In vain the watchers now besought Keseberg to return for Hardcoop Next they applied to Messrs Graves and Breen who alone had saddle horses able to carry the helpless man but neither of them would risk his animals again on that perilous road In desperation Messrs William Pike Milton Elliot and William Eddy proposed to go out afoot and carry him in if the wagons would wait Messrs Graves and Breen however in language so plain and homely that it seemed heartless declared that it was neither the voice of common sense nor of humanity that asked the wagons to wait there in the face of danger while three foolhardy men rushed back to look for a helpless one whom they had been unable to succor on the previous day and for whom they could make no provision in the future even if they should succeed then in snatching him from the jaws of death This exposition of undeniable facts defeated the plans of the would be rescuers yet did not quiet their consciences When the section halted at noon they again begged though in vain for horses which might enable them to do something for their deserted companion My father listened thoughtfully to the accounts of that harrowing incident and although he realized that death must have ended the old man s sufferings within a few hours after he dropped by the wayside he could not but feel deeply the bitterness of such a fate Who could peer into the near future and read between its lines the greater suffering which mister Hardcoop had escaped or the trials in store for us We were in close range of ambushed savages lying in wait for spoils While the company were hurrying to get into marching order Indians stole a milch cow and several horses belonging to mister Graves Emboldened by success they made a raid on our next camp and stampeded a bunch of eighteen horned cattle belonging to mister Wolfinger and my father and Uncle Jacob and also flesh wounded several poor beasts with arrows These were more serious hindrances than we had yet experienced Still undaunted by the alarming prospects before us we immediately resumed travel with cows under yoke in place of the freshly injured oxen Footnote two Thornton CHAPTER VI INDIAN DEPREDATIONS WOLFINGER S DISAPPEARANCE STANTON RETURNS WITH SUPPLIES FURNISHED BY CAPTAIN SUTTER DONNER WAGONS SEPARATED FROM TRAIN FOREVER TERRIBLE PIECE OF NEWS FORCED INTO SHELTER AT DONNER LAKE DONNER CAMP ON PROSSER CREEK All who managed to get beyond the sink of Ogden s River before midnight of October twelve reached Geyser Springs without further molestation but the belated who encamped at the sink were surprised at daylight by the Indians who while the herders were hurriedly taking a cup of coffee swooped down and killed twenty one head of cattle Among the number were all of mister Eddy s stock except an ox and a cow that would not work together Maddened by his appalling situation Eddy called for vengeance on his despoilers and would have rushed to certain death if the breaking of the lock of his rifle at the start had not stopped him Sullen and dejected he cached the contents of his wagons and with a meagre supply of food in a pack on his back he and his wife each carrying a child set forth to finish the journey on foot To add to their discomfort they saw Indians on adjacent hills dancing and gesticulating in savage delight In relating the above occurrence after the journey was finished mister Eddy declared that no language could portray the desolation and heartsick feeling nor the physical and mental torture which he and his wife experienced while travelling between the sink of Ogden s River and the Geyser Springs three It was during that trying week that mister Wolfinger mysteriously disappeared At the time he and Keseberg with their wagons were at the rear of the train and their wives were walking in advance with other members of the company When camp was made those two wagons were not in sight and after dark the alarmed wives prevailed on friends to go in search of their missing husbands The searchers shortly found Keseberg leisurely driving toward camp He assured them that Wolfinger was not far behind him so they returned without further search All night the frantic wife listened for the sound of the coming of her husband and so poignant was her grief that at break of day William Graves junior and two companions went again in search of mister Wolfinger Five or six miles from camp they came upon his tenantless wagon with the oxen unhooked and feeding on the trail near by Nothing in the wagon had been disturbed nor did they find any sign of struggle or of Indians After a diligent search for the missing man his wagon and team was brought to camp and restored to missus Wolfinger and she was permitted to believe that her husband had been murdered by Indians and his body carried off Nevertheless some suspected Keseberg of having had a hand in his disappearance as he knew that mister Wolfinger carried a large sum of money on his person Three days later Rhinehart and Spitzer who had not been missed came into camp and missus Wolfinger was startled to recognize her husband s gun in their possession They explained that they were in the wagon with mister Wolfinger when the Indians rushed upon them drove them off killed Wolfinger and burned the wagon My father made a note of this conflicting statement to help future investigation of the case At Geyser Springs the company cached valuable goods among them several large cases of books and other heavy articles belonging to my father As will be seen later the load in our family wagon thus lightened through pity for our oxen also lessened the severity of an accident which otherwise might have been fatal to Georgia and me On the nineteenth of October near the present site of Wadsworth Nevada we met mister Stanton returning from Sutter s Fort with two Indian herders driving seven mules laden with flour and jerked beef Their arrival was hailed with great joy and after a brief consultation with my father Stanton and his Indians continued toward the rear in order to distribute first to those most in need of provisions also that the pack animals might be the sooner set apart to the use of those whose teams had given out or had been destroyed by Indians Illustration MARCH OF THE CARAVAN Illustration UNITED STATES TROOPS CROSSING THE DESERT mister Stanton had left mister McCutchen sick at Sutter s Fort He brought information also concerning Messrs Reed and Herron whom he had met in the Sacramento valley At the time of meeting they were quite a distance from the settlement had been without food three days and mister Reed s horse was completely worn out mister Stanton had furnished mister Reed with a fresh mount and provisions enough to carry both men to Sutter s Fort In camp that night mister Stanton outlined our course to the settlement and in compliance with my father s earnest wish consented to lead the train across the Sierra Nevada Mountains Frost in the air and snow on the distant peaks warned us against delays yet notwithstanding the need of haste we were obliged to rest our jaded teams Three yoke of oxen had died from exhaustion within a week and several of those remaining were not in condition to ascend the heavy grades before them On the twentieth mister Pike met death in his own tent by the accidental discharge of a six shooter in the hands of mister Foster his brother in law He left a young wife and two small children Naomi three years of age and Catherine a babe in arms His loss was keenly felt by the company for he was highly esteemed We broke camp on the twenty second and my father and uncle took our wagons to the rear of the train in order to favor our cattle and also to be near families whose teams might need help in getting up the mountains That day we crossed the Truckee River for the forty ninth and last time in eighty miles and encamped for the night at the top of a high hill where we received our last experience of Indian cruelty The perpetrator was concealed behind a willow and with savage vim and well trained hand sent nineteen arrows whizzing through the air and each arrow struck a different ox mister Eddy caught him in the act and as he turned to flee the white man s rifle ball struck him between the shoulders and pierced his body With a spring into the air and an agonizing shriek he dropped lifeless into the bushes below Strange but true not an ox was seriously hurt The train took the trail early next morning expecting to cross the summit of the Sierras and reach California in less than two weeks The following circumstances which parted us forever from the train which father had led through so many difficulties were told me by my sister missus Elitha C Wilder now of Bruceville California Our five Donner wagons and missus Wolfinger s wagon were a day or more behind the train and between twelve and sixteen miles from the spot where we later made our winter camp when an accident happened which nearly cost us your life and indirectly prevented our rejoining the train Your mother and Frances were walking on ahead you and Georgia were asleep in the wagon and father was walking beside it down a steep hill It had almost reached the base of the incline when the axle to the fore wheels broke and the wagon tipped over on the side tumbling its contents upon you two children Father and uncle in great alarm rushed to your rescue Georgia was soon hauled out safely through the opening in the back of the wagon sheets but you were nowhere in sight and father was sure you were smothering because you did not answer his call They worked breathlessly getting things out and finally uncle came to your limp form You could not have lasted much longer they said How thankful we all were that our heaviest boxes had been cached at Geyser Springs Much as we felt the shock there was little time for self indulgence Never were moments of greater importance for while father and uncle were hewing a new axle two men came from the head of the company to tell about the snow It was a terrible piece of news Those men reported that on the twenty eighth of that month the larger part of the train had reached a deserted cabin near Truckee Lake the sheet of water now known as Donner Lake at the foot of Fremont s Pass in the main chain of the Sierra Nevada Mountains The following morning they had proceeded to within three miles of the summit but finding snow there five feet in depth the trail obliterated and no place for making camp they were obliged to return to the spot they had left early in the day There they said the company had assembled to discuss the next move and great confusion prevailed as the excited members gave voice to their bitterest fears Some proposed to abandon the wagons and make the oxen carry out the children and provisions some wanted to take the children and rations and start out on foot and some sat brooding in dazed silence through the long night The messengers further stated that on the thirtieth with Stanton as leader and despite the falling sleet and snow the forward section of the party united in another desperate effort to cross the summit but encountered deeper drifts and greater difficulties As darkness crept over the whitened waste wagons became separated and lodged in the snow and all had to cling to the mountain side until break of day when the train again returned to its twice abandoned camp having been compelled however to leave several of the wagons where they had become stalled The report concluded with the statement that the men at once began log cutting for cabins in which the company might have to pass the winter After the messengers left and as father and Uncle Jacob were hastening preparations for our own departure new troubles beset us Uncle was giving the finishing touches to the axle when the chisel he was using slipped from his grasp and its keen edge struck and made a serious wound across the back of father s right hand which was steadying the timber The crippled hand was carefully dressed and to quiet uncle s fears and discomfort father made light of the accident declaring that they had weightier matters for consideration than cuts and bruises The consequences of that accident however were far more wide reaching than could have been anticipated Up and up we toiled until we reached an altitude of six thousand feet and were within about ten miles of our companions at the lake when the intense cold drove us into camp on Prosser Creek in Alder Creek Valley a picturesque and sheltered nook two and a half miles in length and three quarters of a mile in width But no one observed the picturesque grandeur of the forest covered mountains which hem it in on the north and west nor that eastward and southward it looks out across plateaus to the Washoe Mountains twenty miles away A piercing wind was driving storm clouds toward us and those who understood their threatening aspect realized that twenty one persons eight of them helpless children were there at the mercy of the pitiless storm king The teams were hurriedly unhooked the tents pitched and the men and the women began collecting material for more suitable quarters Some felled trees some lopped off the branches and some with oxen dragged the logs into position There was enough building material on the ground for a good sized foundation four logs deep when night stopped the work The moon and stars came out before we went to bed yet the following morning the ground was covered with snow two or three feet in depth which had to be shovelled from the exposed beds before their occupants could rise I remember well that new day All plans for log cabins had to be abandoned There was no sheltered nook for shivering children so father lifted Georgia and me on to a log and mother tucked a buffalo robe around us saying Sit here until we have a better place for you There we sat snug and dry chatting and twisting our heads about watching the hurrying anxious workers Those not busy at the wagons were helping the builders to construct a permanent camp They cleared a space under a tall pine tree and reset the tent a few feet south of its trunk facing the sunrise Then following the Indian method as described by John Baptiste a rude semi circular hut of poles was added to the tent the tree trunk forming part of its north wall and its needled boughs the rafters and cross pieces to the roof The structure was overlaid so far as possible with pieces of cloth old quilts and buffalo robes then with boughs and branches of pine and tamarack A hollow was scooped in the ground near the tree for a fireplace and an opening in the top served as chimney and ventilator One opening led into the tent and another served as an outer door To keep the beds off the wet earth two rows of short posts were driven along the sides in the tent and poles were laid across the tops thus forming racks to support the pine boughs upon which the beds should be made While this was being done Elitha Leanna and missus Wolfinger were bringing poles and brush with which to strengthen and sheath the tent walls against wind and weather Even Sister Frances looked tall and helpful as she trudged by with her little loads The combination of tent and hut was designed for my father and family and missus Wolfinger The teamsters Samuel Shoemaker Joseph Rhinehart James Smith and John Baptiste built their hut in Indian wigwam fashion Not far from us across the stream braced against a log was reared a mixed structure of brush and tent for use of Uncle Jacob Aunt Betsy and William and Solomon Hook Aunt Betsy s sons by a former husband and their five small children George Mary Isaac Lewis and Samuel Donner Before we two could leave our perch the snow was falling faster and in larger flakes It made pictures for Georgia and me upon the branches of big and little trees it gathered in a ridge beside us upon the log it nestled in piles upon our buffalo robe and by the time our quarters were finished it was veiling Uncle Jacob s from view Everything within was cold damp and dreary until our tired mother and elder sisters built the fire prepared our supper and sent us to bed each with a lump of loaf sugar as comforter Footnote three Thornton CHAPTER VII SNOWBOUND SCARCITY OF FOOD AT BOTH CAMPS WATCHING FOR RETURN OF M CUTCHEN AND REED When we awoke the following morning little heaps of snow lay here and there upon the floor No threshold could be seen only a snow bank reaching up to the white plain beyond where every sound was muffled and every object was blurred by falling flakes Father s face was very grave His morning caress had all its wonted tenderness but the merry twinkle was gone from his eye and the gladsome note from his voice For eight consecutive days the fatal snow fell with but few short intermissions Eight days in which there was nothing to break the monotony of torturing inactive endurance except the necessity of gathering wood keeping the fires and cutting anew the steps which led upward as the snow increased in depth Hope well nigh died within us All in camp fared alike and all were on short rations Three of our men became dispirited said that they were too weak and hungry to gather wood and did not care how soon death should put an end to their miseries The out of door duties would have fallen wholly upon my Aunt Betsy s two sons and on John Baptiste and on my crippled father had the women lost their fortitude They however hid their fears from their children even from each other and helped to gather fuel hunt cattle and keep camp Axes were dull green wood was hard to cut and harder to carry whether through loose dry snow or over crusts made slippery by sleet and frost Cattle tracks were covered over Some of the poor creatures had perished under bushes where they sought shelter A few had become bewildered and strayed others were found under trees in snow pits which they themselves had made by walking round and round the trunks to keep from being snowed under These starvelings were shot to end their sufferings and also with the hope that their hides and fleshless bones might save the lives of our snow beleaguered party Every part of the animals was saved for food The locations of the carcasses were marked so that they could be brought piece by piece into camp and even the green hides were spread against the huts to serve in case of need After the storm broke John Baptiste was sent with a letter from my mother to the camp near the lake He was absent a number of days for upon his arrival there he found a party of fourteen ready to start next morning on foot across the summit He joined it but after two days of vain effort the party returned to camp and he came back to us with an answer to the letter he had delivered We then learned that most of those at the lake were better housed than we Some in huts and the rest in three log structures which came to be known respectively as the Murphy Graves and Breen cabins The last mentioned was the relic of earlier travellers four and had been grizzled by the storms of several winters Yet despite their better accommodations our companions at the lake were harassed by fears like ours They too were short of supplies The game had left the mountains and the fish in the lake would not bite Different parties both with and without children had repeatedly endeavored to force their way out of that wilderness of snow but each in turn had become confused and unconsciously moved in a circle back to camp Several persons had become snow blind Every landmark was lost even to Stanton who had twice crossed the range All now looked to the coming of McCutchen and Reed for deliverance We had every reason to expect them soon for each had left his family with the company and had promised to return with succor Moreover Stanton had brought tidings that the timely assistance of himself and comrade had enabled Reed to reach Sutter s Fort in safety and that McCutchen would have accompanied him back had he not been detained by illness Well indeed was it that we could not know that at the very time we were so anxiously awaiting their arrival those two men after struggling desperately to cross the snows were finally compelled to abandon the attempt bury the precious food they had striven to bring us and return to the settlement It was also well that we were unaware of their baffling fears when the vigorous efforts incited by the memorial presented by Reed to Commodore Stockton the military Governor of California were likewise frustrated by mountain storms Footnote four Built by Townsend party in eighteen forty four See McGlashan s History of the Donner Party CHAPTER VIII ANOTHER STORM FOUR DEATHS IN DONNER CAMP FIELD MICE USED FOR FOOD CHANGED APPEARANCE OF THE STARVING SUNSHINE DEPARTURE OF THE FORLORN HOPE WATCHING FOR RELIEF IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTURB THE BODIES OF THE DEAD IN DONNER CAMP ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF THE FIRST RELIEF PARTY Meanwhile with us in the Sierras November ended with four days and nights of continuous snow and December rushed in with a wild shrieking storm of wind sleet and rain which ceased on the third The weather remained clear and cold until the ninth when Milton Elliot and Noah James came on snowshoes to Donner s camp from the lake cabins to ascertain if their captain was still alive and to report the condition of the rest of the company Before morning another terrific storm came swirling and whistling down our snowy stairway making fires unsafe freezing every drop of water about the camp and shutting us in from the light of heaven Ten days later Milton Elliot alone fought his way back to the lake camp with these tidings Jacob Donner Samuel Shoemaker Joseph Rhinehart and James Smith are dead and the others in a low condition five Uncle Jacob the first to die was older than my father and had been in miserable health for years before we left Illinois He had gained surprisingly on the journey yet quickly felt the influence of impending fate foreshadowed by the first storm at camp His courage failed Complete prostration followed My father and mother watched with him during the last night and the following afternoon helped to lay his body in a cave dug in the mountain side beneath the snow That snow had scarcely resettled when Samuel Shoemaker s life ebbed away in happy delirium He imagined himself a boy again in his father s house and thought his mother had built a fire and set before him the food of which he was fondest But when Joseph Rhinehart s end drew near his mind wandered and his whitening lips confessed a part in mister Wolfinger s death and my father listening knew not how to comfort that troubled soul He could not judge whether the self condemning words were the promptings of a guilty conscience or the ravings of an unbalanced mind Like a tired child falling asleep was James Smith s death and Milton Elliot who helped to bury the four victims and then carried the distressing report to the lake camp little knew that he would soon be among those later called to render a final accounting Yet it was even so Our camp having been thus depleted by death Noah James who had been one of my father s drivers from Springfield until we passed out of the desert now cast his lot again with ours and helped John Baptiste to dig for the carcasses of the cattle It was weary work for the snow was higher than the level of the guide marks and at times they searched day after day and found no trace of hoof or horn The little field mice that had crept into camp were caught then and used to ease the pangs of hunger Also pieces of beef hide were cut into strips singed scraped boiled to the consistency of glue and swallowed with an effort for no degree of hunger could make the saltless sticky substance palatable Marrowless bones which had already been boiled and scraped were now burned and eaten even the bark and twigs of pine were chewed in the vain effort to soothe the gnawings which made one cry for bread and meat During the bitterest weather we little ones were kept in bed and my place was always in the middle where Frances and Georgia snuggling up close gave me of their warmth and from them I learned many things which I could neither have understood nor remembered had they not made them plain Illustration PASS IN THE SIERRA NEVADAS OF CALIFORNIA Illustration From an old drawing made from description furnished by Wm G Murphy CAMP AT DONNER LAKE NOVEMBER eighteen forty six Just one happy play is impressed upon my mind It must have been after the first storm for the snow bank in front of the cabin door was not high enough to keep out a little sunbeam that stole down the steps and made a bright spot upon our floor I saw it and sat down under it held it on my lap passed my hand up and down in its brightness and found that I could break its ray in two In fact we had quite a frolic I fancied that it moved when I did for it warmed the top of my head kissed first one cheek and then the other and seemed to run up and down my arm Finally I gathered up a piece of it in my apron and ran to my mother Great was my surprise when I carefully opened the folds and found that I had nothing to show and the sunbeam I had left seemed shorter After mother explained its nature I watched it creep back slowly up the steps and disappear Snowy Christmas brought us no glad tidings and New Year s Day no happiness Yet each bright day that followed a storm was one of thanksgiving on which we all crept up the flight of snow steps and huddled about on the surface in the blessed sunshine but with our eyes closed against its painful and blinding glare Once my mother took me to a hole where I saw smoke coming up and she told me that its steps led down to Uncle Jacob s tent and that we would go down there to see Aunt Betsy and my little cousins I stooped low and peered into the dark depths Then I called to my cousins to come to me because I was afraid to go where they were I had not seen them since the day we encamped At that time they were chubby and playful carrying water from the creek to their tent in small tin pails Now they were so changed in looks that I scarcely knew them and they stared at me as at a stranger So I was glad when my mother came up and took me back to our own tent which seemed less dreary because I knew the things that were in it and the faces about me Father s hand became worse The swelling and inflammation extending up the arm to the shoulder produced suffering which he could not conceal Each day that we had a fire I watched mother sitting by his side with a basin of warm water upon her lap laving the wounded and inflamed parts very tenderly with a strip of frayed linen wrapped around a little stick I remember well the look of comfort that swept over his worn features as she laid the soothed arm back into place By the middle of January the snow measured twelve and fourteen feet in depth Nothing could be seen of our abode except the coils of smoke that found their way up through the opening There was a dearth of water Prosser Creek was frozen over and covered with snow Icicles hung from the branches of every tree The stock of pine cones that had been gathered for lights was almost consumed Wood was so scarce that we could not have fire enough to cook our strips of rawhide and Georgia heard mother say that we children had not had a dry garment on in more than a week and that she did not know what to do about it Then like a smile from God came another sunny day which not only warmed and dried us thoroughly but furnished a supply of water from dripping snowbanks The twenty first was also bright and John Baptiste went on snowshoes with messages to the lake camp He found its inmates in a more pitiable condition than we were Only one death had occurred there since our last communication but he saw several of the starving who could not survive many days The number to consume the slender stock of food had been lessened however on the sixteenth of December some six weeks previously by the departure of William Eddy Patrick Dolan Lemuel Murphy William Foster missus Sarah Foster Jay Fosdick missus Sarah Fosdick missus William McCutchen missus Harriet Pike Miss Mary Graves Franklin Graves Sr C T Stanton Antonio Lewis and Salvador This party which called itself The Forlorn Hope had a most memorable experience as will be shown later In some instances husband had parted from wife and father from children Three young mothers had left their babes in the arms of grandmothers It was a dire resort a last desperate attempt in face of death to save those dependent upon them Staff in hand they had set forth on snowshoes each carrying a pack containing little save a quilt and light rations for six days journeying One had a rifle ammunition flint and hatchet for camp use William Murphy and Charles Burger who had originally been of the number gave out before the close of the first day and crept back to camp The others continued under the leadership of the intrepid Eddy and brave Stanton John Baptiste remained there a short time and returned to us saying Those at the other camp believe the promised relief is close at hand This rekindled hope in us even as it had revived courage and prolonged lives in the lake cabins and we prayed as they were praying that the relief might come before its coming should be too late Oh how we watched hour after hour and how often each day John Baptiste climbed to the topmost bough of a tall pine tree and with straining eyes scanned the desolate expanse for one moving speck in the distance for one ruffled track on the snow which should ease our awful suspense Days passed No food in camp except an unsavory beef hide pinching hunger called for more Again John Baptiste and Noah James went forth in anxious search for marks of our buried cattle They made excavations then forced their hand poles deep deeper into the snow but in vain their efforts the nail and hook at the points brought up no sign of blood hair or hide In dread unspeakable they returned and said We shall go mad we shall die It is useless to hunt for the cattle but the dead if they could be reached their bodies might keep us alive No replied father and mother speaking for themselves No part of a hide still remains When it is gone we will perish if that be the alternative The fact was our dead could not have been disturbed even had the attempt been made for the many snowfalls of winter were banked about them firm as granite walls and in that camp was neither implement nor arm strong enough to reach their resting places It was a long weary waiting on starvation rations until the nineteenth of February I did not see any one coming that morning but I remember that suddenly there was an unusual stir and excitement in the camp Three strangers were there and one was talking with father The others took packs from their backs and measured out small quantities of flour and jerked beef and two small biscuits for each of us Then they went up to fell the sheltering pine tree over our tent for fuel while Noah James missus Wolfinger my two half sisters and mother kept moving about hunting for things Finally Elitha and Leanna came and kissed me then father good bye and went up the steps and out of sight Mother stood on the snow where she could see all go forth They moved in single file the leaders on snowshoes the weak stepping in the tracks made by the strong Leanna the last in line was scarcely able to keep up It was not until after mother came back with Frances and Georgia that I was made to understand that this was the long hoped for relief party It had come and gone and had taken Noah James missus Wolfinger and my two half sisters from us then had stopped at Aunt Betsy s for William Hook her eldest son and my Cousin George and all were now on the way to the lake cabins to join others who were able to walk over the snow without assistance The rescuers seven in number who had followed instructions given them at the settlement professed to have no knowledge of the Forlorn Hope except that this first relief expedition had been outfitted by Captain Sutter and Alcalde Sinclair in response to mister Eddy s appeal and that other rescue parties were being organized in California and would soon come prepared to carry out the remaining children and helpless grown folk By this we knew that mister Eddy at least had succeeded in reaching the settlement Footnote five Patrick Breen s Diary CHAPTER IX SUFFERINGS OF THE FORLORN HOPE RESORT TO HUMAN FLESH CAMP OF DEATH BOOTS CRISPED AND EATEN DEER KILLED INDIAN Rancheria THE WHITE MAN S HOME AT LAST Although we were so meagrely informed it is well that my readers should at this point become familiar with the experiences of the expedition known as the Forlorn Hope six and also the various measures taken for our relief when our precarious condition was made known to the good people of California It will be remembered that the Forlorn Hope was the party of fifteen which as John Baptiste reported to us made the last unaided attempt to cross the mountains Words cannot picture nor mind conceive more torturing hardships and privations than were endured by that little band on its way to the settlement It left the camp on the sixteenth of December with scant rations for six days hoping in that time to force its way to Bear Valley and there find game But the storms which had been so pitiless at the mountain camps followed the unprotected refugees with seemingly fiendish fury After the first day from camp its members could no longer keep together on their marches The stronger broke the trail and the rest followed to night camp as best they could On the third day Stanton s sight failed and he begged piteously to be led but soon realizing the heart rending plight of his companions he uncomplainingly submitted to his fate Three successive nights he staggered into camp long after the others had finished their stinted meal Always he was shivering from cold sometimes wet with sleet and rain It is recorded that at no time had the party allowed more than an ounce of food per meal to the individual yet the rations gave out on the night of the twenty second while they were still in a wilderness of snow peaks mister Eddy only was better provided In looking over his pack that morning for the purpose of throwing away any useless article he unexpectedly found a small bag containing about a half pound of dried bear meat seven Fastened to the meat was a pencilled note from his wife begging him to save the hidden treasure until his hour of direst need since it might then be the means of saving his life The note was signed Your own dear Elinor With tenderest emotion he slipped the food back resolving to do the dear one s bidding trusting that she and their children might live until he should return for them Illustration BEAR VALLEY FROM EMIGRANT GAP Illustration THE TRACKLESS MOUNTAINS The following morning while the others were preparing to leave camp Stanton sat beside the smouldering fire smoking his pipe When ready to go forth they asked him if he was coming and he replied Yes I am coming soon Those were his parting words to his friends and his greeting to the Angel of Death eight He never left that fireside and his companions were too feeble to return for him when they found he did not come into camp Twenty four hours later the members of that hapless little band threw themselves upon the desolate waste of snow to ponder the problems of life and death to search each the other s face for answer to the question their lips durst not frame Fathers who had left their families and mothers who had left their babes wanted to go back and die with them if die they must but mister Eddy and the Indians those who had crossed the range with Stanton declared that they would push on to the settlement Then Mary Graves in whose young heart were still whisperings of hope courageously said I too will go on for to go back and hear the cries of hunger from my little brothers and sisters is more than I can stand I shall go as far as I can let the consequences be what they may W F Graves her father would not let his daughter proceed alone and finally all decided to make a final supreme effort Yet think of it they were without one morsel of food Even the wind seemed to hold its breath as the suggestion was made that were one to die the rest might live Then the suggestion was made that lots be cast and whoever drew the longest slip should be the sacrifice mister Eddy endorsed the plan Despite opposition from mister Foster and others the slips of paper were prepared and great hearted Patrick Dolan drew the fatal slip Patrick Dolan who had come away from camp that his famishing friends might prolong their lives by means of the small stock of food which he had to leave Harm a hair of that good man s head Not a soul of that starving band would do it mister Eddy then proposed that they resume their journey as best they could until death should claim a victim All acquiesced Slowly rising to their feet they managed to stagger and to crawl forward about three miles to a tree which furnished fuel for their Christmas fire It was kindled with great difficulty for in cutting the boughs the hatchet blade flew off the handle and for a time was lost in deep snow Meanwhile every puff of wind was laden with killing frost and in sight of that glowing fire Antonio froze to death mister Graves who was also breathing heavily when told by mister Eddy that he was dying replied that he did not care He however called his daughters missus Fosdick and Mary Graves to him and by his parting injunctions showed that he was still able to realize keenly the dangers that beset them Remembering how their faces had paled at the suggestion of using human flesh for food he admonished them to put aside the natural repugnance which stood between them and the possibility of life He commanded them to banish sentiment and instinctive loathing and think only of their starving mother brothers and sisters whom they had left in camp and avail themselves of every means in their power to rescue them He begged that his body be used to sustain the famishing and bidding each farewell his spirit left its bruised and worn tenement before half the troubles of the night were passed About ten o clock pelting hail followed by snow on the wings of a tornado swept every spark of fire from those shivering mortals whose voices now mingled with the shrieking wind calling to heaven for relief mister Eddy knowing that all would freeze to death in the darkness if allowed to remain exposed succeeded after many efforts in getting them close together between their blankets where the snow covered them With the early morning Patrick Dolan became delirious and left camp He was brought back with difficulty and forcibly kept under cover until late in the day when he sank into a stupor whence he passed quietly into that sleep which knows no waking The crucial hour had come Food lay before the starving yet every eye turned from it and every hand dropped irresolute Another night of agony passed during which Lemuel Murphy became delirious and called long and loud for food but the cold was so intense that it kept all under their blankets until four o clock in the afternoon when mister Eddy succeeded in getting a fire in the trunk of a large pine tree Whereupon his companions instead of seeking food crept forth and broke off low branches put them down before the fire and laid their attenuated forms upon them The flames leaped up the trunk and burned off dead boughs so that they dropped on the snow about them but the unfortunates were too weak and too indifferent to fear the burning brands mister Eddy now fed his waning strength on shreds of his concealed bear meat hoping that he might survive to save the giver The rest in camp could scarcely walk by the twenty eighth and their sensations of hunger were deminishing This condition forebode delirium and death unless stayed by the only means at hand It was in very truth a pitiful alternative offered to the sufferers With sickening anguish the first morsels were prepared and given to Lemuel Murphy but for him they were too late Not one touched flesh of kindred body Nor was there need of restraining hand or warning voice to gauge the small quantity which safety prescribed to break the fast of the starving Death would have been preferable to that awful meal had relentless fate not said Take eat that ye may live Eat lest ye go mad and leave your work undone All but the Indians obeyed the mandate and were strengthened and reconciled to prepare the remaining flesh to sustain them a few days longer on their journey Hitherto the wanderers had been guided partly by the fitful sun partly by Lewis and Salvador the Indians who had come with Stanton from Sutter s Fort In the morning however when they were ready to leave that spot which was thereafter known as the Camp of Death Salvador who could speak a little English insisted that he and Lewis were lost and therefore unable to guide them farther Nevertheless the party at once set out and travelled instinctively until evening The following morning they wrapped pieces of blanket around their cracked and swollen feet and again struggled onward until late in the afternoon when they encamped upon a high ridge There they saw beyond in the distance a wide plain which they believed to be the Sacramento Valley This imaginary glimpse of distant lowland gave them a peaceful sleep The entire day of December thirty one was spent in crossing a canon and every footstep left its trace of blood in the snow When they next encamped mister Eddy saw that poor Jay Fosdick was failing and he begged him to summon up all his courage and energy in order to reach the promised land now so near They were again without food and William Foster whose mind had become unbalanced by the long fast was ready to kill missus McCutchen or Miss Graves mister Eddy confronted and intimidated the crazed sufferer who next threatened the Indian guides and would have carried out his threat then had mister Eddy not secretly warned them against danger and urged them to flee But nothing could save the Indians from Foster s insane passion later when he found them on the trail in an unconscious and dying condition January one eighteen forty seven was to the little band of eight a day of less distressing trials its members resumed travel early braced by unswerving will power They stopped at midday and revived strength by eating the toasted strings of their snowshoes mister Eddy also ate his worn out moccasins and all felt a renewal of hope upon seeing before them an easier grade which led to night camp where the snow was only six feet in depth Soothed by a milder temperature they resumed their march earlier next morning and descended to where the snow was but three feet deep There they built their camp fire and slightly crisped the leather of a pair of old boots and a pair of shoes which constituted their evening meal and was the last of their effects available as food An extraordinary effort on the third day of the new year brought them to bare ground between patches of snow They were still astray among the western foothills of the Sierras and sat by a fire under an oak tree all night enduring hunger that was almost maddening Jay Fosdick was sinking rapidly and mister Eddy resolved to take the gun and steal away from camp at dawn But his conscience smote him and he finally gave the others a hint of his intention of going in search of game and of not returning unless successful Not a moving creature nor a creeping thing had crossed the trail on their journey thither but the open country before them and minor marks well known to hunters had caught mister Eddy s eye and strengthened his determination missus Pike in dread and fear of the result threw her arms about mister Eddy s neck and implored him not to leave them and the others mingled their entreaties and protestations with hers In silence he took his gun to go alone Then Mary Graves declared that she would keep up with him and without heeding further opposition the two set out A short distance from camp they stopped at a place where a deer had recently lain With a thrill of emotion too intense for words with a prayer in his heart too fervent for utterance mister Eddy turned his tearful eyes toward Mary and saw her weeping like a child A moment later that man and that woman who had once said that they knew not how to pray were kneeling beside that newly found track pleading in broken accents to the Giver of all life for a manifestation of His power to save their starving band Long restrained tears were still streaming down the cheeks of both and soothing their anxious hearts as they arose to go in pursuit of the deer J Q

none	none	They had not proceeded far before they saw a large buck about eighty yards distant mister Eddy raised his rifle and for some time tried to bring it to bear upon the deer but such was his extreme weakness that he could not He breathed a little changed his manner of holding the gun and made another effort Again his weakness prevented him from being able to hold upon it He heard a low suppressed sobbing behind him and turning around saw Mary Graves weeping and in great agitation her head bowed and her hands upon her face Alarmed lest she should cause the deer to run mister Eddy begged her to be quiet which she was after exclaiming Oh I am afraid you will not kill it He brought the gun to his face the third time and elevated the muzzle above the deer let it descend until he saw the animal through the sight when the rifle cracked Mary immediately wept aloud exclaiming Oh merciful God you have missed it mister Eddy assured her that he had not that the rifle was upon it the moment of firing and that in addition to this the animal had dropped its tail between its legs which this animal always does when wounded His belief was speedily confirmed The deer ran a short distance then fell and the two eager watchers hastened to it as fast as their weakened condition would allow mister Eddy cut the throat of the expiring beast with his pocket knife and he and his companion knelt down and drank the warm blood that flowed from the wound The excitement of getting that blessed food and the strength it imparted produced a helpful reaction and enabled them to sit down in peace to rest a while before attempting to roll their treasure to the tree near by where they built a fire and prepared the entrails mister Eddy fired several shots after dark so that the others might know that he had not abandoned them Meanwhile mister and missus Foster missus McCutchen and missus Pike had moved forward and made their camp half way between mister Eddy s new one and that of the previous night mister Fosdick however being too weak to rise remained at the first camp His devoted wife pillowed his head upon her lap and prayed that death would call them away together mister Thornton continues The sufferer had heard the crack of mister Eddy s rifle at the time he killed the deer and said feebly There Eddy has killed a deer Now if I can only get to him I shall live But in the stillness of that cold dark night Jay Fosdick s spirit fled alone His wife wrapped their only blanket about his body and lay down on the ground beside him hoping to freeze to death The morning dawned bright the sun came out and the lone widow rose kissed the face of her dead and with a small bundle in her hand started to join mister Eddy She passed a hunger crazed man on the way from the middle camp going to hers and her heart grew sick for she knew that her loved one s body would not be spared for burial rites She found mister Eddy drying his deer meat before the fire and later saw him divide it so that each of his companions in the camps should have an equal share The seven survivors each with his portion of venison resumed travel on the sixth and continued in the foothills a number of days crawling up the ascents sliding down the steeps often harassed by fears of becoming lost near the goal yet unaware that they were astray The venison had been consumed Hope had almost died in the heart of the bravest when at the close of day on the tenth of January twenty five days from the date of leaving Donner Lake they saw an Indian village at the edge of a thicket they were approaching As the sufferers staggered forward the Indians were overwhelmed at sight of their misery The warriors gazed in stolid silence The squaws wrung their hands and wept aloud The larger children hid themselves and the little ones clung to their mothers in fear The first sense of horror having passed those dusky mothers fed the unfortunates Some brought them unground acorns to eat while others mixed the meal into cakes and offered them as fast as they could cook them on the heated stones All except mister Eddy were strengthened by the food It sickened him and he resorted to green grass boiled in water The following morning the chief sent his runners to other rancherias en route to the settlement telling his people of the distress of the pale faces who were coming toward them and who would need food When the Forlorn Hope was ready to move on the chief led the way and an Indian walked on either side of each sufferer supporting and helping the unsteady feet At each rancheria the party was put in charge of a new leader and fresh supporters On the seventeenth the chief with much difficulty procured for mister Eddy a gill of pine nuts which the latter found so nutritious that the following morning on resuming travel he was able to walk without support They had proceeded less than a mile when his companions sank to the ground completely unnerved They had suddenly given up and were willing to die The Indians appeared greatly perplexed and mister Eddy shook with sickening fear Was his great effort to come to naught Should his wife and babes die while he stood guard over those who would no longer help themselves No he would push ahead and see what he yet could do The old chief sent an Indian with him as a guide and support Relieved of the sight and personal responsibility of his enfeebled companions mister Eddy felt a renewal of strength and determination He pressed onward scarcely heeding his dusky guide At the end of five miles they met another Indian and mister Eddy now conscious that his feet were giving out promised the stranger tobacco if he would go with them and help to lead him to the white man s house And so that long desperate struggle for life and for the sake of loved ones ended an hour before sunset when mister Eddy leaning heavily upon the Indians halted before the door of Colonel M D Richey s home thirty five miles from Sutter s Fort The first to meet him was the daughter of the house whom he asked for bread Thornton says She looked at him burst out crying and took hold of him to assist him into the room He was immediately placed in bed in which he lay unable to turn his body during four days In a very short time he had food brought to him by missus Richey who sobbed as she fed the miserable and frightful being before her Shortly Harriet the daughter had carried the news from house to house in the neighborhood and horses were running at full speed from place to place until all preparations were made for taking relief to those whom mister Eddy had left in the morning William Johnson John Howell John Rhodes mister Keiser mister Sagur Racine Tucker and Joseph Varro assembled at mister Richey s immediately The females collected the bread they had with tea sugar and coffee amounting to as much as four men could carry Howell Rhodes Sagur and Tucker started at once on foot with the Indians as guides and arrived at camp between fifteen and eighteen miles distant at midnight mister Eddy had warned the outgoing party against giving the sufferers as much food as they might want but on seeing them the tender hearted men could not deny their tearful begging for more One of the relief was kept busy until dawn preparing food which the rest gave to the enfeebled emigrants This overdose of kindness made its victims temporarily very ill but caused no lasting harm Early on the morning of January eighteen Messrs Richey Johnson Varro and Keiser equipped with horses and other necessaries hurried away to bring in the refugees together with their comrades who had gone on before By ten o clock that night the whole of the Forlorn Hope were safe in the homes of their benefactors mister Richey declared that he and his party had retraced mister Eddy s track six miles by the blood from his feet and that they could not have believed that he had travelled that eighteen miles if they themselves had not passed over the ground in going to his discouraged companions Footnote six The experiences of the Donner Party to which he refers in a footnote suggested to Bret Harte the opening chapters of Gabriel Conroy but he has followed the sensational accounts circulated by the newspapers and the survivors find his work a mere travesty of the facts The narrative however does not purport to set forth the truth but is confessedly imaginative Footnote seven mister Eddy had killed the bear and dried the meat early in the winter Footnote eight His body was found there later by

2481_156738_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The following morning ten men started on their toilsome march to Bear Valley where they arrived on the thirteenth and at once began searching for the abandoned wagon and provisions which Reed and McCutchen had cached the previous Autumn after their fruitless attempt to scale the mountains The wagon was found under snow ten feet in depth but its supplies had been destroyed by wild beasts

chronicled in a previous chapter the party reached on the nineteenth of February eighteen forty seven Footnote nine Of the Forlorn Hope CHAPTER XI WATCHING FOR THE SECOND RELIEF PARTY OLD NAVAJO LAST FOOD IN CAMP After the departure of the First Relief we who were left in the mountains began to watch and pray for the coming of the Second Relief as we had before watched and prayed for the coming of the First Sixteen year old John Baptiste was disappointed and in ill humor when Messrs Tucker and Rhodes insisted that he being the only able bodied man in the Donner camp should stay and cut wood for the enfeebled until the arrival of other rescuers The little half breed was a sturdy fellow but he was starving too and thought that he should be allowed to save himself After he had had a talk with father however and the first company of refugees had gone he became reconciled to his lot and served us faithfully He would take us little ones up to exercise upon the snow saying that we should learn to keep our feet on the slick frozen surface as well as to wade through slush and loose drifts Frequently when at work and lonesome he would call Georgia and me up to keep him company and when the weather was frosty he would bring Old Navajo his long Indian blanket and roll her in it from one end and me from the other until we would come together in the middle like the folds of a paper of pins with a face peeping above each fold Then he would set us upon the stump of the pine tree while he chopped the trunk and boughs for fuel He told us that he had promised father to stay until we children should be taken from camp also that his home was to be with our family forever One of his amusements was to rake the coals together nights then cover them with ashes and put the large camp kettle over the pile for a drum so that we could spread our hands around it to get just a little warm before going to bed For the time he lived at Aunt Betsy s tent because Solomon Hook was snow blind and demented and at times restless and difficult to control The poor boy some weeks earlier had set out alone to reach the settlement and after an absence of forty eight hours was found close to camp blind and with his mind unbalanced He like other wanderers on that desolate waste had become bewildered and unconsciously circled back near to the starting point Aunt Betsy came often to our tent and mother frequently went to hers and they knelt together and asked for strength to bear their burdens Once when mother came back she reported to father that she had discovered bear tracks quite close to camp and was solicitous that the beast be secured as its flesh might sustain us until rescued As father grew weaker we children spent more time upon the snow above camp Often after his wound was dressed and he fell into a quiet slumber our ever busy thoughtful mother would come to us and sit on the tree trunk Sometimes she brought paper and wrote sometimes she sketched the mountains and the tall tree tops which now looked like small trees growing up through the snow And often while knitting or sewing she held us spell bound with wondrous tales of Joseph in Egypt of Daniel in the den of lions of Elijah healing the widow s son of dear little Samuel who said Speak Lord for Thy servant heareth and of the tender loving Master who took young children in his arms and blessed them With me sitting on her lap and Frances and Georgia at either side she referred to father s illness and lonely condition and said that when the next Relief came we little ones might be taken to the settlement without either parent but God willing both would follow later Who could be braver or tenderer than she as she prepared us to go forth with strangers and live without her While she without medicine without lights would remain and care for our suffering father in hunger and in cold and without her little girls to kiss good morning and good night She taught us how to gain friends among those whom we should meet and what to answer when asked whose children we were Often her eyes gazed wistfully to westward where sky and mountains seemed to meet and she told us that beyond those snowy peaks lay California our land of food and safety our promised land of happiness where God would care for us Oh it was painfully quiet some days in those great mountains and lonesome upon the snow The pines had a whispering homesick murmur and we children had lost all inclination to play The last food which I remember seeing in our camp before the arrival of the Second Relief was a thin mould of tallow which mother had tried out of the trimmings of the jerked beef brought us by the First Relief She had let it harden in a pan and after all other rations had given out she cut daily from it three small white squares for each of us and we nibbled off the four corners very slowly and then around and around the edges of the precious pieces until they became too small for us to hold between our fingers CHAPTER XII ARRIVAL OF SECOND RELIEF OR REED GREENWOOD PARTY FEW SURVIVORS STRONG ENOUGH TO TRAVEL WIFE S CHOICE PARTINGS AT DONNER CAMP MY TWO SISTERS AND I DESERTED DEPARTURE OF SECOND RELIEF PARTY It was the first of March about ten days after the arrival of the First Relief before James Reed and William McCutchen succeeded in reaching the party they had left long months before They together with Brit Greenwood Hiram Miller Joseph Jondro Charles Stone John Turner Matthew Dofar Charles Cady and Nicholas Clark constituted the Second Relief They reported having met the First Relief with eighteen refugees at the head of Bear Valley three having died en route from the cabins Among the survivors mister Reed found his wife his daughter Virginia and his son James F Reed junior He learned there from his anxious wife that their two younger children Martha J and Thomas K Reed had also left the cabin with her but had soon given out and been carried back and left at the mountain camp by Messrs Glover and Moutrey who then retraced their steps and rejoined the party Consequently this Reed Greenwood party realizing that this was no time for tarrying had hurried on to the lake cabins where mister Reed had the happiness of finding his children still alive There he and five companions encamped upon the snow and fed and soothed the unfortunates Two members continued on to Aunt Betsy s abode and Messrs Cady and Clark came to ours This Relief had followed the example of its predecessor in leaving supplies at marked caches along the trail for the return trip Therefore it reached camp with a frugal amount for distribution The first rations were doled out with careful hand lest harm should come to the famishing through overeating still the rescuers administered sufficient to satisfy the fiercest cravings and to give strength for the prospective journey While crossing Alder Creek Valley to our tent that first afternoon Messrs Cady and Clark had seen fresh tracks of a bear and cubs and in the evening the latter took one of our guns and went in pursuit of the game which would have been a godsend to us It was dark when he returned and told my mother that he had wounded the old bear near the camp but that she had escaped with her young through the pines into a clump of tamarack and that he would be able to follow her in the morning by the blood stains on the snow Meanwhile the two men who had come to Aunt Betsy s with food thought it best not to tell her that her son William had died en route to the settlement with the First Relief They selected from among her children in camp Solomon Mary and Isaac as able to follow a leader to the lake cabins and thence to go with the outgoing Second Relief across the mountains Hopefully that mother kissed her three children good bye and then wistfully watched them depart with their rescuers on snowshoes She herself was strong enough to make the journey but remained because there was no one to help to carry out her two youngest children Thirty one of the company were still in the camps when this party arrived nearly all of them children unable to travel without assistance and the adults were too feeble to give much aid to the little ones upon the snow Consequently when my father learned that the Second Relief comprised only ten men he felt that he himself would never reach the settlement He was willing to be left alone and entreated mother to leave him and try to save herself and us children He reminded her that his life was almost spent that she could do little for him were she to remain and that in caring for us children she would be carrying on his work She who had to choose between the sacred duties of wife and mother thought not of self She looked first at her helpless little children then into the face of her suffering and helpless husband and tenderly unhesitatingly announced her determination to remain and care for him until both should be rescued or death should part them

Perplexities and heartaches multiplied with the morning hours of the following day mister Clark being anxious to provide more food started early to hunt the wounded bear He had not been gone long when mister Stone arrived from the lake cabins and told mister Cady that the other members of the Relief had become alarmed at gathering storm clouds and had resolved to select at once the ablest among the emigrants and hasten with them across the summit and to leave Clark Cady and himself to cut the necessary fuel for the camps and otherwise assist the sufferers until the Third Relief should reach them Cady and Stone without waiting to inform Clark promptly decided upon their course of action They knew the scarcity of provisions in camp the condition of the trail over the mountains the probability of long fierce March storms and other obstacles which might delay future promised relief and terror stricken determined to rejoin their party regardless of opposition and return to the settlement Mother fearing that we children might not survive another storm in camp begged Messrs Cady and Stone to take us with them offering them five hundred dollars in coin to deliver us to Elitha and Leanna at Sutter s Fort The agreement was made and she collected a few keepsakes and other light articles which she wished us to have and which the men seemed more than willing to carry out of the mountains Then lovingly she combed our hair and helped us to dress quickly for the journey When we were ready except cloak and hood she led us to the bedside and we took leave of father The men helped us up the steps and stood us up on the snow She came put on our cloaks and hoods saying as if talking to herself I may never see you again but God will take care of you Frances was six years and eight months old and could trudge along quite bravely but Georgia who was little more than five and I lacking a week of four years could not do well on the heavy trail and we were soon taken up and carried After travelling some distance the men left us sitting on a blanket upon the snow and went ahead a short distance where they stopped and talked earnestly with many gesticulations We watched them trembling lest they leave us there to freeze Then Frances said Don t feel afraid If they go off and leave us I can lead you back to mother by our foot tracks on the snow After a seemingly long time they returned picked us up and took us on to one of the lake cabins where without a parting word they left us The Second Relief Party of which these men were members left camp on the third of March They took with them seventeen refugees the Breen and Graves families Solomon Hook Isaac and Mary Donner and Martha and Thomas mister Reed s two youngest children CHAPTER XIII A FATEFUL CABIN missus MURPHY GIVES MOTHERLY COMFORT THE GREAT STORM HALF A BISCUIT ARRIVAL OF THIRD RELIEF WHERE IS MY BOY How can I describe that fateful cabin which was dark as night to us who had come in from the glare of day We heard no word of greeting and met no sign of welcome but were given a dreary resting place near the foot of the steps just inside the open doorway with a bed of branches to lie upon and a blanket to cover us After we had been there a short time we could distinguish persons on other beds of branches and a man with bushy hair reclining beside a smouldering fire Soon a child began to cry Give me some bread Oh give me some meat Then another took up the same pitiful wail It continued so long that I wept in sympathy and fastened my arms tightly around my sister Frances neck and hid my eyes against her shoulder Still I heard that hungry cry until a husky voice shouted Be quiet you crying children or I ll shoot you But the silence was again and again broken by that heart rending plea and again and again were the voices hushed by the same terrifying threat And we three fresh from our loving mother s embrace believed the awful menace no vain threat We were cold and too frightened to feel hungry nor were we offered food that night but next morning mister Reed s little daughter Mattie appeared carrying in her apron a number of newly baked biscuits which her father had just taken from the hot ashes of his camp fire Joyfully she handed one to each inmate of the cabin then departed to join those ready to set forth on the journey to the settlement Few can know how delicious those biscuits tasted and how carefully we caught each dropping crumb The place seemed drearier after their giver left us yet we were glad that her father was taking her to her mother in California Soon the great storm which had been lowering broke upon us We were not exposed to its fury as were those who had just gone from us but we knew when it came for snow drifted down upon our bed and had to be scraped off before we could rise We were not allowed near the fire and spent most of our time on our bed of branches Dear kind missus Murphy who for months had taken care of her own son Simon and her grandson George Foster and little James Eddy gave us a share of her motherly attention and tried to feed and comfort us Affliction and famine however had well nigh sapped her strength and by the time those plaintive voices ceased to cry for bread and meat her willing hands were too weakened to do much for us I remember being awakened while there by two little arms clasped suddenly and tightly about me and I heard Frances say No she shall not go with you You want to kill her Near us stood Keseberg the man with the bushy hair In limping past our sleeping place he had stopped and said something about taking me away with him which so frightened my sisters that they believed my life in danger and would not let me move beyond their reach while we remained in that dungeon We spoke in whispers suffered as much as the starving children in Joseph s time and were more afraid than Daniel in the den of lions How long the storm had lasted we did not know nor how many days we had been there We were forlorn as children can possibly be when Simon Murphy who was older than Frances climbed to his usual look out on the snow above the cabin to see if any help were coming He returned to us stammering in his eagerness I seen a woman on snow shoes coming from the other camp She s a little woman like missus Donner She is not looking this way and may pass Hardly had he spoken her name before we had gathered around him and were imploring him to hurry back and call our mother We were too excited to follow him up the steps She came to us quickly with all the tenderness and courage needed to lessen our troubles and soften our fears Oh how glad we were to see her and how thankful she appeared to be with us once more We heard it in her voice and saw it in her face and when we begged her not to leave us she could not answer but clasped us closer to her bosom kissed us anew for father s sake then told how the storm had distressed them Often had they hoped that we had reached the cabins too late to join the Relief then in grieving anguish felt that we had and might not live to cross the summit She had watched the fall of snow and measured its depth had seen it drift between the two camps making the way so treacherous that no one had dared to cross it until the day before her own coming then she induced mister Clark to try to ascertain if Messrs Cady and Stone had really got us to the cabins in time to go with the Second Relief We did not see mister Clark but he had peered in taken observations and returned by nightfall and described to her our condition John Baptiste had promised to care for father in her absence She left our tent in the morning as early as she could see the way She must have stayed with us over night for I went to sleep in her arms and they were still around me when I awoke and it seemed like a new day for we had time for many cherished talks She veiled from us the ghastliness of death telling us Aunt Betsy and both our little cousins had gone to heaven She said Lewis had been first to go and his mother had soon followed that she herself had carried little Sammie from his sick mother s tent to ours the very day we three were taken away and in order to keep him warm while the storm raged she had laid him close to father s side and that he had stayed with them until day before yesterday I asked her if Sammie had cried for bread She replied No he was not hungry for your mother saved two of those little biscuits which the relief party brought and every day she soaked a tiny piece in water and fed him all he would eat and there is still half a biscuit left How big that half biscuit seemed to me I wondered why she had not brought at least a part of it to us While she was talking with missus Murphy I could not get it out of my mind I could see that broken half biscuit with its ragged edges and knew that if I had a piece I would nibble off the rough points first The longer I waited the more I wanted it Finally I slipped my arm around mother s neck drew her face close to mine and whispered What are you going to do with the half biscuit you saved I am keeping it for your sick father she answered drawing me closer to her side laying her comforting cheek against mine letting my arm keep its place and my fingers stroke her hair The two women were still talking in subdued tones pouring the oil of sympathy into each others gaping wounds Neither heard the sound of feet on the snow above neither knew that the Third Relief Party was at hand until mister Eddy and mister Foster came down the steps and each asked anxiously of missus Murphy Where is my boy Each received the same sorrowful answer Dead CHAPTER XIV THE QUEST OF TWO FATHERS SECOND RELIEF IN DISTRESS THIRD RELIEF ORGANIZED AT WOODWORTH S RELAY CAMP DIVIDES AND ONE HALF GOES TO SUCCOR SECOND RELIEF AND ITS REFUGEES AND THE OTHER HALF PROCEEDS TO DONNER LAKE A LAST FAREWELL A WOMAN S SACRIFICE It will be remembered that mister Eddy being ill was dropped out of the First Relief at Mule Springs in February and sent back to Johnson s Ranch to await the return of this party which had promised to bring out his family Who can realize his distress when it returned with eighteen refugees and informed him that his wife and little Maggie had perished before it reached the camps and that it had been obliged to leave his baby there in care of missus Murphy Disappointed and aggrieved the afflicted father immediately set out on horseback hoping that he would meet his child on the trail in charge of the Second Relief which it seemed reasonable to expect would follow closely in the footsteps of the first He was accompanied by mister Foster of the Forlorn Hope who had been forced to leave his own little son at the camp in charge of missus Murphy its grandmother On the evening of the second day the two reached Woodworth s camp established as a relay station pursuant to the general plan of rescue originally adopted They found the midshipman in snug quarters with several men to do his bidding He explained that the lack of competent guides had prevented his venturing among the snow peaks Whereupon mister Eddy earnestly assured him that the trail of those who had already gone up outlined the way After much deliberation Woodworth and his men agreed to start out next morning for the mountain camps but tried to dissuade mister Eddy from accompanying them on account of his apparent depleted condition Nevertheless both he and mister Foster remained firm and with the party left the relay camp crossed the low foothills and encamped for the night on the Yuba River At dusk Woodworth was surprised by the arrival of two forlorn looking individuals whom he recognized as members of the Reed Greenwood Relief which had gone up the mountain late in February and was overdue The two implored food for themselves also for their seven companions and three refugees a mile back on the trail unable to come farther When somewhat refreshed they were able to go more into detail and the following explanation of their plight was elicited One of our men Clark is at Donner s Camp and the other nine of us left the cabins near the lake on the third of March with seventeen of the starving emigrants The storm caught us as we crossed the summit and ten miles below drove us into camp It got so bad and lasted so long that our provisions gave out and we almost froze to death cutting wood We all worked at keeping the fires until we were completely exhausted then seeing no prospects of help coming to us we left and made our way down here bringing Reed s two children and Solomon Hook who said he could and would walk The other fourteen that we brought over the summit are up there at what we call Starved Camp Some are dead the rest without food Woodworth and two followers went at once with provisions to the near by sufferers and later brought them down to camp Messrs Reed and Greenwood stated that every available means had been tried by them to get the seventeen unfortunates well over the summit before the great storm reached its height They said the physical condition of the refugees was such from the very start that no persuasion nor warnings nor threats could quicken their feeble steps All but three of the number were children with their hands and feet more or less frozen Worse still the caches on which the party had relied for sustenance had been robbed by wild animals and the severity of the storm had forced all into camp with nothing more than a breastwork of brush to shelter them missus Elisabeth Graves died the first night leaving to the party the hopeless task of caring for her emaciated babe in arms and her three other children between the ages of nine and five years Soon however the five year old followed his mother and the number of starving was again lessened on the third night when Isaac Donner went to sleep beside his sister and did not waken The storm had continued so furiously that it was impossible to bury the dead Days and nights were spent in steadfast struggling against the threatening inevitable before the party gave up and Greenwood and Reed taking the two Reed children and also Solomon Hook who walked started down the mountain hoping to save their own lives and perhaps get fresh men to complete the pitiful work which they had been forced to abandon When Messrs Reed and Greenwood closed their account of the terrible physical and mental strain their party had undergone mister Woodworth asked his own men of the relay camp if they would go with him to rescue those unfortunates at Starved Camp and received an answer in the negative ten The following morning there was an earnest consultation and so hazardous seemed the trail and the work to be done that for a time all except Eddy and Foster refused to go farther Finally John Stark stepped forward saying Gentlemen I am ready to go and do what I can for those sufferers without promise of pay Illustration ARRIVAL OF THE CARAVAN AT SANTA FE Illustration ON THE BANKS OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER By guaranteeing three dollars per day to any man who would get supplies to the mountain camps and fifty dollars in addition to each man who should carry a helpless child not his own back to the settlement mister Eddy eleven secured the services of Hiram Miller who had just come down with the Second Relief and mister Foster hired on the same terms mister Thompson from the relay camp mister Woodworth offered like inducements on Government account to the rest of his men and before the morning was far advanced with William H Eddy acting as leader William Foster Hiram Miller mister Thompson John Stark Howard Oakley and Charles Stone who had left us little ones at the lake camp shouldered their packs and began the ascent Meanwhile how fared it at Starved Camp mister and missus Breen being left there with their own five suffering children and the four other poor moaning little waifs were tortured by situations too heart rending for description too pitiful to seem true Suffice it to relate that missus Breen shared with baby Graves the last lump of loaf sugar and the last drops of tea of that which she had denied herself and had hoarded for her own babe When this was gone with quivering lips she and her husband repeated the litany and prayed for strength to meet the ordeal then turning to the unburied dead they resorted to the only means left to save the nine helpless little ones When mister Eddy and party reached them they found much suffering from cold and crying for something to eat but not the wail which precedes delirium and death This Third Relief Party settled for the night upon the snow near these refugees who had twice been in the shadow of doom and after giving them food and fire mister Eddy divided his force into two sections Messrs Stark Oakley and Stone were to remain there and nurture the refugees a few hours longer then carry the small children and conduct those able to walk to Mule Springs while Eddy and three companions should hasten on to the cabins across the summit twelve Section Two spurred on by paternal solicitude resumed travel at four o clock the following morning and crossed the summit soon after sunrise The nearer they approached camp the more anxious Messrs Eddy and Foster became to reach the children they hoped to find alive Finally they rushed ahead as we have seen to the Murphy cabin Alas only disappointment met them there Even after missus Murphy had repeated her pitiful answer Dead the afflicted fathers stood dazed and silent as if waiting for the loved ones to return mister Eddy was the first to recover sufficiently for action Presently Simon Murphy and we three little girls were standing on the snow under a clear blue sky and saw Hiram Miller and mister Thompson coming toward camp The change was so sudden it was difficult to understand what had happened How could we realize that we had passed out of that loathsome cabin never to return or that missus Murphy too ill to leave her bed and Keseberg too lame to walk by reason of a deep cleft in his heel made by an axe would have to stay alone in that abode of wretchedness Nor could we know our mother s anguish as she stepped aside to arrange with mister Eddy for our departure She had told us at our own camp why she would remain She had parted from us there and put us in charge of men who had risked much and come far to do a heroic deed Later she had found us abandoned by them in time of direst need and in danger of an awful death and had warmed and cheered us back to hope and confidence Now she was about to confide us to the care of a party whose leader swore either to save us or die with us on the trail We listened to the sound of her voice felt her good bye kisses and watched her hasten away to father over the snow through the pines and out of sight and knew that we must not follow But the influence of her last caress last yearning look of love and abiding faith will go with us through life The ordeal through which she passed is thus told by Colonel Thornton after a personal interview with mister Eddy missus George Donner was able to travel But her husband was in a helpless condition and she would not consent to leave him while he survived She expressed her solemn and unalterable purpose which no danger or peril could change to remain and perform for him the last sad office of duty and affection She manifested however the greatest solicitude for her children and informed mister Eddy that she had fifteen hundred dollars in silver all of which she would give him if he would save the lives of the children He informed her that he would not carry out one hundred dollars of all she had but that he would save her children or die in the effort The party had no provisions to leave for the sustenance of these unhappy unfortunate beings After remaining about two hours mister Eddy informed missus Donner that he was constrained by force of circumstances to depart It was certain that George Donner would never rise from the miserable bed upon which he had lain down worn by toil and wasted by famine A woman was probably never before placed in circumstances of greater or more peculiar trial but her duty and affection as a wife triumphed over all her instincts of reason The parting scene between parent and children is represented as being one that will never be forgotten so long as life remains or memory performs its functions My own emotions will not permit me to attempt a description which language indeed has not power to delineate It is sufficient to say that it was affecting beyond measure and that the last words uttered by missus Donner in tears and sobs to mister Eddy were Oh save save my children Footnote ten Extract from Thornton s work Footnote eleven Thornton saw Eddy pay Hiram Miller the promised fifty dollars after the Third Relief reached the settlement Footnote twelve See McGlashan s History of the Donner Party CHAPTER XV SIMON MURPHY FRANCES GEORGIA AND I TAKEN FROM THE LAKE CABINS BY THE THIRD RELIEF NO FOOD TO LEAVE CROSSING THE SNOW REMNANT OF THE SECOND RELIEF OVERTAKEN OUT OF THE SNOW INCIDENTS OF THE JOURNEY JOHNSON S RANCH THE SINCLAIR HOME SUTTER S FORT When we left the lake cabin we still wore the clothing we had on when we came from our tent with Messrs Cady and Stone Georgia and I were clad in quilted petticoats linsey dresses woollen stockings and well worn shoes Our cloaks were of a twilled material garnet with a white thread interwoven and we had knitted hoods to match Frances clothing was as warm instead of cloak however she wore a shawl and her hood was blue Her shoes had been eaten by our starving dog before he disappeared and as all others were buried out of reach mother had substituted a pair of her own in their stead mister Foster took charge of Simon Murphy his wife s brother and Messrs Eddy and Miller carried Georgia and me mister Eddy always called Georgia my girl and she found great favor in his eyes because in size and looks she reminded him of his little daughter who had perished in that storm bound camp Our first stop was on the mountain side overlooking the lake where we were given a light meal of bread and meat and a drink of water When we reached the head of the lake we overtook Nicholas Clark and John Baptiste who had deserted father in his tent and were hurrying toward the settlement Our coming was a surprise to them yet they were glad to join our party After our evening allowance of food we were stowed snugly between blankets in a snow trench near the summit of the Sierras but were so hungry that we could hardly get to sleep even after being told that more food would do us harm Early next morning we were again on the trail I could not walk at all and Georgia only a short distance at a time So treacherous was the way that our rescuers often stumbled into unseen pits struggled among snow drifts and climbed icy ridges where to slip or fall might mean death in the yawning depth below Near the close of this most trying day Hiram M Miller put me down saying wearily I am tired of carrying you If you will walk to that dark thing on the mountain side ahead of us you shall have a nice lump of loaf sugar with your supper My position in the blanket had been so cramped that my limbs were stiff and the jostling of the march had made my body ache I looked toward the object to which he pointed It seemed a long way off yet I wanted the sugar so much that I agreed to walk The wind was sharp I shivered and at times could hardly lift my feet often I stumbled and would have fallen had he not held my hand tightly as he half led half drew me onward I did my part however in glad expectation of the promised bit of sweetness The sun had set before we reached our landmark which was a felled and blackened tree selected to furnish fuel for our night fire When we children were given our evening allowance of food I asked for my lump of sugar and cried bitterly on being harshly told there was none for me Too disappointed and fretted to care for anything else I sobbed myself to sleep Nor did I waken happy next morning I had not forgotten the broken promise and was lonesome for mother When mister Miller told me that I should walk that day as far as Frances and Georgia did I refused to go forward and cried to go back The result was that he used rough means before I promised to be good and do as he commanded His act made my sister Frances rush to my defence and also touched a chord in the fatherly natures of the other two men who summarily brought about a more comfortable state of affairs When we proceeded on our journey I was again carried by mister Miller in a blanket on his back as young children are carried by Indians on long journeys My head above the blanket folds bobbed uncomfortably at every lurch The trail led up and down and around snow peaks and under overhanging banks that seemed ready to give way and crush us At one turn our rescuers stopped picked up a bundle and carefully noted the fresh human foot prints in the snow which indicated that a number of persons were moving in advance By our fire that night mister Eddy opened the bundle that we had found upon the snow and to the surprise of all Frances at once recognized in it the three silk dresses silver spoons small keepsakes and articles of children s clothing which mother had intrusted to the care of Messrs Cady and Stone The spoons and smaller articles were now stowed away in the pockets of our rescuers for safekeeping on the journey and while we little girls dressed ourselves in the fresh underwear and watched our discarded garments disappear in the fire the dresses which mother had planned should come to us later in life were remodelled for immediate use mister Thompson pulled out the same sharp pocket knife coarse black thread and big eyed needle which he had used the previous evening while making Frances a pair of moccasins out of his own gauntlet gloves With the help of mister Eddy he then ripped out the sleeves cut off the waists about an inch above the skirt gathers cut slits in the skirts for arm holes and tacked in the sleeves Then with mother s wish in mind they put the dove colored silk on Frances the light brown on Georgia and the dark coffee brown on me Pleats and laps in the skirt bands were necessary to fit them to our necks Strings were tied around our waists and the skirts tacked up until they were of walking length These ample robes served for cloaks as well as dresses for we could easily draw our hands back through the sleeves and keep our arms warm beneath the folds Thus comfortably clad we began another day s journey Before noon we overtook and passed Messrs Oakley Stone and Stark having in charge the following refugees from Starved Camp mister and missus Patrick Breen and their five children Mary Donner Jonathan Graves Nancy Graves and baby Graves Messrs Oakley and Stone were in advance the former carrying Mary Donner over his shoulder and the latter baby Graves in his arms Great hearted John Stark had the care of all the rest He was broad shouldered and powerful and would stride ahead with two weaklings at a time deposit them on the trail and go back for others who could not keep up These were the remnant of the hopeful seventeen who had started out on the third of March with the Second Relief and with whom mother had hoped we children would cross the mountains It was after dark when our own little party encamped at the crossing of the Yuba River The following morning Lieutenant Woodworth and attendants were found near by He commended the work done by the Third Relief yet to mister Eddy s dismay he declared that he would not go to the rescue of those who were still in the mountains because the warmer weather was melting the snow so rapidly that the lives of his men would be endangered should he attempt to lead them up the trail which we had just followed down He gave our party rations and said that he would at once proceed to Johnson s Ranch and from there send to Mule Springs the requisite number of horses to carry to the settlement the persons now on the trail Our party did not resume travel until ten o clock that morning nevertheless we crossed the snow line and made our next camp at Mule Springs There we caught the first breath of spring tide touched the warm dry earth and saw green fields far beyond the foot of that cold cruel mountain range Our rescuers exclaimed joyfully Thank God we are at last out of the snow and you shall soon see Elitha and Leanna and have all you want to eat Our allowance of food had been gradually increased and our improved condition bore evidence of the good care and kind treatment we had received We remained several days at Mule Springs and were comparatively happy until the arrival of the unfortunates from Starved Camp who stretched forth their gaunt hands and piteously begged for food which would have caused death had it been given to them in sufficient quantities to satisfy their cravings When I went among them I found my little cousin Mary sitting on a blanket near mister Oakley who had carried her thither and who was gently trying to engage her thoughts Her wan face was wet with tears and her hands were clasped around her knee as she rocked from side to side in great pain A large woollen stocking covered her swollen leg and frozen foot which had become numb and fallen into the fire one night at Starved Camp and been badly maimed before she awakened to feel the pain I wanted to speak to her but when I saw how lonesome and ill she looked something like pain choked off my words Her brother Isaac had died at that awful camp and she herself would not have lived had mister Oakley not been so good to her He was now comforting her with the assurance that he would have the foot cared for by a doctor as soon as they should reach the settlement and she believing him was trying to be brave and patient We all resumed travel on horseback and reached Johnson s Ranch about the same hour in the day As we approached the little colony of emigrants which had settled in the neighborhood the previous Autumn crowded in and about the two roomed adobe house which mister Johnson had kindly set apart as a stopping place for the several relief parties on their way to and from the mountains All were anxious to see the sufferers for whose rescue they had helped to provide Survivors of the Forlorn Hope and of the First Relief were also there awaiting the arrival of expected loved ones There Simon Murphy who came with us met his sisters and brother Mary Graves took from the arms of Charles Stone her slowly dying baby sister she received from the hands of John Stark her brother Jonathan and her sister Nancy and heard of the death of her mother and of her brother Franklin at Starved Camp That house of welcome became a house of mourning when Messrs Eddy and Foster repeated the names of those who had perished in the snows The scenes were so heart rending that I slipped out of doors and sat in the sunshine waiting for Frances and Georgia and thinking of her who had intrusted us to the care of God Before our short stay at the Johnson Ranch ended we little girls had a peculiar experience While standing in a doorway the door closed with a bang upon two of my fingers My piercing cry brought several persons to the spot and one among them sat down and soothed me in a motherly way After I was myself again she examined the dress into which Messrs Thompson and Eddy had stitched so much good will and she said Let me take off this clumsy thing and give you a little blue dress with white flowers on it She made the change and after she had fastened it in the back she got a needle and white thread and bade me stand closer to her so that she might sew up the tear which exposed my knees She asked why I looked so hard at her sewing and I replied My mother always makes little stitches when she sews my dresses No amount of pulling down of the sleeves or straightening out of the skirt could conceal the fact that I was too large for the garment As I was leaving her I heard her say to a companion That is just as good for her and this will make two for my little girl Later in the day Frances and Georgia parted with their silks and looked as forlorn as I in calico substitutes Oh the balm and beauty of that early morning when Messrs Eddy Thompson and Miller took us on horseback down the Sacramento Valley Under the leafy trees and over the budding blossoms we rode Not rapidly but steadily we neared our journey s end Toward night when the birds had stopped their singing and were hiding themselves among bush and bough we reached the home of mister and missus John Sinclair on the American River thirty five miles from Johnson s Ranch and only two and a half from Sutter s Fort That hospitable house was over crowded with earlier arrivals but as it was too late for us to cross the river sympathetic missus Sinclair said that she would find a place for us Having no bed to offer she loosened the rag carpet from one corner of the room had fresh straw put on the floor and after supper tucked us away on it drawing the carpet over us in place of quilts We had bread and milk for supper that night and the same good food next day In the afternoon we were taken across the river in an Indian canoe Then we followed the winding path through the tules to Sutter s Fort where we were given over to our half sisters by those heroic men who had kept their pledge to our mother and saved our lives CHAPTER XVI ELITHA AND LEANNA LIFE AT THE FORT WATCHING THE COW PATH RETURN OF THE FALLON PARTY KESEBERG BROUGHT IN BY THEM FATHER AND MOTHER DID NOT COME The room in which Elitha and Leanna were staying when we arrived at Sutter s Fort was part of a long low single story adobe building outside the fortification walls and like others that were occupied by belated travellers was the barest and crudest structure imaginable It had an earthen floor a thatched roof a batten door and an opening in the rear wall to serve as window We little ones were oblivious of discomfort however The tenderness with which we were received and the bewildering sense of safety that we felt blinded us even to the anguish and fear which crept over our two sisters when they saw us come to them alone How they suffered I learned many years later from Elitha who said in referring to those pitiful experiences After Sister Leanna and I reached the Fort with the First Relief we were put in different families to await our parents but as soon as the Second Relief was expected we went to housekeeping gathered wood and had everything ready No one came Then we waited and watched anxiously for the Third Relief and it was a sad sight to see you three and no more I went in kindled the fire and gave you supper I had a bed of shavings hemmed in with poles for father and mother They did not come We five lay down upon it and Sister Leanna and I talked long after you three were asleep wondering what we should do You had no clothes except those you wore so the next day I got a little cotton stuff and commenced making you some Sister Leanna did the cooking and looked after you which took all her time The United States Army officer at the Port had left orders at Captain Sutter s store that we should be furnished with the necessaries of life and that was how we were able to get the food and few things we had when you arrived Messrs Eddy and Thompson did not tell my sisters that they had no expectation of father s getting through and considered mother s chance very slight but went directly to the Fort to report to Colonel McKinstrey and to mister Kerns what their party had accomplished and to inform them that Lieutenant Woodworth was about to break camp and return to the settlement instead of trying to get relief to the four unfortunates still at the mountain camp Very soon thereafter a messenger on horseback from the Fort delivered a letter to Lieutenant Woodworth and a fourth party was organized consisting of John Stark John Rhodes E Coffeymier John Del Daniel Tucker Wm Foster and Wm Graves But this party proceeded no farther than Bear Valley on account of the rapidly melting snows thirteen The return of the party after its fruitless efforts was not made known to Elitha and Leanna nor were they aware that Thomas Fallon with six companions had set out for the mountain camps on the tenth of April Neither fear nor misgivings troubled us little ones the morning we started out hand in hand to explore our new surroundings We had rested been washed combed and fed and we believed that father and mother would soon come to us Everything was beautiful to our eyes We did not care if the houses did look as if they were made of dry dirt and hadn t anything but holes for windows We watched the mothers sitting on the door sills or on chairs near them laughing as they talked and sewed and it seemed good to see the little children at play and hear them singing their dolls to sleep The big gate to the adobe wall around Captain Sutter s home was open and we could look in and see many white washed huts built against the back and side walls and a flag waving from a pole in front of the large house which stood in the middle of the ground Cannons like those we had seen at Fort Laramie were also peeping out of holes in these walls and an Indian soldier and a white soldier were marching to and fro each holding a gun against his shoulder and it pointing straight up in the air Illustration ELITHA DONNER missus BENJAMIN WILDER Illustration LEANNA DONNER missus JOHN APP Illustration MARY DONNER Illustration GEORGE DONNER NEPHEW OF captain DONNER Often we looked at each other and exclaimed How good to be here instead of up in the snow It was hard to go back to the house when sisters called us I do not remember the looks or the taste of anything they gave us to eat We were so eager to stay out in the sunshine Before long we went to that dreary bare room only to sleep Many of the women at the Fort were kind to us gave us bread from their scant loaves not only because we were destitute but because they had grateful recollection of those whose name we bore Once a tall freckle faced boy with very red hair edged up to where I was watching others at play and whispered See here little gal you run get that little tin cup of yourn and when you see me come out of missus Wimmer s house with the milk pail on my arm you go round yonder to the tother side of the cow pen where you ll find a hole big enough to put the cup through Then you can watch me milk it full of the nicest milk you ever tasted You needn t say nothing to nobody about it I give your little sister some last time and I want to do the same for you I hain t got no mother neither and I know how it is When I got there he took the cup and as he sat down under old Bossy smilingly asked if I liked lots of foam I told him I did He milked a faster stronger stream then handed me the cup full as he could carry it and a white cap of foam stood above its rim I tasted it and told him it was too good to drink fast but he watched me until it was all gone Then saying he didn t want thanks he hurried me back to the children I never saw that boy again but have ever been grateful for his act of pure kindness Every day or two a horse all white with lather and dripping with sweat would rush by and the Indian or white man on his back would guide him straight to Captain Kerns quarters where he would hand out papers and letters The women and children would flock thither to see if it meant news for them Often they were disappointed and talked a great deal about the tediousness of the Mexican War and the delays of Captain Fremont s company They wanted the war to end and their men folk back so that they could move and get to farming before it should be too late to grow garden truck for family use While they thus anxiously awaited the return of their soldiers we kept watch of the cow path by which we had reached the Fort for Elitha had told us that we might pretty soon see the relief coming She did not say with father and mother but we did and she replied I hope so We were very proud of the new clothes she had made us but the first time she washed and hung them out to dry they were stolen and we were again destitute Sister Elitha thought perhaps strange Indians took them In May the Fallon party arrived with horses laden with many packs of goods but their only refugee was Lewis Keseberg from the cabin near the lake It was evening and some one came to our door spoke to Elitha and Leanna in low tones and went away My sisters turned put their arms about us and wept bitterly Then gently compassionately the cruel desolating truth was told Ah how could we believe it No anxious watching no weary waiting would ever bring father and mother to us again Footnote thirteen Thornton CHAPTER XVII ORPHANS KESEBERG AND HIS ACCUSERS SENSATIONAL ACCOUNTS OF THE TRAGEDY AT DONNER LAKE PROPERTY SOLD AND GUARDIAN APPOINTED KINDLY INDIANS GRANDPA MARRIAGE OF ELITHA The report of our affliction spread rapidly and the well meaning tender hearted women at the Fort came to condole and weep with us and made their children weep also by urging Now do say something comforting to these poor little girls who were frozen and starved up in the mountains and are now orphans in a strange land without any home or any one to care for them Such ordeals were too overwhelming I would rush off alone among the wild flowers to get away from the torturing sympathy Even there I met those who would look at me with great serious eyes shake their heads and mournfully say You poor little mite how much better it would be if you had died in the mountains with your dear mother instead of being left alone to struggle in this wicked world This would but increase my distress for I did not want to be dead and buried up there under the cold deep snow and I knew that mother did not want me to be there either Had she not sent me away to save me and asked God our Heavenly Father to take care of me Intense excitement and indignation prevailed at the Fort after Captain Fallon and other members of his party gave their account of the conditions found at the mountain camps and of interviews had with Keseberg whom they now called cannibal robber and murderer The wretched man was accused by this party not only of having needlessly partaken of human flesh and of having appropriated coin and other property which should have come to us orphaned children but also of having wantonly taken the life of missus Murphy and of my mother 
2691_156745_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Some declared him crazy others called him a monster 
none	none	Keseberg denied these charges and repeatedly accused Fallon and his party of making false statements He sadly acknowledged that he had used human flesh to keep himself from starving but swore that he was guiltless of taking human life He stated that missus Murphy had died of starvation soon after the departure of the Third Relief and that my mother had watched by father s bedside until he died After preparing his body for burial she had started out on the trail to go to her children 
2691_156745_000008_000005	train-clean-100	In attempting to cross the distance from her camp to his she had strayed and wandered about far into the night and finally reached his cabin wet shivering and grief stricken yet determined to push onward 
none	none	She had brought nothing with her but told him where to find money to take to her children in the event of her not reaching them 
2691_156745_000008_000007	train-clean-100	He stated that he offered her food which she refused 
none	none	He then attempted to persuade her to wait until morning and while they were talking she sank upon the floor completely exhausted and he covered her with blankets and made a fire to warm her In the morning he found her cold in death Keseberg s vehement and steadfast denial of the crimes of which he stood accused saved him from personal violence but not from suspicion and ill will Women shunned him and children stoned him as he walked about the fort The California Star printed in full the account of the Fallon party and blood curdling editorials increased public sentiment against Keseberg stamping him with the mark of Cain and closing the door of every home against him fourteen Elitha and Leanna tried to keep us little ones in ignorance of the report that our father s body was mutilated also of what was said about the alleged murder of our mother Still we did hear fragments of conversations which greatly disturbed us and our sisters found it difficult to answer some of our questions Meanwhile more disappointments for us were brewing at the fort Fallon s party demanded an immediate settlement of its claim It had gone up the mountains under promise that its members should have not only a per diem as rescuers but also one half of all the property that they might bring to the settlement and they had brought valuable packs from the camps of the Donners Captain Fallon also had two hundred and twenty five dollars in gold coin taken from concealment on Keseberg s person and two hundred and seventy five dollars additional taken from a cache that Keseberg had disclosed after the Captain had partially strangled him and otherwise brutally treated him to extort information of hidden treasure Keseberg did not deny that this money belonged to the Donners but asserted that it was his intention and desire to take it to the Donner children himself as he had promised their mother Eventually it was agreed that the Donner properties should be sold at auction and that one half of the proceeds should be handed over to Captain Fallon to satisfy the claims of his party and the other half should be put into the hands of a guardian for the support of the Donner children Hiram Miller was appointed guardian by Alcalde Sinclair Notwithstanding these plans for our well being unaccountable delays followed making our situation daily more trying Elitha was not yet fifteen years of age and Leanna was two years younger They had not fully recovered from the effects of their long privations and physical sufferings in the mountains and the loss of parents and means of support placed upon them responsibilities greater than they could carry no matter how bravely they strove to meet the situation How can we provide for ourselves and these little sisters was a question which haunted them by night and perplexed them by day They had no way of communicating with our friends in Eastern States and the women at the Fort could ill afford to provide longer for us since their bread winners were still with Fremont and their own supplies were limited Finally my two eldest sisters were given employment by different families in exchange for food which they shared with us but it was often insufficient and we little ones drifted along forlornly 
2691_156745_000016_000002	train-clean-100	Sometimes home was where night overtook us 
none	none	Often we trudged to the rancheria beyond the pond made by the adobe moulders who had built the houses and wall surrounding the fort There the Indian mothers were good to us They gave us shreds of smoked fish and dried acorns to eat lowered from their backs the queer little baby beds called bickooses and made the chubby faces in them laugh for our amusement They also let us pet the dogs that perked up their ears and wagged their tails as our own Uno used to do when he wanted to frolic Sometimes they stroked our hair and rubbed the locks between their fingers then felt their own as if to note the difference They seemed sorry because we could not understand their speech The pond also with its banks of flowers winding path and dimpling waters had charms for us until one day s experience drove us from it forever We three were playing near it when a joyous Indian girl with a bundle of clothes on her head ran down the bank to the water s edge We following watched her drop her bundle near a board that sloped from a rock into nature s tub then kneel upon the upper end and souse the clothes merrily up and down in the clear water She lathered them with a freshly gathered soap root and cleansed them according to the ways of the Spanish mission teachers As she tied the wet garments in a bundle and turned to carry them to the drying ground Frances espied some loose yellow poppies floating near the end of the board and lay down upon it for the purpose of catching them Georgia and I saw her lean over and stretch out her hand as far as she could reach saw the poppies drift just beyond her finger tips saw her lean a little farther then slip head first into the deep water Such shrieks as terrified children give brought the Indian girl quickly to our aid 
2691_156745_000019_000002	train-clean-100	Like a flash she tossed the bundle from her head sprang into the water snatched Frances as she rose to the surface and restored her to us without a word 
2691_156745_000019_000003	train-clean-100	Before we had recovered sufficiently to speak she was gone 
none	none	Not a soul was in sight when we started toward the Fort all unconscious of what the inevitable is to be was weaving into our lives We were too young to keep track of time by calendar but counted it by happenings Some were marked with tears some with smiles and some stole unawares upon us just as on that bright June evening when we did not find our sisters and aimlessly followed others to the little shop where a friendly appearing elderly man was cutting slices of meat and handing them to customers We did not know his name nor did we realize that he was selling the meat he handed out only that we wanted some So after all the others had gone we addressed him asking
2691_156745_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Grandpa please give us a little piece of meat 
none	none	He looked at us and inquired whose children we were and where we lived 
2691_156745_000023_000001	train-clean-100	Upon learning he turned about lifted a liver from a wooden peg and cut for each a generous slice 
none	none	On our way out a neighbor intercepted us and said that we should sleep at her house that night and see our sisters in the morning She also gave us permission to cook our pieces of liver over her bed of live coals Frances offered to cook them all on her stick but Georgia and I insisted that it would be fun for each to broil her own I being the smallest child was given the shortest stick and allowed to stand nearest the fire Soon the three slices were sizzling and browning from the ends of three willow rods and smelled so good that we could hardly wait for them to be done Presently however the heat began to burn my cheeks and also the hand that held the stick The more I wiggled about the hotter the fire seemed and it ended in Frances having to fish my piece of liver from among the coals burned in patches curled over bits of dying embers and pretty well covered with ashes but she knew how to scrape them away and my supper was not spoiled Our neighbor gave us breakfast next morning and spruced us up a bit then led us to the house where a number of persons had gathered most of them sitting at table laughing and talking and among them Elitha and Leanna Upon our entrance the merriment ceased and all eyes were turned inquiringly toward us Some one pointed to him who sat beside our eldest sister and gayly said Look at your new brother Another asked How do you like him We gazed around in silent amazement until a third continued teasingly She is no longer Elitha Donner but missus Perry McCoon You have lost your sister for her husband will take her away with him Lost your sister Those harrowing words stirred our pent feelings to anguish so keen that he who had uttered them in sport was touched with pity by the pain they caused Tears came also to the child wife s eyes as she clasped her arms about us soothingly assuring us that she was still our sister and would care for us Nevertheless she and her husband slipped away soon on horseback and we were told that we were to stay at our neighbor s until they returned for us This marriage which was solemnized by Alcalde John Sinclair on the fourth of June eighteen forty seven was approved by the people at the Fort Children were anxious to play with us because we had a married sister and a new brother Women hurried through noon chores to meet outside and some in their eagerness forgot to roll down their sleeves before they began to talk One triumphantly repeated to each newcomer the motherly advice which she gave the young couple when she first noticed his affection for that sorrowing girl who is too pretty to be in this new country without a protector They also recalled how Perry McCoon s launch had brought supplies up the river for the Second Relief to take over the mountains and how finally he himself had carried to the bereaved daughter the last accounts from Donner Camp Then the speakers wondered how soon Elitha would be back Would she take us three to live with her on that cattle ranch twenty five miles by bridle trail from the Fort And would peace and happiness come to us there Footnote fourteen See Appendix for account of the Fallon party quoted from Thornton s work CHAPTER XVIII GRANDMA HAPPY VISITS A NEW HOME AM PERSUADED TO LEAVE IT We were still without Elitha when up the road and toward the Fort came a stout little old woman in brown On one arm she carried a basket and from the hand of the other hung a small covered tin pail Her apron was almost as long as her dress skirt which reached below her ankles yet was short enough to show brown stockings above her low shoes Two ends of the bright kerchief which covered her neck and crossed her bosom were pinned on opposite sides at the waist line A brown quilted hood of the same shade and material as her dress and apron concealed all but the white lace frill of a grandma cap which fastened under her chin with a bow Her dark hair drawn down plain to each temple was coiled there into tiny wheels and a brass pin stuck through crosswise to hold each coil in place Her bright speaking eyes more brown than gray gave charm to a face which might have been pretty had disease not marred it in youth As she drew near her wonderful eyes looked into our faces and won from our lips a timid Good morning grandma That title which we had been taught to use when speaking to the aged was new and sweet to her who had never been blessed with child She set the basket on the ground put the pail beside it and caressed us in a cheery way then let us peep in and see what she had brought especially for us How did it happen That is something we were to learn later Such luxuries eggs bread butter cheese and milk in the dear little tin pail Seeing how thin and hungry we looked she gave each a piece of buttered bread before going with us to our neighbor s house where she left the food with instructions in broken English that it was for us three little girls who had called her grandma and that we must not be given too much at a time When next grandma came she took puny Georgia home with her and left me hugging the promise that I also should have a visit if I would await my turn patiently Who can picture my delight when Georgia got back and told me of all she had seen Cows horses pigs and chickens but most thrilling of all was about the cross old sheep which would not let her pass if she did not carry a big stick in sight Still I should not have been so eager to go nor so gleeful on the way had I known that the good bye kiss I gave my sister Frances at parting that day would be the last kiss in five long years Grandma was as happy as I She could understand English better than she could speak it and in answering my questions explained largely by signs Courage her gray poodle left deep footprints in the dust as he trotted ahead over the well known road and I felt an increasing affection for him upon learning that he too had crossed the plains in an emigrant wagon and had reached the Fort at about the same time I had reached the snow He was so small that I imagined he must have been a wee baby dog when he started and that he was not yet half grown My surprise and admiration quickened beyond expression when grandma assured me that he could do many tricks understood French and German and was learning English Then she laughed and explained that he was thus accomplished because she and Christian Brunner her husband and Jacob her brother in law had come from a place far away across lands and big waters where most of the people spoke both French and German and that they had always talked to Courage in one or the other of these languages As soon as we got into the house she opened the back door and called Jacob Then turning she took a small cup of rennet clabber from the shelf poured a little cream over it put a spoon in it and set it on the table before me While I was eating a pleasant elderly man came in and by nods motions and words partly English and partly something else convinced me that he liked little girls and was glad to see me Then of a sudden he clasped his hands about my waist and tossed me in the air as father did before his hand was hurt and when he wanted to startle me and then hear me laugh This act which brought back loving memories made Jacob seem nearer to me nearer still when he told me I must not call him anything but Jakie Everything about the house was as Georgia had described Even the big stick she had used to keep the old sheep from butting her over was behind the door where she had left it When Christian Brunner got home from the Fort grandma had supper nearly ready and he and I were friends the instant we looked into each other s face for he was grandpa who had given us the liver the evening we did not find our sisters He had gone home that night and said Mary at the Fort are three hungry little orphan girls Take them something as soon as you can One child is fair two are dark You will know them by the way they speak to you Grandpa had now hastened home to hold me on his lap and to hear me say that I was glad to be at his house and intended to help grandma all I could for being so good as to bring me there After I told how we had cooked the liver and how good it tasted he wiped his eyes and said Mine child when you little ones thanked me for that liver it made me not so much your friend as when you called me grandpa As time went on grandma declared that I helped her a great deal because I kept her chip box full shooed the hens out of the house brought in the eggs and drove the little chicks to bed nights I don t recollect that I was ever tired or sleepy yet I know that the night must have sped between the time of my last nod at the funny shadow picture of a rabbit which Jakie made hop across the wall behind the lighted candle and Courage s barking near my pillow which grandma said meant Good morning little girl It was after one of these reminders of a new day that I saw Leanna I don t know when or how she came but I missed Frances and Georgia the more because I wanted them to share our comforts Nevertheless a strange feeling of uneasiness crept over me as I noticed later that grandpa lingered and that the three spoke long in their own tongue and glanced often toward me Finally grandpa and Jakie went off in the wagon and grandma also disappeared but soon returned dressed for a trip to the Fort and explained that she had heard that Georgia was sick and she would take me back and bring her in my place I had known from the beginning that I was to stay only a little while yet I was woefully disturbed at having my enjoyment so abruptly terminated My first impulse was to cry but somehow the influence of her who under the soughing pines of the Sierras had told me that friends do not come quickly to a cry baby child gave me courage and I looked up into the dear old face before me and with the earnestness of an anxious child asked Grandma why can t you keep two of us She looked at me hesitated then replied I will see She kissed away my fears and rode off on old Lisa I did not know that she would ride farther than the fort and imagined she had gone on horseback so that she might the easier bring back my little sister Leanna washed the dishes and did the other work before she joined me in watching for grandma s return At last she came in sight and I ran up the road craning my neck to see if Georgia were really behind on old Lisa s back and when I saw her pinched face aglow with smiles that were all for me I had but one wish and that was to get my arms around her One chair was large enough to hold us both when we got into the house and the big clock on the wall with long weights reaching almost to the floor and red roses painted around its white face did not tick long before we were deaf to its sound telling each other about the doings of the day She knew more than I who listened intently as she excitedly went on Me and Frances started to find you this morning but we wasn t far when we met Jacob in the wagon and he stopped and asked us where we was going We told him Then he told us to get in by him But he didn t come this way just drove down to the river and some men lifted us out and set us in a boat and commenced to paddle across the water I knew that wasn t the way and I cried and cried as loud as I could cry and told them I wanted to go to my little sister Eliza and that I d tip the boat over if they did not take me back and one man said It s too bad It ain t right to part the two littlest ones And they told me if I d sit still and stop crying they would bring me back with them by and by and that I should come to you And I minded Then they taked us to that house where we sleeped under the carpet the night we didn t get to the Fort Don t you remember Well lots of people was there and talked about us and about father and mother and waited for grandma to come Pretty soon grandma come and everybody talked and talked And grandma told them she was sorry for us and would take you and me if she could keep Leanna to help her do the work When I was coming away with grandma Frances cried like everything She said she wanted to see you and told the people mother said we should always stay together But they wouldn t let her come They ve gived her to somebody else and now she is their little girl We both felt sorry for Frances and wished we could know where she was and what she was doing While we were talking grandma kept busily at work and sometimes she wiped her face with the corner of her apron yet we did not think of her as listening nor of watching us nor would we ever have known it had we not learned it later from her own lips as she told others the circumstances which had brought us into her life Some days later Georgia and I were playing in the back yard when Leanna appeared at the door and called out in quick jubilant tones Children run around to the front and see who has come True enough hitched to a stake near the front door was a bay horse with white spots on his body and a white stripe down his face and tied to the pommel of his saddle was another horse with a side saddle on its back It did not take us long to get into the house where we found Elitha and our new brother who had come to arrange about taking us away with them While Elitha was talking to grandma and Leanna Georgia stood listening but I sat on my new brother s knee and heard all about his beautiful spotted horse and a colt of the same colors Elitha could not persuade Leanna or Georgia to go with her nor was I inclined to do so when she and grandma first urged me But I began to yield as the former told me she was lonesome wanted at least one little sister to live with her and that if I would be that one I should have a new dress and a doll with a face Then my new brother settled the matter by saying Listen to me If you ll go you shall have the pinto colt that I told you about a little side saddle of your own and whenever you feel like it you can get on it and ride down to see all the folks The prospects were so alluring that I went at once with Leanna who was to get me ready for the journey Leanna did not share my enthusiasm She said I was a foolish little thing and declared I would get lonesome on such a big place so far away that the colt would kick me if I tried to go near it and that no one ever made saddles for colts She was not so gentle as usual when she combed my hair and gave my face a right hard scrubbing with a cloth and whey which grandma bade her use because it makes the skin so nice and soft Notwithstanding these discouragements I took my clothes which were tied up in a colored handkerchief kissed them all good bye and rode away sitting behind my new brother on the spotted horse really believing that I should be back in a few days on a visit CHAPTER XIX ON A CATTLE RANCH NEAR THE COSUMNE RIVER NAME BILLY INDIAN GRUB FEAST We left the Fort and grandma s house far behind and still rode on and on The day was warm the wild flowers were gone and the plain was yellow with ripening oats which rustled noisily as we passed through crowding and bumping their neighborly heads together Yet it was not a lonesome way for we passed elk antelope and deer feeding with pretty little fawns standing close to their mothers sides There were also sleek fat cattle resting under the shade of live oak trees and great birds that soared around overhead casting their shadows on the ground As we neared the river smaller birds of brighter colors could be heard and seen in the trees along the banks where the water flowed between clear and cold All these things my sister pointed out to me as we passed onward It was almost dark before we came in sight of the adobe ranch house We were met on the road by a pack of Indian dogs whose fierce looks and savage yelping made me tremble until I got into the house where they could not follow The first weeks of my stay on the ranch passed quickly Elitha and I were together most of the time She made my new dress and a doll which was perfection in my eyes though its face was crooked and its pencilled hair was more like pothooks than curls I did not see much of her husband because in the mornings he rode away early to direct his Indian cattle herders at the rodeos or to oversee other ranch work and I was often asleep when he returned nights The pinto colt he had promised me was as Leanna had said big enough to kick but too small to ride and I at once realized that my anticipated visits could not be made as planned Occasionally men came on horseback to stay a day or two and before the summer was over a young couple with a small baby moved into one part of our house We called them mister and missus Packwood and Baby Packwood The mother and child were company for my sister while the husbands talked continually of ranches cattle hides and tallow so I was free to roam around by myself In one of my wanderings I met a sprightly little Indian lad whose face was almost as white as my own He was clad in a blue and white shirt that reached below his knees Several strings of beads were around his neck and a small bow and arrow in his hand We stopped and looked at each other were pleased yet shy about moving onward or speaking I being the larger finally asked What s your name To my great delight he answered Name Billy While we were slowly getting accustomed to each other a good natured elderly squaw passed She wore a tattered petticoat and buttons pieces of shell and beads of bird bones dangled from a string around her neck A band of buckskin covered her forehead and was attached to strips of rawhide which held in place the water tight basket hanging down her back Billy now left me for her and I followed the two to that part of our yard where the tall ash hopper stood which ever after was like a story book to me The squaw set the basket on the ground reached up and carefully lifted from a board laid across the top of the hopper several pans of clabbered milk which she poured into the basket Instead of putting the pans back she tilted them up against the hopper squatted down in front and with her slim forefinger scraped down the sides and bottom of each pan so that she and Billy could scoop up and convey to their mouths by means of their three crooked fingers all that had not gone into the basket Then she licked her improvised spoon clean and dry turned her back to her burden replaced the band on her forehead and with the help of her stick slowly raised herself to her feet and quietly walked away Billy after her Next day I was on watch early My kind friend the choreman let me go with him when he carried the lye from the hopper to the soap fat barrel Then he put more ashes on the hopper and set the pans of milk in place for the evening call of Billy and his companion Illustration PAPOOSES IN BICKOOSES Illustration SUTTER S MILL WHERE MARSHALL DISCOVERED GOLD JANUARY nineteen eighteen forty eight He pointed out the rancheria by the river where the Indian herders lived with others of their tribe among them Billy and his mother He also informed me that the squaws took turns in coming for the milk and that Billy came as often as he got the chance that he was a nice little fellow who had learned a few English words from his white papa who had gone off and left him Billy and I might never have played together as we did if my brother in law had not taken his wife to San Francisco and left me in the care of mister and missus Packwood Their chief aim in life was to please their baby She was a dear little thing when awake but the house had to be kept very still while she slept and they would raise a hand and say Hu sh as they left me and together tip toed to the cradle to watch her smile in her sleep I had their assurance that they would like to let me hold her if her little bones were not so soft that I might break them They were never unkind or cross to me I had plenty to eat and clean clothes to wear but they did not seem to realize how I yearned for some one to love So I went to mister Choreman He told me about the antelope that raced across the ranch before I was up of the elk deer bear and buffalo he had shot in his day and of beaver otter and other animals that he had trapped along the rivers Entranced with his tales I became as excited as he while listening to the dangers he had escaped One day he showed me a little chair which I declared was the cunningest thing I had ever seen It had a high straight back just like those in the house only that it was smaller The seat was made of strips of rawhide woven in and out so that it looked like patchwork squares He let me sit on it and say how beautiful it was before telling me that he had made it all for me I was so delighted that I jumped up clasped it in my arms and looked at him in silent admiration I do not believe that he could understand how rich and grateful I felt although he shook his head saying You are not a bit happier than I was while making it for you nor can you know how much good it does me to have you around Gradually Billy spent more time near the ranch house and learned many of my kind of words and I picked up some of his Before long he discovered that he could climb up on the hopper and then he helped me up But I could not crook my fingers into as good a spoon as he did his and he got more milk out of the pan than I We did not think any one saw us yet the next time we climbed up we found two old spoons stuck in a crack in plain sight After we got through using them I wiped them on my dress skirt and put them back Later I met mister Choreman who told me that he had put the spoons there because I was too nice a little girl to eat as Billy did or to dip out of the same pan I was ashamed and promised not to do so again nor to climb up there with him As time passed I watched wistfully for my sister s return and thought a great deal about the folks at grandma s I tried to remember all that had happened while I was there and felt sure they were waiting for me to pay the promised visit A great longing often made me rush out behind a large tree near the river where no one could see or hear me feel sorry for myself and where I would wonder if God was taking care of the others and did not know where I lived I still feel the wondrous thrill and bid my throbbing heart beat slower when I recall the joy that tingled through every part of my being on that evening when unexpectedly Leanna and Georgia came to the door Yet so short lived was that joy that the event has always seemed more like a disquieting dream than a reality for they came at night and were gone in the morning and left me sorrowing A few months ago I wrote to Georgia now missus Babcock who lives in the State of Washington for her recollections of that brief reunion and she replied Before we went to Sonoma with Grandma Brunner in the Fall of eighteen forty seven Leanna and I paid you a visit We reached your home at dusk mister McCoon and Elitha were not there We were so glad to meet but our visit was too short You and I were given a cup of bread and milk and sent to bed Leanna ate with the grown folks who upon learning that we had only come to say good bye told her we must for your sake get away before you awoke next morning We arose and got started early but had only gone a short distance when we heard your pitiful cry begging us to take you with us Leanna hid her face in her apron while a man caught you and carried you back I think she cried all the way home It was so hard to part from you mister Packwood carried me into the house and both he and his wife felt sorry for me My head ached and the tears would come as often as any one looked at me missus Packwood wet a piece of brown paper laid it on my forehead and bade me lie on my bed until I should feel better I could not eat or play and even mister Choreman s bright stories had lost their charm Come look see squaw papoose Me go you go exclaimed Billy excitedly one soft gray morning after I had regained my spirits I turned in the direction he pointed and saw quite a number of squaws trudging across an open flat with babies in bickooses and larger children scampering along at various paces most of them carrying baskets With missus Packwood s permission Billy and I sped away to join the line I had never been granted such a privilege before and had no idea what it all meant As we approached the edge of the marsh the squaws walked more slowly with their eyes fixed upon the ground Every other moment some of them would be down digging in the earth with forefinger or a little stick and I soon learned they were gathering bulbs about a quarter of an inch in thickness and as large around as the smaller end of a woman s thimble I had seen the plants growing near the pond at the fort but now the bulbs were ripe and were being gathered for winter use In accordance with the tribal custom not a bulb was eaten during harvest time They grew so far apart and were so small that it took a long while to make a fair showing in the baskets When no more bulbs could be found the baskets were put on the ground in groups and the mothers carefully leaned their bickooses against them in such positions that the wide awake papooses could look out from under their shades and smile and sputter at each other in quaint Indian baby talk and the sleeping could sleep on undisturbed That done the squaws built a roaring fire and one of them untied a bundle of hardwood sticks which she had brought for the purpose and stuck them around under the fuel in touch with the hottest parts of the burning mass When the ends glowed like long lasting coals the waiting crowd snatched them from their bed and rushed into the low thicket which grew in the marsh I followed with my fire brand but not knowing what to do with it simply watched the Indians stick theirs into the bushes sometimes high up sometimes low down I saw them dodge about and heard their shouts of warning and their peals of laughter Then myriads of hornets came buzzing and swarming about This frightened me so that I ran back to where the brown babies were cooing in safety Empty handed but happy they at length returned and though I could not understand anything they were saying their looks and actions betokened what a good time they had had Years later I described the scene to Elitha who assured me that I had been highly favored by those Indians for they had permitted me to witness their annual Grub Feast The Piutes always use burning fagots to drive hornets and other stinging insects from their nests and they also use heat in opening the comb cells so that they can easily remove the larvae which they eat without further preparation With the first cold snaps of winter my feet felt the effect of former frost bites and I was obliged to spend most of my time within doors Fortunately Baby Packwood had grown to be quite a frolicsome child She was fond of me and her bones had hardened so that there was no longer danger of my breaking them when I lifted her or held her on my lap Her mother had also discovered that I was anxious to be helpful pleased when given something to do and proud when my work was praised I was quite satisfied with my surroundings when unexpectedly mister McCoon brought my sister back and once more we had happy times together CHAPTER XX I RETURN TO GRANDMA WAR RUMORS AT THE FORT LINGERING HOPE THAT MY MOTHER MIGHT BE LIVING AN INDIAN CONVOY THE BRUNNERS AND THEIR HOME The Spring of eighteen forty eight was at hand when my brother in law said to me Grandma Brunner wants you to come back to her and if you would like to go I ll take you to the Fort as soon as the weather changes and leave you with the people who are getting ready to move north and are willing to take you with them to Sonoma where grandma now lives The storm was not over but the day was promising when my bundle of clothes was again on the pommel of the saddle and I ready to begin my journey I was so excited that I could hardly get around to say good bye to those who had gathered to see me off We returned by the same route that we had followed out on that warm June day but everything seemed different The catkins on the willows were forming and the plain was green with young grass As we neared the Fort we passed a large camp of fine looking Indians who I was told were the friendly Walla Wallas that came every spring to trade ponies and otter and beaver skins with Captain Sutter for provisions blankets beads gun caps shot and powder A large emigrant wagon stood near the adobe house where my new brother in law drew rein Before dismounting he reached back took me by the arm and carefully supported me as I slid from the horse to the ground I was so stiff that I could hardly stand but he led me to the door where we were welcomed by a good natured woman to whom he said Well missus Lennox you see I ve brought the little girl I don t think she ll be much trouble unless she talks you to death Then he told her that I had during the ride asked him more questions than a man six times his size could answer But she laughed and lowed that I couldn t match either of her three boys in asking questions and then informed him that she did not calculate on making the move until the roads be dryer and the weather settled She promised however that I should have good care until I could be handed over to the Brunners After a few words with her in private Perry McCoon bade me good bye and passed out of my life forever I was now again with emigrants who had crossed the plains in eighteen forty six but who had followed the Fort Hall route and so escaped the misfortunes that befell the Donner Party Supper over missus Lennox made me a bed on the floor in the far corner of the room I must have fallen asleep as soon as my head touched the pillow for I remember nothing more until I was awakened by voices and saw the candle still burning and missus Lennox and two men and a woman sitting near the table The man speaking had a shrill voice and his words were so terrifying that I shook all over my hair felt as though it were trying to pull itself out by its roots a cold sweat dampened my clothes I was afraid to move or to turn my eyes Listening I tried to remember how many Indians he was talking about I knew it must be a great many for it was such a long word After they went away and the house was dark I still seemed to see his excited manner and to hear him say missus Lennox we ve got to get out of here right away for I heard tell at the store before I come up that there s bound to be an Injun outbreak Them savages from Sonora are already on their way up and they ll kill and scalp every man woman and child they can ketch and there s nothing to keep them from ketching us if we stay at this here little fort any longer I lay awake a long while I did not dare call out because I imagined some of those Indians might have got ahead of the rest and be sneaking up to our house at that very moment I wondered where I could hide if they should climb through the window and I felt that Georgia would never know what had become of me if they should kill and scalp me As soon as missus Lennox stirred in the morning I ran to her and had a good cry She threatened all sorts of things for the man who had caused me such torture and declared that he believed everything he heard He did not seem to remember how many hundred miles away Sonora was nor how many loaded cannon there were at the Fort I felt better satisfied however when she told me that she had made up her mind to start for Sonoma the next day After breakfast her younger boys wanted to see the Walla Wallas and took me along A cold breath from the Sierra Nevadas made me look up and shiver Soon Captains Sutter and Kern passed us the former on his favorite white horse and the latter on a dark bay I was delighted to catch a glimpse of those two good friends but they did not know it They had been to see the Indian ponies and before we got to the big gate they had gone in and the Walla Wallas were forming in line on both sides of the road between the gate and the front of the store Only two Indians at a time were allowed to enter the building and as they were slow in making their trades we had a good chance to see them all The men the boys and most of the women were dressed in fringed buckskin suits and their hands and faces were painted red as the Sioux warriors of Fort Laramie painted their cheeks The Lennox boys took greatest interest in the little fellows with the bows and arrows but I could not keep my eyes from the young princess who stood beside her father the chief She was all shimmering with beads They formed flowers on her moccasins fringed the outer seams of her doeskin trousers and the hem of her tunic formed a stripe around her arm holes and her belt glittered on a band which held in place the eagle plume in her hair dangled from her ears and encircled her neck and arms Yet she did not seem to wear one too many She looked so winsome and picturesque that I have never forgotten the laughing pretty picture We started back over ground where my little sisters and I had wandered the previous Spring The people whom I remembered had since gone to other settlements and strangers lived in the old huts I could not help looking in as we passed for I still felt that mother might not be dead She might have come down the mountain alone and perhaps I could find her The boys not knowing why I lagged behind tried to hurry me along and finally left me to go home by myself This not from unkindness but rather love of teasing and also oblivion of the vain hope I cherished missus Lennox let me dry the dishes for her after the noon meal then sent me to visit the neighbor in the next house while she should stow her things in the wagon and get ready for the journey I loved this lady fifteen in the next house as soon as she spoke to me and I was delighted with her baby who reached out his little arms to have me take him and raised his head for me to kiss his lips While he slept his mother sewed and talked with me She had known my parents on the plains and now let me sit at her feet giving me her workbox that I might look at its bobbins of different colored thread and the pretty needle book When I told her that the things looked a little like mother s and that sometimes mother let me take the tiniest bit of her wax she gave me permission to take a tiny taste of that which I held in my hand to see if it was like that which I remembered Only she the baby and I sat down to tea yet she said that she was glad she had company for baby s papa was away with Captain Fremont and she was lonesome After I learned that she would have to stay until he came back I was troubled and told what I had heard in the night She assured me that those in charge of the Fort heard every day all that was going on for miles and miles around and that if they should learn that fighting Indians were coming they would take all the white people and the good Indians into the fort and then shoot the bad ones with the cannon that peeped through its embrasures The dainty meal and her motherly talk kept me a happy child until I heard the footsteps of the Lennox boys I knew they were coming for me and that I should have to sleep in that dark room where I had been so afraid Quickly slipping from my chair under the table and hiding behind my new friend s dress skirt I begged her not to let them know where I was and please to let me stay with her all night I listened as she sent the boys back to tell their mother that she would keep me until morning adding that she would step in and explain matters after she put her baby to bed Before I went to sleep she heard me say my prayers and kissed me good night When I awoke next morning I was not in her house but in missus Lennox s wagon on the way to Sonoma The distance between the Fort and Sonoma was only about eighty miles yet the heavy roads and the frequent showers kept us on the journey more than a week It was still drizzling when we reached the town and missus Lennox learned where the Brunners lived I had been told that they would be looking for me and I expected to go to them at once As we approached the west bank of the creek which winds south past the town we could see the branches on the trees in grandma s dooryard swaying Yet we could not reach there because a heavy mountain storm had turned a torrent into the creek channel washed away the foot bridge and overflowed the low land Disappointed we encamped on high ground to wait for the waters to recede Toward evening Jakie gathering his cows on the opposite side noticed our emigrant wagon and oxen and as he drew nearer recognized missus Lennox Both signalled from where they stood and soon he descried me anxious to go to him He also was disappointed at the enforced delay and returned often to cheer us and to note the height of the water It seemed to me that we had been there days and days when a Mission Indian on a gray pony happened to come our way and upon learning what was wanted signalled that he would carry me over for a Mexican silver dollar Jakie immediately drew the coin from his pocket and held it between thumb and forefinger high above his head in the sunshine to show the native that his price would be paid Quickly the Indian dismounted looked his pony over carefully cinched the blanket on tighter led him to the water s edge and turned to me I shuddered and when all was ready drew near the deep flowing current tremblingly yet did not hesitate for my loved ones were beyond and to reach them I was willing to venture The Indian mounted and I was placed behind him By sign he warned me not to loosen my hold lest I like the passing branches should become the water s prey With my arms clasped tightly about his dusky form and his elbows clamped over them we entered the stream I saw the water surge up around us felt it splash over me Oh how cold it was I held my breath as we reached the deepest part and in dread clung closer to the form before me We were going down stream drifting past where Jakie stood How could I know that we were heading for the safe slope up the bank where we landed The Indian took his dollar with a grunt of satisfaction and Jakie bade me wave to the friends I had left behind as he put me on old Lisa s back and hurried off to grandma Leanna and Georgia waiting at the gate to welcome me home Georgia had a number of patches of calico and other trinkets which she had collected for me and offered them as soon as we had exchanged greetings then eagerly conducted me about the place Grandma was more energetic and busier than at the Fort and I could only talk with her as she worked but there was so much to see and hear that before nightfall my feet were heavy and my brain was weary However a good sleep under the roof of those whom I loved was all the tonic I needed to prepare me for a fair start in the new career and grandma s assurance This be your home so long as you be good filled me with such gladness that childlike I promised to be good always and to do everything that should be required of me Most of the emigrants in and around the Pueblo of Sonoma were Americans from the western frontiers of the United States They had reached the province in the Summer or early Autumn of eighteen forty six and for safety had settled near this United States Army post Here they had bought land and made homes within neighboring distance of each other and begun life anew in simple happy pioneer fashion The Brunners were a different type They had immigrated from Switzerland and settled in New Orleans Louisiana when young and by toil and economy had saved the snug sum of money which they brought to invest in California enterprises They could speak and read French and German and had some knowledge of figures Being skilled in the preparation of all the delicacies of the meat market and the products of the dairy they had brought across the plains the necessary equipment for both branches of business and had already established a butcher shop in the town and a dairy on the farm less than a mile from it Jakie was busy and useful at both places but grandpa was owner of the shop and grandma of the dairy Her hand had the cunning of the Swiss cheese maker and the deftness of the artist in butter moulding She was also an experienced cook and had many household commodities usually unknown to pioneer homes They were thus eminently fitted for life in a crude new settlement and occupied an important place in the community A public road cut their land into two unequal parts The cattle corrals and sheds were grouped on one side of the road and the family accommodations on the other Three magnificent oaks and a weird blackened tree trunk added picturesqueness to the ground upon which the log cabin and outbuildings stood The trim live oak shaded the adobe milk room and smoke house while the grand old white oak spread its far reaching boughs over the curbed well and front dooryard Illustration PLAZA AND BARRACKS OF SONOMA Illustration ONE OF THE OLDEST BUILDINGS IN SONOMA The log cabin was a substantial three roomed structure Its two outer doors opened with latch strings and were sawed across just above the middle so that the lower sections might be kept closed against the straying pigs and fowls while the upper part remained open to help the windows opposite give light and ventilation The east end formed the ample store room with shelves for many stages of ripening cheese The west end served as sleeping apartment for all except Jakie The large middle room was set apart as kitchen and general living room Against its wall were braced the dear old clock and conveniences for holding dishes and the few keepsakes which had shared the wanderings of their owners on two continents The adobe chimney which formed part of the partition between the living and the sleeping apartment gave a huge fireplace to each From the side of the one that cheered the living room swung a crane worthy of the great copper cheese kettle that hung on its arm In tidy rows on the chimney shelf stood bottles and boxes of medicine two small brass kettles and six bright candlesticks with hoods trays and snuffers to match On the wide hearth beneath were ranged the old fashioned three legged iron pots dominated by the large round one used as a bake oven Hovering over the fire sat the iron tea kettle with its slender throat and pointed lips now warmed to song by the blazing logs now rattling its lid with increasing fervor A long table with rough redwood benches around it a few straight backed chairs against the wall and Jakie s half concealed bed in the far corner constituted the visible furnishings of this memorable room which was so spick and span in German order and cleanliness that even its clay floor had to be sprinkled in regular spots and rings before being swept It was under the great oaks that most of the morning work was done There the pails and pans were washed and sunned the meats chopped the sausage made head cheese moulded ham and bacon salted and the lard tried out over the out door fires Among those busy scenes Georgia and I spent many happy hours and learned some of our hardest lessons for to us were assigned regular tasks and we were also expected to do the countless little errands which save steps to grown people and are supposed not to tire the feet of children Grandma stimulated by the success of her mixing and moulding and elated by the profit she saw in it was often too happy and bustling to remember how young we were or that we got tired or had worries of our own to bear Our small troubles however were soon forgotten when we could slip away for a while to the lovely playhouse which Leanna had secretly made for us in an excavation in the back yard There we forgot work used our own language and played we were like other children for we owned the beautiful cupboard dug in the wall and the pieces of Delft and broken glass set in rows upon the shelves also the furniture made of stumps and blocks of wood and the two bottles standing behind the brush barricade to act as sentries in case of danger during our absence One stolen visit to that playhouse led me into such disgrace that grandma did not speak to me the rest of the day and told Jakie all about it In the evening when no one else was near he called me to him I obeyed with downcast head Putting his hand under my chin and turning my face up he made me look straight into his eyes as he asked Who broke dat glass cup vat grandma left on die dinner table full of milk and telled you watch it bis Hendrik come to his dinner or bis she be done mit her nap I tried to turn my eyes down but he would not let me and I faltered The chicken knocked it off but he left the door open so it could get in Then he raised his other hand shook his finger and in awe inspiring tone continued Yes I be sure die chicken do dat but vot for you tell grandma dat Heinrick do dat Der debil makes peoples tell lies and den he ketch sie for his fire und he vill ketch you if you do dat some more Gott who you mutter telled you bout will not love you I will not love you if you do dat some more I be sorry for you because I tought you vas His little girl and mine little girl Jakie must have spent much time in collecting so many English words and they were effective for before he got through repeating them to me I was as heart sore and penitent as a child could be After he had forgiven me he sent me to grandma later to acknowledge my wrong to Hendrik and before I slept I had to tell God what a bad child I had been and ask Him to make me good I had promised to be very careful and to try never to tell another lie and I had been unhappy enough to want to keep the promise But alas my sympathy for Jakie led me into more trouble and it must have been on Sunday too for he was not working but sitting reverently under the tree with his elbows upon a table and his cheeks resting in the hollows of his hands Before him lay the Holy Scriptures from which he was slowly reading aloud in solemn tones Georgia and I standing a short distance from him listened very intently Not hearing a single English word and not understanding many of the German I became deeply concerned and turning to her asked Aren t you awful sorry for poor Jakie There he is reading to God in German and God can t understand him I m afraid Jakie won t go to heaven when he dies My wise little sister turned upon me indignantly assuring me that God sees everybody and understands everybody s talk To prove the truth of her statement she rushed to the kitchen and appealed to grandma who not only confirmed Georgia s words but asked me what right I had to believe that God was American only and could not understand good German people when they read and spoke to Him She wanted to know if I was not ashamed to think that they who had loved me and been kind to me would not go to Heaven as well as I who had come to them a beggar Then she sent me away by myself to think of my many sins and I weeping accepted banishment from Georgia lest she should learn wickedness from me Georgia was greatly disturbed on my account because she believed I had wilfully misrepresented God and that He might not forgive me When Jakie learned what had happened he declared that I had spoken like a child and needed instruction more than punishment So for the purpose of broadening my religious views and keeping before me the fact that God can do all things and knows all languages grandma taught me the Lord s Prayer in French and German and heard me repeat it each night in both languages after I had said it as taught me by my mother It was about this time that Leanna confided to me that she was homesick for Elitha and she would go to her very soon She said that I must not object when the time came for she loved her own sister just as much as I did mine and was as anxious to go to Elitha as I had been to come to Georgia She had been planning several weeks and knew of a family with which she could travel to Sutter s Fort Later when she collected her things to go away she left with us a pair of beautifully knit black silk stockings marked near the top in fine cross stitch in white D and under that five The stockings had been our mother s She had knit them herself and worn them Georgia gave one to me and kept the other We both felt that they were almost too sacred to handle They were our only keepsakes Later Georgia found a small tin box in which mother had kept important papers Recently when referring to that circumstance Georgia said Grandma for a long time had used it for a white sugar box and kept it on a shelf so high that we could see it only when she lifted it down and I don t think we took our eyes from it until it was put back We felt that it was too valuable for us ever to own One day I found it thrown away One side had become unsoldered from the ends and the bottom also was hanging loose With a full heart I grasped the treasure and put it where we could often see it Long afterwards Harry Huff kindly offered to repair it and the solder that still holds it together is also regarded as a keepsake from a dear friend Footnote fifteen missus Andrew J Grayson wife of the well known ornithologist frequently referred to as the Audubon of the West CHAPTER XXI MORAL DISCIPLINE THE HISTORICAL PUEBLO OF SONOMA SUGAR PLUMS Grandma often declared that she loved me and did not want to be too severe but for fear that I had learned much wickedness from the little Indians with whom I had played after I left her at the Fort she should watch me very closely herself and also have Georgia tell her whenever she should see me do wrong Consequently for a while after I reached Sonoma I was frequently on the penitential bench and was as often punished for fancied misdoings as for real ones Yet I grant that grandma was warranted in being severe the day that she got back from town before I was ready for her She had left us with the promise that she would bring us something nice if we would be good children and do certain work that she had planned After we had finished the task we both became restless wondered how soon she would come back and what we could do next to keep from being lonesome Then I espied on the upper shelf the cream colored sugar bowl with the old fashioned red roses and black foliage on its cover and sides Grandma had occasionally given us lumps of sugar out of it and I now asked Georgia if I hadn t better get it down so that we could each have a lump of sugar Hesitatingly she said No I am afraid you will break it I assured her that I would be very careful and at once set a chair in place and climbed up It was quite a strain to reach the bowl so I lifted it down and rested it on the lower shelf expecting to turn and put it into Georgia s hands But somehow before I could do this the lid slipped off and lay in two pieces upon the floor Georgia cried out reproachfully There you know I didn t want you to do it and now you will get a good whipping for breaking grandma s best sugar bowl I replied loftily that I was not afraid because I would ask God to mend it for me She did not think He would do it but I did So I matched the broken edges and put it on the chair knelt down before it and said Please when I made my request I touched the pieces very carefully and pleaded more earnestly each time that I found them unchanged Finally Georgia watching at the door said excitedly Here comes grandma I arose so disappointed and chagrined that I scarcely heard her as she entered and spoke to me I fully believed that He would have mended that cover if she had remained away a little longer nevertheless I was so indignant at Him for being so slow about it that I stood unabashed while Georgia told all that had happened The whipping I got did not make much impression but the after talks and the banishment from good company were terrible Later when I was called from my hiding place grandma saw that I had been very miserable and she insisted upon knowing what I had been thinking about Then I told her reluctantly that I had talked to God and told Him I did not think that He was a very good Heavenly Father or He would not let me get into so much trouble that I was mad at Him and didn t believe He knew how to mend dishes She covered her face with her apron and told me sobbingly that she had expected me to be sorry for getting down her sugar bowl and for breaking its cover that I was so bad that I would surely put poor old grandma s gray hair in her grave who had got one foot there already and the other on the brink This increased my wretchedness and I begged her to live just a little longer so that I might show her that I would be good She agreed to give me another trial and ended by telling me about the beautiful wicked angel who had been driven out of paradise and spends his time coaxing people to be bad and then remembers them and after they die takes them on his fork and pitches them back and forth in his fire Jakie had told me his name and also the name of his home Toward evening my head ached and I felt so ill that I crept close to grandma and asked sorrowfully if she thought the devil meant to have me die that night and then take me to his hell At a glance she saw that I suffered and drew me to her pillowed my head against her bosom and soothingly assured me that I would be forgiven if I would make friends with God and remember the lesson that I had learned that day She told me later I must never say devil or hell because it was not nice in little girls but that instead I might use the words blackman and blackman s fires At first I did not like to say it that way because I was afraid that the beautiful devil might think that I was calling him nicknames and get angry with me Notwithstanding my shortcomings the Brunners were very willing to keep me and strove to make a Schweitzer child of me dressed me in clothes modelled after those which grandma wore when she was small and by verse and legend filled my thoughts with pictures of their Alpine country I liked the German language learned it rapidly and soon could help to translate orders Those which pleased grandma best were from the homes of mister Jacob Leese Captain Fitch Major Prudon and General Vallejo for their patronage influenced other distinguished Spanish families at a distance to send for her excellent cheese and fancy pats of butter Yet with equal nicety she filled the orders that came from the mess room of the officers of our own brave boys in blue and always tried to have a better kerchief and apron on the evenings that officers and orderly rode out to pay the bills Visitors felt more than a passing interest in us two little ones for accounts of the sufferings of the Donner Party had been carried to all the settlements on the Pacific coast and had been sent in print or writings to all parts of the United States as a warning against further emigration to California by way of Hastings Cut Off Thus the name we bore awakened sympathy for us and in the huts of the lowly natives as well as in the homes of the rulers of the province we found welcome and were greeted with words of tenderness which were often followed by prayers for the repose of the souls of our precious dead Marked attentions were also shown us by officers and soldiers from the post The latter gathered in the evenings at the Brunner home for social intercourse Some played cards checkers and dominoes or talked and sang about des Deutschen Vaterland Others reviewed happenings in our own country recalled battles fought and victories won And we sitting between our foster grandparents or beside Jakie listening to their thrilling tales were unwittingly crammed with crumbs of truth and fiction that made lasting impressions upon our minds Nor were these odd bits of knowledge all we gained from those soldier friends They taught us the alphabet how to spell easy words and then to form letters with pencil They explained the meaning of fife and drum calls which we heard during the day and in mischievous earnestness declared that they the best fighters of Colonel Stephenson s famous regiment of New York Volunteers had pledged their arms and legs to our defence and had only come to see if we were worth the price they might have to pay Yet they made grim faces when all too soon the retreat call from the barracks sounded and away they would have to go on the double quick to be at post by the time of roll call and in bed at sound of taps On those evenings when grandma visited the sick or went from home on errands we children were tucked away early in our trundle bed There and by ourselves we spoke of mother and the mountains Not infrequently however our thoughts would be recalled to the present by loud wailing squeak squawk squeak squawks As the sound drew nearer and became shriller we would put our fingers in our ears to muffle the dismal tones which we knew were only the creakings of the two wooden wheels of some Mexican carreta laboriously bringing passengers to town or perhaps a cruder one carrying hides to the embarcadero or possibly supplies to adjacent ranchos We wondered how old people and mothers with sick children could travel in such uncomfortable vehicles and not become distracted by their nerve piercing noises Then like a bird song pleasanter scenes would steal in upon our musings of gay horseback parties on their way to church feasts or fandangos preceded or followed by servants in charge of pack animals laden with luggage We rarely stayed awake long enough to say all we wished about the Spanish people Their methods of travel modes of dress and fascinating manners were sources of never ending discussion and interest Illustration OLD MEXICAN CARRETA Illustration RESIDENCE OF JUDGE A L RHODES A TYPICAL CALIFORNIA HOUSE OF THE BETTER CLASS IN eighteen forty nine We had seen princely dons of many leagues ride by in state dashing caballeros resplendent in costumes of satin and velvet on their way to sing beneath the windows of dark eyed senoritas and had stood close enough to the wearers of embroidered and lace bedecked small clothes to count the scallops which closed the seams of their outer garments and to hear the faint tinkle of the tiny silver bells which dangled from them We had feasted our eyes on magnificently robed senoras and senoritas caught the scent of the roses twined in their hair and the flash of jewels on their persons Such frequent object lessons made the names and surroundings of those grandees easy to remember Some lived leagues distant some were near neighbors in that typical Mexican Pueblo of Sonoma whose adobe walls and red tiled roofs nestled close to the foot of the dimpled hills overlooking the valley from the north and whose historic and romantic associations were connected with distinguished families who still called it home Foremost among the men was General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo by whom Sonoma was founded in eighteen thirty four upon ground which had twice been consecrated to Mission use First by Padre Altemera who had in eighteen twenty three established there the church and mission building of San Francisco Solano And four years later after hostile Indians had destroyed the sacred structures Padre Fortune under protection of Presidio Golden Gate blessed the ashes and rebuilt the church and the parochial houses named last on the list of the historic Missions of California The Vallejo home covered the largest plot of ground on the north side of the plaza and its great house had a hospitable air despite its lofty watchtower begrimed by sentry holes overlooking every part of the valley During the period that its owner was commandante of the northern frontier the Vallejo home was headquarters for high officials of the province But after Commodore Sloat raised the Stars and Stripes at Monterey General Vallejo espoused the cause of the United States put aside much of his Spanish exclusiveness and opened his doors to Americans as graciously as to friends of his own nationality A historic souvenir greatly prized by Americans in town and valley was the flag pole which in Sonoma s infancy had been hewn from the distant mountain forest and brought down on pack animals by mission Indians under General Vallejo s direction It originally stood in the centre of the plaza where it was planted with sacred ceremonials and where amid ringing cheers of Viva Mexico it first flung to the breeze that country s symbolical banner of green white and red Through ten fitful years it loyally waved those colors then followed its brief humiliation by the Bear Flag episode and early redemption by order of Commodore Sloat who sent thither an American flag bearer to invest it with the Stars and Stripes Thereafter a patriotic impulse suggested its removal to the parade ground of the United States Army post and as Spanish residents looked upon it as a thornful reminder of lost power they felt no regret when Uncle Sam s boys transplanted it to new environments and made it an American feature by adoption But the Mexican landmark which appealed to me most pathetically was the quaint rustic belfry which stood solitary in the open space in front of the Mission buildings Its strong columns were the trunks of trees that looked as though they might have grown there for the purpose of shouldering the heavy cross beams from which the chimes hung Its smooth timbers had been laboriously hewn by hand as must be the case in a land where there are no saw mills The parts that were not bound together with thongs of rawhide were held in place by wooden pegs The strips of rawhide attached to the clappers dropped low enough for me to reach and often tempted me to make the bells speak Mission padres no longer dwelt in the buildings but shepherds from distant folds came monthly to administer to the needs of this consecrated flock Then the many bells would call the faithful to mass and to vespers or chime for the wedding of favored sons and daughters Part of them would jingle merrily for notable christenings but one only would toll when death whitened the lips of some distinguished victim and again while the blessed body was being borne to its last resting place During one of my first trips to town Jakie and I were standing by grandpa s shop on the east side of the plaza when suddenly those bells rang out clear and sweet and we saw the believing glide out of their homes in every direction and wend their way to the church The high born ladies had put aside their jewels their gorgeous silks and satins and donned the simpler garb prescribed for the season of fasts and prayer Those to the manor born wore the picturesque rebosa of fine lace or gauzy silk draped over the head and about the shoulders while those of humbler station made the shawl serve in place of the rebosa The Indian servants who with mats and kneeling cushions followed their mistresses wore white chemises bright colored petticoats and handkerchiefs folded three cornerwise over the head and knotted under the chin The costumes of the young girls were modelled after those of their mothers and the little ladies appeared as demure and walked as stately as their elders The gentlemen also were garbed in plainer costumes than their wont and for custom s sake rode on horseback even the short distances which little children walked The town seemed deserted and the church filled as we started homeward I skipping ahead until we reached a shop window where I waited for Jakie and asked him if he knew what those pretty little things were that I saw on a shelf in big short necked glass jars Some were round and had little stickers all over them and others looked like birds eggs pink yellow white and violet He told me the round ones were sugar plums and the egg shaped had each an almond nut under its bright crust that they were candies that had come from France in the ships that had brought the Spanish people their fine clothes and that they were only for the rich and would make poor little girls teeth ache if they should eat them Yet after I confided to him how mother had given me a lump of loaf sugar each night as long as it lasted and how sorry we both felt when there was no more he led me into the shop and let me choose two of each kind and color from the jars We walked faster as I carried them home Jakie and grandma would not take any but she gave Georgia and me each a sugar plum and an egg and saved the rest for other days when we should be good children CHAPTER XXII GOLD DISCOVERED CALIFORNIA IS OURS NURSING THE SICK THE U S MILITARY POST BURIAL OF AN OFFICER In the year eighteen forty eight while the settlers and their families were contentedly at work developing the resources of the country the astounding cry Gold discovered came through the valley like a blight stopping every industry in its wake Excited men women and children rushed to town in quest of information It was furnished by Alcalde Boggs and General Vallejo who had been called away privately two weeks earlier and had just returned in a state of great enthusiasm declaring that gold in dust grains and chunks had been discovered at Coloma not more than a day s journey from Sutter s Fort How soon can we get there became the all absorbing problem of eager listeners

none	none	Crowds from San Francisco came hurrying through some stopping barely long enough to repeat the maddening tales that had started them off to the diggings with pick and shovel Each new rumor increased the exodus of gold seekers and by the end of the first week in August when the messenger arrived with the long hoped for report of the ratification of the treaty of peace and General Mason s proclamation officially announcing it there were not enough men left in the valley outside of the barracks to give a decent round of cheers for the blessing of peace

none	none	From house to house by turns went the strong to help the weak to bridge their troubles They went not with cheering words only but with something in store for the empty cupboards and with ready hands to help to milk wash cook or sew Grandma was in such demand that she had little time to rest for there was not a doctor nor a medicine shop in the valley and her parcels of herbs and knowledge of their uses had to serve for both

2691_156750_000014_000001	train-clean-100	Sometimes we played on the way and made mistakes 
none	none	Then she would mete out to us that hardest of punishments namely that we were not to speak with each other until she should forgive our offence Forgiveness usually came before time to drive up the cows for she knew that we were nimbler footed when she started us off in happy mood Each cow wore a bell of different tone and knew her own name yet it was not an easy task even in pleasant weather to collect the various strings and get them home on time They mixed and fed with neighbors cattle on the range and hid themselves behind clumps of trees and other convenient obstructions Often grandma would get her string in by the main trail and have them milked before we could bring up the laggards that provokingly dawdled along nibbling stray bunches of grass

none	none	Our gallant Company C officered by Captain Bartlett and Lieutenants Stoneman and Stone was ordered to another post early in August and its departure caused such universal regret that no one supposed Company H under Captain Frisbie could fill its place Nevertheless that handsome young officer soon found his way to the good will of the people and when Captain Joe Hooker brought him out to visit grandma s dairy she too was greatly pleased by his soldierly bearing After he mentioned that he had heard of her interest in the company which had been called away and that he believed she would find Company H equally deserving of her consideration she readily extended to the new men the homelike privileges which the others had enjoyed

none	none	His boots with their toes reversed hung over the saddle of a riderless horse led behind the caisson The solemn tones of fife and muffled drum led the way through the town past the old Mission bells and up the hillside Only soldiers stood close around the grave and heard what was read by the officer who stood at its head with an open book in one hand and a drawn sword in the other Three times the file of soldiers fired a volley over the grave then the muffled drum sounded its farewell taps and the officers with their men and the funeral caisson returned to their quarters in silent order CHAPTER XXIII REAPING AND THRESHING A PIONEER FUNERAL THE HOMELESS AND WAYFARING APPEAL TO missus BRUNNER RETURN OF THE MINERS SOCIAL GATHERINGS OUR DAILY ROUTINE STOLEN PLEASURES A LITTLE DAIRYMAID MY DOGSKIN SHOES Reaping and threshing were interesting events to us that summer Mission Indians scantily clothed came and cut the grain with long knives and sickles bound it in small sheaves and stacked it in the back yard opposite grandma s lookout window then encircled it with a rustic fence leaving a wide bare space between the stack and the fence which they swept clean with green branches from live oak trees After many days Mexican drivers brought a band of wild mares to help with the work A thick layer of unthreshed grain was pitched on to the bare space surrounding the stack and the mares were driven around and around upon it From time to time fresh material was supplied to meet the needs of the threshers And at given signals from the men on the stack the mares were turned out for a short rest also in order to allow the Indians a chance to throw out the waste straw and to heap the loose grain on the winnowing ground So they did again and again until the last sheaf had been trodden under foot When the threshing was finished the Indians rested then prepared their fires and feasted on the head feet and offal of a bullock which grandpa had slaughtered Like buzzards came the squaws and papooses to take what was left of the food and to claim a share from the pile of worn out clothes which grandma brought out for distribution Amid shouts of pleasure gesticulations and all manner of begging the distribution began and when it ended our front yard looked as though it were stocked with prize scarecrows One big fellow was resplendent in a battered silk hat and a tattered army coat another was well dressed in a pair of cast off boots and one of grandma s ragged aprons Georgia and I tried to help to sort the things as they should be worn but our efforts were in vain Wrong hands would reach around and get the articles and both sexes interchanged suits with apparent satisfaction Grandma got quite out of patience with one great fellow who was trying to put on a petticoat that his squaw needed and rushed up to him jerked it off gave him a vigorous push and had the garment on his squaw before he could do more than grunt In the end they went away caring more for the clothes that had been given them than for the money they had earned Before the summer waned death claimed one of our own brave women and immigrants from far and near gathered to do her honor I do not recollect her name but know that she was tall and fair and that grandma who had watched with her through her last hours told Georgia and me that when we saw the procession leave the house we might creep through our back fence and reach the grave before those who should walk around by the road We were glad to go for we had watched the growth of the fresh ridge under a large oak tree not far from our house and had heard a friend say that it would be a heavenly resting place for the freed sufferer Her family and nearest neighbors left the house afoot behind the wagon which carried the plain redwood coffin At the cross road several fell in line and at the grave was quite a gathering A number came in their ox wagons others on horseback among them a father afoot leading a horse upon whose back sat his wife with an infant in arms and a child behind clinging to her waist and several old nags freighted with children were led by one parent while the other walked alongside to see that none should lose their balance and fall off No minister of the Gospel was within call so after the coffin was placed upon the bars above the open grave and the lid removed a friend who had crossed the plains with the dead offered a prayer and all the listeners said Amen I might not have remembered all these things if Georgia and I had not watched over that grave when all others seemed to have forgotten it As we brought brush to cover it in order to keep the cattle from dusting themselves in the loose earth we talked matters over and felt as though that mother s grave had been bequeathed to us Grandma had instructed us that the graveyard is God s acre and that it is a sin to live near and not tend it Still no matter how often we chased the cattle away they would return We could not make them understand that their old resting place had become sacred ground About the middle of October eighteen forty eight the last of the volunteers were mustered out of service and shortly thereafter the excess of army stores were condemned and sold Ex soldiers had preference over settlers and could buy the goods at Government rates plus a small cost of transportation to the Pacific coast Grandma profited by the good will of those whom she had befriended They stocked her store room with salt pork flour rice coffee sugar ship bread dried fruit and camp condiments at a nominal figure above what they themselves paid for them This was fortunate for the hotel was still closed and the homeless and wayfaring appealing to grandma easily persuaded her to make room for them at her table The greater the number the harder she worked and the more she expected of us Although we rose at dawn and rolled our sleeves high as she rolled hers and like her turned up our dress skirts and pinned them behind under our long belt aprons we could not keep pace with her work Nevertheless we were pleasing reminders of little girls whom she had known in her native village and she was proud of us and had two little white dresses fashioned to be worn on very special occasions After they were finished we also were proud and made many trips into the room to see how beautiful they looked hanging against the wall under the curtain Marvellous accounts of the extent and richness of the gold diggings were now brought to town by traffickers in provisions for mining camps This good news inspired our home keepers with renewed courage They worked faster while planning the comfort they should enjoy after the return of the absent The first to come were the unfortunate who sought to shake off rheumatism lung trouble or the stubborn low grade fever brought on by working in the water sleeping on damp ground eating poorly cooked food or wearing clothing insufficient to guard against the morning and evening chill Few had much to show for their toil and privation yet not disheartened even in delirium they clamored to hasten back for the precious treasure which seemed ever beckoning them onward When wind and weather drove them home the robust came with bags of gold rolled in their snug packs They called each other lucky dogs yet looked like grimy beggars with faces so bewhiskered and clothing so ragged or so wonderfully patched that little children cried when they drew near and wives threw up their hands exclaiming For the land s sake can it be Yet each home comer found glad welcome and messengers were quick to spread the news and friends gathered to rejoice with the returned Now each home cooked dish was a feast for the camp fed to contrast with their fare at Coloma Wood s Camp sixteen and sundry other places where flour rice ship bread and coffee were three dollars a pound salt pork and white beans two dollars a pound jerked beef eight dollars a pound saleratus sixteen dollars an ounce and salt sugar and raisins were put on the scales to balance their weight in gold dust where liquor was fifty cents a tablespoonful and candles five dollars each It was not the prices at which they complained but at the dearth of these staples which had forced them home to wait until spring should again open the road to supply trains The homeless who in the evenings found comfort and cheer around grandma s table would take out their treasure bags and boxes and pour their dust and grains of gold in separate piles to show the quality and quantity then pass the nuggets around that all might see what strange figures nature had moulded in secret up among the rocks and ravines of the Sierras One Roman Catholic claimed as his choicest prize a perfectly shaped cross of free gold which he had cradled from the sands in the bed of a creek Another had an image of the Virgin and Child A slight stretch of the imagination turned many of the beautifully fretted pieces into miniature birds and other admirable designs for sweetheart brooches The exhibition over each would scrape his hoard back into its receptacle blow the remaining yellow particles on to the floor so that the table should not show stain and then settle himself to take his part in relating amusing and thrilling incidents of life in the mining camps Not a window was closed nor a door locked nor a wink of sleep lost in those days guarding bags of gold Hands off was the miners law and all knew that death awaited him who should venture to break it Heavy purses made willing spenders and generous impulses were untrammelled Nothing could be more gratifying or touching than the respect shown by those homeless men to the pioneer women and children They would walk long distances and suffer delays and inconveniences for the privilege of passing a few hours under home influences and were ever ready to contribute toward pleasures in which all might participate There were so few young girls in the community and their presence was so greatly desired that in the early winter Georgia and I attended as welcome guests some of the social gatherings which began at early candle light and we wore the little white dresses that were so precious in our eyes Illustration GOLD ROCKER WASHING PAN AND GOLD BORER Illustration SCENE DURING THE RUSH TO THE GOLD MINES FROM SAN FRANCISCO IN eighteen forty eight Before the season was half over heavy rain was followed by such bitter cold that all the ground and still waters were frozen stiff Although we were well muffled and grandma warmed us up with a drink of hot water and sweetened cream before starting us out after the cows the frost nipped at our feet until the old scars became so angry and painful that we could scarcely hobble about the house Many remedies were tried to no purpose the most severe being the early foot bath with floats of ice in the water It chilled us through and through and also made grandma keep us from the fire lest the heat should undo the benefit expected from the cold So while we sat with shivering forms and chattering teeth looking across the room at the blazing logs under the breakfast pots and kettles our string of cows was coming home in care of a new driver We were glad to be together even in misery and all things considered were perhaps as useful in our crippled condition as before for there was enough to keep our hands busy while our feet rested Grandma thought she made our work lighter by bringing it to us yet she came too often for it to seem easy to us First the six brass candlesticks with hoods snuffers and trays had to be brightened and next there were the small brass kettles in which she boiled the milk for coffee to be polished inside and out However we did not dread the kettles much unless burned for there was always a spoon in the bottom to help to gather the scrapings of which we were very fond But when she would come with a large pan of dried beans or peas to be picked over quickly so that she could get them soaked for early cooking we would measure its contents with critical eyes to make sure that it was not more than we had had the previous day By the time we would get to the bottom of the pan she would be ready to put before us a discouraging pile of iron knives forks and pewter spoons to scour with wood ashes How we did hate those old black knives and forks She said her sight was poor but she could always see when we slighted any The redeeming work of the day was sorting the dried fruit for sauce or pies We could take little nibbles as we handled it and knew that we should get an extra taste when it was ready for use And after she had put the upper crust on the pies she would generally permit us to make the fancy print around the edges with a fork and then prick a figure in the centre to let the steam escape while baking Sometimes she received a dollar apiece for these pies and she had so many customers for them and for such loaves of bread as she could spare that she often declared the farm was as good as a gold mine We were supposed not to play with dolls consequently we durst not ask any one to step around and see how our little house in the back yard was weathering the storms nor how the beloved nine in it were getting along Though only bottles of different sizes to us they were dear children named after great personages whom the soldiers had taught us to honor The most distinguished had cork stoppers for heads with faces marked on the sides the rest only wads of paper or cloth fastened on the ends of sticks that reached down into the bodies A strip of cloth tied around each neck below the bulge served as make believe arms suitable for all ordinary purposes and with a little assistance capable of saluting an officer or waving to a comrade We worried because they were clothed in fragments of cloth and paper too thin for the season and the very first chance we got we slipped out and found our darlings in a pitiable plight Generals Washington and Jackson and little Van Buren were mired at the foot of a land slide from the overhanging bank Taylor Webster Clay and Benton had been knocked down and buried almost out of sight Martha Washington s white shawl and the chicken plumes in her hat were ruined and Dandy Jim from North Carolina lay at her feet with a broken neck Such a shock Not until we realized that everything could be restored was our grief assuaged that is everything but Dandy Jim He was a serious loss for he was our only black bottle and had always been kept to wait on Martha Washington We worked fast and had accomplished so much before being called into the house that we might have put everything in order next day had Georgia not waked up toward morning with a severe cold and had grandma not found out how she caught it The outcome was that our treasures were taken to the store room to become medicine and vinegar bottles and we mourned like birds robbed of their young New duties were opened to me as soon as I could wear my shoes and by the time Georgia was out again I was a busy little dairymaid and quite at home in the corrals I had been decorated with the regulation salt bag which hung close to my left side like a fisherman s basket I owned a quart cup and could milk with either hand also knew how to administer the pinch of salt which each cow expected After a little practice I became able to do all the stripping In some cases it amounted to not more than half a pint from each animal However much or little the strippings were of importance and were kept separate because grandma considered them good as cream in the cheese kettle When I could sit on the one legged stool which Jakie had made me hold a pail between my knees and milk one or more cows without help they both praised my cleverness a cleverness which fixed more outside responsibilities upon me and kept me from Georgia a longer while each day My work was hard still I remained noticeably taller and stronger than she who was assigned to lighter household duties I felt that I had no reason to complain of my tasks because everybody about me was busy and the work had to be done If I was more helpful than my little sister I was also a source of greater trouble for I wore out my clothes faster and they were difficult to replace especially shoes There was but one shoemaker in the town and he was kept so busy that he took a generous measure of children s feet and then allowed a size or more to guard against the shoes being too small by the time he should get them finished When my little stogies began to leak he shook his head thoughtfully and declared that he had so many orders for men s boots that he could not possibly work for women or children until those orders were filled Consequently grandma kept her eye on my shoes and as they got worse and worse she became sorely perplexed She would not let me go barefooted because she was afraid of snags and ensuing lockjaw she could not loan me her own because she was saving them for special occasions and wearing instead the heavy sabots she had brought from her native land She tried the effect of continually reminding me to pick my way and save my shoes which made life miserable for us both Finally she upbraided me harshly for a playful run across the yard with Courage and I lost my temper and grumbled I would rather go barefooted and get snags in my feet than have so much bother about old shoes that are worn out and no good anyway I was still crying when Hendrik a roly poly Hollander came along and asked the cause of my distress Grandma told him that I was out of humor because she was trying to keep shoes on my feet while I was determined to run them off He laughed bade me cheer up sang the rollicking sailor song with which he used to drive away storms at sea then showed me a hole in the heel of the dogskin boots he wore and told me that out of their tops he would make me a beautiful pair of shoes No clouds darkened my sky the morning that Hendrik came wearing a pair of new cowhide boots then squeaked as though singing crickets were between the heavy soles for he had his workbox and the dogskins under his arm and we took seats under the oak tree where he laid out his tools and went to work without more ado He had brought a piece of tanned cowhide for the soles of my shoes an awl a sailor s thimble needles coarse thread a ball of wax and a sharp knife The hair on the inside of the boot legs was thick and smooth and the colors showed that one of the skins had been taken from the body of a black and white dog and the other from that of a tawny brindle As Hendrik modelled and sewed he told me a wondrous tale of the great North Polar Sea where he had gone in a whaling vessel and had stayed all winter among mountains of ice and snow There his boots had worn out So he had bought these skins from queer little people there who live in snow huts and instead of horses or oxen use dogs to draw their sleds I liked the black and white skin better than the brindle so he cut that for the right foot and told me always to make it start first And when I put the shoes on they felt so soft and warm that I knew I could never forget Hendrik s generosity and kindness The longer I wore them the more I became attached to them and the better I understood the story he had told me for in my musings they were not shoes but Spot and Brindle live Eskimo dogs that had drawn families of queer little people in sleds over the frozen sea and had always been hungry and ready to fight over their scanty meals At times I imagined that they wanted to race and scamper about as happy dogs do and I would run myself out of breath to keep them going and always stop with Spot in the lead When I needed shoestrings I was sent to the shoemaker who only glanced up and replied Come to morrow and I ll have a piece of leather big enough The next day he made the same answer Come to morrow and kept pegging away as fast as he could on a boot sole The third time I appeared before him he looked up with the ejaculation Well I ll be damned if she ain t here again I was well aware that he should not have used that evil word yet was not alarmed for I had heard grandpa and others use worse and mean no harm nor yet intend to be cross So I stood quietly and in a trice he was up had rushed across the shop brought back two round pieces of leather not larger than cookies and before I knew what he was about had turned them into good straight shoestrings He waxed them and handed them to me with the remark Tell your grandma that since you had to wait so long I charge her only twenty five cents for them Footnote sixteen Now Jamestown CHAPTER XXIV MEXICAN METHODS OF CULTIVATION FIRST STEAMSHIP THROUGH THE GOLDEN GATE THE ARGONAUTS OR BOYS OF forty nine A LETTER FROM THE STATES JOHN BAPTISTE JAKIE LEAVES US THE FIRST AMERICAN SCHOOL IN SONOMA By the first of March eighteen forty nine carpenters had the frame of grandma s fine new two story house enclosed and the floors partly laid Neighbors were hurrying to get their fields ploughed and planted those without farming implements following the Mexican s crude method of ploughing the ground with wooden prongs and harrowing in the seed by dragging heavy brush over it They gladly turned to any tool that would complete the work by the time the roads to the mountains should be passable and the diggings clear of snow Their expectations might have been realized sooner if a bluff old launch captain with an eye to business for

Harbor with merchandise Stopped at Panama there took aboard three hundred and fifty waiting passengers that had cut across country a mixture of men from all parts of the United States who have come to carry off the gold diggings root and branch Others are coming in shiploads as fast as they can Now mark my words and mark them well provisions is going to run mighty short and if this valley wants any it had better send for them pretty damn quick By return boat farmers shopkeepers and carpenters hastened to San Francisco All were eager for supplies from the first steamship that had entered the Golden Gate the first it may be added that most of them even those of a sea going past had ever seen During the absence of husbands we little girls were loaned separately nights to timid wives who had no children to keep them company Georgia went earlier and stayed later than I because grandma could not spare me in the evenings until after the cows were turned out and she needed me in the mornings before sunrise Those who borrowed us made our stays so pleasant that we felt at home in many different houses Once however I encountered danger on my early homeward trip I had turned the bend in the road could see the smoke curling out of grandma s chimney and knew that every nearer house was closed In order to avoid attracting the attention of a suspicious looking cow on the road I was running stealthily along a rail fence when unexpectedly I came upon a family of sleeping swine and before I was aware of danger from that direction was set upon and felled to the ground by a vicious beast Impelled I know not how but quick as thought I rolled over and over and over and when I opened my eyes I was on the other side of the fence and an angry noisy bristling creature was glaring at me through the rails Quivering like a leaf and for a time unable to rise I lay upon the green earth facing the morning sky With strange sensations and wonderment I tried to think what might have happened if I had not rolled What if that space between fence and ground had been too narrow to let my body through what if on the other hand it had been wide enough for that enraged brute to follow Too frightened to cry and still trembling I made my way to the end of the field and climbed back over the fence near home Grandma was greatly startled by my blanched face and the rumpled and soiled condition of my clothes After I related my frightful experience she also felt that had it not been for that fence I should have been torn to pieces She explained however that I probably would not have been attacked had I not startled the old mother so suddenly that she believed her young in danger When our menfolk returned from San Francisco they were accompanied by many excited treasure seekers anxious to secure pack animals to carry their effects to the mines They were made welcome and in turn furnished us news of the outer world and distributed worn copies of American and foreign newspapers which our hungry minded pioneers read and re read so long as the lines held together Those light hearted newcomers who danced and gayly sang O Susannah don t you cry for me I m bound to Californy with a tin pan on my knee were the first we saw of that vast throng of gold seekers who flocked to our shores within a twelvemonth and who have since become idealized in song and story as the Argonauts the Boys of forty nine They were unlike either our pioneer or our soldier friends in style of dress and manner Nor had they come to build homes or develop the country They wanted gold to carry back to other lands Some had expected to find it near the Bay of San Francisco some to scoop it up out of the river beds that crossed the valleys and others to shovel it from ravines and mountain sides When told of the difficulties before them their impatience grew to be off that they might prove to Western plodders what could be done by Eastern pluck and muscle Such packing as those men did Mother s Bible and wife and baby s daguerreotype not infrequently started to the mines in the coffee pot or in the miner s boots hanging across the mule s pack The sweetheart s lock of hair affectionately concealed beneath the hat lining of its faithful wearer caught the scent of the old clay pipe stuck in the hat band With the opening season all available Indians of both sexes were hired as gold diggers and trudged along behind their employers and our town was again reduced to a settlement of white women and children But what a difference in the feeling of our people We now heard regularly from the Bay City and entertained transients from nearly every part of the globe and these would loan us books and newspapers and frequently store unnecessary possessions with us until they should return from the mines San Francisco had a regular post office One day its postmaster forwarded a letter addressed to ex Governor Boggs which the latter brought out and read to grandma She did not as usual put her head out of the window and call us but came from the house wiping her eyes and asked if we wanted to be put in a big ship and sent away from her and grandma and Jakie Greatly alarmed we exclaimed No no grandma no Taking us by the hand she led us into the house seated herself and drew one of us to each side then requested the Governor to read the letter again We two did not understand all it said but enough to know that it had been written by our own dear aunt Elizabeth Poor who wanted Governor Boggs to find her sister s three little orphaned girls and send them back to her by ship to Massachusetts It contained the necessary directions for carrying out her wish Illustration POST OFFICE CORNER OF CLAY AND PIKE STREETS SAN FRANCISCO eighteen forty nine Illustration OLD CITY HOTEL eighteen forty six CORNER OF KEARNEY AND CLAY STREETS THE FIRST HOTEL IN SAN FRANCISCO Grandma assured the Governor that we did not want to leave her nor would she give us up She said she and her husband and Jakie had befriended us when we were poor and useless and that we were now beginning to be helpful Moreover that they had prospered greatly since we had come into their home and that their luck might change if they should part from us She further stated that she already had riches in her own right which we should inherit at her death The Governor spoke of schools and divers matters pertaining to our welfare then promised to explain by letter to Aunt Elizabeth how fortunately we were situated This event created quite a flutter of excitement among friends Grandpa and Jakie felt just as grandma did about keeping us Georgia and I were assured that in not being allowed to go across the water we had escaped great suffering and perhaps drowning by shipwreck Still we did wish that it were possible for us to see Aunt Elizabeth whom mother had taught us to love and who now wanted us to come to her I told Georgia that I would learn to write as fast as I could and send her a letter so she would know all about us We now imagined that we were quite large girls for grandma usually said before going away Children you know what there is to do and I leave everything in your care We did not realize that this was her little scheme in part to keep us out of mischief but we knew that upon her return she would see and call attention to what was left undone Once when we were at home alone and talking about endless work and aching bones as we had heard grown up folks complain of theirs we were interrupted by a bareback rider who did not tie up under the live oak but came to the shade of the white oak in front of us at the kitchen door After a cheery Howdy do and a hand shake he exclaimed I heard at Napa that you lived here and my pony has made a hard run to give me this sight of you We were surprised and delighted for the speaker was John Baptiste who had wintered with us in the Sierras We asked him to dismount take a seat under the tree and let us bring him a glass of milk He declined graciously then with a pleased expression drew a small brown paper parcel from his trousers pocket and handed it to us leaned forward clasped his arms about his pony rested his head on its neck and smilingly watched Georgia unwrap it and two beautiful bunches of raisins come to view one for each He would not touch a single berry nor let us save any He asked us to eat them then and there so that he could witness our enjoyment of the luxury he had provided for this our first meeting in the settlement Never had we seen raisins so large translucent and delicious They seemed far too choice for us to have and John was so poorly dressed and pinched in features that we hesitated about eating them But he would have his way and in simple language told us that he wanted them to soften the recollection of the hungry time when he came into camp empty handed and discouraged Also to fulfil his assurance to our mother that he would try to keep us in sight and give us of the best that he could procure His last injunctions were Be good little girls always remember your mother and father and don t forget John Baptiste He was gone when grandma got back and she was very serious when told what had occurred in her absence She rarely spoke to us of our mother and feared it might lessen our affection for herself if others kept the memory of the dead fresh in our minds There were many other happenings before the year closed that caused me to think a great deal Grandpa spent less time at the shop he bought himself a fleet footed horse which he named Antelope and came home oftener to talk to grandma about money they had loaned Major Prudon to send to China for merchandise also about a bar room which he was fitting up near the butcher shop for a partner Next he bought faithful Charlie a large bay horse with friendly eyes and long black mane and tail also a small blue farm wagon in which Georgia and I were to drive about the fields when sent to gather loose bark and dry branches for baking fires We were out for that purpose the day that we saw grandpa ride away to the mines but we missed seeing Jakie steal off with his bunch of cows He felt too badly to say good bye to us I was almost heart broken when I learned that he was not coming back He had been my comforter in most of my troubles had taught me to ride and drive the horse shown me the wood duck s nest in the hollow of our white oak tree and the orioles pretty home swinging from a twig in the live oak also where the big white faced owls lived He had helped me to gather wild flowers made me whistles from branches cut from the pussy willows and had yodeled for me as joyfully as for loved ones in his Alpine home Everything that he had said and done meant a great deal more to me now and kept him in mind as I went about alone or with grandma doing the things that had been his to do She now moulded her cheeses in smaller forms and we had fewer cows to milk When the season for collecting and drying herbs came Georgia and I had opportunity to be together considerably It was after we had picked the first drying of sage and were pricking our fingers on the saffron pods that grandma in passing with her apron full of Castilian rose petals stopped and announced that if we would promise to work well and gather the sage leaves and saffron tufts as often as necessary she would let us go to a real school which was about to open in town Oh dear to go to school to have books and slate and pencil What more could be wished Yes we would get up earlier work faster before time to go and hurry home after lessons were over And I would carry the book Aunt Lucy had given me It was all arranged and grandma went to town to buy slates pencils speller and a stick of wine colored ribbon to tie up our hair When the anticipated hour came there were great preparations that we might be neat and clean and ready on time Our hair was parted in four equal divisions the front braids tied with ribbon formed a U at the back of the neck and we wore new calico dresses and sun bonnets and carried lunch for two in a curious little basket which grandma must have brought with her from Switzerland Joyfully we started forth to the first American school opened in Sonoma Alas it was not what our anticipations had pictured The schoolroom was a dreary adobe containing two rows of benches so high that when seated we could barely touch the earthen floor with our toes The schoolmaster told us that we must hold our slates on our laps and our open books in the right hand and not look at the pictures but study all the time and not speak even to each other without permission His face was so severe his eyes so keen and his voice so sharp that I was afraid of him He had a chair with a back to it and a table to hold his books yet he spent most of his time walking about with a narrow strap of rawhide in his hand and was ever finding some one whose book drooped or who was whispering and the stinging bite of that strap would call the erring to order The Misses Boggs Lewis Smith and Bone were pretty young ladies and brought their own chairs and a table to sit around and when they whispered the master never saw them and when they missed in lessons he didn t keep them in nor make them stand on the floor I learned my lessons well enough but grandma was terribly shocked because I got strapped nearly every day But then I sat between Georgia and the other little girls in our row and had to deliver messages from those on both sides of me as well as to whisper a little on my own account Finally grandma declared that if I got a whipping next day she would give me a second one after reaching home So I started in the morning with the intention of being the best girl in school but we had hardly settled in line for our first lesson when Georgia whispered behind her book Eliza see Mary Jane Johnson has got my nice French card with the double queens on it and I can t get it Forgotten were my good resolutions I leaned out of line and whispered louder than I meant Mary Jane Johnson that is my sister s card and you must give it back to her She saw the master watching but I did not until he called me to hold out my hand For once I begged Please excuse me I won t do it again But he wouldn t and I felt greatly humiliated because I knew the large girls had heard me and were smiling After recess a new boy arrived little Willie McCracken whom we had seen on the plains and known at Sutter s Fort and he knew us as soon as he reached his seat and looked around In a short time I nudged Georgia and asked her if I hadn t better roll him the little knot of dried apples that grandma had put in the basket for my lunch She said yes if I wanted to So I wiggled the basket from under the seat with my foot and soon thereafter my bit of hospitality was on its way to the friend I was glad to see again Instead of his getting it however the master stepped down and picked it up with the hand that didn t have the strap in it So instead of being the best I was the worst child in school for not one had ever before received two strappings in a forenoon It must have been our bad day for Georgia felt her very first bite from the strap that afternoon and on the way home volunteered not to tell on me if grandma did not ask Yet grandma did the first thing And when Georgia reluctantly said Yes grandma looked at me and shook her head despairingly but when I announced that I had already had two strappings and Georgia one she burst out laughing and said she thought I had had enough for one day A few weeks later the large boys drove the master out of school on account of his cruelty to a little fellow who had played truant In that dingy schoolroom Georgia and I later attended the first Protestant Sunday school and church service held in Sonoma CHAPTER XXV FEVER PATIENTS FROM THE MINES UNMARKED GRAVES THE TALES AND TAUNTS THAT WOUNDED MY YOUNG HEART A short experience in the mines cured grandpa s mining fever but increased his rheumatism The accounts he brought of sufferings he had witnessed in the camps prepared us for the approaching autumn s work when many of the happy fellows who had started to the gold fields in vigorous health and with great expectations returned haggard sick and out of luck Then was noble work done by the pioneer women No door was closed against the needy However small the house might be its inmates had some comfort to offer the stranger Many came to grandma saying they had places to sleep but begging that she would give them food and medicine until they should be able to proceed to San Francisco Weary mortals dragged their aching limbs to the benches under her white oak tree dropped upon them with blankets still across their shoulders declaring they could not go another rod Often she turned her face aside and murmured God help the poor wanderers but to them she would say encouragingly You be not very sick you will soon be rested There be straw in the stack that we will bring for your bed and me and the children will let you not go hungry Ere long beds had to be made on the floor of the unfinished house More were needed and they were spread under the great white oak On a block beside each fever patient stood a tin cup which Georgia and I were charged to keep full of cold water and it was pitiful to see the eyes of the sick watch the cooling stream we poured Our patients eagerly grasped the cup with unsteady hands so that part of its contents did not reach the parched lips Often we heard the fervid prayer God bless the women of this land and bless the children too Soon we learned to detect signs of improvement and were rejoiced when the convalescents smiled and asked for more to eat Grandma carried most of the food to them and sent us later for the empty dishes Of the many who came to us that season there was but one who never proceeded on his way He was a young German fair of face but terribly wasted by disease His gentle boyish manner at once made him a favorite and we not only gave him our best care but when a physician drifted into town grandma sent for him and followed his directions I remember well the day that John seemed almost convalescent relished his breakfast wanted to talk a while and before we left him had us bring him a basin of warm water and his beflowered carpet bag from which he took a change of clothing and his shaving outfit When we saw him later his hair was smoothly combed he looked neat and felt encouraged and was sure that he should soon be up and doing for himself At nightfall grandma bade us wipe the dishes quickly as possible at which Georgia proposed a race to see whether she could wash fast enough to keep us busy and we got into a frolicsome mood which grandma put an end to with the sobering remark Oh be not so worldly minded John ist very bad to night I be in a hurry to go back to him and you must hold the candle We passed out into the clear cold starlight with the burning candle sheltered by a milk pan and picked our way between the lumber to the unfinished room where John lay I was the last to enter and saw grandma hurriedly give the candle to Georgia drop upon her knees beside the bed touch his forehead lift his hand and call him by name The damp of death was on his brow the organs of speech had lost their power One long upward look a slight quivering of the muscles of the face and we were alone with the dead I was so awed that I could scarcely move but grandma wept over him as she prepared his body for burial The next afternoon we three and grandpa and a few friends followed him to his final resting place After he was gone grandma remembered that she did not know his name in full the land of his birth nor the address of his people Expecting his recovery she had not troubled him with questions and the few trinkets in his carpet bag yielded no identifying clue So he lies in a nameless grave like countless other youth of that period We had patients of every type those who were appreciative and grateful and those who rebelled against confinement and swore at the pain which kept sleep from their eyes and hurled their things about regardless of consequences The most trying were the chronic grumblers who did not know what they wanted nor what they ought to have and adopted the moody refrain But the happy times are over I ve only grief and pain For I shall never never see Susannah dear again The entrance of Georgia and myself would occasionally turn their thoughts into homeward channels and make them reminiscent of their little children and loved ones back in the States Then again our coming would set them to talking about our early disaster and such horrible recounts of happenings in the snow bound camps that we would rush away and poor Georgia would have distressing crying spells over what we had heard At first no tears dimmed my eyes for I felt with keen indignation that those wounding tales were false but there came hours of suffering for me later when an unsympathetic soldier nicknamed Picayune Butler engaged me in conversation and set me to thinking He was a great big man with eyes piercing as a hawk s and lips so thin that they looked like red lines on his face parting and snapping together as he repeated the horrible things he had read in The California Star He insisted that the Donner Party was responsible for its own misfortune that parents killed their babies and ate their bodies to keep themselves alive cut off the heads of companions and called them good soup bones and were as thievish as sneaking Indians even stealing the strings from the snowshoes of those who had come to their rescue He maintained that Keseberg had murdered my mother and mutilated my dead father s body and that he himself felt that the miserable wretches brought from starvation were not worth the price it had cost to save them Too young too ignorant and too distressed to disprove the accusations or resent his individual view I could only take refuge behind what I had heard and seen in camp and declare I know it is not true they were good people and loved their babies and were sorry for everybody How could I believe his cruel words While I had come from the mountains remembering most clearly the sufferings from cold hunger thirst and pitiful surroundings I had also brought from there a child s mental picture of tenderest sympathies and bravest self denials evinced by the snow bound in my father s camp and of missus Murphy s earnest effort to soothe and care for us three little sisters after we had been deserted at the lake cabins by Cady and Stone also her motherly watchfulness over Jimmie Eddy Georgia Foster and her own son Simon and of mister Eddy s constant solicitude for our safety on the journey over the mountains to Sutter s Fort Vain however my efforts to speak in behalf of either the dead or the absent every attempt was met by the ready assertion You can t prove anything you were not old enough to remember or understand what happened Oh how I longed to be grown to have opportunities to talk with those of the party who were considered old enough to remember facts and would answer the questions I wanted to ask and how firmly I resolved that when I grew to be a woman I would tell the story of my party so clearly that no one could doubt its truth CHAPTER XXVI THANK OFFERINGS MISS DOTY S SCHOOL THE BOND OF KINDRED IN JACKET AND TROUSERS CHUM CHARLIE Grandma had a fixed price for table board but would not take pay for medicines nor for attendance on the sick consequently many of her patients after reaching San Francisco sent thank offerings of articles useful and pleasing to her Thus also Sister Georgia and I came into possession of pretty calico Swiss and delaine dresses and shoes that filled our hearts with pride for they were of Morocco leather a red and a green pair for each We had seen finely dressed Spanish children wear such shoes but never supposed that we should be so favored After the first dresses were finished there came a Sunday when I was allowed to go to the Mission Church with Kitty Purcell the baker s little daughter and I felt wonderfully fine in my pink calico frock flecked with a bird s eye of white a sun bonnet to match and green shoes The brilliantly lighted altar decked with flowers the priests in gorgeous vestments the acolyte with the swinging censer and the intoned service in foreign tongue were bewildering to me My eyes wandered from the clergy to the benches upon which sat the rich and the great then back to the poor among whom I was kneeling Each humble worshipper had spread a bright bordered handkerchief upon the bare floor as a kneeling mat I observed the striking effect then recollecting my shoes put my hand back and drew up the hem of my dress that my two green beauties might be seen by the children behind me No seven year old child ever enjoyed finery more than I did those little shoes Gifts which grandma considered quite unsuitable came one day in two neat wooden boxes about thirty inches in length and eight in width and depth They were addressed to us individually but in grandma s care When she removed the cover and a layer of cotton batting from Georgia s a beautiful French lady doll was revealed exquisitely dressed with a spray of flowers in her hair and another that looped one side of her lovely pink skirt sufficiently high to display an elaborately trimmed petticoat She was so fine in lace and ribbons yes even watch and chain that grandma was loath to let us touch her and insisted she should be handled in the box My gift was a pretty young Swiss matron in holiday attire really more picturesque and quite as costly as Georgia s but lacking that daintiness which made the lady doll untouchable I had her to hug and look at only a few moments then both boxes with their precious contents were put away for safe keeping and brought forth only on state occasions for the inspection of special visitors Grandma did not want any nonsense put into our heads She wished us to be practical and often quoted maxims to the effect that As the twig is bent the tree s inclined All work is ennobling if well done Much book learning for girls is not conducive to happiness or success and The highest aim of a girl should be honesty chastity and industry Still she was so pleased when I could write a little with ink and quill that she dictated several letters to Jakie who was in the dairy business near Stockton and in an unguarded moment she agreed that I should attend Miss Doty s school Then she hesitated She wished to treat us exactly alike yet could not spare both at the same time Finally as a way out of the difficulty she decided that we should attend school alternate months during the summer and that my sister being the elder should begin the course It seemed to me that Georgia s month at school would never end My own sped faster than I wished Miss Doty helped me with my lessons during part of the noon hour and encouragingly said Be patient keep trying and you will gain your reward While still her pupil I wrote my long planned letter to Aunt Elizabeth Georgia helped to compose it and when finished we carried it to our friend the postmaster He banteringly held it in his hand until we told its contents and begged that it go to Aunt Elizabeth as fast as possible He must have seen that it was incorrectly addressed yet he readily promised that if an answer should come addressed to Miss Georgia Ann Donner or to Miss Eliza Poor Donner he would carefully save it for us After many fruitless trips to the post office we were one day handed a letter for grandma It was not from our aunt however but from our sister Elitha and bore the sad news that her husband while on the range had been thrown from his horse and lived but a few moments after she reached him She also stated that her little daughter Elisabeth and her sister Leanna were with her on the ranch and that she was anxious to learn how Georgia and I were getting on By advice of short sighted friends grandma sent a very formal reply to the letter and told us that she did not want Elitha to write again Moreover that we in gratitude for what she had done for us should take her name and call her mother This endeavor to destroy personal identity and family connection met with pathetic opposition Of our own accord we had called her grandma But mother that name was sacred to her who had taught our infant lips to give it utterance We would bestow it on no other Under no circumstance was there difficulty in finding some one ready to advise or help to plan our duties With the best of intentions Yes but often oh how trying to us poor little waifs of misfortune One like a thorn in the flesh was apportioned to me at the approach of the Winter of eighteen forty nine and eighteen fifty We needed more help in the dairy but could get no one except mister Marsh who lived in bachelor quarters half a mile south on the creek bank He drove in the bunch of cows found in the mornings grazing on their homeward way but was too old to follow after those on the range Moreover he did not know how to milk Grandma therefore was obliged to give up going after the cows herself She hesitated about sending us alone for of late many stragglers had been seen crossing the valley and also Indians loitering about Furthermore Georgia was again coughing badly At a loss what to do she discussed the situation with a neighbor who after reflection asked Why not dress Eliza in boy s clothes and put her on old Charlie Grandma threw up her hands at the bare suggestion It was scandalous improper Why she had even taught me to shun the boys of the village However she felt differently later in the day when she called me to her But in vain was coaxing in vain was scolding I refused positively to don boy s clothing Then she told in strictest confidence that Georgia was very frail would probably die young certainly would not reach twenty five and I ought not to hesitate at what would make her life easier Still if I had no regard for my sister s comfort she would be compelled to send us together afoot after the cows and the exposure might be very bad for Georgia This was enough I would wear the hated clothes and my little sister should never learn from me the seriousness of her condition lest it should hasten her death My suit of brown twill red flannel shirt boots and sou wester with ear muffs attached were ready for me before the heaviest winter storm The jacket and trousers were modelled for a boy of nine instead of a girl not yet eight but grandma assured me that being all wool the rain would soon shrink them to my size also that the boots which were too wide in the heel and hurt my toes would shape themselves to my feet and prevent the old frost bites from returning I was very unhappy while she helped me to dress and pinned up my braids and hid them under my storm hat and I was absolutely wretched when she kissed me and said It would be hard to find a prettier little boy than you are After again admonishing me to let no one on the range know I was a girl and to answer all questions civilly and ride on quickly after my string of cows she promised that if I helped her thus through the short days of the rainy season she would give back my girl clothes in the Spring and never again ask me to wear others She led me to where Charlie was tied to a tree I stepped on to a block from there to a stump put my foot into the stirrup and clumsily raised myself into the seat of an old dragoon saddle My eyes were too full of tears to see but grandma put the reins in my hand and started me away Away where To drive up the cows Yes and into wider fields of thought than she recked After I got beyond our road I stopped Charlie and made him turn his face toward mine and told him all that had happened and just how I felt The good old horse seemed to understand for no friend could be more faithful than Charlie thenceforth proved to me He learned to separate our cows from the many strange ones on the plain to move faster when it rained to choose the crossings that were safe and to avoid the branches that might scrape me from his back Grandma was pleased to learn that drivers on the range when inquiring about strays addressed me as Bubbie My humiliation however was so great that though Georgia and I were room mates and had secret day meetings I never went near her when others were by She was allowed to play oftener with neighbors children and occasionally spent a week or more with missus Bergwald helping her to care for her little daughter While away she learned fine needlework had fewer crying spells and was more contented than at home with grandma This happiness in her life added much to mine and it came to pass that the duty which had seemed such a bitter task became a pleasure As the days lengthened chum Charlie and I kept earlier hours and crept closer to the heart of nature We read the signs of the day in the dawn tints watched the coyotes and other night prowlers slink back to their lairs saw where the various birds went to housekeeping and how they cared for their young knew them also by their call and song We could show where Johnnie jump ups and baby blue eyes grew thickest where the cream cups were largest and where the wild forget me nots blossomed We explored each nook and corner for miles around and felt that everything that God had made and man had not put his mark upon was ours The aged boughs heaped by the wind in wild confusion about the maimed and storm beaten tree trunks seemed to assume fantastic shapes and expressions as we approached from different directions or viewed them under light and shadow of changing weather Gnarled and twisted they became elves and goblins and the huge piles of storm wreckage were transformed into weird old ruins and deserted castles like those which grandma had described to me in legends of the Rhine At twilight I was often afraid to pass lest giants and ghosts should show themselves between uncanny arches Then all that was needed was a low cluck to Charlie and off he would start on a run past imaginary dangers It was late in the Spring when grandma gave back my girl clothes and wearily told me she had hired a boy to drive in the cows and a man to help to milk and that Georgia was to look after the house and I to take her own place in the corrals because she was sick and would have to be cupped and bled before she could be better Grandpa came home early next day and everything was ready for the treatment immediately after the noon meal Grandma looked so grave and gave so many instructions about household and dairy matters that Georgia and I feared that we might lose her I verily believe we would have slipped away during the operation had grandpa not commanded us to stay near as he might need assistance In dread we watched every movement saw what made grandma s face pale and where the sore spots were Indeed our sympathies were so strained our fingers fumbled awkwardly as we adjusted the covers about her weakened form As soon as her illness became known neighbors came from far and near to help with the dairy work or nursing and keen was their disappointment when she replied I thank you for your kind offers but the children are handy and know my ways Regularly she asked me about the cows and if the goats had been milked the eggs gathered and the pigs fed She remembered and planned the work but did not regain strength as rapidly as she wished nor did she resume her place in the corrals even after she was up and around but had a way of coming unexpectedly to see if her instructions were being carried out One day she became quite angry on finding me talking with a stranger He was well dressed and spoke like a gentleman touched his hat as she drew near and remarked This little girl tells me she is an orphan and that you have been very kind to her Grandma was uncivil in her reply and he went away Then she warned me Beware of wolves in sheep s clothing and insisted that no man wearing such fine clothes and having such soft hands could earn an honest living I did not repeat what he had told me of his little daughter who lived in a beautiful home in New York and was about my age and had no sister and his wish that I were there with her I could not understand what harm there was in his questions or my answers Did I not remind him of his own little girl And had I not heard lonely miners tell of times when they gladly would have walked ten miles to shake hands and talk a few moments with a child

2691_156755_000008_000000	train-clean-100	At that auspicious time she was but eighteen years of age and second cook in the principal tavern of Neuchatel Switzerland 
none	none	Georgia and I sat entranced as with animated words and gestures she pictured the appearance of the buglers and heralds who came weeks in advance to announce the date on which the Emperor and Empress would arrive in that town and dine at the tavern then the excitement and enthusiastic preparations which followed She described the consultations between the Herr Wirth and the Frau Wirthin and their maids and how finally Marie s butter piece for the christening feast of the child of the Herr Graf was remembered and she the lowly second cook was told that a corner in the cellar would be set apart for her especial use and that she should have her evenings to devote to the work and three groschen seven and a half cents added to her week s wages if she would produce a fitting centrepiece for the Emperor s table 
2691_156755_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Five consecutive nights she designed and modelled until the watchman s midnight cry drove her from work and at three o clock in the morning of the sixth day she finished 
2691_156755_000009_000001	train-clean-100	And what a centrepiece it was 
none	none	It required the careful handling of no less than three persons to get it in place on the table where the Emperor might see at a glance the groups of figures along the splendid highway which was spanned by arches and terminated with a magnificently wrought gateway surmounted by His Majesty s coat of arms We scarcely winked as we listened to the rest of the happenings on that memorable day She recounted how she had dropped everything at the sound of martial music and from the tiny open space at the window caught glimpses of the passing pageant of the royal coaches of the maids of honor of Josephine in gorgeous attire of the snow white poodle snuggled close in the Empress s arms 
2691_156755_000010_000002	train-clean-100	Then she told how she heard a heavy thud by the kitchen fire which made her rush back only to discover that the head cook had fallen to the floor in a faint 
2691_156755_000011_000000	train-clean-100	She gave the quick call which brought the Frau Wirthin to the scene of confusion where in mute agony she looked from servant to servant until with hands clasped and eyes full of tears she implored Marie take the higher place for the day and with God s help make no mistake 
none	none	Then she went on to say that while the dinner was being served the Emperor admired the butter piece and on hearing that it was the work of a young maidservant in the house commanded that she be brought in to receive commendation of himself and the Empress Again the Frau Wirthin rushed to the kitchen in great excitement and knowing that Marie s face was red from heat of the fire that she was nervous from added responsibilities and not dressed for presentation cried with quivering lips
2691_156755_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah Marie the butter piece is so grand it brings us into trouble The great Emperor asks to see thee and thou must come 
2691_156755_000014_000000	train-clean-100	She told how poor red faced bewildered Marie dropped her ladle and stared at the speaker then rolled down her sleeves while the Frau Wirthin tied her own best white apron around her waist at the same time instructing her in the manner in which she must hold her dress at the sides between thumb and forefinger and spread the skirt wide in making a low reverential bow 
2691_156755_000014_000001	train-clean-100	But Marie was so upset that she realized only that her heart was beating like a trip hammer and her form shaking like an aspen leaf while being led before those august personages 
2691_156755_000014_000002	train-clean-100	Yet after it was all over she was informed that the Emperor and Empress had spoken kindly to her and that she herself had made her bow and backed out of the room admirably for one in her position and ought to feel that the great honor conferred upon her had covered with glory all the ills and embarrassments she had suffered 
2691_156755_000015_000000	train-clean-100	To impress us more fully with the importance of that event grandma had Georgia and me stand up on our cellar floor and learn to make that deferential bow she by turns taking the parts of the Frau Wirthin the Emperor and the Empress 
2691_156755_000016_000000	train-clean-100	She now finished her modelling with a dainty centrepiece for the bride s table and let me go with her when she carried it to the Vallejo mansion 
2691_156755_000016_000001	train-clean-100	It gave great satisfaction and while the family and guests were admiring it Senora Vallejo took me by the hand saying in her own musical tongue Come little daughter and play while you wait 
2691_156755_000017_000000	train-clean-100	She led me to a room that had pictures on the walls and left me surrounded by toys 
2691_156755_000017_000001	train-clean-100	But I could not play 
2691_156755_000017_000002	train-clean-100	My eyes wandered about until they became riveted on one corner of the room where stood a child s crib which looked like gold 
none	none	Its head and foot boards were embellished with figures of angels and a canopy of lace like a fleecy cloud hovered over them 
2691_156755_000017_000004	train-clean-100	The bed was white but the pillows were covered with pink silk and encased in slips of linen lawn exquisite with rare needlework 
none	none	I touched it before I left the room wondering what the little girl dreamed in that beautiful bed and on the way home grandma and I discussed all these things The linen pillow slips were as fine as those Senorita Isabella Fitch showed me when she gave me the few highly prized lessons in simple drawn work and her cousin Senorita Leese had taught me hemming These young ladies were related to the Vallejos and also lived in large houses facing the plaza and were always kind to Georgia and me 
2691_156755_000018_000001	train-clean-100	In fact some of my sweetest memories of Sonoma are associated with these three Spanish homes 
none	none	Their people never asked unfeeling questions nor repeated harrowing tales and I did not learn until I was grown that they had been among the large contributors to the fund for the relief of our party I have a faint recollection of listening to the chimes of the wedding bells and later of hearing that Captain Frisbie had taken his bride away but that is all for about that time dear old Jakie returned to us in ill health and our thoughts and care turned to him He was so feeble and wasted that grandma sent for the French physician who had recently come among us 
2691_156755_000019_000002	train-clean-100	Even he said that he feared that Jakie had stayed away too long 
2691_156755_000019_000003	train-clean-100	After months of treatment the doctor shook his head saying I have done my best with the medicines at hand 
2691_156755_000019_000004	train-clean-100	The only thing that remains to be tried is a tea steeped from the nettle root That may give relief 
2691_156755_000020_000000	train-clean-100	As soon as we could get ready after the doctor uttered those words Georgia and I equipped with hoe large knife and basket were on our way to the Sonoma River 
2691_156755_000020_000001	train-clean-100	We had a full two miles and a half to walk but did not mind that because we were going for something that might take Jakie s pains away 
2691_156755_000020_000002	train-clean-100	Georgia was to press down the nettle stems with a stick while I cut them off and hoed up the roots 
2691_156755_000021_000000	train-clean-100	The plants towered luxuriantly above our heads making the task extremely painful 
2691_156755_000021_000001	train-clean-100	No sooner would I commence operations than the branches slipping from under the stick would brush Georgia s face and strike my hands and arms with stinging force and by the time we had secured the required number of roots we were covered with fiery welts 
none	none	We took off our shoes and stockings waded into the stream and bathed our faces hands and arms then rested and ate the lunch we had brought with us As we turned homeward we observed several Indians approaching by the bushy path the one in front staggering and his squaw behind making frantic motions to us to hurry over the snake fence near by 
2691_156755_000022_000001	train-clean-100	This we did as speedily as possible and succeeded none too soon for as we reached the ground on the safe side he stopped us and angrily demanded the contents of our basket 
none	none	We opened it and when he saw what it contained he stamped his wabbling foot and motioned us to be off 
2691_156755_000022_000003	train-clean-100	We obeyed with alacrity for it was our first experience with a drunken Indian and greatly alarmed us 
none	none	The tea may have eased Jakie s pain but it did not accomplish what we had hoped One morning late in Summer he asked grandpa to bring a lawyer and witnesses so that he could make his will This request made us all move about very quietly and feel very serious 
2691_156755_000023_000003	train-clean-100	After the lawyer went away grandma told us that Jakie had willed us each fifty dollars in gold and the rest of his property to grandpa and herself 
none	none	A few weeks later when the sap ceased flowing to the branches of the trees and the yellow leaves were falling we laid Jakie beside other friends in the oak grove within sight of our house 
2691_156755_000024_000000	train-clean-100	Grandma put on deep mourning but Georgia and I had only black sun bonnets which we wore with heartfelt grief 
none	none	The following Spring grandpa had the grave enclosed with a white paling and we children planted Castilian rose bushes at the head and foot of the mound and carried water to them from the house and in time their branches met and the grave was a bed of fragrant blossoms 
2691_156755_000025_000000	train-clean-100	One day as I was returning from it with my empty pail a tidy black eyed woman came up to me and said 
none	none	I m a Cherokee Indian the wife of one of the three drovers that sold the Brunners them long horned cattle that was delivered the other day I know who you are and if you ll sit on that log by me I ll tell you something 
2691_156755_000027_000000	train-clean-100	We took the seats shaded by the fence and she continued with unmistakable pride I can read and write quite a little and me and the men belong to the same tribe 
2691_156755_000027_000001	train-clean-100	We drove our band of cattle across the plains and over the Sierras and have sold them for more than we expected to get 
none	none	We are going back the same road but first I wanted to see you little girls I heard lots about your father s party and how you all suffered in the mountains and that no one seems to remember what became of his body 
2691_156755_000027_000004	train-clean-100	Now child I tell the truth 
none	none	I stood by your father s grave and read his name writ on the headboard and come to tell you that he was buried in a long grave near his own camp in the mountains 
2691_156755_000027_000006	train-clean-100	I m glad at seeing you but am going away wishing you wasn t so cut off from your own people 
none	none	So earnest was she that I believed what she told me and was sorry that I could not answer all her questions We parted as most people did in those days feeling that the meeting was good and the parting might be forever CHAPTER XXVIII ELITHA FRANCES AND mister MILLER VISIT US missus BRUNNER CLAIMS US AS HER CHILDREN THE DAGUERREOTYPE The spring tide of eighteen fifty two was bewitchingly beautiful hills and plain were covered with wild flowers in countless shapes and hues They were so friendly that they sprang up in dainty clusters close to the house doors or wherever an inch of ground would give them foothold They seemed to call to me and I looked into their bright faces threw myself among them and hugged as many as my arms could encircle then laid my ear close to the ground to catch the low sound of moving leaf and stem or of the mysterious ticking in the earth which foretells the coming of later plants Sometimes in my ecstasy I would shut my eyes and lie still for a while then open them inquiringly to assure myself that all my favorites were around me still and that it was not all a day dream This lovely season mellowed into the Summer which brought a most unexpected letter from our sister Frances who had been living all these years with the family of mister James F Reed in San Jose Childlike she wrote I am happy but there has not been a day since I left Sutter s Fort that I haven t thought of my little sisters and wanted to see them Hiram Miller our guardian says he will take me to see you soon and Elitha is going too After the first few days of wondering grandma rarely mentioned our prospective visitors nor did she show Georgia or me the letter she herself had received from Elitha but we re read ours until we knew it by heart and were filled with delightful anticipations We imagined that our blue eyed sister with the golden curls would look as she did when we parted and recalled many things that we had said and done together at the Fort I asked grandma what guardian meant and after she explained I was not pleased with mine and dreaded his coming for I had not forgotten how mister Miller had promised me a lump of sugar that night in the Sierras and then did not have it for me after I had walked the required distance nor could I quite forgive the severe punishment he administered next morning because I refused to go forward and cried to return to mother when he told me that I must walk as far as Georgia and Frances did that day Autumn was well advanced before the lumbering old passenger coach brought our long expected guests from the embarcadero and after the excitement of the meeting was over I stealthily scanned each face and figure mister Miller s stocky form in coarse dark clothes his cold gray eyes uneven locks stubby beard and teeth and lips browned by tobacco chewing were not unfamiliar but he looked less tired more patient and was a kindlier spoken man than I had remembered Elitha well dressed tall slender and regular of feature had the complexion and sparkling black eyes which mark the handsome brunette I was more surprised than disappointed however to see that the girl of twelve who slipped one arm around Georgia and the other around me in a long loving embrace had nothing about her that resembled our little sister Frances except her blue eyes and motherly touch The week of their visit was joyous indeed Many courtesies were extended by friends with whom we had travelled from time to time on the plains One never to be forgotten afternoon was spent with the Boggs family at their beautiful home amid orchard and vineyard near the foothills On Sunday the bell of the South Methodist Church called us to service In those days the men occupied the benches on one side of the building and the women and children on the other and I noticed that several of the young men found difficulty in keeping their eyes from straying in our direction and after service more than one came to inquire after grandma s health mister Miller passed so little time in our company that I remember only his arrival and his one serious talk with grandma when he asked her the amount due her on account of the trouble and expense we two children had been since she had taken us in charge She told him significantly that there was nothing to pay because we were her children and that she was abundantly able to take care of us In proof she handed him a daguerreotype taken the previous year It pictured herself comfortably seated and one of us standing at either side with an elbow resting upon her shoulder and a chubby face leaning against the uplifted hand She was arrayed in her best cap handsome embroidered black satin dress and apron lace sleeve ruffs kerchief watch and chain We were twin like in lace trimmed dresses of light blue dimity striped with a tan colored vine blue sashes and hair ribbons and each held a bunch of flowers in her hand It was a costly trinket in a case inlaid with pink roses in mother of pearl and she was very proud of it Grandma s answer to mister Miller was a death knell to Elitha s hopes and plans in our behalf Her little daughter had been dead more than a year Sister Leanna had recently married and gone to a home of her own and the previous week the place made vacant by the marriage had been given to Frances with the ready approval of Hiram Miller and mister and missus Reed She had now come to Sonoma hoping that if mister Miller should pay grandma for the care we had been to her she would consent to give us up in order that we four sisters might be reunited in one home Elitha now foresaw that such a suggestion would not only result in failure but arouse grandma s antagonism and cut off future communication between us CHAPTER XXIX GREAT SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC

3994_156757_000003_000000	train-clean-360	These whispered comments which did not improve our situation suddenly ceased for the smallpox made its appearance in Sonoma and helpers were needed to care for the afflicted 
none	none	Grandma had had the disease in infancy and could go among the patients without fear 
3994_156757_000003_000002	train-clean-360	In fact she had such confidence in her method of treating it that she would not have Georgia and me vaccinated while the epidemic prevailed insisting that if we should take the disease she could nurse us through it without disfigurement and we would thenceforth be immune 
3994_156757_000003_000003	train-clean-360	She did not expose us during what she termed the catching stage but after that had passed she called us to share her work and become familiar with its details and taught us how to brew the teas make the ointments and apply them 
3994_156757_000004_000000	train-clean-360	I do not remember a death among her patients and only two who were badly disfigured 
none	none	One was our pretty Miss Sallie Lewis who had the dread disease in confluent form 
3994_156757_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Grandma was called hurriedly in the night because the afflicted girl in delirium had loosened the straps which held her upon her bed and while her attendant was out of the room had rushed from the house into the rain and was not found until after she had become thoroughly drenched 
none	none	Grandma had never before treated such serious conditions yet strove heroically and helped to restore Miss Sallie to health but could not keep the cruel imprints from her face 
3994_156757_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The other was our arch enemy Castle who seemed so near death that one night as grandma was peering into the darkness for signal lights from the homes of the sick she exclaimed impulsively Hark children there goes the Catholic bell 
3994_156757_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Count its strokes

3994_156757_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Later he came to us to recuperate and was the most exacting and profane man we ever waited on 
3994_156757_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He conceived a special grudge against Georgia whom he had caught slyly laughing when she first observed the change in his appearance

none	none	Frequently had he twitted my sensitive sister about her little nose and had once made her very angry in the presence of others by offering to tell her a story then continuing God and the devil take turns in shaping noses 
3994_156757_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Now look at mine large and finely shaped

3994_156757_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Georgia fled and cried in anger over this indignity declaring that she hated Castle and would not be sorry if something should happen to spoil his fine nose 
3994_156757_000011_000001	train-clean-360	So when he came to us from the sick room soured and crestfallen because disease had deeply pitted and seamed that feature which had formerly been his pride she laughingly whispered Well I don t care my nose could never look like his even if I had the smallpox for there is not so much of it to spoil 
none	none	Our dislike of the man became intense and later when we discovered that he was to be bartender at grandpa s bar and board at our house we held an indignation meeting in the back yard This was more satisfaction to Georgia than to me for she had the pleasure of declaring that if grandma took that man to board she would be a Schweitzer child no longer she would stop speaking German make her clothes like American children s and that she knew her friend missus Bergwald would give her a home if grandma should send her away Here the meeting was suddenly interrupted by the discovery that grandma was standing behind us We did not know how long she had been there nor how much she had overheard nor which she meant to strike with the switch she had in her hand However we were sitting close together and my left arm felt the sting and it aroused in me the spirit of rebellion I felt that I had outgrown such correction nor had I deserved it and I told her that she should never never strike me again Then I walked to the house alone A few moments later Georgia came up to our room and found me dressing myself with greatest care In amazement she asked Eliza where are you going and was dumbfounded when I answered To find another home for us In the lower hall I encountered grandma whose anger had cooled and she asked the question Georgia had 
3994_156757_000015_000001	train-clean-360	I raised my sleeve showed the welt on my arm and replied I am going to see if I can t find a home where they will treat me kindly 
3994_156757_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Poor grandma was conscience stricken drew me into her own room and did not let me leave it until after she had soothed my hurts and we had become friends again 
3994_156757_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Georgia went to missus Bergwald s and remained quite a while 
3994_156757_000017_000001	train-clean-360	When she came back speaking English and insisting that she was an American grandma became very angry and threatened to send her away among strangers then hesitated as if realizing how fully Georgia belonged to me and I to her and that we would cling together whatever might happen 
3994_156757_000017_000002	train-clean-360	In her perplexity she besought missus Bergwald s advice 
3994_156757_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Now missus Bergwald was a native of Stockholm a lady of rare culture and used the French language in conversing with grandma 
none	none	She spoke feelingly of my little sister said that she was companionable willing and helpful anxious to learn the nicer ways of work and ladylike accomplishments She could see no harm in Georgia wishing to remain an American since to love one s own people and country was natural 
3994_156757_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Thereafter grandma changed her methods 
none	none	She gave us our dolls to look at and keep among our possessions likewise most of our keepsakes She also unlocked her carefully tended parlor and we three spent pleasant evenings there 
3994_156757_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Sometimes she would let us bring her from under the sofa her gorgeous prints illustrating Wilhelm Tell and would repeat the text relating to the scenes as we examined each picture with eager interest 
3994_156757_000020_000000	train-clean-360	We were also allowed to go to Sunday school oftener and later she sent me part of the term to the select school for girls recently established by doctor Ver Mehr an Episcopalian clergyman 
3994_156757_000020_000001	train-clean-360	In fact my tuition was expected to offset the school s milk bill yet that did not lessen my enthusiasm 
3994_156757_000020_000002	train-clean-360	I was eager for knowledge 
3994_156757_000020_000003	train-clean-360	I also expected to meet familiar faces in that great building which had been the home of mister Jacob Leese 
none	none	But upon entering I saw only finely dressed young ladies from other parts of the State promenading in the halls and small girls flitting about in the yard like bright winged butterflies Some had received letters from home and were calling out the news others were engaged in games that were strange to me 
3994_156757_000020_000005	train-clean-360	The bell rang I followed to the recitation hall and was assigned a seat below the rest because I was the only small Sonoma girl yet enrolled 
none	none	I made several life long friends at that institute still it was easy to see that saint Mary s Hall was established for pupils who had been reared in the lap of wealth and ease not for those whose hands were rough like mine 
3994_156757_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Nor was there a class for me 
none	none	I seemed to be between grades and had the discouragement of trying to keep up with girls older and farther advanced My educational advantages in Sonoma closed with my half term at saint Mary s Hall grandma believing that I had gone to school long enough to be able to finish my studies without teachers Georgia was more fortunate When Miss Hutchinson opened The Young Ladies Seminary in the Fall grandma decided to lend it a helping hand by sending her a term as a day scholar 
3994_156757_000023_000002	train-clean-360	My delighted sister was soon in touch with a crowd of other little girls and brought home many of their bright sayings for my edification

3994_156757_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Grandma was pleased that I was invited and declared that she would send a liberal donation of milk and cheese as a mark of appreciation 
3994_156757_000026_000000	train-clean-360	I caught much of Georgia s spirit of delight for I had a vivid recollection of the grand dinner given in commemoration of our very first legally appointed Thanksgiving Day in California I had only to close my eyes and in thought would reappear the longest and most bountifully spread table I had ever seen 
3994_156757_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Turkey chicken and wild duck at the ends a whole roasted pig in the centre and more than enough delicious accompaniments to cover the spaces between

3994_156757_000027_000000	train-clean-360	There I wore a dark calico dress and sun bonnet both made by poor missus McCutchen of the Donner Party who had to take in sewing for a livelihood but to the Seminary I should wear grandpa s gift a costly alpaca changeable in the sunlight to soft mingling bluish and greenish colors of the peacock 
3994_156757_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Its wide skirt reached to my shoetops and the gathers to its full waist were gauged to a sharp peak in front 
3994_156757_000027_000002	train-clean-360	A wide open V from the shoulder down to the peak displayed an embroidered white Swiss chemisette 
3994_156757_000027_000003	train-clean-360	The sleeves small at the wrist were trimmed with folds of the material and a quilling of white lace at the hand 
none	none	On the all important morning grandma was anxious that I should look well and after she had looped my braids with bows of blue ribbon and fastened my dress she brought forth my dainty bonnet her own gift Deft fingers had shirred the pale blue silk over a frame which had been cut down from ladies size arranged an exquisite spray of Marechal Niel rosebuds and foliage on the outside and quilled a soft white ruching around the face which emphasized the Frenchy style and finish so pleasing to grandma

subject CHAPTER XXX IDEALS AND LONGINGS THE FUTURE CHRISTMAS At the time of which I now speak I was in my eleventh year but older in feeling and thought I had ideals and wanted to live up to them and my way was blocked by difficulties Often in the cowyard I would say to the dumb creatures before me I shall milk you dry and be kind to you as long as I stay but I shall not always be here doing this kind of work These feelings had been growing since the beginning of grandpa s partnership in that bar room Neither he nor grandma saw harm in the business They regarded it as a convenient place where men could meet and spend a social evening and where strangers might feel at home Yet who could say that harm did not emanate from that bar I could not but wish that grandpa had no interest in it I did not want to blame him for he was kind by nature and had been more than benefactor to Georgia and me Fond recollection was ever bringing to mind joys he had woven into our early childhood Especially tender and precious thoughts were associated with that night long ago when he hurried home to inspect a daguerreotype that had just been taken Grandma handed it to him with the complaisant remark Mine and Georgia s sind fine but Eliza s shows that she forgot herself and ist watching how the thing ist being made Grandpa looked at it in silence observing that grandma s likeness was natural and Georgia s perfect in fact pretty as could be while I not being tall enough to rest my elbow comfortably upon grandma s shoulder stood awkwardly with my flowers drooping and eyes turned intently watching in the direction of the operator Regretfully I explained Grandpa mine was best two times for Georgia moved in the first one and grandma in the next and the pictureman said after each We must try again And he would have tried yet again for me but the sun was low and grandma said she was sorry but this would have to do Lovingly he then drew me to his side saying Never mind mein Schatz my treasure let grandma and Georgia keep this and when that pictureman comes back grandpa will sit for his picture and thou shalt stand at his knee He ll buy thee a long gold chain to wear around thy neck and thou shalt be dressed all in white and look like an angel Being younger than grandma and more fond of amusements he had taken us to many entertainments notably Odd Fellows picnics and dinners where he wore the little white linen apron which we thought would be cute for our dolls He often reminded grandma that she should teach us to speak the high German so that we might appear well among gentlefolk and my cherished keepsakes included two wee gold dollars and a fifty cent piece of the same bright metal which he had given me after fortunate sales from the herds But dearest of all is remembrance of the evening long ago when he befriended us at Sutter s Fort Still not even those tender recollections could longer hold in check my resentment against the influences and associations which were filtering through that bar room and robbing me of companions and privileges that I valued More than once had I determined to run away and then desisted knowing that I should leave two lonely old people grieving over my seeming ingratitude This question of duty to self and to those who had befriended me haunted my working hours went with me to church and Sunday school and troubled my mind when I was supposed to be asleep Strange indeed would it have seemed to me could I then have known that before my thirtieth year I should be welcomed in the home of the military chief of our nation Strange also that the young Lieutenant William Tecumseh Sherman who when visiting in Sonoma came with his fellow officers to the Brunner farm should have attained that dignity Equally impossible would it have been then to conceive that in so short a time I a happy mother and the wife of a Congressional Representative should be a guest at the brilliant receptions of the foreign diplomats and at the Executive Mansion in the city of Washington Is it any wonder that in later years when my mind reverted to those days I almost questioned my identity Georgia s return from missus Bergwald s before Christmas gave me a chance to talk matters over with her and we decided that we must leave our present surroundings Yet how to get away and when puzzled us Our only hope of escape seemed to be to slip off together some moonlight night But my sister remarked gravely we can t do it before Christmas You forget the white flannel skirt that I am embroidering for grandma the pillow slips that you are hemstitching and trimming with lace for her and the beautiful white shirt that you have for grandpa She was sure that not to stay and give them as we had planned would be as bad as breaking a promise So we took out our work and hid ourselves to sew a while My undertaking was not so large or elaborate as hers and when I finished she still had quite a piece to do and was out of floss She had pin pricked from an embroidered silk shawl on to strips of white paper the outline of a vine representing foliage buds and blossoms then basted the paper in place around the skirt The colors were shaded green and pink Unable to get the floss for the blossoms she had bought narrow pink silk braid and outlined each rose and bud then embroidered the foliage in green Some might have thought it a trifle gaudy but to me it seemed beautiful and I was proud of her handiwork I washed starched and ironed the pillow slips while grandma was from home and they did look well for I had taken great pains in doing my work Several days before the appointed time grandma in great good humor showed us the dresses she had been hiding from us and then and there like three children unable to keep their secrets longer we exchanged gifts and were as pleased as if we had waited until Christmas morning CHAPTER XXXI THE WIDOW STEIN AND LITTLE JOHNNIE DAUGHTERS OF A SAINTED MOTHER ESTRANGEMENT AND DESOLATION A RESOLUTION AND A VOW MY PEOPLE ARRIVE AND PLAN TO BEAR ME AWAY On the first of September eighteen fifty five a widow whom I shall call Stein and her little son Johnnie came to visit grandma She considered herself a friend by reason of the fact that she and her five children had been hospitably entertained in our home two years earlier upon their arrival in California For grandpa in particular she professed a high regard because her husband had been his bartender and as such had earned money enough to bring his family from Europe and also to pay for the farm which had come to her at his death Mother and son felt quite at home and in humor to enjoy their self appointed stay of two weeks Despite her restless eye and sinister smile she could be affable and although at first I felt an indescribable misgiving in her presence it wore away and I often amused Johnnie while she and grandma talked As if to hasten events missus Bergwald had sent for Georgia almost at the beginning of the visit of the Steins and after her departure missus Stein insisted on helping me with the chores and then on my sitting with her during grandma s busiest hour She seemed deeply interested in California s early history and when I would stop talking she would ply me with questions So I told her how poor everybody was before the discovery of gold how mothers would send their boys to grandma s early morning fire for live coals because they had no matches or tinder boxes how neighbors brought their coffee and spices to grind in her mills how the women gathered in the afternoons under her great oak tree to talk sew and eagerly listen to the reading of extracts from letters and papers that had come from friends away back in the States I told her how in case of sickness one neighbor would slip over and cook the family breakfast for the sick woman others would drop in later wash the dishes and put the house in order and so by turns and shares the washing ironing and mending would be done and by the time the sick woman would be up and around she would have no neglected work to discourage her Also we talked of how flags were used for day signals and lights by night in calls for help Our last talk was on Saturday morning between work She questioned me in regard to the amount and location of the property of the Brunners then wanted to hear all about my sisters in Sacramento and wondered that we did not go to live with them I explained that Elitha had written us several times asking us to come but knowing that grandma would be displeased we had not read her those parts of the letters lest she forbid our correspondence entirely I added that we were very sorry that she could not like those who were dear to us Finally having exhausted information on several subjects missus Stein gave me a searching glance and after a marked silence continued I don t wonder that you love grandpa and grandma as much as you tell me and it is a pity about these other things that aren t pleasant Don t you think it would be better for you to live with your sister and grandma could have some real German children to live here She is old and can t help liking her own kind of people best I did not have an unkind thought in mind yet I did confess that I should like to live well and grow up to be like my mother In thoughtless chatter I continued that more nice people came to visit grandma and to talk with us before the town filled with strangers and before Americans lived in the good old Spanish houses and before the new churches and homes were built She led me to speak of mother then wondered at my vivid recollections since I had parted from her so young She was very attentive as I told how Georgia and I spoke of her when we were by ourselves and that friends did not let us forget her I even cited a recent instance when the teacher had invited us and two other young girls to go to the Vallejo pear orchard for all the fruit we wished to eat and when he offered the money in payment the old Spanish gentleman in charge said Pay for three But we are five said the teacher Then the Don blessed himself with the sign of the cross and pointing to Georgia and me replied Those two are daughters of a sainted mother and are always welcome At noon grandma told me that she and the Steins would be ready to go down town immediately after dinner and that I must wash the dishes and finish baking the bread in the round oven We parted in best of humor and I went to work The dishes and bread received first attention Then I scrubbed the brick floor in the milk house swept the store room and front yard gathered the eggs fed the chickens and rebuilt the fire for supper I fancied grandma would be pleased with all I had accomplished and laughed to myself as I saw the three coming home leaning close to each other in earnest conversation To my surprise the Steins went directly to their own room and grandma did not speak but closed her eyes as she passed me That was her way and I knew that it would be useless to ask what had offended her So I took my milk pails and wondering went to the cow corrals I could not imagine what had happened yet felt hurt and uncomfortable Returning with the milk I saw Johnnie playing by the tree too near the horse s feet and warned him As he moved grandma stepped forward and stood in front of me her face white with rage I set my buckets down and standing between them listened as she said in German Oh false one thou didst not think this morning that I would so soon find thee out Thou wast not smart enough to see that my friend missus Stein was studying thee so that she could let me know what kind of children I had around me And thou like a snake in the grass hast been sticking out thy tongue behind my back Thou pretendest that thou art not staying here to get my money and property yet thou couldst tell her all I had Thou wouldst not read all in the letters from thy fine sisters Thou wouldst rather stay here until I die and then be rich and spend it with them She stopped as if to catch her breath and I could only answer Grandma I have not done what thou sayest She continued I have invited people to come here this night and thou shalt stand before them and listen while I tell what I have done for thee and how thou hast thanked me Now go finish thy work eat thy supper and come when I call thee I heard her call but don t know how I got into the room nor before how many I stood I know that my head throbbed and my feet almost refused to support my body as I listened to grandma who in forceful language declared that she had taken me a starveling and reared me until I was almost as tall as she herself that she had loved and trusted me and taught me everything I knew and that I had that day blackened the home that had sheltered me wounded the hand that had fed me and proved myself unworthy the love that had been showered upon me missus Stein helped her through an account of our morning chat misconstruing all that had passed between us I remained silent until the latter had announced that almost the first thing that she had noticed was that we children were of a selfish jealous disposition and that Georgia was very cross when her little Johnnie came home wearing a hat that grandpa had bought him Then I turned upon her saying missus Stein you forget that Georgia has not seen that hat You know that grandma bought it after Georgia went away She sprang toward me then turned to grandma and asked if she was going to let an underling insult a guest in her house I did not wait for the reply I fled out into the dark and made my way to the weird old tree trunk in the back yard Thence I could see the lights from the windows and at times hear the sound of voices There I could stand in the starlight and look up to the heavens I had been there before but never in such a heartsick and forlorn condition I was too overwrought to think yet had to do something to ease the tension I moved around and looked toward Jakie s grave then returned to the side of the tree trunk which had escaped the ravages of fire and ran my finger up and down feeling the holes which the red headed woodpecker had bored and filled with acorns A flutter in the air aroused me It was the old white faced owl leaving the hollow in the live oak for the night s hunt I faced about and saw her mate fly after her Then in the stillness that followed I stretched both arms toward heaven and cried aloud O God I m all alone take care of me The spell was broken I grew calmer and began to think and to plan I pictured Georgia asleep in a pretty house two miles away wondered how I could get word to her and what she would say when told that we would go away together from Sonoma and not take anything that grandpa or grandma had given us I remembered that of the fund which we had started by hemming new and washing soiled handkerchiefs for the miners there still remained in her trunk seven dollars and eighty five cents and in mine seven dollars and fifty cents If this was not enough to take us to Sacramento we might get a chance as Sister Leanna had to work our way I was still leaning against the tree trunk when the moon began to peep over the eastern mountains and I vowed by its rising that before it came up in its full Georgia and I should be in Sacramento I heard grandma s call from the door which she opened and quickly closed and I knew by experience that I should find a lighted candle on the table and that no one would be in the room to say good night I slept little but when I arose in the morning I was no longer trouble tossed I knew what I would say to grandma if she should give me the chance Grandpa who had come home very late did not know what had happened and he and I breakfasted with the men and grandma and the Steins came after we left the room No one offered to help me that morning still I got through my duties before grandma called me to her She seemed more hurt than angry and began by saying On account of thy bad conduct missus Stein is going to shorten her stay She is going to leave on Tuesday and wants me to go with her She says that she has kept back the worst things that thou hast told about me but will tell them to me on the road Trembling with indignation I exclaimed Oh grandma thou hast always told us that it is wrong to speak of the faults of a guest in the house but what dost thou think of one who hath done what missus Stein hath done I did say some of the things she told thee but I did not say them in that way I didn t give them that meaning I didn t utter one unkind word against thee or grandpa I have not been false to thee To prove it I promise to stay and take care of everything while thou goest and hearest what more she hath to tell but after the home coming I leave Nothing that thou canst say will make me change my mind I am thankful for the home I have had but will not be a burden to thee longer I came to thee poor and I will go away poor The Brunner conveyance was at the door on Tuesday morning when grandma and her guest came out to begin their journey Grandpa helped grandma and the widow on to the back seat While he was putting Johnnie in front with the driver I stepped close to the vehicle and extended my hand to grandma saying Good bye don t worry about the dairy while thou art gone for everything will be attended to until thy return but remember then I go On the way back to the house grandpa asked why I did not treat the widow more friendly and I answered Because I don t believe in her To my surprise he replied I don t either but grandma is like a little child in her hands I felt that I ought to tell him I should soon go away but I had never gone to him with home troubles and knew that it would not be right to speak of them in grandma s absence so he quietly went to his duties and I to mine Yet I could not help wondering how grandma could leave me in full charge of her possessions if she believed the stories that had been told her I felt so sure that the guilty one would be found out that it made me light hearted missus Blake came and spent the night with me and the following morning helped to get the breakfast and talked over the cleaning that I wished to do before grandma s return on the coming Saturday morning But God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform and unseen hands were shaping a different course for me I had the milk skimmed and a long row of clean pans in the sunshine before time to hurry the dinner for grandpa and the three men I was tired for I had carried most of the milk to the pig troughs after having finished work which grandma and I had always done together so I sat down under the tree to rest and meditate My thoughts followed the travellers with many questions and the wish that I might hear what missus Stein had to say I might have overstayed my time if the flock of goats had not come up and smelled my hands nibbled at the hem of my apron and tried to chew the cape of my sun bonnet I sprang up and with a shout and clap of my hands scattered them and entered the log kitchen reclosing the lower section of the divided door to keep them from following me within I prepared the dinner and if it lacked the flavor of grandma s cooking those who ate it did not tell me Grandpa lingered a moment to bestow a meed of praise on my work then went off to the back corral to slaughter a beef for the shop I began clearing the table and was turning from it with a vegetable dish in each hand when I caught sight of the shadow of a tall silk hat in the open space above the closed half door Then the hat and its wearer appeared Leaning over the edge of the door he gazed at me standing there as if I were nailed to the floor I was speechless with amazement and it seemed a long while before he remarked lightly You don t seem to know me Yes you are mister Wilder my brother in law I stammered Where is Elitha Illustration SACRAMENTO CITY IN THE EARLY FIFTIES Illustration FRONT STREET SACRAMENTO CITY eighteen fifty He informed me that she and their little daughter were at the hotel in town where they had arrived about noon and that she wanted Georgia and me to be prompt in coming to her at four o clock I told him that we could not do so because Georgia was at missus Bergwald s grandma on a journey beyond Bodego and I at home in charge of the work In surprise he listened then asked But aren t you at all anxious to see your sister and little niece Most earnestly I replied that I was Nevertheless as grandma was away I could not leave the place until after the day s work was done Then I enumerated what was before me He agreed that there was quite enough to keep me busy yet insisted that I ought to keep the appointment for four o clock After his departure I rushed out to grandpa told him who had come and gone and what had passed between us He too regretted the situation but promised that I should spend the evening at the hotel I fairly flew about my work that afternoon and my brain was as active as my hands and feet I was certain that brother and sister had come for us and the absorbing query was How did they happen to arrive at this particular time I also feared there was more trouble before me and remembered my promise to grandma with twinges of regret At half past four I was feeding the hens in the yard and looking up saw a strange carriage approaching Instantly I guessed who was in it and was at the gate before it stopped Elitha greeted me kindly but not cordially She asked why I had not come as requested and then said Go bring the silver thimble Frances left here and the coral necklace I gave you In my nervous haste I could not find the thimble but carried out the necklace She next bade me take the seat beside her thus disclosing her intention of carrying me on picking up Georgia and proceeding to Sacramento She was annoyed by my answer and disappointed in what she termed my lack of pride Calling my attention to my peculiar style of dress and surroundings to my stooped shoulders and callous hands she bade me think twice before I refused the comfortable home she had to offer When assured that I would gladly go on Saturday but was unwilling to leave in grandma s absence she did not urge further simply inquired the way to Georgia and left me I was nursing my disappointment and watching the disappearing carriage when mister Knipp the brewer with his load of empty kegs drew up and asked what I was thinking about so hard It was a relief to see his jolly good natured face and I told him briefly that our people were in town and wished to take us home with them He got down from his wagon to say confidentially Thou must not leave grandpa and grandma because the old man is always kind to thee and though she may sometimes wag a sharp tongue she means well Be patient by and by thou wilt have a nice property the country will have more people for hire and thou wilt not have so hard to work When I told him that I did not want the property and that there were other things I did care for he continued persuasively Women need not so much learning from books Grandma would not know how to scold so grandly if she remembered not so many fine words from Wilhelm Tell and the other books that she knoweth by heart And he climbed back and drove off believing that he had done me a good turn To my great satisfaction Georgia arrived about dark saying that Benjamin had brought her and would call for us later to spend the evening with them When we reached the hotel Elitha received us affectionately and did not refer to the disappointments of the afternoon The time was given up to talk about plans for our future and that night when we two crept into bed I felt that I had been eased of a heavy burden for Benjamin was willing to await grandma s return He also told us that early next morning he would go to Santa Rosa the county seat and apply to be made our guardian in place of Hiram Miller and would also satisfy any claim grandma might have to us or against us adding that we need not take anything away with us except our keepsakes CHAPTER XXXII GRANDMA S RETURN GOOD BYE TO THE DUMB CREATURES GEORGIA AND I ARE OFF FOR SACRAMENTO Meanwhile grandma and her friends had reached Bodego and spent the night there She had not learned anything more terrible that I had said about her and at breakfast told missus Stein that she had had a dream foreboding trouble and would not continue the journey to the Stein home The widow coaxed and insisted that she go the few remaining miles to see her children Then she waxed indignant and let slip the fact that she considered it an outrage that American instead of European born children should inherit the Brunner property and that she had hoped that grandma would select two of her daughters to fill the places from which Georgia and I should be expelled Grandma took a different view of the matter and started homeward immediately after breakfast That very afternoon on the Santa Rosa road whom should she pass but our brother Ben They recognized each other but were too astonished to speak Grandma ordered her driver to whip up saying that she had just seen the red whiskered imp of darkness who had troubled her sleep and she must get to town as fast as possible She stopped first at the butcher shop Before grandpa could express surprise at her unexpected return she showered him with questions in regard to happenings at home and being informed took him to task for having permitted us to visit our people at the hotel He innocently remarked that he knew of no reason why we should not see our relatives that Georgia was spending the day with them and that we both had his permission to go again in the evening In conclusion he said that I had been a faithful hard working little housekeeper and she would find everything in order at home Grandma arrived at home before sunset too excited to be interested in dairy matters She told me all about her trip even to the name she had called my brother in law adding that she knew he was not red whiskered but he was next door to it Later when he came she did not receive him pleasantly nor would she let us go to Elitha Brusquely she demanded to know if I had written to him to come for us and would not believe him when he assured her that neither he nor our sisters had received letter or message from us in months After his departure I could see that she was no longer angry and I dreaded the ensuing day which was destined to be my last on that farm It came with a rosy dawn and I was up to meet it and to say good bye to the many dumb creatures that I had cared for The tension I was under lent me strength to work faster than usual When the breakfast call sounded I had finished in the corrals and was busy in the hen houses having taken care to keep out of grandpa s sight for I knew how he would miss me and I did not want to say the parting words After he and the men were gone grandma came and watched me finish my task then said kindly Come Eliza and eat thy breakfast I looked up and replied Grandma I ate my last meal in thy house last night Dost thou not remember I told thee that I would take care of everything until thy return and then would not be a burden to thee longer I have kept my word and am going away this morning Thou are mine and canst not go but if thou wilt not eat come and help me with the dishes she replied nervously I had planned to slip off and change my dress before meeting her but now after a breath of hesitation I went to dry the dishes hoping that our talk would soon be over I knew it would be hard for both of us for dear childish grandma was ready to forgive and forget what she termed our little troubles I however smarting under the wrong and injustice that had been done me felt she had nothing to forgive and that matters between us had reached the breaking point She was still insisting on her right to keep me when a slight sound caused us both to turn and meeting Georgia s anxious listening gaze grandma appealed to her saying Thou hast heard thy sister s talk but thou hast not been in this fuss and surely wilt not leave me Yes I am going with Eliza was the prompt answer which had no sooner left her lips than grandma resorted to her last expedient she ordered us both to our room and forbade us to leave it until she should hear from grandpa What message she sent him by the milker we never learned Georgia being already dressed for the journey and her trunk containing most of her possessions being at missus Bergwald s had nothing to do but await results I quickly changed my working suit for a better one which had been given me by a German friend from San Francisco Then I laid out my treasured keepsakes In my nervous energy nothing was forgotten I took pains that my clothes against the wall should hang in straight rows that the folded ones should lie in neat piles in my pretty Chinese trunk and that the bunch of artificial flowers which I had always kept for a top centre mark should be exactly in the middle finally that the gray gauze veil used as a fancy covering of the whole should be smoothly tucked in around the clothing This done I gave a parting glance at the dainty effect dropped the cover snapped the queer little brass padlock in place put the key on the table and covered the trunk so that its embossed figures of birds and flowers should be protected from harm We had not remembered to tell Elitha about the hundred dollars which Jakie had willed us so decided to let grandma keep it to cover some of the expense we had been to her also not to ask for our little trinkets stored in her closet With the bundle containing my keepsakes I now sat down by Georgia and listened with bated breath to the sound of grandma s approaching footsteps She entered and hastily began Grandpa says if you want to go and your people are here to take you we have no right to keep you but that I am not to part with you bad friends So I came to shake hands and say good bye But I don t forgive you for going away and I never want to see you or hear from you again She did not ask to see what we were taking away nor did her good bye seem like parting The fear that something might yet arise to prevent our reaching brother and sister impelled us to run the greater part of the distance to the hotel and in less than an hour thereafter we were in the carriage with them on the way to missus Bergwald s prior to taking the road to Sacramento Off at last without a soul in the town knowing it Georgia who had neither said nor done anything to anger grandma was easier in mind and more comfortable in body than I who fasting had borne the trials of the morning I could conceal the cause but not the faint and ill feeling which oppressed me during the morning drive and continued until I had had something to eat at the wayside inn and a rest while the horses were enjoying their nooning I had also been too miserable to feel any interest in what occurred at missus Bergwald s after we stopped to let Georgia get her keepsakes But when the day s travel was over and we were comfortably housed for the night Georgia and I left our brother and sister to their happy hour with their child and sat close together on the outer doorsteps to review the events of the day Our world during that solemn hour was circumscribed reaching back only to the busy scenes of the morning and forward to the little home that should open to us on the morrow When we resumed travel we did not follow the pioneers trail once marked by hoof of deer elk and antelope nor the winding way of the Spanish cabellero but took the short route which the eager tradesman and miner had hewn and tramped into shape On reaching the ferry across the Sacramento River I gazed at the surrounding country in silent amazement Seven and a half years with their marvellous influx of brawn and brain and their output of gold had indeed changed every familiar scene except the snow capped Sierras wrapped in their misty cloak of autumnal blue The broad deep river had given up both its crystal floods and the wild free song which had accompanied it to the sea and become a turbid waterway encumbered with busy craft bringing daily supplies to countless homes and carrying afar the long hidden wealth of ages The tule flat between the water front and Sutter s Fort had become a bustling city The streets running north and south were numbered from first to twenty eighth and those east and west lettered from A to Z and thriving light hearted throngs were pursuing their various occupations upon ground which had once seemed like a Noah s ark to me Yes this was the very spot where with wondering eyes I had watched nature s untamed herds winding through the reedy paths to the river bank to quench their morning and evening thirst As we crossed from J Street to K brother remarked Our journey will end on this street which of you girls will pick out the house before we come to it Elitha would not help us but smiled when after several guesses I said that I wished it to be a white house with brownish steps and a dark door with a white knob Hence great was my satisfaction when near the southeast corner of Eighteenth and K streets we halted in front of a cottage of that description and it was regarded as a lucky omen for me that my first wish amid new scenes should be realized The meeting with Sister Frances and the novelty of the new situation kept up a pleasurable excitement until bed time Then in the stillness of the night in the darkness of the new chamber came the recollection that at about that hour one week ago I sorrowing and alone had stood by a weird old tree trunk in Sonoma and vowed by the rising moon that before it should come up again in its full Georgia and I would be in Sacramento I did not sleep until I had thanked the good Father for sending help to me in my time of need CHAPTER XXXIII THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF SACRAMENTO A GLIMPSE OF GRANDPA THE RANCHO DE LOS CAZADORES MY SWEETEST PRIVILEGE LETTERS FROM THE BRUNNERS It is needless to say that we were grateful for our new home and tried to express our appreciation in words and by sharing the household duties and by helping to make the neat clothing provided for us The first Monday in October was a veritable red letter day Aglow with bright anticipations we hurried off to public school with Frances Not since our short attendance at the pioneer school in Sonoma had Georgia and I been schoolmates and never before had we three sisters started out together with books in hand nor did our expectations overreach the sum of happiness which the day had in store for us The supposition that grandpa and grandma had passed out of our lives was soon disproved for as I was crossing our back yard on the Saturday of that first week of school I happened to look toward Seventeenth Street and saw a string of wagons bringing exhibits from the fair grounds Beside the driver of a truck carrying a closed cage marked Buffalo stood grandpa He had risen from his seat leaned back against the front of the cage folded his arms and was looking at me My long black braids had been cut off and my style of dress changed still he had recognized me I fled into the house and told Elitha what I had seen She too was somewhat disquieted and replied musingly The old gentleman is lonely and may have come to take you girls back with him His presence in Sacramento so soon after our reaching there did seem significant because he had bought that buffalo in eighteen fifty one before she was weaned from the emigrant cow that had suckled and led her in from the great buffalo range and he had never before thought of exhibiting her The following afternoon as we were returning from Sunday school a hand suddenly reached out of the crowd on J Street and touched Georgia s shoulder then stopped me A startled backward glance rested on Castle our old enemy who said Come Grandpa is in town and wants to see you We shook our heads Then he looked at Frances saying All of you come and see the large seal and other things at the fair But she replied emphatically We have not permission and grasping a hand of each hurried us homeward For days thereafter we were on the alert guarding against what we feared might happen Illustration Photographs by Lynwood Abbott PINES OF THE SIERRAS Illustration GENERAL JOHN A SUTTER Illustration colonel J D STEVENSON Our alarm over life moved along smoothly Elitha admonished us to forget the past and prepare for the future She forbade Georgia and me to use the German language in speaking with each other giving as a reason that we should take Frances into our confidence and thoughts as closely as we took one another I was never a morbid child and the days that I did not find a sunbeam in life I was apt to hunt for a rainbow But there in sight of the Sierras the feeling again haunted me that perhaps my mother did not die but had strayed from the trail and later reached the settlement and could not find us Each middle aged woman that I saw ahead of me on the street would thrill me with expectation and I would quicken my steps in order to get a view of her face When I gave up this illusion I still prayed that Keseberg would send for me some day and let me know her end and give me a last message I wanted his call to me to be voluntary so that I might know that his words were true These hopes and prayers were sacred even from Georgia On the twenty fourth of March eighteen fifty six brother Ben took us all to pioneer quarters on Rancho de los Cazadores where their growing interests required the personal attention of the three brothers There we became familiar with the pleasures and also the inconveniences and hardships of life on a cattle ranch We were twenty miles from town church and school ten miles from the post office and close scrutiny far and wide disclosed but one house in range Our supply of books was meagre and for knowledge of current events we relied on The Sacramento Union and on the friends who came to enjoy the cattleman s hospitality My sweetest privilege was an occasional visit to cousin Frances Bond my mother s niece who with her husband and child had settled on a farm about twelve miles from us She also had grown up a motherless girl but had spent a part of her young ladyhood at our home in Illinois She had helped my mother to prepare for our long journey and would have crossed the plains with us had her father granted her wish She was particularly fond of us three little ones whom she had caressed in babyhood She related many pleasing incidents connected with those days and spoke feelingly yet guardedly of our experiences in the mountains Like Elitha she hoped we would forget them and as she watched me cheerfully adapting myself to new surroundings she imagined that time and circumstances were dimming the past from my memory She did not understand me I was light hearted because I was old enough to appreciate the blessings that had come to me old enough to look ahead and see the pure intelligent womanhood opening to me and trustful enough to believe that my expectations in life would be realized So I gathered counsel and comfort from the lips of that sympathetic cousin and loved her word pictures of the home where I was born Nor could change of circumstances wean my grateful thoughts from Grandpa and Grandma Brunner At times I seemed to listen for the sound of his voice and to hear hers so near and clear that in the night I often started up out of sleep in answer to her dream calls Finally I determined to disregard her parting words and write her Georgia was sure that I would get a severe answer but Elitha s ready permission made the letter easier to write Weeks elapsed without a reply and I had about given up looking for it when late in August William the youngest Wilder brother saddled his horse and upon mounting called out I m off to Sacramento Eliza to bring you that long expected letter It was misdirected and is advertised in The Sacramento Union s list of uncalled for mail He left me in a speculative mood wondering if it was from grandma which of her many friends had written it for her and if it was severe as predicted by Georgia Great was my delight when the letter was handed me and I opened it and read SONOMA July three eighteen fifty six To Miss ELIZA P DONNER CASADOR RANCHO COSUMNE RIVER NEAR SACRAMENTO CITY DEAR ELIZA Your letter of the fifteenth of June came duly to hand giving me great satisfaction in regard to your health as well as keeping me and grandfather in good memory I have perused the contents of

and we wish you the same for all time to come We give you our love and remain In parental affection MARY AND CHRISTIAN BRUNNER Give our love also to Georgia Georgia was as much gratified by the contents of the letter as I and we each sent an immediate answer addressed to grandpa and grandma expressing our appreciation of their forgiving words regret for trouble and annoyances we had caused them thanks for their past kindness and the hope that they would write to us again when convenient We referred to our contentment in our new home and avoided any words which they might construe as a wish to return There was no long waiting for the second letter nor mistake in address It was dated just three days prior to the first anniversary of our leaving Sonoma and here speaks for itself SONOMA Sept eleven eighteen fifty six GEORGIA AND ELIZA DONNER MY DEAR CHILDREN Your two letters dated August thirty first reached us in due season We were glad to hear from you and it is our wish that you do well Whenever you are disposed to come to us again our doors shall be open to you and we will rejoice to see you We are glad to see that you acknowledge your errors for it shows good hearts and the right kind of principles for you should always remember that in showing respect to old age you are doing yourself honor and those who know you will respect you All your cows are doing well I am inclined to think that the last letter we wrote you you did not get We mention this to show you that we always write to you Your mother desires to know if you have forgotten the time when she used to have you sleep with her each in one arm showing the great love and care she had for you she remembers and can t forget Your grandfather informs you that he still keeps the butcher shop and bar room and that scarcely a day passes without his thinking of you He still feels very bad that you did not before going away come to him and say Good bye grandfather He forgives you however and hopes you will come and see him When you get this letter you must write Yours affectionately CHRISTIAN BRUNNER MARY BRUNNER Letters following the foregoing assured us that grandma had become fully satisfied that the stories told her by missus Stein were untrue She freely acknowledged that she was miserable and forlorn without us and begged us to return to the love and trust which awaited us at our old home This however we could not do Before the close of the Winter Frances and Georgia began preparations for boarding school in Sacramento and I being promised like opportunities for myself later wrote all about them to grandma trusting that this course would convince her that we were permanently separated from her and that Elitha and her husband had definite plans for our future I received no response to this but Georgia s first communication from school contained the following paragraph I saw Sallie Keiberg last week who told me that her mother had a letter from the old lady Grandma Brunner five weeks ago A man brought it And that the old lady had sent us by him some jewellery gold breast pins earrings and wristlets He stopped at the William Tell Hotel And that is all they know about him and the presents CHAPTER XXXIV TRAGEDY IN SONOMA CHRISTIAN BRUNNER IN A PRISON CELL saint CATHERINE S CONVENT AT BENICIA ROMANCE OF SPANISH CALIFORNIA THE BEAUTIFUL ANGEL IN BLACK THE PRAYER OF DONA CONCEPCION ARGUELLO REALIZED MONASTIC BITES Time passed Not a word had come to me from Sonoma in months when Benjamin handed me the Union and with horror I read the headlines to which he pointed TRAGEDY IN SONOMA CHRISTIAN BRUNNER AN OLD RESIDENT SLAYS HIS OWN NEPHEW From the lurid details published I learned that the Brunners had asked this nephew to come to them and had sent him money to defray his expenses from Switzerland to California Upon his arrival in Sonoma he had settled himself in the proffered home and at once begun a life of extravagance at the expense of his relatives He was repeatedly warned against trifling with their affection and wasting their hard earned riches Then patience ceased and he was forbidden the house of his uncle Meanwhile his aunt became seriously ill and the young man visited her secretly and prevailed upon her to give him in the event of her death certain cattle and other property which stood in her name She however recovered health and he in the presence of his uncle insisted that she had given him the property outright and he wanted possession This made trouble between the old couple and the wife took refuge with friends in San Francisco The night after her departure the husband entered his own room and found the nephew in his bed Thoroughly enraged he ordered him up and out of his sight and was insolently told by the young man that he was owner of that property and in rightful possession of the same At this his uncle snatched his pistol from the table at the bedside and fired the fatal shot This almost incredible news was so harrowing that I could scarcely think of anything except grandpa chained in a prison cell grandma in hiding away from home and excited groups of people gathering about the thoroughfares of Sonoma discussing the tragedy I was not sorry that at this time an epidemic of measles broke out in Sacramento and Georgia became one of its early victims This brought both girls back to the ranch and during Georgia s convalescence we had many serious talks about the Brunners troubles We wrote to grandma but received no answer and could only wait to learn what would be done with grandpa He was arraigned and held but the date set for trial was not fixed before Benjamin took Frances and Georgia to Benicia to enter the September term of saint Catherine s Convent School Upon Ben s return I observed that he and Elitha were keeping from me some mysterious but pleasurable secret It came out a few days later when Elitha began making a black and a white uniform which would fit no one except me When ready to try them on she informed me that we would have to sew early and late that I might be ready to enter the convent by the first of October and thereby reap the benefit of the institution s established custom That when more than two of a family become pupils the same term the third one shall be received free of charge except incidentals with the understanding that the family thus favored shall exert its influence toward bringing an additional pupil into the school Friends who had religious prejudices advised Ben against putting us under Catholic influence but he replied good naturedly The school is excellent the girls are Protestants and I am not afraid Besides I have told them all the horrible and uncanny stories that I have heard about convents and they will not care to meddle with anything outside of the prescribed course of study He was twenty years older than I and had such conservative and dignified ways that I often stood in awe of him So when he let the convent gate close behind us with a loud click and said Now you are a goner I scanned his face apprehensively but seeing nothing very alarming silently followed him through the massive door which was in charge of a white robed nun of the Dominican order Illustration saint CATHERINE S CONVENT AT BENICIA CALIFORNIA Illustration CHAPEL saint CATHERINE S CONVENT Presently Mother Mary Superior and my two sisters came to us in the reception room and my brother deposited the fund for my school incidentals and after a brief conversation departed The preparations in connection with my coming had been so rapidly carried out that I had had little time in which to question or anticipate what my reception at the convent might be Now however Mother Mary with open watch in hand stood before me saying Your sister Georgia cried twice as long as expected when she came still I will allow you the regular five minutes I don t wish to cry was my timid response But she insisted you must shed a few entrance tears to Before she finished her sentence and without thinking that it would be overreaching a stranger s privilege I impulsively threw my arms around her neck laid my cheek against hers and whispered Please don t make me cry She drew me closer to her and her lips touched my forehead and she said No child you need not Then she bade me go with my sisters and become acquainted with my new surroundings I was at once made to feel that I was welcome to every advantage and privilege accorded to Frances and Georgia The following Monday soon after breakfast I slipped unobserved from the recreation room and made my way to the children s dormitory where Sister Mary Joseph was busily engaged I told her that I had come to help make beds and that I hoped she would also let me wash or wipe the silverware used at the noon and evening meals She would not accept my services until she became thoroughly satisfied that I had not offered them because I felt that I was expected to do so but because I earnestly desired to do whatever I could in return for the educational and cultural advantages so freely tendered me by the convent By the end of the week I knew the way to parts of the buildings not usually open to pupils Up in the clothes room I found Sister Mary Frances and on assuring her that I only wanted occupation for part of my leisure time she let me help her to sort and distribute the clothing of the small girls on Saturdays Sister Rose let me come to her in the kitchen an hour on Sundays and other light tasks were assigned me at my request Then did I eat the bread of independence take a wholesome interest in my studies and enjoy the friends I gained My seat in the refectory was between my sister Georgia and Miss Cayitana Payne a wealthy Spanish girl Near neighbors were the two Estudillo sisters who were prouder of their Castilian lineage than of the princely estate which they had inherited through it To them I was in a measure indebted for pleasing conversation at table My abundant glossy black hair and brunette type had first attracted their attention and suggested the probability of Spanish blood in my veins After they had learned otherwise those points of resemblance still awoke in them an unobtrusive interest in my welfare I became aware of its depth one evening in the recreation room while Georgia was home for a month on sick leave I was near Miss Dolores Estudillo and overheard her say quietly to her sister in Spanish Magdalena see how care free the young girl at my side seems tonight The far away look so often in her eyes leads me to think that our dear Lord has given her many crosses to bear Her hands show marks of hard work and her clothing is inexpensive yet she appears of good birth and when I can throw pleasure in her way I mean to do it Whereupon Miss Magdalena turned to me and asked Do you live in Sacramento Miss Donner No I live on a ranch twenty miles from the city Do your parents like it there I have no parents they died when I was four years old She did not ask another question nor did she know that I had caught the note of sympathy in her apology as she turned away From that time on she and her coterie of young friends showed me many delicate attentions While still a new pupil I not infrequently met Sister Dominica resting at the foot of the steps after her walk in the sunshine and with a gracious Thank you she would permit me to assist her up the flight of stairs leading to her apartment Bowed by age and wasted by disease she was patiently awaiting the final summons I became deeply interested in her before I learned that this wan bit of humanity was the once winsome daughter of Commandante Arguello and the heroine of a pathetic romance of Spanish California s day seventeen The hero was Rezanoff an officer of high repute sent by Russia in eighteen oh six to inspect its establishment at the port of Sitka Alaska Finding the colony there in almost destitute condition he had embarked on the first voyage of a Russian vessel to the port of San Francisco California There being no commercial treaty between the two ports Rezanoff made personal appeal for help to Governor Arrillago and later to Commandante Arguello After many difficulties and delays he succeeded in obtaining the sorely needed supplies Meanwhile the young officer frequently met in her father s house the vivacious Dona Concepcion Arguello and Cupid soon joined their hearts with an immortal chain After their betrothal Rezanoff hastened back to the destitute colony with supplies Then he sped on toward saint Petersburg buoyant with a lover s hope of obtaining his sovereign s sanction to his marriage and perhaps an appointment to Spain which would enable him to give his bride a distinguished position in the country of her proud ancestors Alas death overtook the lover en route across the snows of Siberia When Dona Concepcion learned of her bereavement her lamentations were tearless her sorrow inconsolable She turned from social duties and honors and clad in mourning weeds devoted her time and means to the poor and the afflicted among whom she became known and idolized as the beautiful angel in black After the death of her parents she endowed saint Catherine s Convent with her inheritance took the vows of the Dominican nun and the world saw her no more Early in her sorrow she had prayed that death might come to her in the season when the snow lay deep on Siberia s plain and her prayer was realized for it was on a bleak winter morning that we pupils gathered in silence around the breakfast table knowing that Sister Dominica lay upon her bier in the chapel The meal was nearly finished when Sister Amelda entered and spoke to a couple of the Spanish young ladies who bowed and immediately withdrew As she came down the line selecting other Spanish friends of the dead she stopped beside me long enough to say You also may go to her You comforted her in life and it is fitting that you should be among those who keep the last watch and that your prayers mingle with theirs After her burial which was consecrated by monastic rites I returned to the schoolroom with reverential memories of Sister Dominica the once beautiful angel in black The school year closed in July eighteen fifty eight and I left the convent with regret The gentle self sacrificing conduct of the nuns had destroyed the effect of the prejudicial stories I had heard against conventual life The tender ennobling influences which had surrounded me had been more impressive than any I had experienced during orphanhood and I dreaded what the noisy world might again have in store for me My sister Frances and William R Wilder who had been betrothed for more than a year and had kept their secret until we three returned from the convent were married November twenty four eighteen fifty eight and soon thereafter moved to a pleasant home of their own on a farm adjoining Rancho de los Cazadores The following January Georgia and I entered public school in Sacramento where we spent a year and a half in earnest and arduous study Footnote seventeen The subject of a poem by Bret Harte and of a novel by missus Gertrude Atherton CHAPTER XXXV THE CHAMBERLAIN FAMILY COUSINS OF DANIEL WEBSTER JEFFERSON GRAMMAR SCHOOL FURTHER CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS OF THE DONNER PARTY PATERNAL ANCESTRY S O HOUGHTON DEATH TAKES ONE OF THE SEVEN SURVIVING DONNERS Our school home in Sacramento was with friends who not only encouraged our desire for knowledge but made the acquirement pleasant The head of the house was mister William E Chamberlain cashier of D O Mills s bank His wife Charlotte was a contributor to The Sacramento Union and leading magazines Their daughter Miss Florence taught in the public schools and their son William E junior was a high school student preparing for Harvard In addition to their superior personal attainments mister and missus Chamberlain each for they were cousins had the distinction of being first cousins to Daniel Webster and this fact also served to bring to their home guests of note and culture Georgia and I were too closely occupied with lessons to venture often beyond the school girl precinct but the intellectual atmosphere which pervaded the house and the books to which we had access were of inestimable advantage Furthermore the tuition fees required of non resident pupils entitled them to choice of district and we fortunately had selected Jefferson Grammar School No four in charge of mister Henry A White one of the ablest educators in the city Several resident families had also taken advantage of this privilege and elected to pay tuition and place their children under his instruction thus bringing together forty nine energetic boys and girls to whet each other s ambition and incite class rivalry Among the number were the five clever children of the honorable Tod Robinson three sons of Judge Robert Robinson Colonel Zabriskie s pretty daughter Annie Banker Swift s stately Margaret General Redding s two sons doctor Oatman s son Eugene beloved Nelly Upton daughter of the editor of The Sacramento Union Daniel Yost Agnes Toll the sweet singer and Eliza Denison my chum At the end of the term The Daily Union closed its account of the public examination of Jefferson Grammar School with the following statement Among mister White s pupils are two young ladies survivors of the terrible disaster which befell the emigration of eighteen forty six among the snows of the California mountains Even this cursory reference was a matter of regret to Georgia and me We had entered school silent in regard to personal history and did not wish public attention turned toward ourselves even in an indirect way fearing it might lead to a revival of the false and sensational accounts of the past and we were not prepared to correct them nor willing they should be spread Pursued by these fears we returned to the ranch where Elitha and her three black eyed little daughters welcomed our home coming and brightened our vacation Almost coincident however with the foregoing circumstance Georgia came into possession of What I Saw in California by Edwin Bryant and we found that the book did contain many facts in connection with our party s disaster but they were so interwoven with wild rumors and the false and sensational statements quoted from The California Star that they proved nothing yet gave to the untrue that appearance of truth which is so difficult to correct The language employed in description seemed to us so coarse and brutal that we could not forgive its injustice to the living and to the memory of the dead We could but feel that had simple facts been stated there would have been no harrowing criticism on account of long unburied corpses found in the lake cabins Nor would the sight of mutilated dead have suggested that the starving survivors had become gloating cannibals preying on the bodies of their companions Bare facts would have shown that the living had become too emaciated too weak to dig graves or to lift or drag the dead up the narrow snow steps even had open graves awaited their coming Aye more would have shown conclusively that mutilation of the bodies of those who had perished was never from choice never cannibalistic but dire necessity s last resort to ease torturing hunger to prevent loss of reason to save life Loss of reason was more dreaded than death by the starving protectors of the helpless Fair statements would also have shown that the First Relief reached the camps with insufficient provision to meet the pressing needs of the unfortunate Consequently it felt the urgency of haste to get as many refugees as possible to Bear Valley before storms should gather and delays defeat the purpose of its coming that it divided what it could conscientiously spare among those whom it was obliged to leave cut wood for the fires and endeavored to give encouragement and hope to the desponding but did not remain long enough to remove or bury the dead Each succeeding party actuated by like anxieties and precautions departed with its charges leaving pitiable destitution behind leaving mournful conditions in camp conditions attributable as much to the work of time and atmospheric agencies as to the deplorable expedients to which the starving were again and again reduced With trembling hand Georgia turned the pages from the sickening details of the Star eighteen to the personal observations of Edwin Bryant who in returning to the United States in the Summer of eighteen forty seven crossed the Sierra Nevadas with General Kearney and escort reached the lake cabins June twenty two and wrote as follows A halt was called for the purpose of interring the remains Near the principal lake cabin I saw two bodies entire except the abdomens had been cut open and entrails extracted Their flesh had been either wasted by famine or evaporated by exposure to dry atmosphere and presented the appearance of mummies Strewn around the cabins were dislocated and broken skulls in some instances sawed asunder with care for the purpose of extracting the brains Human skeletons in short in every variety of mutilation A more appalling spectacle I never witnessed The remains were by order of General Kearney collected and buried under supervision of Major Sword They were interred in a pit dug in the centre of one of the cabins for a cache These melancholy duties to the dead being performed the cabins by order of Major Sword were fired and with everything surrounding them connected with the horrible and melancholy tragedy consumed The body of Captain George Donner was found in his camp about eight miles distant He had been carefully laid out by his wife and a sheet was wrapped around the corpse This sad office was probably the last act she performed before visiting the camp of Keseberg He was buried by a party of men detailed for that purpose I knew the Donners well their means in money and merchandise which they had brought with them were abundant mister Donner was a man of about sixty and was at the time of leaving the United States a highly respectable citizen of Illinois a farmer of independent means missus Donner was considerably younger than her husband an energetic woman of refined education After Georgia left me I reopened the book and pondered its revelations many of them new to us both and most of them I marked for later investigation Bryant found no human bones at Donner s camp His description of that camp was all important proving that my father s body had not been mutilated but lay in his mountain hut three long months sacred as when left by my little mother who had watched over him to the pitiful end had closed his eyes folded his arms across his breast and wrapped the burial sheet about his precious form There too was proof of his last resting place just as had been told me in sight of Jakie s grave by the Cherokee woman in Sonoma The book had also a copy of Colonel McKinstrey s letter to the General Relief Committee in San Francisco reporting the return of the first rescuers with refugees In speaking of the destitution of the unfortunates in camp he used the following words sympathically When the party arrived at camp it was obliged to guard the little stock of provisions it had carried over the mountains on its back on foot for the relief of the poor beings as they were in such a starving condition that they would have immediately used up all the little store They even stole the buckskin strings from the party s snowshoes and ate them I at once recognized this friendly paragraph as the one which had had its kindness extracted and been abbreviated and twisted into that cruel taunt which I had heard in my childhood from the lips of Picayune Butler A careful study of Bryant s work increased my desire to sift that of Thornton for I had been told that it not only contained the Fallon Diary but lengthier extracts from the Star and I wanted to compare and analyze those details which had been published as Thrilling Events in California History I was unable to procure the book then but resolved to do so when opportunity should occur Naturally we who see history made are solicitous that it be accurately recorded especially when it vitally concerns those near to us Illustration Photograph by Lynwood Abbott THE CROSS AT DONNER LAKE Shortly before school reopened Georgia and I spent the day with cousin Frances E Bond and in relating to her various incidents of our life we spoke of the embarrassment we had felt in class the day that mister White asked every pupil whose ancestors had fought in the war of the American Revolution to rise and Georgia and I were the only ones who remained seated My cousin regarded us a moment and then said Your Grandfather Eustis although a widow s only son and not yet sixteen years of age enlisted when the Revolutionary War began He was a sentinel at Old South Church and finally a prisoner aboard the Count d Estang She would have stopped there but we begged for all she knew about our mother s people so she continued mingling advice with information I would rather that you should not know the difference between their position in life and your own yet if you must know it the Eustis and the Wheelwright families from whom you are descended are among the most substantial and influential of New England Their reputation however is not a prop for you to lean on They are on the Atlantic coast you on the Pacific so your future depends upon your own merit and exertions This revelation of lineage nevertheless was an added incentive to strive for higher things an inheritance more enduring than our little tin box and black silk stockings which had belonged to mother An almost indescribable joy was mine when at a gathering of the school children to do honor to the citizens who had inaugurated the system of public instruction in Sacramento I beheld on the platform Captain John A Sutter Memories both painful and grateful were evoked It was he who had first sent food to the starving travellers in the Sierra Nevada Mountains It was he who had laid his hand on my head when a forlorn little waif at the Fort tenderly saying Poor little girl I wish I could give back what you have lost To me Captain Sutter had long been the embodiment of all that was good and grand and now I longed to touch his hand and whisper to him gratitude too sacred for strangers ears But the opportunity was withheld until riper years During our last term at school Georgia s health was so improved that my life was more free of cares and aglow with fairer promises Miss Kate Robinson and I were rivals for school honors and I studied as I never had studied before for in the history physiology and rhetoric classes she pressed me hard At the close of the session the record showed a tie Neither of us would accept determination by lot and we respectfully asked the Honorable Board of Education to withhold the medal for that year About this time Georgia and I enjoyed a rare surprise On his return from business one day mister Chamberlain announced that a distinguished appearing young lawyer S O Houghton by name had stopped at the bank that afternoon to learn our address and say that he would call in the evening We knowing that he was the husband of our little cousin Mary were anxious to meet him and to hear of her whom we had not seen since our journey across the snow He came that evening and told us of the cozy home in San Jose to which he had taken his young wife and of her wish that we visit them the coming July or August Although letters had passed between us up to this time we had known little of Mary s girlhood life After we parted in eighteen forty seven she was carried through to San Francisco then called Yerba Buena where her maimed foot was successfully treated by the surgeon of the United States ship Portsmouth The citizens of that place purchased and presented to her the one hundred vara lot Number thirty eight and the lot adjoining to her brother George mister Reed was appointed her guardian and given charge of her apportionment of funds realized from the sale of goods brought from her father s tents She became a member of the Reed household in San Jose and her life must have been cast in pleasant lines for she always spoke of mister and missus Reed with filial affection Moreover her brother had been industrious and prosperous and had contributed generously to her comfort and happiness Some weeks later we took mister Houghton s report home to Elitha We also showed her a recent letter from Mary sparkling with bright anticipations anticipations never to be realized for we girls were hardly settled on the ranch before a letter came from cousin George Donner dated Sacramento June twenty eighteen sixty From this we learned that he had on that day been summoned to the bedside of his dying sister and had come from his home on Putah Creek as fast as horse could carry him yet had failed to catch the bay steamer and while waiting for the next boat was writing to us who could best understand his state of mind Next a note from San Jose informed us that missus Mary M Houghton died June twenty one eighteen sixty leaving a namesake a daughter two weeks old and that her brother had reached there in time for the funeral Of the seven Donners who had survived the disaster she was the first called by death and we deeply mourned her loss and grieved because another little Mary was motherless The following August mister Houghton made his first visit to Rancho de los Cazadores and with fatherly pride showed the likeness of his little girl and promised to keep us all in touch with her by letter mister Houghton was closely identified with pioneer affairs and we had many friends in common especially among officers and soldiers of the Mexican War He had enlisted in Company A of Stevenson s Regiment of New York Volunteers when barely eighteen years of age and sailed with it from his native State on the twenty sixth of September eighteen forty six After an eventful voyage by way of Cape Horn the good ship Loo Choo which bore him hither cast anchor in the Bay of San Francisco March twenty six eighteen forty seven about the time the Third Relief was bringing us little girls over the mountains His company being part of the detachment ordered to Mexico under Colonel Burton he went at once into active service was promoted through intermediate grades and appointed lieutenant and adjutant on the staff of Colonel Burton before his twentieth year Following an honorable discharge at the close of the war and a year s exciting experiences in the gold fields he settled in San Jose in November eighteen forty nine then the capital city His knowledge of the Spanish and French languages fitting him specially therefor he turned his attention to legislative and municipal matters As clerk of the Senate Judiciary Committee of the first session of the California Legislature he helped to formulate statutes for enactment they being promulgated in Spanish as well as English at that time During the period between eighteen fifty one and eighteen sixty he held several official positions among them that of president of the City Council and on his twenty fifth birthday he was elected Mayor of San Jose Meanwhile he had organized the Eagle Guard one of the first independent military companies in the State and had also been successively promoted from adjutant to ordnance officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel on Major General Halleck s staff of the State Militia Moreover he had completed the study of law in the office of Judge W T Wallace been admitted to the bar and was now actively engaged in the practice of his profession Footnote eighteen See Appendix for extract from The California Star CHAPTER XXXVI NEWS OF THE BRUNNERS LETTERS FROM GRANDPA More than two years had elapsed since we had heard directly from Sonoma when on the day before Thanksgiving eighteen sixty Judge Robert Robinson and wife of Sacramento came to the ranch and he in his pleasing way announced that he and missus Robinson had a little story to tell and a message to deliver which would explain why they had arrived unexpectedly to spend the national holiday with us Then seating himself he bowed to his wife and listened in corroborative silence while she related the following incident Last Summer when the Judge went on his circuit he took the carriage and I accompanied him on his travels One day we stopped for dinner at the stage station between Sonoma and Santa Rosa After we had registered the proprietor approached us saying I see you are from Sacramento and wonder if you know anything about a couple of young girls by the name of Downie who spent some time there in the public school He seemed disappointed when we replied We know Donners but not Downies Well he continued they are strangers to me but I am interested in them on account of their former connection with an unfortunate little old German woman who frequently comes in on the stage that runs between Sonoma and Santa Rosa She carries their pictures in her hand bag and tells a touching story about her happiness when they lived with her Just then the stage stopped before the door and he looking out exclaimed Why she is among the passengers to day With your permission I ll bring her to you He introduced her as missus Brunner told her where we were from and asked her to show us the picture of her little girls After shaking hands with us she took the seat offered and nervously drew from her reticule a handsomely inlaid case which she opened and handed to us An expression of pride and tenderness lighted her worn features as Judge and I at once exclaimed pointing to one and then the other Why this is Georgia and this Eliza Donner We know them well and call them our girls in Sacramento She sprang from her seat and stood with one hand on Judge s shoulder and the other on mine saying earnestly Yes You do know my children Be they well and doing well We had to talk fast in order to answer all her questions and a number of listeners drew nearer and were considerably affected as the poor old soul said Please shake hands with me again for them and tell them that you talked with their old Grandma Brunner that loves them now just the same as when they was little Judge and I assured her that we would deliver her messages in person as soon as we should get time to look you up After dinner we saw her reseated in the stage and the black silk reticule containing the picture was upon her lap as the stage carried her homeward We learned from them further that grandpa had been convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to San Quentin Prison for a term of eleven years and that grandma had been granted a divorce and awarded all the property but was having great trouble because it had since become involved and was being frittered away in litigation The information given by the Robinsons increased our uneasiness for our trouble worn friends Since the tragedy Georgia and I had often spoken of them to one another but to no one else We knew that few could understand them as we did and we refrained from exposing them to unnecessary criticism Anxious as we were to comfort them it was not in our power to do more than endeavor again to reach them by letter The first was despatched to grandma at Sonoma the day after the departure of our guests and shortly before Christmas I posted one to grandpa The former was answered quickly and so pathetically that brother Ben offered to take us to Sonoma for a visit in the early Spring and then to see what could be done for grandma The letter to grandpa did not reach him until January twenty seven eighteen sixty one but his reply left San Quentin by Wells Fargo Express on the twenty eighth of January It was a brave letter closing with the following mystifying paragraph Though I may be confined by prison walls I wish those dear to me to be happy and joyous as they can and I trust in God to open a way for me out of here when I can see you all which will make us all very happy Your affectionate grandfather CHRISTIAN BRUNNER His next communication contained a thrilling surprise which cleared the lurking mystery of his former letter and expressed such joyous appreciation of his regained privileges that I once more quote his own words from the letter yellowed by age which lies before me SONOMA March twenty five eighteen sixty one DEAR ELIZA AND GEORGIA Your kind and friendly letter reached me about ten days ago and I would have responded to the same right away but waited a few days so that I could give you some good news over which you my dear little girls will surely rejoice as you take so much interest in everything which myself concerns This news is that I am free again Last Tuesday I received through the influence of friends from the Governor of the State of California a full pardon and am again in Sonoma and as soon as I have my business affairs in such a way settled that I can leave for a week or two I will come up and see you I have much to tell you which you will better understand through a personal interview than by writing Yours friendly C BRUNNER Georgia and I felt this news was almost too good to be true We wondered how soon he would come to see us wondered also if he and grandma had met and were glad that we had not taken the side of either against the other What next was the pertinent question uppermost in our minds We found the answer in The Sacramento Daily Union early in April under title of Romance in Real Life After a brief review of the troubles of the Brunners and reference to their divorcement the article announced their recent remarriage This gratifying circumstance made our long intended trip to Sonoma unnecessary especially since the reunited couple seemed to have retained the sympathy and loyalty of those who had known them in their days of prosperity and usefulness CHAPTER XXXVII ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST PONY EXPRESS I happened to be in Sacramento on the thirteenth day of April eighteen sixty one and found the city full of irrepressible excitement Men on gayly caparisoned horses galloping hither and thither unfurled flags and a general air of expectancy on eager faces everywhere betokened an occasion of rare moment At times hats were swung aloft and cheers rang out tumultuously only to be hushed by the disappointing murmur Not yet But an instant s quiet and there was a mad rush of the populace toward Sutter s Fort then again enthusiasm died and the crowds ebbed back up J Street which some eight or ten feet higher than any other street in the city extended straight as an arrow from the fort to where the bay steamer lightly hugged the water front puffing and impatient to be off to San Francisco So the anxious waiting continued until the day was well on to its close when suddenly vociferous cheers again rent the air and this time knew no cessation What a din With leap and outcry all faced Sutter s Fort That was a spectacle to be remembered Pony The pony hurrah hurrah We see a dark speck in the distance It grows as up J Street it comes Now the pony foams before us now swift as the wind it is gone It passes reception committee passes escort It reaches the water front down the gang plank it dashes the band plays the whistle blows the bell rings the steamer catches the middle of the stream and is off leaving a trail of sparks and smoke in the twilight and bearing away the first Pony Express memorable in history The baffling problem is solved the dream of years is realized expeditious mail service with the East is an accomplished fact No wonder the people cheered It was a gigantic scheme well conceived magnificently executed Think of it a stretch of two thousand miles of mountain wild and desert plain covered in twelve days How was it done Horses were tested and riders selected by weight and power of endurance The latter were boys in years Bill Cody the youngest said to be only fourteen years of age The pouch was light its contents were limited but how gladly five dollars per letter was paid for those precious missives Every detail was carefully arranged The first mount left saint Joseph Missouri April two relay camps were established ten miles apart with a horse ever in readiness for instantaneous exchange and a fresh rider mounted for the next run was waiting at each successive hundred mile station along the entire route Small wonder those pioneers were beside themselves with enthusiastic excitement The minds of many reverted to personal experiences with ox team or jogtrot of horses or mule train Here was the Overland Stage outdone even the speed with which Monk Hanks brought Horace Greeley over the mountains was at discount CHAPTER XXXVIII WAR AND RUMORS OF WAR MARRIAGE SONOMA REVISITED The Summer of eighteen sixty one now well advanced was rife with war and rumors of war and foreshadowings of coming events The old and the young were flushed with patriotism each eager to help his country s cause I remembering grandma s training was ready to give my services to hospital work Earnest as was this desire however I was dissuaded from taking definite steps in that direction by those who knew that my slender physique and girlish appearance would defeat my purpose before the board of appointing physicians Moreover mister Houghton s visits and frequent letters were changing my earlier plans for the future and finally led to my naming the tenth of October eighteen sixty one as our wedding day The ceremony was solemnized by the reverend J A Benton of Sacramento The event is also noteworthy as being the occasion of the first reunion of the five Donner sisters since their parting at Sutter s Fort in June eighteen forty seven Georgia s place was by my side while Elitha Leanna and Frances each grouped with husband and children in front among friends who had come to witness the plighting of vows between my hero and me Not until I had donned my travelling suit and my little white Swiss wedding dress was being packed did I fully realize that the days of inseparable companionship between Georgia and me were past She had long been assured that in my new home a welcome would be ever ready for her yet she had thoughtfully answered No I am not needed there and I feel that I am needed here Nature s wedding gift to us was a week of glorious weather and its first five days we passed in San Francisco the bustling historic city which I knew so well yet had never seen before Then we boarded the afternoon boat up the bay expecting to spend the evening and following morning in Sonoma with Grandpa and Grandma Brunner but the vessel failed to reach Lakeside Landing in time to connect with the northbound coach This mischance necessitated our staying overnight at the only hostelry in the place The cry All aboard for Sonoma hurried us from the table next morning and on reaching the sidewalk we learned that the proprietor of the hotel had bespoken the two best seats in the coach for us I was too happy to talk until after we crossed the Sonoma River shaded by grand old oak sycamore and laurel trees and then onward I was too happy to remain silent Before us lay the valley which brought back memories of my childhood and I was in a mood to recall only the brightest as we sped on to our destination My companion shared my delight and gave heed to each scene I called to his attention The coach stopped in front of the hotel and we alighted upon almost the same spot from which I had climbed into the carriage to leave Sonoma six years earlier But oh how changed was everything One sweeping glance at the little town revealed the fact that it had passed its romantic age and lost its quickening spirit Closed were the homes of the old Spanish families gone were the caballeros and the bright eyed senoritas grass grown was the highway to the mines the flagstaff alone remained flushed with its old time dignity and importance In subdued mood I stepped into the parlor until our names should be registered When my husband returned I said The carpet on this floor the chairs in this room and the pictures on these walls were in place in grandma s home when I left her perhaps she is no longer living He left me again to make inquiry concerning those whom we had come to see and ascertained that the Brunners had remarried for the purpose of facilitating the readjustment of their property rights and of rescuing them from the hands of a scheming manager who with his family was now living on the estate and caring for grandma but would not permit grandpa to enter the house After sending a messenger to find grandpa I led the way to the open door of the old home then slipped aside to let my husband seek admission He rapped Illustration GENERAL VALLEJO S CARRIAGE BUILT IN ENGLAND IN eighteen thirty two Illustration GENERAL VALLEJO S OLD JAIL I heard a side door open uneven footsteps in the hall and him saying quietly I think the old lady herself is coming and you had better meet her alone I crossed the threshold opened my arms and uttered the one word Grandma She came and rested her head against my bosom and I folded my arms about her just as she had enfolded me when I went to her a lonely child yearning for love She stirred then drew back looked up into my face and asked Who be you Touched by her wistful gaze I exclaimed Grandma don t you know me Be you Eliza she asked and when I had given answer she turned from me in deepest emotion murmuring No no it can t be my little Eliza She would have tottered away had I not supported her to a seat in the well remembered living room and caressed her until she looked up through her tears saying When you smile you be my little Eliza but when you look serious I don t know you She inquired about Georgia and how I came to be there without her Then she bade me call my husband and thanked him for bringing me to her Forgetting all the faults and shortcomings that once had troubled her sorely she spoke of my busy childhood and the place I had won in the affections of all who knew me A tender impulse took her from us a moment She returned saying Now you must not feel bad when you see what I have in the hand behind me and drawing it forth continued This white lace veil which I bought at Sutter s Fort when your mother s things were sold at auction is to cover my face when I am dead and this picture of us three is to be buried in the coffin with me I want your husband to see how you looked when you was little She appeared proudly happy but a flame of embarrassment burned my cheeks as she handed him the picture wherein I showed to such disadvantage with the question Now doesn t she look lovely and heard his affirmative reply Upon the clock lay a broken toy which had been mine and in childlike ecstasy she spoke of it and of others which she had kept ever near her When invited to go to luncheon with us she brought first her bonnet next her shawl for me to hold while she should don her best apparel for the occasion Instead of going directly she insisted on choosing the longer road to town that we might stop at missus Lewis s to see if she and her daughter Sallie would recognize me Frequently as we walked along she hastened in advance and then faced about on the road to watch us draw near When we reached missus Lewis s door she charged me not to smile and clapped her hands when both ladies appeared and called me by name As we were taking leave an aged horseman drew rein at the gate and dismounted and missus Lewis looking up exclaimed Why there is mister Brunner It did not take me long to meet him part way down the walk nor did I shrink from the caress he gave me nor know how much joy and pain that meeting evoked in him even after he turned to mister Houghton saying fervently Do not be angry because I kiss your wife and put my arms around her for she is my child come back to me I helped raise her and we learned her to do all kinds of work what is useful and she was my comfort child in my troubles My husband s reply seemed to dispel the recollections which had made the reunion distressing and grandpa led his horse and walked and talked with us until we reached the turn where he bade us leave him while he disposed of Antelope preparatory to joining us at luncheon Proceeding we observed an increasing crowd in front of the hotel massed together as if in waiting As we drew nearer a way was opened for our passage and friends and acquaintances stepped forth shook hands with me and desired to be introduced to my husband It was apparent that the message which we had sent to grandpa early in the day stating the hour we would be at the hotel had spread among the people who were now assembled for the purpose of meeting us Strangers also were among them for I heard the whispered answer many times Why that is little Eliza Donner who used to live with the Brunners and that is mister Houghton her husband they can only stay until two o clock The hotel table usually more than ample to accommodate its guests was not nearly large enough for all who followed to the dining room so the smiling host placed another table across the end for many who had intended to lunch at home that day Meantime our little party was seated with mister Houghton at the head of the table I at his right grandpa opposite me and grandma at my right She was supremely happy would fold her hands in her lap and say If you please and Thank you as I served her and I was grateful that she claimed my attention for grandpa s lips were mute He strove for calm endeavoring to eat that he might the better conceal the unbidden tears which coursed down his cheeks Not until we reached a secluded retreat for our farewell talk did his emotion express itself in words Grasping my husband s hand he said My friend I must leave you I broke bread and tasted salt with you but I am too heartsick to visit or to say good bye You bring back my child a bride and I have no home to welcome her in no wedding feast or happiness to offer I must see and talk with her in the house of strangers and it makes me suffer more than I can bear But before I go I want you both to make me the promise that you will always work together and have but one home one purse one wish in life so that when you be old you will not have to walk separately like we do You will not have bitter thoughts and blame one another Here grandma interrupted meekly I know I did wrong but I did not mean to and I be sorry The pause which followed our given promise afforded me the opportunity to clasp their withered hands together between mine and gain from grandpa an earnest pledge that he would watch over and be kind to her who had married him when he was poor and in ill health who had toiled for him through the long years of his convalescence who had been the power behind the throne his best aid and counsellor until time had turned her back in its tide and made her a child again My husband followed him from the room to bestow the sympathy and encouragement which a strong man can give to a desponding one When the carriage was announced which would take us to Benicia in time to catch the Sacramento steamer to San Francisco I tied on grandma s bonnet pinned her shawl around her shoulders and told her that we would take her home before proceeding on our way but she crossed her hands in front and artlessly whispered No I d like to stay in town a while to talk with friends but I thank you just the same and shall not forget that I am to go to you after you be settled in the new home and his little daughter has learned to call you mother We left her standing on the hotel piazza smiling and important among the friends who had waited to see us off but grandpa was nowhere in sight The steamer was at the landing when we reached Benicia so we hurriedly embarked and found seats upon the deck overlooking the town As the moonlight glistened on the white spray which encircled our departing boat the sound of the Angelus came softly sweetly prayerfully over the water and I looking up and beyond saw the glimmering lights of Saint Catherine s Convent fitting close to scenes of my childhood its silver toned bells cheering my way to long life honors and many blessings APPENDIX Though the mills of God grind slowly yet they grind exceeding small Though with patience He stands waiting with exactness grinds He all FRIEDRICH VON LOGAU I ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN The California Star STATISTICS OF THE PARTY NOTES OF AGUILLA GLOVER EXTRACT FROM THORNTON RECOLLECTIONS OF JOHN BAPTISTE TRUBODE In honor to the State that cherishes the landmark in justice to history which is entitled to the truth in sympathetic fellowship with those who survived the disaster and in reverent memory of those who suffered and died in the snow bound camps of the Sierra Nevadas I refute the charges of cruelty selfishness and inhumanity which have been ascribed to the Donner Party In this Appendix I set forth some of the unwarranted statements to which frequent reference has been made in the foregoing pages that they may be examined and analyzed and their utter unreliability demonstrated by comparison with established facts and figures These latter data for the sake of brevity are in somewhat statistical form A few further incidents which I did not learn of or understand until long after they occurred are also related The accounts of weather conditions of scarcity of food and fuel also the number of deaths in the camps before the first of March eighteen forty seven are verified by the carefully kept Diary of Patrick Breen One of the Donner Party which has recently been published by the Academy of Pacific Coast History The following article which originally appeared in The California Star April ten eighteen forty seven is here quoted from The Life and Days of General John A Sutter by T J Schoonover A more shocking scene cannot be imagined than was witnessed by the party of men who went to the relief of the unfortunate emigrants in the California Mountains The bones of those who had died and been devoured by the miserable ones that still survived were around their tents and cabins bodies of men women and children with half the flesh torn from them lay on every side A woman sat by the side of the body of her dead husband cutting out his tongue the heart she had already taken out broiled and eaten The daughter was seen eating the father and the mother that viz body of her children children that of father and mother The emaciated wild and ghastly appearance of the survivors added to the horror of it Language can not describe the awful change that a few weeks of dire suffering had wrought in the minds of the wretched and pitiable beings Those who one month before would have shuddered and sickened at the thought of eating human flesh or of killing their companions and relatives to preserve their own lives now looked upon the opportunity the acts afforded them of escaping the most dreadful of deaths as providential interference in their behalf Calculations were coldly made as they sat around their gloomy camp fires for the next succeeding meals Various expedients were devised to prevent the dreadful crime of murder but they finally resolved to kill those who had least claims to longer existence Just at this moment some of them died which afforded the rest temporary relief Some sank into the arms of death cursing God for their miserable fate while the last whisperings of others were prayers and songs of praise to the Almighty After the first few deaths but the one all absorbing thought of individual self preservation prevailed The fountains of natural affection were dried up The chords that once vibrated with connubial parental and filial affection were torn asunder and each one seemed resolved without regard to the fate of others to escape from impending calamity So changed had the emigrants become that when the rescuing party arrived with food some of them cast it aside and seemed to prefer the putrid human flesh that still remained The day before the party arrived one emigrant took the body of a child about four years of age in bed with him and devoured the whole before morning and the next day he ate another about the same age before noon This article one of the most harrowing to be found in print spread through the early mining camps and has since been quoted by historians and authors as an authentic account of scenes and conduct witnessed by the first relief corps to Donner Lake It has since furnished style and suggestion for other nerve racking stories on the subject causing keener mental suffering to those vitally concerned than words can tell Yet it is easily proved to be nothing more or less than a perniciously sensational newspaper production too utterly false too cruelly misleading to merit credence Evidently it was written without malice but in ignorance and by some warmly clad well nourished person who did not know the humanizing effect of suffering and sorrow and who may not have talked with either a survivor or a rescuer of the Donner Party When the Donner Party ascended the Sierra Nevadas on the last day of October eighteen forty six it comprised eighty one souls namely Charles Berger nineteen Patrick Breen Margaret Breen his wife John Breen Edward Breen Patrick Breen junior Simon Breen James Breen Peter Breen Isabella Breen Jacob Donner nineteen Elizabeth Donner nineteen his wife William Hook twenty Solomon Hook George Donner junior Mary

John Baptiste Trubode August Spitzer nineteen James Smith nineteen Samuel Shoemaker Bailis Williams nineteen and Eliza Williams his sister missus Woolfinger widow Antonio a Mexican and Lewis and Salvador the two Indians sent with Stanton by General Sutter Stated in brief the result of the disaster to the party in the mountains was as follows The total number of deaths was thirty six as follows fourteen in the mountains while en route to the settlement fourteen at camp near Donner Lake and eight at Donner s Camp The total number who reached the settlement was forty five of whom five were men eight were women and thirty two were children The family of James F Reed and that of Patrick Breen survived in unbroken numbers The only other family in which all the children reached the settlement was that of Captain George Donner Fourteen of the eighty one souls constituting the Donner Party were boys and girls between the ages of nineteen and twelve years twenty six ranged from twelve years to a year and a half and seven were nursing babes There were only thirty four adults twenty two men and twelve women Of the first named group eleven survived the disaster One youth died en route with the Forlorn Hope one at the Lake Camp and one at Bear Valley in charge of the First Relief Twenty of the second named group also reached the settlements One died en route with the First Relief two at Donner s Camp in March eighteen forty seven two at Starved Camp in charge of the Second Relief and one at the Lake Camp in March Two of the seven babes lived and five perished at the Lake Camp They hungered and slowly perished after famine had dried the natural flow and infant lips had drawn blood from maternal breasts The first nursling s life to ebb was that of Lewis Keseberg junior on January twenty four eighteen forty seven twenty one His grief stricken mother could not be comforted She hugged his wasted form to her heart and carried it far from camp where she dug a grave and buried it in the snow Harriet McCutchen whose mother had struggled on with the Forlorn Hope in search of succor breathed her last on the second of February while lying upon the lap of missus Graves and the snow being deep and hard frozen missus Graves bade her son William make the necessary excavation near the wall within their cabin and they buried the body there where the mother should find it upon her return Catherine Pike died in the Murphy cabin a few hours before the arrival of food from the settlement and was buried on the morning of February twenty two twenty two Illustration Photograph by Lynwood Abbott ALDER CREEK Illustration DENNISON S EXCHANGE AND THE PARKER HOUSE SAN FRANCISCO Those were the only babes that perished before relief came Does not the fact that so many young children survived the disaster refute the charges of parental selfishness and inhumanity and emphasize the immeasurable self sacrifice love and care that kept so many of the little ones alive through that long bitter siege of starvation missus Elinor Eddy who passed away in the Murphy cabin on the seventh of February was the only wife and mother called by death in either camp before the arrival of the First Relief Both Patrick Breen s diary and William G Murphy then a lad of eleven years assert that missus Eddy and little Margaret her only daughter were buried in the snow near the Murphy cabin on the ninth of February Furthermore the Breen Diary and the death list of the Donner Party show that not a husband or father died at the Lake Camp during the entire period of the party s imprisonment in the mountains twenty three How then could that First Relief or either of the other relief parties see how could they even have imagined that they saw wife sitting at the side of her husband who had just died mutilating his body or the daughter eating her father or mother that of her children or children that of father and mother The same questions might be asked regarding the other revolting scenes pictured by the Star The seven men who first braved the dangers of the icy trail in the work of rescue came over a trackless ragged waste of snow varying from ten to forty feet in depth twenty four and approached the camp site near the lake at sunset They halloed and up the snow steps came those able to drag themselves to the surface When they descended into those cabins they found no cheering lights Through the smoky atmosphere they saw smouldering fires and faced conditions so appalling that words forsook them their very souls were racked with agonizing sympathy There were the famine stricken and the perishing almost as wasted and helpless as those whose sufferings had ceased Too weak to show rejoicing they could only beg with quivering lips and trembling hands Oh give us something to eat Give us something to drink We are starving True their hands were grimy their clothing tattered and the floors were bestrewn with hair from hides and bits of broken bullock bones but of connubial parental or filial inhumanity there were no signs With what deep emotion those seven heroic men contemplated the conditions in camp may be gathered from mister Aguilla Glover s own notes published in Thornton s work Feb nineteen eighteen forty seven The unhappy survivors were in short in a condition most deplorable and beyond power of language to describe or imagination to conceive The emigrants had not yet commenced eating the dead Many of the sufferers had been living on bullock hides for weeks and even that sort of food was so nearly exhausted that they were about to dig up from the snow the bodies of their companions for the purpose of prolonging their wretched lives Thornton s work contains the following statement by a member of one of the relief corps On the morning of February twenty twenty five Racine Tucker John Rhodes and Riley Moutrey went to the camp of George Donner eight miles distant taking a little jerked beef These sufferers eighteen had but one hide remaining They had determined that upon consuming this they would dig from the snow the bodies of those who had died from starvation mister Donner was helpless missus Donner was weak but in good health and might have come to the settlement with this party yet she solemnly but calmly determined to remain with her husband and perform for him the last sad offices of affection and humanity And this she did in full view that she must necessarily perish by remaining behind The three men returned the same day with seven refugees twenty six from Donner Camp John Baptiste Trubode has distinct recollections of the arrival and departure of Tucker s party and of the amount of food left by it He said to me in that connection To each of us who had to stay in camp one of the First Relief Party measured a teacupful of flour two small biscuits and thin pieces of jerked beef each piece as long as his first finger and as many pieces as he could encircle with that first finger and thumb brought together end to end This was all that could be spared and was to last until the next party could reach us Our outlook was dreary and often hopeless I don t know what I would have done sometimes without the comforting talks and prayers of those two women your mother and Aunt Elizabeth Then evenings after you children went to sleep missus George Donner would read to me from the book twenty seven she wrote in every day If that book had been saved every one would know the truth of what went on in camp and not spread these false tales I dug in the snow for the dead cattle but found none and we had to go back to our saltless old bullock hide days before the Second Relief got to us on the first of March Footnote nineteen Died while in the mountain camps Footnote twenty Died en route over the mountains to the settlements in California Footnote twenty one Report brought by John Baptiste to Donner s Camp after one of his trips to the lake Footnote twenty two Incident related by William C Graves after he reached the settlement Footnote twenty three Franklin W Graves and Jay Fosdick perished in December eighteen forty six while en route to the settlement with the Forlorn Hope Footnote twenty four One of the stumps near the Breen Graves cabin cut for fuel while the snow was deepest was found by actual measurement to be twenty two feet in height It is still standing Footnote twenty five Thornton s dates are one day later than those in the Breen Diary Breen must have lost a day en route Footnote twenty six The First Relief Corps took six instead of seven refugees from Donner Camp and set out from the lake cabins with twenty three instead of twenty four refugees Footnote twenty seven The journal herbarium manuscript and drawings of missus George Donner were not among the goods delivered at the Fort by the Fallon Party and no trace of them was ever found II THE REED GREENWOOD PARTY OR SECOND RELIEF REMINISCENCES OF WILLIAM G MURPHY CONCERNING NICHOLAS CLARK AND JOHN BAPTISTE On the third of March eighteen forty seven the Reed Greenwood or Second Relief Corps excepting Nicholas Clark left camp with the following refugees Patrick Breen Margaret Breen his wife Patrick Breen junior Simon Breen James Breen Peter Breen Isabella Breen Solomon Hook Mary Donner Isaac Donner missus Elizabeth Graves Nancy Graves Jonathan B Graves Franklin W Graves junior Elizabeth Graves junior Martha J Reed and Thomas K Reed The whole party as has been already told were forced into camp about ten miles below the summit on the west side of the Sierras by one of the fiercest snow storms of the season All credit is due mister and missus Breen for keeping the nine helpless waifs left with them at Starved Camp alive until food was brought them by members of the Third Relief Party mister Breen s much prized diary does not cover the experiences of that little band in their struggle across the mountains but concludes two days before they started After he and his family succeeded in reaching the Sacramento Valley he gave his diary kept at Donner Lake to Colonel George McKinstrey for the purpose of assisting him in making out his report to Captain Hall U S N Sloop of War Warren Commander Northern District of California James F Reed of the Reed Greenwood Party the second to reach the emigrants has been adversely criticised from time to time because he and six of his men returned to Sutter s Fort in March with no more than his own two children and Solomon Hook a lad of twelve years who had said that he could and would walk and did Careful investigation however proves the criticism hasty and unfair True mister Reed went over the mountains with the largest and best equipped party sent out ten well furnished able bodied men But returning he left one man at camp to assist the needy emigrants The seventeen refugees whom he and nine companions brought over the summit comprised three weak wasted adults and fourteen emaciated young children The prospect of getting them all to the settlement even under favorable circumstances had seemed doubtful at the beginning of the journey Alas one of the heaviest snow storms of the season overtook them on the bleak mountain side ten miles from the tops of the Sierra Nevadas It continued many days Food gave out death took toll The combined efforts of the men could not do more than provide fuel and keep the fires All became exhausted Rescuers and refugees might have perished there together had the nine men not followed what seemed their only alternative Who would not have done what Reed did With almost superhuman effort he saved his two children No one felt keener regret than he over the fact that he had been obliged to abandon at Starved Camp the eleven refugees he had heroically endeavored to save In those days of affliction it were well nigh impossible to say who was most afflicted still it would seem that no greater destitution and sorrow could have been meted to any one than fell to the lot of missus Murphy at the lake camp The following incidents were related by her son William G Murphy in an address to a concourse of people assembled on the shore of Donner Lake in February eighteen ninety six I was a little more than eleven years of age when we all reached these mountains and that one roomed shanty was built where so many of us lived ate and slept No Where so many of us slept starved and died It was constructed for my mother and seven children two being married and her three grandchildren and William Foster husband of her daughter Sarah Early in December when the Forlorn Hope was planned we were almost out of provisions and my mother took the babes from the arms of Sarah and Harriet missus Pike and told them that she would care for their little ones and they being young might with William Foster and their brother Lemuel reach the settlement and return with food And the four became members of that hapless band of fifteen mister Eddy being its leader his wife and her two children came to live with us during his absence When my eldest brother on whom my mother depended was very weak and almost at death s door my mother went to the Breens and begged a little meat just a few mouthfuls I remember well that little piece of meat My mother gave half of it to my dying brother he ate it fell asleep with a hollow death gurgle When it ceased I went to him he was dead starved to death in our presence Although starving herself my mother said that if she had known that Landrum was going to die she would have given him the balance of the meat Little Margaret Eddy lingered until February four and her mother until the seventh Their bodies lay two days and nights longer in the room with us before we could find assistance able to bury them in the snow Some days earlier Milton Elliot weak and wandering around had taken up his abode with us We shared with him the remnant of our beef hides We had had a lot of that glue making material But mark it would not sustain life Elliot soon starved to death and neighbors removed and interred the body in the snow beside others Catherine Pike my absent sister s baby died on the eighteenth of February only a few hours before the arrival of the First Relief Thus the inmates of our shanty had been reduced to my mother my sister Mary brother Simon Nioma Pike Georgie Foster myself and little Jimmy Eddy When the rescuers decided they would carry out Nioma Pike and that my sister Mary and I should follow stepping in the tracks made by those who had snowshoes strength seemed to come so that I was able to cut and carry to my mother s shanty what appeared to me a huge pile of wood It was green but it was all I could get We left mother there with three helpless little ones to feed on almost nothing yet in the hope that she might keep them alive until the arrival of the next relief Many of the survivors remember that after having again eaten food seasoned with salt the boiled saltless hides produced nausea and could not be retained by adult or child I say with deep reverence that flesh of the dead was used to sustain the living in more than one cabin near the lake But it was not used until after the pittance of food left by the First Relief had long been consumed not until after the wolves had dug the snow from the graves Perhaps God sent the wolves to show missus Murphy and also missus Graves where to get sustenance for their dependent little ones Both were widows the one had three and the other four helpless children to save Was it culpable or cannibalistic to seek and use the only life saving means left them Were the acts and purposes of their unsteady hands and aching hearts less tender less humane than those of the lauded surgeons of to day who infuse human blood from living bodies into the arteries of those whom naught else can save or who strip skin from bodies that feel pain to cover wounds which would otherwise prove fatal John Baptiste Trubode and Nicholas Clark of the Second Relief were the last men who saw my father alive In August eighteen eighty three the latter came to my home in San Jose This was our second meeting since that memorable morning of March two eighteen forty seven when he went in pursuit of the wounded mother bear and was left behind by the relief party We spoke long and earnestly of our experience in the mountains and he wished me to deny the statement frequently made that Clark carried a pack of plunder and a heavy shotgun from Donner s Camp and left a child there to die This I can do positively for when the Third Relief Party took Simon Murphy and us three little Donner girls from the mountain camp not a living being remained except missus Murphy and Keseberg at the lake camp and my father and mother at Donner s Camp All were helpless except my mother The Spring following my interview with Nicholas Clark John Baptiste came to San Jose and mister McCutchen brought him to talk with me John always a picturesque character had become a hop picker in hop season and a fisherman the rest of the year He could not restrain the tears which coursed down his bronzed cheeks as he spoke of the destitution and suffering in the snow bound camps of the young unmarried men who had been so light hearted on the plains and brave when first they faced the snows His voice trembled as he told how often they had tried to break through the great barriers and failed hunted and found nothing fished and caught nothing and when rations dwindled to strips of beef hide their strength waned and death found them ready victims He declared The hair and bones found around the Donner fires were those of cattle No human flesh was used by either Donner family This I know for I was there all winter and helped get all the wood and food we had after starvation threatened us I was about sixteen years old at the time Our four men died early in December and were buried in excavations in the side of the mountain Their bodies were never disturbed As the snows deepened to ten and twelve feet we lost track of their location When saying good bye he looked at me wistfully and exclaimed Oh little Eliza sister mine how I suffered and worked to help keep you alive Do you think there was ever colder stronger winds than them that whistled and howled around our camp in the Sierras He returned the next day and in his quaint earnest way expressed keenest regret that he and Clark had not remained longer in camp with my father and mother I did not feel it so much at first but after I got married and had children of my own I often fished and cried as I thought of what I done for if we two men had stayed perhaps we might have saved that little woman His careworn features lightened as I bade him grieve no more for I realized that he was but a boy overburdened with a man s responsibilities and had done his best and that nobly Then I added what I have always believed that no one was to blame for the misfortunes which overtook us in the mountains The dangers and difficulties encountered by reason of taking the Hastings Cut off had all been surmounted two weeks more and we should have reached our destination in safety Then came the snow Who could foresee that it would come earlier fall deeper and linger longer that season than for thirty years before Everything that a party could do to save itself was done by the Donner Party and certainly everything that a generous sympathizing people could do to save the snow bound was done by the people of California III THE REPORT OF THOMAS FALLON DEDUCTIONS STATEMENT OF EDWIN BRYANT PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES The following is the report of Thomas Fallon leader of the fourth party to the camps near Donner Lake Left Johnson s on the evening of April thirteen and arrived at the lower end of Bear River Valley on the fifteenth Hung our saddles upon trees and sent the horses back to be returned again in ten days to bring us in again Started on foot with provisions for ten days and travelled to head of the valley and camped for the night snow from two to three feet deep Started early in the morning of April fifteen and travelled twenty three miles Snow ten feet deep April seventeen Reached the cabins between twelve and one o clock Expected to find some of the sufferers alive missus Donner and Keseberg twenty eight in particular Entered the cabins and a horrible scene presented itself Human bodies terribly mutilated legs arms and skulls scattered in every direction One body supposed to be that of missus Eddy lay near the entrance the limbs severed off and a frightful gash in the skull The flesh was nearly consumed from the bones and a painful stillness pervaded the place The supposition was that all were dead when a sudden shout revived our hopes and we flew in the direction of the sound Three Indians who had been hitherto concealed started from the ground fled at our approach leaving behind their bows and arrows We delayed two hours in searching the cabins during which we were obliged to witness sights from which we would have fain turned away and which are too dreadful to put on record We next started for Donner s camp eight miles distant over the mountains After travelling about half way we came upon a track in the snow which excited our suspicion and we determined to pursue It brought us to the camp of Jacob Donner where it had evidently left that morning There we found property of every description books calicoes tea coffee shoes percussion caps household and kitchen furniture scattered in every direction and mostly in water At the mouth of the tent stood a large iron kettle filled with human flesh cut up It was from the body of George Donner The head had been split open and the brain extracted therefrom and to the appearance he had not been long dead not over three or four days at most Near by the kettle stood a chair and thereupon three legs of a bullock that had been shot down in the early part of winter and snowed upon before it could be dressed The meat was found sound and good and with the exception of a small piece out of the shoulder whole untouched We gathered up some property and camped for the night April eighteen Commenced gathering the most valuable property suitable for our packs the greater portion had to be dried We then made them up and camped for the night April nineteen This morning Foster Rhodes and J Foster started with small packs for the first cabins intending from thence to follow the trail of the person that had left the morning previous The other three remained behind to cache and secure the goods necessarily left there Knowing the Donners had a considerable sum of money we searched diligently but were unsuccessful The party for the cabins were unable to keep the trail of the mysterious personage owing to the rapid melting of the snow they therefore went directly to the cabins and upon entering discovered Keseberg lying down amid the human bones and beside him a large pan full of fresh liver and lights They asked him what had become of his companions whether they were alive and what had become of missus Donner He answered them by stating that they were all dead missus Donner he said had in attempting to cross from one cabin to another missed the trail and slept out one night that she came to his camp the next night very much fatigued He made her a cup of coffee placed her in bed and rolled her well in the blankets but next morning she was dead He ate her body and found her flesh the best he had ever tasted He further stated that he obtained from her body at least four pounds of fat No trace of her body was found nor of the body of missus Murphy either When the last company left the camp three weeks previous missus Donner was in perfect health though unwilling to leave her husband there and offered five hundred dollars to any person or persons who would come out and bring them in saying this in the presence of Keseberg and that she had plenty of tea and coffee We suspected that it was she who had taken the piece from the shoulder of beef on the chair before mentioned In the cabin with Keseberg were found two kettles of human blood in all supposed to be over two gallons Rhodes asked him where he had got the blood He answered There is blood in dead bodies They asked him numerous questions but he appeared embarrassed and equivocated a great deal and in reply to their asking him where missus Donner s money was he evinced confusion and answered that he knew nothing about it that she must have cached it before she died I haven t it said he nor money nor property of any person living or dead They then examined his bundle and found silks and jewellery which had been taken from the camp of Donners amounting in value to about two hundred dollars On his person they discovered a brace of pistols recognized to be those of George Donner and while taking them from him discovered something concealed in his waistcoat which on being opened was found to be two hundred twenty five dollars in gold Before leaving the settlement the wife of Keseberg had told us that we would find but little money about him the men therefore said to him that they knew he was lying to them and that he was well aware of the place of concealment of the Donners money He declared before Heaven he knew nothing concerning it and that he had not the property of any one in his possession They told him that to lie to them would effect nothing that there were others back at the cabins who unless informed of the spot where the treasure was hidden would not hesitate to hang him upon the first tree Their threats were of no avail He still affirmed his ignorance and innocence Rhodes took him aside and talked to him kindly telling him that if he would give the information desired he should receive from their hands the best of treatment and be in every way assisted otherwise the party back at Donner s Camp would upon arrival and his refusal to discover to them the place where he had deposited this money immediately put him to death It was all to no purpose however and they prepared to return to us leaving him in charge of the packs and assuring him of their determination to visit him in the morning and that he must make up his mind during the night They started back and joined us at Donner s Camp April twenty We all started for Bear River Valley with packs of one hundred pounds each our provisions being nearly consumed we were obliged to make haste away Came within a few hundred yards of the cabins and halted to prepare breakfast after which we proceeded to the cabin I now asked Keseberg if he was willing to disclose to me where he had concealed that money He turned somewhat pale and again protested his innocence I said to him Keseberg you know well where Donner s money is and damn you you shall tell me I am not going to multiply words with you or say but little about it Bring me that rope He then arose from his hot soup and human flesh and begged me not to harm him he had not the money nor goods the silk clothing and money which were found upon him the previous day and which he then declared belonged to his wife he now said were the property of others in California I told him I did not wish to hear more from him unless he at once informed us where he had concealed the money of those orphan children then producing the rope I approached him He became frightened but I bent the rope around his neck and as I tightened the cord and choked him he cried out that he would confess all upon release I then permitted him to arise He still seemed inclined to be obstinate and made much delay in talking Finally but without evident reluctance he led the way back to Donner s Camp about ten miles distant accompanied by Rhodes and Tucker While they were absent we moved all our packs over the lower end of the lake and made all ready for a start when they should return mister Foster went down to the cabin of missus Murphy his mother in law to see if any property remained there worth collecting and securing he found the body of young Murphy who had been dead about three months with his breast and skull cut open and the brains liver and lights taken out and this accounted for the contents of the pan which stood beside Keseberg when he was found It appeared that he had left at the other camp the dead bullock and horse and on visiting this camp and finding the body thawed out took therefrom the brains liver and lights Tucker and Rhodes came back the next morning bringing two hundred seventy three dollars that had been cached by Keseberg who after disclosing to them the spot returned to the cabin The money had been hidden directly underneath the projecting limb of a large tree the end of which seemed to point precisely to the treasure buried in the earth On their return and passing the cabin they saw the unfortunate man within devouring the remaining brains and liver left from his morning repast They hurried him away but before leaving he gathered together the bones and heaped them all in a box he used for the purpose blessed them and the cabin and said I hope God will forgive me what I have done I could not help it and I hope I may get to heaven yet We asked Keseberg why he did not use the meat of the bullock and horse instead of human flesh He replied he had not seen them We then told him we knew better and asked him why the meat on the chair had not been consumed He said Oh it is too dry eating the liver and lights were a great deal better and brains made good soup We then moved on and camped by the lake for the night April twenty one Started for Bear River Valley this morning Found the snow from six to eight feet deep camped at Yuma River for the night On the twenty second travelled down Yuma about eighteen miles and camped at the head of Bear River Valley On the twenty fifth moved down to lower end of the valley met our horses and came in The account by Fallon regarding the fate of the last of the Donners in their mountain camp was the same as that which Elitha and Leanna had heard and had endeavored to keep from us little ones at Sutter s Fort Illustration VIEW IN THE GROUNDS OF THE HOUGHTON HOME IN SAN JOSE Illustration THE HOUGHTON RESIDENCE IN SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA It is self evident however that the author of those statements did not contemplate that reliable parties twenty nine would see the Donner camps before prowling beasts or time and elements had destroyed all proof of his own and his party s wanton falsity It is also plain that the Fallon Party did not set out expecting to find any one alive in the mountains otherwise would it not have taken more provisions than just enough to sustain its own men ten days Would it not have ordered more horses to meet it at the lower end of Bear Valley for the return trip Had it planned to find and succor survivors would it have taken it for granted that all had perished simply because there was no one in the lake cabins and would it have delayed two precious hours in searching the lake camp for valuables before proceeding to Donner s Camp Had the desire to rescue been uppermost in mind would not the sight of human foot tracks on the snow half way between the two camps have excited hope instead of suspicion and prompted some of the party to pursue the lone wanderer with kindly intent Does not each succeeding day s entry in that journal disclose the party s forgetfulness of its declared mission to the mountains Can any palliating excuse be urged why those men did not share with Keseberg the food they had brought instead of permitting him to continue that which famine had forced upon him and which later they so righteously condemned Is there a single strain of humanity pathos or reverence in that diary save that reflected from Keseberg s last act before being hurried away from that desolate cabin Or could there be a falser crueler or more heartless account brought to bereaved children than Fallon s purported description of the father s body found in Donner s Camp Here is the statement of Edwin Bryant who with General Kearney and escort en route to the United States halted at the deserted cabins on June twenty two eighteen forty seven and wrote The body of Captain George Donner was found in his own camp about eight miles distant He had been carefully laid out by his wife and a sheet was wrapped around the corpse This sad office was probably the last act she performed before visiting the camp of Keseberg thirty After considering what had been published by The California Star by Bryant Thornton missus Farnham and others I could not but realize Keseberg s peculiarly helpless situation Without a chance to speak in his own defence he had been charged tried and adjudged guilty by his accusers and an excited people had accepted the verdict without question Later at Captain Sutter s suggestion Keseberg brought action for slander against Captain Fallon and party The case was tried before Alcalde Sinclair thirty one and the jury gave Keseberg a verdict of one dollar damages This verdict however was not given wide circulation and prejudice remained unchecked There were other peculiar circumstances connected with this much accused man which were worthy of consideration notably the following If as reported Keseberg was in condition to walk to the settlement why did the First Relief permit him to remain in camp consuming rations that might have saved others Messrs Reed and McCutchen of the Second Relief knew the man on the plains and had they regarded him as able to travel or a menace to life in camp would they have left him there to prey on women and little children like a wolf in the fold Messrs Eddy and Foster of the Third Relief had travelled with him on the plains starved with him in camp and had had opportunities of talking with him upon their return to the cabins too late to rescue Jimmy Eddy and Georgia Foster Had they believed that he had murdered the children would those two fathers and the rest of their party have taken Simon Murphy and the three little Donner girls and left Keseberg alive in camp with lone sick and helpless missus Murphy missus Murphy who was grandmother of Georgia Foster and had sole charge of Jimmy Eddy Footnote twenty eight Should be spelled Keseberg Footnote twenty nine General Kearney and escort accompanied by Edwin Bryant Footnote thirty McGlashan s History of the Donner Party eighteen seventy nine Footnote thirty one The old Alcalde records are not in existence but some of the survivors of the party remember the circumstance and missus Samuel Kybert now of Clarkville Eldorado County was a witness at the trial C F McGlashan eighteen seventy nine IV LEWIS KESEBERG In March eighteen seventy nine while collecting material for his History of the Donner Party mister C F McGlashan of Truckee California visited survivors at San Jose and coming to me said missus Houghton I am sorry that I must look to you and your sisters for answers to the most delicate and trying questions relating to this history I refer to the death of your mother at the hand of Keseberg He was so surprised and shocked as I replied I do not believe that Keseberg was responsible for my mother s death that he interrupted me lost for a moment the manner of the impartial historian and with the directness of a cross questioning attorney asked Is it possible that missus George Donner s daughter defends the murderer of her mother And when I replied We have no proofs My mother s body was never found he continued earnestly Why I have enough evidence in this note book to convict that monster and I can do it or at least arouse such public sentiment against him that he will have to leave the State Very closely he followed my answering words mister McGlashan from little girlhood I have prayed that Lewis Keseberg some day would send for me and tell me of my mother s last hours and perhaps give a last message left for her children and I firmly believe that my prayer will be granted and I would not like you to destroy my opportunity You have a ready pen but it will not be used in exact justice to all the survivors as you have promised if you finish your work without giving Keseberg also a chance to speak for himself After a moment s reflection he replied I am amazed but your wish in this matter shall be respected The following evening he wrote from San Francisco You will be glad to know that I have put Harry N Morse s detective agency of Oakland upon the track of Keseberg and if found I mean to take steps to obtain his confession In less than a week after the foregoing came a note from him which tells its own story SACRAMENTO Midnight April four eighteen seventy nine missus E P HOUGHTON DEAR MADAM Late as it is I feel that I ought to tell you that I have spent the evening with Keseberg I have just got back and return early to morrow to complete my interview By merest accident while tracing as I supposed the record of his death I found a clue to his whereabouts After dark I drove six miles and found him At first he declined to tell me anything but somehow I melted the mood with which he seemed enwrapped and he talked freely He swears to me that he did not murder your mother He declares it so earnestly that I cannot doubt his veracity To morrow I intend plying him closely with questions and by a rigid system of cross examination will detect the false hood if there is one in his statement He gives chapter after chapter that others never knew I cannot say more to night but desire that you write me at the Cosmopolitan any questions you might wish me to ask Keseberg and if I have not already asked them I will do so on my return from San Francisco C F MCGLASHAN After his second interview with Keseberg and in response to my urgent appeal for full details of everything relating to my parents mister McGlashan wrote I wish you could see him He will talk to either you or me at any time unless other influences are brought to bear upon him If I send word for him to come to Sacramento he will meet me on my return If you and your husband could be there on Thursday or Friday of this week I could arrange an interview at the hotel that would be all you could wish I asked him especially if he would talk to you and he said Yes I dared not tell you about my interview until I had your permission Even now I approach the task tremblingly Your mother was not murdered Your father died Keseberg thinks about two weeks after you left Your mother remained with him until the last and laid him out tenderly as you know The days to Keseberg were perfect blanks missus Murphy died soon after your departure with Eddy and he was left alone alone in his cabin alone with the dead bodies which he could not have lifted from the floor because of his weakness even had he desired The man sighs and shudders and great drops of agony gather upon his brows as he endeavors to relate the details of those terrible days or recall their horrors Loneliness desolation was the chief element of horror Alone with the mutilated dead One night he sprang up in affright at the sound of something moving or scratching at a log outside his cabin It was some time before he could understand that it was wolves trying to get in One night about two weeks after you left a knock came at his door and your mother entered To this lonely wretch her coming seemed like an angel s She was cold and wet and freezing yet her first words were that she must see her children Keseberg understood that she intended to start out that very night and soon found that she was slightly demented She kept saying O God I must see my children I must go to my children She finally consented to wait until the morning but was determined that nothing should then prevent her lonely journey She told Keseberg where her money was concealed she made him solemnly promise that he would get the money and take it to her children She would not taste the food he had to offer She had not tasted human flesh and would hardly consent to remain in his foul and hideous den Too weak and Chilled to move she finally sank down on the floor and he covered her as best he could with blankets and feather bed and made a fire to warm her but it was of no avail she had received her death chill and in the morning her spirit had passed heavenward I believe Keseberg tells the truth Your mother watched day and night by your father s bedside until the end At nightfall he ceased to breathe and she was alone in the desolate camp where she performed the last sad ministrations and then her duty in the mountains was accomplished All the smothered yearnings of maternal love now burst forth with full power Out into the darkness and night she rushed without waiting for the morning My children I must see my children She arrived at Keseberg s cabin overwrought mentally overtaxed physically and chilled by the freezing night air She was eager to set forth on her desperate journey without resting a moment I can see her as he described her wringing her hands and exclaiming over and over again I must see my children The story told by missus Farnham and others about finding your mother s remains and that of Thornton concerning the pail of blood are unquestionably false She had been dead weeks and Keseberg confessed to me that no part of her body was found by the relief Fallon party My friend I have attempted to comply with your request More than once during this evening I have burst into tears I am sorry almost that I attempted so mournful a task but you will pardon the pain I have caused Keseberg is a powerful man six feet in height with full bushy beard thin brown locks and high forehead He has blue eyes that look squarely at you while he talks He is sometimes absent minded and at times seems almost carried away with the intensity of his misery and desolation He speaks and writes German French Spanish and English and his selection of words proves him a scholar When I first asked him to make a statement which I could reduce to writing he urged What is the use of making a statement People incline to believe the most horrible reports concerning a man they will not credit what I say in my own defence My conscience is clear I am an old man and am calmly awaiting my death God is my judge and it long ago ceased to trouble me that people shunned and slandered me He finally consented to make the desired statement and in speaking of your family he continued Some time after missus George Donner s death I thought I had gained sufficient strength to redeem the pledge I had made her before her death I went to Alder Creek Camp to get the money I had a difficult journey The wagons of the Donners were loaded with tobacco powder caps school books shoes and dry goods This stock was very valuable I spent the night there searched carefully among the bales and bundles of goods and found five hundred and thirty one dollars Part of this sum was gold part silver The silver I buried at the foot of a pine tree a little way from camp One of the lower branches of another tree reached down close to the ground and appeared to point to the spot I put the gold in my pocket and started back to my cabin got lost and in crossing a little flat the snow suddenly gave way and I sank down almost to my arm pits After great exertion I raised myself out of a snow covered stream and went round on a hillside and continued my journey At dark and completely exhausted and almost dead I came in sight of the Graves s cabin and sometime after dark staggered into my own My clothes were wet and the night was so cold that my garments were frozen stiff I did not build a fire nor get anything to eat just rolled myself up in the bed clothes and shivered finally fell asleep and did not waken until late in the morning Then I saw my camp was in most inexplicable confusion everything about the cabin was torn up and scattered about trunks broken open and my wife s jewellery my cloak my pistol and ammunition was missing I thought Indians had been there Suddenly I heard human voices I hurried up to the surface of the snow and saw white men approaching I was overwhelmed with joy and gratitude I had suffered so much and so long that I could scarcely believe my senses Imagine my astonishment upon their arrival to be greeted not with a Good morning or a kind word but with a gruff insolent demand Where is Donner s money I told them they ought to give me something to eat and that I would talk with them afterwards but no they insisted that I should tell them about Donner s money I asked who they were and where they came from but they replied by threatening to kill me if I did not give up the money They threatened to hang or shoot me At last I told them that I had promised missus Donner that I would carry her money to her children and I proposed to do so unless shown some authority by which they had a better claim This so exasperated them that they acted as though they were going to kill me I offered to let them bind me as a prisoner and take me before Alcalde Sinclair at Sutter s Fort and I promised that I would then tell all I knew about the money They would listen to nothing however and finally I told them where they would find the silver and gave them the gold After I had done this they showed me a document from Alcalde Sinclair by which they were to receive a certain proportion of all moneys and properties which they rescued Those men treated me with great unkindness mister Tucker was the only one who took my part or befriended me When they started over the mountains each man carried two bales of goods They had silks calicoes and delaines from the Donners and other articles of great value Each man would carry one bundle a little way lay it down and come back and get the other bundle In this way they passed over the snow three times I could not keep up with them because I was so weak but managed to come up to their camp every night Upon receipt of this communication I wrote mister McGlashan from San Jose that I was nerved for the ordeal but that he should not permit me to start on that momentous journey if his proposed arrangements were at all doubtful and that he should telegraph me at once Alas my note miscarried and believing that his proposal had not met my approval mister and missus McGlashan returned to Truckee a day earlier than expected Two weeks later he returned the envelope its postmarks showing what had happened It was not easy to gain the consent of my husband to a meeting with Keseberg He dreaded its effect on me He feared the outcome of the interview However on May sixteen eighteen seventy nine he and I by invitation joined mister and missus McGlashan at the Golden Eagle Hotel in Sacramento The former then announced that although Keseberg had agreed by letter to meet us there he had that morning begged to be spared the mortification of coming to the city hotel where some one might recognize him and as of old point the finger of scorn at him After some deliberation as to how I would accept the change mister McGlashan had aceeded to the old man s wish that we drive to the neat little boarding house at Brighton next morning where we could have the use of the parlor for a private interview In compliance with this arrangement we four were at the Brighton hotel at the appointed time mister McGlashan and my husband went in search of Keseberg and after some delay returned saying Keseberg cannot overcome his strong feeling against a meeting in a public house He has tidied up a vacant room in the brewery adjoining the house where he lives with his afflicted children It being Sunday he knows that no one will be about to disturb us Will you go there I could only reply I am ready My husband seeing my lips tremble and knowing the intensity of my suppressed emotion hastened to assure me that he had talked with the man and been impressed by his straightforward answers and that I need have no dread of meeting or talking with him When we met at his door mister McGlashan introduced us We bowed not as strangers not as friends nor did we shake hands Our thoughts were fixed solely on the purpose that had brought us together He invited us to enter led the way to that room which I had been told he had swept and furnished for the occasion with seats for five His first sentence made us both forget that others were present It opened the way at once mister McGlashan has told me that you have questions you wish to ask me yourself about what happened in the mountain cabin Still standing and looking up into his face I replied Yes for the eye of God and your eyes witnessed my mother s last hours and I have come to ask you in the presence of that other Witness when where and how she died I want you to tell me all and so truly that there shall be no disappointment for me nor remorse and denials for you in your last hour Tell it now so that you will not need to send for me to hear a different story then I took the chair he proffered and he placed his own opposite and having gently reminded me of the love and respect the members of the Donner Party bore their captain and his wife earnestly and feelingly he told me the story as he had related it to mister McGlashan Then before I understood his movement he had sunk upon his knees saying solemnly On my knees before you and in the sight of God I want to assert my innocence I could not have it thus I bade him rise and stand with me in the presence of the all seeing Father Extending my upturned hand I bade him lay his own right hand upon it then covering it with my left I bade him speak Slowly but unhesitatingly he spoke missus Houghton if I had murdered your mother would I stand here with my hand between your hands look into your pale face see the tear marks on your cheeks and the quiver of your lips as you ask the question No God Almighty is my witness I am innocent of your mother s death I have given you the facts as I gave them to the Fallon Party as I told them at Sutter s Fort and as I repeated them to mister McGlashan You will hear no change from my death bed for what I have told you is true There with a man s honor and soul to uncover I had scarcely breathed while he spoke I watched the expression of his face his words his hands His eyes did not turn from my face his hand between mine lay as untrembling as that of a child in peaceful sleep and so unflinchingly Lewis Keseberg passed the ordeal which would have made a guilty man quake I felt the truth of his assertion and told him that if it would be any comfort to him at that late day to know that Tamsen Donner s daughter believed him innocent of her murder he had that assurance in my words and that I would maintain that belief so long as my lips retained their power of speech Tears glistened in his eyes as he uttered a heartfelt Thank you and spoke of the comfort the recollection of this meeting would be to him during the remaining years of his life Before our departure mister McGlashan asked Keseberg to step aside and show my husband the scars left by the wound which had prevented his going to the settlement with the earlier refugees There was a mark of a fearful gash which had almost severed the heel from the foot and left a troublesome deformity One could easily realize how slow and tedious its healing must have been and Keseberg assured us that walking caused excruciating pain even at the time the Third Relief Corps left camp His clothing was threadbare but neat and clean One could not but feel that he was poor yet he courteously but positively declined the assistance which privately I offered him In bidding him good bye I remarked that we might not see one another again on earth and he replied pathetically Don t say that for I hope this may not be our last meeting I did not see Keseberg again Years later I learned that he had passed away and in answer to inquiries I received the following personal note from doctor G A White Medical Superintendent of the Sacramento County Hospital Lewis Keseberg died here on September three eighteen ninety five aged eighty one years He left no special message to any one His death was peaceful THE

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project
