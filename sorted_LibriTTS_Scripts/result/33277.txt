7128_84121_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Why 
none	none	should I be here if I didn t he asked I want to see the First Lord The man s manner underwent a change If you ll step inside sir you ll see an attendant John Dene stepped inside and repeated his request this time to a frock coated attendant Have you an appointment enquired the man No responded John Dene indifferently The attendant hesitated It was not customary for unknown callers to demand to see the First Lord without an appointment After a momentary pause the man indicated a desk on which lay some printed slips Will you please fill in your name sir and state your business State my business exclaimed John Dene not on your life I m afraid began the man Never mind what you re afraid of said John Dene just you take my name up to the First Lord Here I ll write it down Seizing a pen he wrote his name John Dene of Toronto and then underneath I ve come three thousand miles to tell you something perhaps it s worth three minutes of your time to listen There take that up and I ll wait he said The attendant read the message then beckoning to another frock coated servitor he handed him the paper at the same time whispering some instructions John Dene looked about him with interest He was frankly disappointed He had conceived the administrative buildings of the greatest navy in the world as something grand and impressive yet here was the British Admiralty with an entrance that would compare unfavourably with a second rate hotel in Toronto He turned suddenly and almost ran into a shifty eyed little man in a grey tweed suit who had entered the Admiralty a moment after him The man apologised profusely as John Dene eyed him grimly He had become aware of the man s interest in his colloquy with the attendant and of the way in which he had endeavoured to catch sight of what was written on the slip of paper John Dene proceeded to stride up and down with short jerky steps twirling his unlit cigar round in his mouth Excuse me sir said the attendant approaching but smoking is not permitted That so remarked John Dene without interest as he continued to roll his cigar in his mouth Your cigar sir continued the man It s out John Dene still continued to look about him The attendant retired nonplussed The rule specifically referred to smoking not to carrying unlit cigars in the mouth At the end of five minutes the attendant who had taken up John Dene s name returned and whispered to the doorkeeper If you will follow the attendant sir he will take you to see Sir Lyster s secretary mister Blair mister began John Dene then breaking off he followed the man up the stairs and along a corridor at the end of which another frock coated man appeared from a room with a small glass door He in turn took charge of the visitor having received his whispered instructions from the second attendant John Dene was then shown into a large room with a central table and requested to take a seat He was still engaged in gazing about him when a door at the further end of the room opened and there entered a fair man with an obvious stoop a monocle a heavy drooping moustache and the nose of a duke in a novelette mister John Dene he asked looking at the slip of paper in his hand Sure was the response as John Dene continued to twirl the cigar in his mouth with him always a sign either of thought or of irritation You wish to see the First Lord continued the fair man I am his secretary Will you give me some idea of your business No I won t was the blunt response mister Blair was momentarily disconcerted by the uncompromising nature of the retort but quickly recovered himself I am afraid Sir Lyster is very busy this morning he said diplomatically If you Look here interrupted John Dene I ve come three thousand miles to tell him something if he hasn t time to listen then I ll not waste my time but before you decide to send me about my business you just ring up the Agent General for Can da and ask who John Dene of T ronto is maybe you ll learn something But will you not give me some idea began the secretary No I won t was the obstinate reply Here he cried with sudden inspiration give me some paper and a pen and I ll write a note mister Blair sighed his relief he was a man of peace He quickly supplied the caller s demands Slowly he indited his letter then taking a case from his pocket he extracted an envelope which he enclosed with the letter in another envelope and finally addressed it to The First Lord of the Admiralty Give him this he said turning to mister Blair and say I m in a hurry Nothing but a long line of ancestors prevented mister Blair from gasping Instead he took the note with a diplomatic smile You wouldn t do for T ronto muttered John Dene as the First Lord s private secretary left the room Two minutes later he returned Sir Lyster will see you mister Dene he said with a smile Will you come this way I m sorry if Don t be sorry said John Dene patiently you re just doing your job as best you can Whilst John Dene was being led by mister Blair to the First Lord s private room Sir Lyster was re reading the astonishing note that had been sent in to him which ran DEAR SIR I am John Dene of Toronto I have come three thousand miles to tell you how to stop the German U boats If I do not succeed you can give the enclosed Lfifty thousand to the Red Cross Yours faithfully JOHN DENE Sir Lyster Grayne was a man for whom tradition had its uses but he never allowed it to dictate to him The letter that had just been brought in was he decided written by a man of strong individuality and the amazing offer it contained to forfeit fifty thousand pounds impressed him These were strange and strenuous days when every suggestion or invention must be examined and deliberated upon Sir Lyster Grayne prided himself upon his open mindedness incidentally he had a wholesome fear of questions being asked in the House As the door opened he rose and held out his hand Sir Lyster always assumed a democratic air as a matter of political expediency mister Dene he murmured as he motioned his visitor to a seat Pleased to meet you said John Dene as he shook hands and then took the seat indicated Sorry to blow in on you like this he continued but my business is important and I ve come three thousand miles about it So I understand said Sir Lyster quietly John Dene looked at him and in that look summed him up as he had previously summed up his secretary You wouldn t do for T ronto was his unuttered verdict John Dene placed a man irrevocably by determining whether or no he would do for Toronto First of all said Sir Lyster I think I will return this handing to John Dene the envelope containing the cheque for fifty thousand pounds I thought it would tickle you some he remarked grimly as he replaced the cheque in his pocket book but I ll cash in if I don t make good he added You know anything about submarines he demanded directness was John Dene s outstanding characteristic Er began the First Lord You don t announced John Dene with conviction I m afraid began Sir Lyster Then you d better send for someone who does was the uncompromising rejoinder Sir Lyster looked at his visitor in surprise hesitated a moment then pressing a button said as mister Blair appeared Will you ask Admiral Heyworth to come here immediately mister Blair retired Admiral Heyworth explained Sir Lyster is the Admiralty authority on submarines John Dene nodded There was a pause Wouldn t you like to ring up the Agent General for Can da and find out who I am suggested John Dene I don t think that is necessary mister Dene was the reply We will hear what you have to say first Ha Heyworth as the Admiral entered this is mister John Dene of Toronto who has come to tell us something about a discovery of his Admiral Heyworth a little bald headed man with beetling brows and a humorous mouth took the hand held out to him Pleased to meet you said John Dene then without a pause he continued I want your promise that this is all between us three that you won t go and breeze it about He looked from Sir Lyster to Admiral Heyworth Sir Lyster bowed Admiral Heyworth said Certainly Now said John Dene turning to the Admiral what s the greatest difficulty you re up against in submarine warfare Well began Admiral Heyworth there are several For instance There s only one that matters broke in John Dene your boats are blind when submerged beyond the depth of their periscopes That so The Admiral nodded Well continued John Dene I want you to understand I m not asking a red cent from anybody and I won t accept one What I m going to tell you about has already cost me well over a million dollars and if you look at me you ll see I m not the man to put a million dollars into patent fly catchers or boots guaranteed to button themselves Sir Lyster and the Admiral exchanged puzzled glances but said nothing Suppose the Germans were able to sink a ship without even showing their periscopes John Dene looked directly at the Admiral It would place us in a very precarious position was the grave reply Oh shucks cried John Dene in disgust It would queer the whole outfit You soldiers and sailors can never see beyond your own particular backyards It would mighty soon finish the war He almost shouted the words in the emphasis he gave them It would mean that troops couldn t be brought from America it would mean that supplies couldn t be brought over here It would mean good bye to the whole sunflower patch Do you get me He looked from Sir Lyster to the Admiral I think said Sir Lyster that perhaps you exaggerate a lit I don t said John Dene I know what I m talking about Now why is the submarine blind Because he answered his own question no one has ever overcome the difficulty of the density of water I have Admiral Heyworth started visibly and Sir Lyster bent forward eagerly You have cried Admiral Heyworth Sure was the self complacent reply I ve got a boat fitted with an apparatus that ll sink any ship that comes along and she needn t show her periscope to do it either What s more she can see under water If I don t deliver the goods John Dene rummaged in his pocket once more and produced the envelope containing the cheque here s fifty thousand pounds you can give to the Red Cross Sir Lyster and Admiral Heyworth gazed at each other wordless John Dene sat back in his chair and chewed the end of his cigar Sir Lyster fumbled for his eye glass and when he had found it stuck it in his eye and gazed at John Dene as if he had been some marvellous being from another world The Admiral said nothing and did nothing He was visualising the possibilities arising out of such a discovery It was John Dene who broke in upon their thoughts The Huns have got it coming he remarked grimly But began Admiral Heyworth Listen said John Dene I m an electrical engineer I m worth more millions than you ve got toes I saw that under water the submarine is only a blind fish with a sting in its tail Give it eyes and it becomes a real factor under water He paused revolving his cigar in his mouth His listeners nodded eagerly Well he continued I set to work to give her eyes On the saint Lawrence River just below Quebec I ve got a submarine that can see Her search lights But how have you done it broke in the Admiral That remarked John Dene drily is my funeral We must put this before the Inventions Board said Sir Lyster Let me see this is Friday Can you be here on Tuesday mister Dene No Sir Lyster started at the decision in John Dene s tone Would Wednesday Look here broke in John Dene I come from T ronto and in Can da when we ve got a good thing we freeze on to it You ve got to decide this thing within twenty four hours yes or no Unless I cable to my agent in Washin ton by noon to morrow he ll make the same offer I ve made you to the States and they ll be that eager to say Yep that they ll swallow their gum But mister Dene began Sir Lyster I ve been in this country fourteen hours proceeded John Dene calmly and I can see that you all want gingering up Why the hell can t you decide on a thing at once when you ve got everything before you If a man offers you a pedigree pup for nothing and you want a pedigree pup wouldn t you just hold out your hand John Dene looked from one to the other But this is not exactly a matter of a pedigree pup suggested Admiral Heyworth diplomatically It s a matter of er I see you haven t got me said John Dene with the air of a patient schoolmaster with a stupid pupil You he addressed himself in particular to Sir Lyster have said in public that the most difficult spot in connexion with the submarine trouble is between the Shetlands and the Norwegian coast You can t help the U boats slipping through submerged Suppose the Destroyer that s the name of my boat is sort of hanging around there with eyes and some other little things she s got what then Both Sir Lyster and I appreciate all you say said the Admiral but well we are a little old fashioned perhaps in our methods here He smiled deprecatingly Well said John Dene rising you lose the odd trick that s all and he added significantly as he took a step towards the door when it all comes out you ll lose your jobs too Really mister Dene protested Sir Lyster flushing slightly John Dene swung round on his heel If you d spent three years of your life and over a million dollars on a boat and come three thousand miles to offer it to someone for nothing and were told to wait till God knows which day what week well you d be rattled too In T ronto we size up a man before he s had time to say he s pleased to meet us and we d buy a mountain quicker than you d ask your neighbour to pass the marmalade at breakfast Whilst John Dene was speaking Sir Lyster had been revolving the matter swiftly in his mind He was impressed by his visitor s fearlessness A self made man himself he admired independence and freedom of speech in others He was not oblivious to the truth of John Dene s hint of what would happen if another nation even an allied nation were to acquire a valuable invention that had been declined by Great Britain He remembered the Fokker scandal He decided to temporise If continued John Dene I was asking for money I d understand but I won t take a red cent and more than that I go bail to the tune of a quarter of a million dollars that I deliver the goods He strode up and down the room twirling his cigar and flinging his short sharp sentences at the two men who to his mind stood as barriers to an Allied triumph If you will sit down mister Dene said Sir Lyster suavely I ll explain John Dene hesitated for a moment then humped himself into a chair gazing moodily before him We quite appreciate your er patriotism and public spiritedness in Here cut it out broke in John Dene Do you want the Destroyer or don t you Sir Lyster recoiled as if he had been struck He had been First Lord too short a time for the gilt to be worn off his dignity Seeing his Chief about to reply in a way that he suspected might end the interview Admiral Heyworth interposed May I suggest that under the circumstances we consult mister Llewellyn John That s bully broke in John Dene without giving Sir Lyster a chance of replying They say he s got pep Bowing to the inevitable Sir Lyster picked up the telephone receiver Get me through to the Prime Minister he said The three men waited in silence for the response As the bell rang Sir Lyster swiftly raised the receiver to his ear Yes the Prime Minister Sir Lyster Grayne speaking There was a pause Grayne speaking yes Can I come round with Admiral Heyworth and an er inventor It s very important He listened for a moment then added Yes we ll come at once Now mister Dene said Sir Lyster as he rose and picked up his hat I hope we shall be able to er He did not finish the sentence but led the way to the door The three men walked across the Horse Guards Quadrangle towards Downing Street The only words uttered were when Sir Lyster asked John Dene if he had seen the pelicans John Dene looked at him in amazement He had heard that in British official circles it was considered bad taste to discuss the war except officially and he decided that he was now discovering what was really the matter with the British Empire As the trio crossed the road to mount the steps leading to Downing Street the girl passed of whom John Dene had asked the way Her eyes widened slightly as she recognised John Dene s two companions they widened still more when John Dene lifted his hat followed a second later by Sir Lyster whilst Admiral Heyworth saluted In her surprise she nearly ran into a little shifty eyed man in a grey suit who with an elaborate flourish of his hat hastened to apologise for her carelessness That s the girl who showed me the way to your back door John Dene announced nonchalantly Sir Lyster exchanged a rapid glance with the Admiral If I was running this show continued John Dene I d get that door enlarged a bit and splash some paint about and for the first time since they had met John Dene smiled up at Sir Lyster a smile that entirely changed the sombre cast of his features On arriving at no Downing Street the three callers were conducted straight into mister Llewellyn John s room As they entered he rose quickly from his table littered with papers and with a smile greeted his colleagues Sir Lyster then introduced John Dene mister Llewellyn John grasped John Dene s hand and turned on him that bewilderingly sunny smile which mister Chappeldale had once said ought in itself to win the war Sit down mister Dene said mister Llewellyn John indicating a chair it s always a pleasure to meet any one from Canada What should we have done without you Canadians he murmured half to himself mister Dene tells us that he has solved the submarine problem said Sir Lyster as he and Admiral Heyworth seated themselves Instantly mister Llewellyn John became alert The social smile vanished from his features giving place to the look of a keen witted Celt eager to pounce upon something that would further his schemes He turned to John Dene interrogatingly Perhaps mister Dene will explain suggested Sir Lyster Sure said John Dene your submarine isn t a submarine at all it s a submersible Under water it s useless because it can t see As well call a seal a fish A submarine must be able to fight under water and until it can it won t be any more a submarine than I m a tunny fish mister Llewellyn John nodded in eager acquiescence I ve spent over a million dollars and now I ve got a boat that can see under water and fight under water and do a lot of other fancy tricks mister Llewellyn John sprang to his feet You have Tell me where is it This is wonderful wonderful It takes us a year forward It s on the saint Lawrence River just below Quebec explained John Dene And how long will it take to construct say a hundred asked mister Llewellyn John eagerly dropping back into his chair Longer than any of us are going to live replied John Dene grimly mister Llewellyn John looked at his visitor in surprise Sir Lyster and the Admiral exchanged meaning glances The Prime Minister was experiencing what in Toronto were known as John s snags But if you ve made one began mister Llewellyn John There s only going to be one announced John Dene grimly But You can but like a he goat announced John Dene still there ll be only our Destroyer Sir Lyster smiled inwardly His bruised dignity was recovering at the sight of the surprised look on the face of the Prime Minister at John Dene s comparison Perhaps mister Dene will explain to us the difficulties insinuated Sir Lyster Sure said John Dene then turning to Admiral Heyworth What would happen if Germany got a submarine that could see and do fancy stunts he demanded It might embarrass began the Admiral Shucks cried John Dene it would bust us up What about the American transports food ships munitions and the rest of it They d be attacked all along the three thousand miles route and would go down like neck oil on a permit night You get me Suddenly mister Llewellyn John struck the table with his fist You re right mister Dene he cried they might capture one and copy it You remember the Gothas he added turning to Sir Lyster Sure was John Dene s laconic reply But how can we be sure they will not capture the Destroyer enquired Sir Lyster Because there ll be John Dene and a hundred weight of high explosive on board said John Dene drily as he chewed at the end of his cigar Then you propose began Admiral Heyworth I ll put you wise This is my offer I m willing to send U boats to merry hell but only on my own terms I won t take a cent for my boat or anything else It s my funeral The Destroyer is now in Canada with German spies buzzing around like flies over a dead rat If you agree I ll cable to my boys to bring the Destroyer and it won t be done without some fancy shooting I take it You turning to Admiral Heyworth will appoint an officer two if you like to come aboard and count the bag I ll supply the crew and you ll give me a commander s commission in the Navy Now is it a deal But began Sir Lyster You make me tired said John Dene wearily Is it or is it not a deal he enquired of mister Llewellyn John With an effort the Prime Minister seemed to gather himself together He found the pace a little breathless even for him I think it might be arranged Grayne he said tactfully mister Dene knows his own invention and we might enrol his crew in the Navy what do you think mister Llewellyn John abounded in tact I take it that you understand navigation mister Dene ventured the Admiral Sure was the reply You come a trip with me and I ll show you navigation that ll make your hair stand on end Sorry he added a moment after observing that Admiral Heyworth was almost aggressively bald That s all right laughed the Admiral they call me the coot Well is it a deal demanded John Dene rising It is said mister Llewellyn John and a splendid deal for the British Empire mister Dene he added holding out his hand It s a great privilege to meet a patriot such as you Sir Lyster and Admiral Heyworth will settle all details to your entire satisfaction If they do for me I want you to give the command to Blake then to Quinton and so on only to my own boys is that agreed Do for you queried mister Llewellyn John Huns they re after me every hour of the day There was a little chap even in your own building We really must intern these Germans began mister Llewellyn John You re barking up the wrong tree over here said John Dene with conviction You think a German spy s got a square head and says Ach himmel and Ja wohl on street cars It s the neutrals mostly and sometimes the British he added under his breath In any case you will I am sure find that Sir Lyster will do whatever you want said mister Llewellyn John as they walked towards the door For the second time that morning John Dene smiled as he left No one hundred ten Downing Street with Sir Lyster and Admiral Heyworth whilst mister Llewellyn John rang up the chief of Department Z CHAPTER II JOHN DENE S WAY As Sir Lyster entered mister Blair s room accompanied by John Dene and Admiral Heyworth he was informed that Sir Bridgman North the First Sea Lord was anxious to see him Ask him if he can step over now Blair said Sir Lyster and the three men passed into the First Lord s room Two minutes later Sir Bridgman North entered and Sir Lyster introduced John Dene For a moment the two men eyed one another in mutual appraisement the big bluff Sea Lord with his humorous blue eyes and ready laugh and the keen heavy featured Canadian as suspicious of a gold band as of a pickpocket Pleased to meet you said John Dene perfunctorily as they shook hands Now you d better give me a chance to work off my music and with that he seated himself Sir Bridgman exchanged an amused glance with Admiral Heyworth as they too found chairs In a few words Sir Lyster explained the reason of John Dene s visit Sir Bridgman listened with the keen interest of one to whom his profession is everything Now mister Dene said Sir Lyster when he had finished perhaps you will continue In short jerky sentences John Dene outlined his scheme of operations the others listening intently From time to time Sir Bridgman or Admiral Heyworth would interpolate a question upon some technical point which was promptly and satisfactorily answered John Dene seemed to have forgotten nothing For two hours the four sat discussing plans for a campaign that was once and for all to put an end to Germany s submarine hopes During those two hours the three Englishmen learned something of the man with whom they had to deal Sir Bridgman s tact cheery personality and understanding of how to handle men did much to improve the atmosphere and gradually John Dene s irritation disappeared It was nearly three o clock before all the arrangements were completed John Dene was to receive a temporary commission as commander as soon as the King s signature could be obtained The Destroyer was entered on the Navy List as Hfour thus taking the place of a submarine that was missing John Dene had stipulated that she should be rated in some existing class so that the secret of her existence might be preserved In short sharp sentences he had presented his demands they were nothing less and the others had acquiesced By now they were all convinced that he was right and that the greatest chance of success lay in giving him his head as Sir Bridgman North expressed it in a whisper to Sir Lyster A base was to be selected on some island in the North of Scotland and fitted with wireless with aerials a hundred and fifty feet high to pick up all that s going explained John Dene conscious of the surprise of his hearers at a request for such a long range plant Here the Destroyer was to be based and stores and fuel sufficient for six months accumulated This was to be proceeded with at once I shall want charts of the minefields he said and full particulars as to patrol flotillas and the like Admiral Heyworth nodded comprehendingly By the way he said there s one thing I do not quite understand Put a name to it said John Dene tersely How do you propose to keep at sea for any length of time without recharging your batteries We shall be lying doggo most of the time was the reply Then in all probability the U boats will pass over you We shan t be lying at the bottom of the sea either said John Dene What exclaimed Admiral Heyworth but if your motor s cut off you ll sink to the bed of the sea the law of gravity The Destroyer is fitted with buoyancy chambers and she can generate a gas that will hold her suspended at any depth he explained This gas can be liquefied in a few seconds Her microphone will tell her when the U boats are about it s my own invention Sir Lyster looked from one to the other unable to grasp such technicalities but conscious that Admiral Heyworth seemed surprised at what he heard It s up to you to see that none of your boys start dropping depth charges around said John Dene He went on to explain that he proposed a certain restricted area for operations and that the Admiralty should issue instructions that no depth charges were to be dropped on any submarine within that area until further notice There s one thing I must leave you to supply said John Dene as he leaned back in his chair smoking a cigar John Dene chewed the end of a cigar during the period of negotiations and smoked it when the deal was struck And what is that asked Sir Bridgman I shall want a mother A mother ejaculated Sir Lyster looking from John Dene to the First Sea Lord who laughed loudly Sir Lyster always felt that Sir Bridgman should have left his laugh on the quarter deck when he relinquished active command A mother he explained is a kangaroo ship a dry dock ship for salvage and repair of submarines Yes we ll fit you out Sir Lyster looked chagrined He had found some difficulty in mastering naval technicalities When war broke out he was directing a large dock from which vast numbers of troops were shipped to France He had shown such administrative genius that mister Llewellyn John had selected him for the post of First Lord of the Admiralty with results that satisfied every one even the Sea Lords John Dene then proceeded to indicate the nature of the alterations he would require made in the vessel showing a remarkable knowledge of the British type of mother ship You ought either to be shot as a spy or made First Sea Lord said Sir Bridgman looking up from a diagram that John Dene had produced The Hun ll try to do the shooting and as for my becoming Sea Lord I should be sorry for some of the plugs here John Dene s thoroughness impressed his three hearers Everything had been foreseen even the spot where the Destroyer was to be based The small island of Auchinlech possessed a natural harbour of sufficient size for the mother ship to enter after which the entrance was to be guarded by a defensive boom as a safeguard against U boats John Dene explained that a month or five weeks must elapse before the Destroyer would be ready for action In about three weeks she could be at Auchinlech crossing the Atlantic under her own power Another week or ten days would be required for refitting and taking in stores When you ve delivered the goods you can quit and I shall be pleased to see your boys again in four months John Dene regarded his listeners with the air of a man who had just thrown a bombshell and is conscious of the fact Four months ejaculated Sir Lyster Yep He uttered the monosyllable in a tone that convinced at least one of his listeners that expostulation would be useless But protested Sir Lyster how shall we know what is happening You won t was the laconic reply But began Sir Lyster again If no one knows what is happening interrupted John Dene no one can tell anyone else Surely mister Dene said Sir Lyster with some asperity in his voice you do not suspect the War Cabinet for instance of divulging secrets of national importance I don t suspect the War Cabinet of anything was the dry retort not even of trying to win the war John Dene looked straight into Sir Lyster s eyes There was an awkward pause Who s going to guarantee that the War Cabinet doesn t talk in its sleep he continued I m not out to take risks If this country doesn t want my boat on my terms then I shan t worry although you may he added as an afterthought No sir he banged his fist on the table vehemently This is the biggest thing that s come into the war so far and I m not going to have anyone monkeying about with my plans I m going to have a written document that I ve got a free hand otherwise I don t deal that s understood But began Sir Lyster once more Excuse me Grayne broke in Sir Bridgman may I suggest that as we are all keenly interested parties mister Dene might give us his reasons Sure said John Dene without waiting for Sir Lyster s reply In Can da a man gets a job because he s the man for that job leastwise if he s not he s fired Here I ll auction that half the big jobs are held by mutts whose granddad s had a pleasant way of saying how d ye do to a prince If any of them came around you d have me skippin like a scalded cat and when I m like that I m liable to say things I m my own man and my own boss and I take a man s size in most things I m too old to feel meek at the sight of gold bands I want to feel kind to everybody and I find I can do that in this country better when everybody keeps out of my way John Dene paused and the others looked at each other a little nonplussed how to respond to such directness It s been in my head fillin quite a while to tell you this and John Dene suddenly smiled one of those rare smiles that seemed to take the sting out of his words I d be real sorry to hurt anybody s feelings he added but we ve got different notions of things in Can da It was Sir Bridgman who eased the situation If ever you want a second in command I m your man he laughed Straight talk makes men friends and if we do wrap things up a bit more here we aren t so thin skinned as not to be able to take it from the shoulder What say you Grayne Yes certainly said Sir Lyster with unconvincing hesitation You were mentioning spies said Admiral Heyworth So would you if they d plagued you as they ve plagued me said John Dene They ve already stolen three sets of plans Three sets of plans cried Sir Lyster starting up in alarm John Dene nodded as he proceeded to relight the stump of his cigar One set in T ronto one on the steamer and the other from my room at the Ritzton Good Heavens exclaimed Sir Lyster in alarm what is to be done Oh I ve got another three sets said John Dene calmly Sir Lyster looked at him as if doubtful of his sanity Don t you worry said John Dene imperturbably one set of plans was of the Uone the first boat the Germans built the second set was of the Utwo and the third of the Unine Sir Bridgman s laugh rang out as he thumped the table with his fist Splendid he cried Sir Lyster sank back into his chair with a sigh of relief By the way Dene said Sir Bridgman casually suppose the Destroyer was er lost and you with her I ve arranged for a set of plans to be delivered to the First Lord whoever he may be at the time said John Dene Good said Sir Bridgman You think of everything We shall have you commanding the Grand Fleet before the war s over Sir Lyster said nothing He did not quite relish the qualification whoever he may be at the time About the spies he said after a pause I think it would be advisable to arrange for your protection Not on your life cried John Dene with energy I don t want any policemen following me around I ve got my own well he added I ve fixed things up all right and if the worst comes to the worst well there aren t many men in this country that can beat John Dene with a gun Now it s up to me to make good on this proposition He looked from one to the other as if challenging contradiction Finding there was none he continued But there are a few things that I want before I can start in and then you won t see me for dust You get me He looked suddenly at Sir Lyster We ll do everything in our power to help you mister Dene said Sir Lyster reaching for a clean sheet of paper from the rack before him Well I ve got it all figured out here said John Dene taking a paper from his jacket pocket First I want a written undertaking signed by you turning to Sir Lyster and mister Llewellyn John that I m to have four months to run the Destroyer with no one butting in Sir Lyster nodded and made a note Next continued John Dene I want a mothership fully equipped with stores and fuel sufficient for four months Again Sir Lyster inclined his head and made a note I ll give you a schedule of everything I m likely to want Then I want an undertaking that if anything happens to me the command goes to Blake and then to Quinton If I don t get these things he announced with decision I ll call a halt right here I think you can depend upon Sir Lyster doing all you want mister Dene said Sir Bridgman and when you see the way he does it perhaps you ll have a better opinion of the Admiralty Sir Lyster smiled slightly He had already determined to show John Dene that nowhere in the world was there an organisation equal to that of the Admiralty Victualling and Stores Departments You help John Dene and he s with you till the cows come to roost was the response and now he added shrewdly you d better get the cables to work and find out something about me Something about you queried Sir Lyster You re not going to trust a man because he talks big I ll gamble on that Well you ll learn a deal about John Dene and now it s time you got a rustle on In all probability our Intelligence Department knows all about you by now mister Dene said Sir Bridgman with a laugh It s supposed to be fairly up to date in most things Well said John Dene as he leaned back in his chair puffing vigorously at his cigar you ve treated me better n I expected and you won t regret it Remembering s my long suit I don t want any honour or glory out of this stunt I just want to get the job done If there are any garters or collars going around you may have em personally I don t wear em garters I mean A couple of rubber bands are good enough for me Sir Bridgman laughed Sir Lyster smiled indulgently and Admiral Heyworth rose to go There s only one thing more I want a room here and someone to take down letters I will tell my secretary to arrange everything said Sir Lyster You have only to ask for what you require mister Dene Well that s settled said John Dene rising Now it s up to me and if the Destroyer doesn t give those Huns merry hell then I m green goods and with this enigmatical utterance he abruptly left the room with a nod and a See you all in the morning As the door closed the three men gazed at each other for a few seconds An original character said Sir Lyster indulgently Going Heyworth he enquired as Admiral Heyworth moved towards the door Yes I ve hardly touched the day s work yet was the reply Never mind said Sir Bridgman you ve done the best day s work you re likely to do during this war I think I agree with you said Admiral Heyworth as he left the room Well Grayne what do you think of our friend John Dene inquired Sir Bridgman as he lighted a cigarette He s rather abrupt said Sir Lyster hesitatingly but I think he s a sterling character You re right said Sir Bridgman heartily I wish we had a dozen John Denes in the Service When the colonies do produce a man they do the thing in style and Canada has made no mistake about John Dene He s going nearer to win the war than any other man in the Empire Ah your incurable enthusiasm smiled Sir Lyster What I like about him remarked Sir Bridgman is that he never waits to be contradicted He certainly does seem to take everything for granted said Sir Lyster with a note of complaint in his voice The man who has all the cards generally does said Sir Bridgman drily Dene will always get there because he has no axe to grind and the only thing he respects is brains That is why he snubs us all so unmercifully he added with the laugh that always made Sir Lyster wish he wouldn t Now I want to consult you about a rather embarrassing question that s on the paper for Friday said Sir Lyster Unconscious that he was forming the subject of discussion with the heads of the Admiralty John Dene on leaving the First Lord s room turned to the right and walked quickly in the direction of the main staircase As he reached a point where the corridor was intersected by another running at right angles the sudden opening of a door on his left caused him to turn his head quickly A moment later there was a feminine cry and a sound of broken crockery and John Dene found himself gazing down at a broken teapot Oh He looked up from the steaming ruin of newly brewed tea into the violet eyes of the girl who had directed him to the Admiralty He noticed the purity of her skin the redness of her lips and the rebelliousness of her corn coloured hair which seeming to refuse all constraint clung about her head in little wanton tendrils That s my fault said John Dene removing his hat I m sorry Yes but our tea said the girl in genuine consternation we re rationed you know Rationed said John Dene Yes we only get two ounces a week each she said with a comical look of despair Gee cried John Dene then he asked suddenly What are you The girl looked at him in surprise a little stiffly Can you type Never mind about the tea But I do mind about the tea She found John Dene s manner disarming I take it you re a stenographer Now tell me your name I ll see about the tea He had whipped out a note book and pencil Hurry I ve got a cable to send Seeing that she was reluctant to give her name he continued Never mind about your name Be in the First Lord s room to morrow at eleven o clock I ll see you there and with that he turned quickly resumed his hat and retraced his steps Without knocking he pushed open the door of mister Blair s room walked swiftly across and opened the door leading to that of the First Lord Here he cried where can I buy a pound of tea If John Dene had asked where he could borrow an ichthyosaurus Sir Lyster and Sir Bridgman could not have gazed at him with more astonishment You can t said Sir Bridgman at length his eyes twinkling as he watched the expression on Sir Lyster s face Can t cried John Dene Tea s rationed two ounces a week explained Sir Bridgman Anyhow I ve got to buy a pound of tea I ve just smashed up the teapot of a girl in the corridor I m afraid it s impossible said Sir Lyster with quiet dignity Impossible said John Dene irritably Here am I giving more n a million dollars to the country and I can t get a pound of tea I ll see about that She ll be here in this room to morrow at eleven o clock and with that the door closed and John Dene disappeared I ve told a girl to be here at eleven o clock to morrow She s going to be my secretary he explained to mister Blair as he passed through his office mister Blair blinked his eyes vigorously He had seen Sir Lyster and Admiral Heyworth leave the Admiralty with John Dene he gathered that they had had a long interview with the Prime Minister then they had returned again and for two hours had sat in consultation with the First Sea Lord Now the amazing John Dene had made an appointment to meet some girl in the First Lord s room at eleven o clock the next morning As John Dene left the Admiralty puffing clouds of blue content from his cigar the shifty eyed man in a grey suit who had been examining the Royal Marines statue drew a white handkerchief with a flourish from his pocket and proceeded to blow his nose vigorously The act seemed to pass unnoticed save by a young girl sitting on a neighbouring seat She immediately appeared to become greatly interested in the movements of John Dene whilst the man in the grey suit walked away in the direction of Birdcage Walk Where s the tea was the cry with which Dorothy West was greeted as she entered the room she occupied with a number of other girls after her encounter with John Dene It s in the corridor she replied Oh go and get it there s a dear I m simply parched cried Marjorie Rogers a pretty little brunette at the further corner It s all gone said Dorothy West a Hun just knocked it out of my hand He smashed the teapot Smashed the teapot cried several girls in chorus Oh Wessie wailed the little brunette I shall die Why did you let him do it asked a fair girl with white eyelashes and glasses I didn t said Dorothy he just barged into me and knocked the teapot out of my hand and then made an assignation for eleven o clock to morrow in the First Lord s room An assignation The First Lord s room cried Miss Cunliffe who by virtue of a flat chest a pair of round glasses and an uncompromising manner made an ideal supervisor She was known as Old Goggles What do you mean Miss West Exactly what I say Miss Cunliffe He asked me if I was a stenographer and then said that I was to see him at eleven o clock to morrow morning in the First Lord s room What do you think I had better do Who is he What is he Do tell us Wessie dear cried Marjorie Rogers excitedly Well I should think he s either a madman or else he s bought the Admiralty said Dorothy West her head on one side as if weighing her words before uttering them He s the man I saw this morning with Sir Lyster Grayne and Admiral Heyworth going to call on the Prime Minister at least I suppose they were they went up the steps into Downing Street But ought I to go at eleven o clock Miss Cunliffe she queried I ll make enquiries said Miss Cunliffe I ll see mister Blair Perhaps he s mad But what are we going to do about our tea wailed Marjorie I d sooner lose my character than my tea Miss Rogers said Miss Cunliffe whose conception of supervisorship was that she should oversee the decorum as well as the work of the other occupants of the room I believe she did it on purpose said she of the white eyelashes spitefully to a girl in a velvet blouse You had better brew to morrow s tea to day Miss West said Miss Cunliffe Yes do there s a darling cried Marjorie I simply can t wait another five minutes Why I couldn t lick a stamp to save my life Borrow No thirteen s pot when they ve finished with it and pinch some of their tea if you can she added And Dorothy West went out to interview the guardian of No thirteen s teapot CHAPTER III DEPARTMENT Z I mister Sage there Very well ask him to step in and see me as soon as he returns Colonel Walton replaced the telephone receiver and continued to draw diagrams upon the blotting pad before him an occupation in which he had been engaged for the last quarter of an hour Since its creation two years before he had been Chief of Department Z the most secret section of the British Secret Service with Malcolm Sage as his lieutenant Department Z owed its inception to an inspiration on the part of mister Llewellyn John He had conceived the idea of creating a secret service department the working of which should be secret even from the Secret Service itself Its primary object was that the Prime Minister and the War Cabinet might have a private means of obtaining such special information as it required Department Z was unhampered by rules and regulations as devoid of conventions as an enterprising flapper In explaining his scheme to mister Thaw the Chancellor of the Exchequer mister Llewellyn John had said Suppose I want to know what Chappeldale had for lunch yesterday and don t like to ask him how am I to find out I want a Department that can tell me anything I want to know and will be surprised at nothing With mister Llewellyn John to conceive a thing was to put it into practice He did not make the mistake of placing Department Z under the control of a regular secret service man I m tired of red tape and traditions he had remarked to mister Thaw If I go to the front they won t let me speak to a man lower than a brigadier whereas I want the point of view of the drummer boy mister Llewellyn John had heard of Colonel Walton s exploits in India as head of the Burmah Police had seen him and in five minutes the first Chief of Department Z was appointed From the Ministry of Supply mister Llewellyn John had plucked Malcolm Sage whom he later described as either a ferret turned dreamer or a dreamer turned ferret he was not quite sure which In discovering Malcolm Sage mister Llewellyn John had achieved one of his greatest strokes of good fortune When Minister of Supply his notice had been attracted to Sage as the man who had been instrumental in bringing to light that is official light for the affair was never made public the greatest contracts scandal of the war It was due entirely to his initiative and unobtrusive enquiries that a gigantic fraud diabolical in its cleverness had been discovered a fraud that might have involved the country in the loss of millions mister Llewellyn John had recognised that this young accountant had done him a great service perhaps saved him from a serious political set back Incidentally he discovered that Sage was a very uneasy person to have in a Government department Sage cared nothing for tradition discipline or bureaucracy If they interfered with the proper performance of his duties overboard they went He was the most transferred man in Whitehall No one seemed to want to keep him for longer than the period necessary for the formalities of his transfer Uneasy lies the Head that has a Sage was a phrase some wag had coined If a man wanted to condemn another as too zealous unnecessarily hard working or as a breaker of idols he likened him to Sage The chief of the department from which mister Llewellyn John took Malcolm Sage when Department Z was formed is said to have wept tears of joy at the news For months he had striven to transfer his unconventional subordinate but there was none who would have him This unfortunate chief of department had gone through life like a man wanting to sell a dog of dubious pedigree In the Ministry he was known as Henry II and Sage came to be referred to as Beckett In Department Z Sage found his proper niche Under Colonel Walton a man of few words and great tact he had found an ideal chief one who understood how to handle men As John Dene had left one hundred ten Downing Street with Sir Lyster and Admiral Heyworth mister Llewellyn John had rung up Colonel Walton and requested that full enquiries be made at once as to John Dene of Toronto and a report submitted to him in the morning That was all He had given no indication of why he wanted to know or what was John Dene s business in London Hardly a day of his life passed without mister Llewellyn John having cause to be thankful for the inspiration that had resulted in the founding of Department Z Nothing seemed to come amiss either to the Department or its officials They never required an elaborate filling up of forms they never asked for further particulars as did other departments They just got to work mister Llewellyn John had once and for all defined Department Z when he said to mister Thaw If I were to ask Scotland Yard if Chappeldale had gone over to the Bolshevists or if Waytensee had become an Orangeman they would send a man here his pockets bulging with note books Department Z would tell me all I wanted to know in a few hours In his first interview with mister Llewellyn John previous to being appointed to Department Z Malcolm Sage had bluntly criticised the Government s methods of dealing with the spy peril You re all wrong sir he had said If you spot a spy you arrest imprison or deport him according to the degree of his guilt Any fool could do that he had added quietly And what would you do Sage inquired mister Llewellyn John who never took offence at the expression of any man s honest opinion no matter how emphatically worded I should watch him was the laconic reply Just as was done before the war You didn t arrest spies then you just let them think they were safe For a few moments mister Llewellyn John had pondered the remark and then asked for an explanation If you arrest shoot or intern a spy another generally springs up in his place and you have to start afresh to find him he may do a lot of mischief before that comes about Sage gazed meditatively at his finger nails a habit of his On the other hand he continued if you know your man you can watch him and generally find out what he s after Better a known than an unknown danger he had added oracularly I m afraid they wouldn t endorse that doctrine at Scotland Yard smiled mister Llewellyn John Scotland Yard is a place of promoted policemen replied Sage regulation intellects in regulation boots mister Llewellyn John smiled He always appreciated a phrase Then you would not arrest a burglar but watch him he said glancing keenly at Sage The cases are entirely different sir was the reply a burglar invariably works on his own a spy is more frequently than not a cog of a machine and must be replaced He seldom works entirely alone Go on mister Llewellyn John had said seeing that Sage paused and was intently regarding his finger nails of his right hand Even when burglars work in gangs there is no superior organisation to replace destroyed units continued Sage With international secret service it is different its casualties are made good as promptly as with a field army I believe you re right said mister Llewellyn John If you can convince Colonel Walton then Department Z can be run on those lines Malcolm Sage had found no difficulty in convincing his chief a man of quiet demeanour but unprejudiced mind The result had been that Department Z had not so far caused a single arrest although it had countered many clever schemes Its motto was The Day when it could make a really historical haul The progress of Malcolm Sage had been remarkable Colonel Walton had quickly seen that his subordinate could work only along his own lines and in consequence he had given him his head Sage on his part had discovered in his chief a man with a sound knowledge of human nature generously spiced with the devil As Sage entered Colonel Walton ceased his diagrams and looked up Sage was as unlike the sleuth hound of fiction as it is possible for a man to be At first glance he looked like the superintendent of a provincial Sunday school He was about thirty five years of age sandy wore gold rimmed glasses and possessed a conical head prematurely bald He had a sharp nose steel coloured eyes and large ears but there was the set of his jaw which told of determination Seating himself in his customary place Sage proceeded to pull at the inevitable briar without which he was seldom seen For a full minute there was silence Colonel Walton deliberately lighted a cigar and leaned back to listen He knew his man and refrained from asking questions They re puzzled chief Sage knocked the ashes from his pipe into the ash tray on the table and they re getting jumpy he added Colonel Walton nodded Twice they ve ransacked John Dene s room at the Ritzton and found nothing Does he know enquired Colonel Walton Sage nodded John Dene s a dark horse he remarked with respect in his voice and the Huns can t make up their minds To what enquired the chief To give up the shadow for the substance he remarked as he pressed down the tobacco in his pipe They want the plans and they want to prevent the boat from putting to sea Colonel Walton nodded comprehendingly They ll probably try to scotch her on the way over but they won t know her route They ll be lying in wait however in full strength in home waters He s a bad psychologist added Sage as he knocked the ashes out of his pipe Who enquired Colonel Walton The Hun replied Sage as he sucked away contentedly at his pipe He s never content to go for a single issue or he d probably have got the Channel ports He s not content with concentrating on John Dene and his boat he s after the plans That s where he ll fail Smart chap John Dene For some moments the two men smoked in silence which was finally broken by Sage They ll try to get hold of John Dene unless he s very careful and hold him to ransom the price being the plans Incidentally Sage where did you get all this from enquired Walton Sage gazed at his chief through his gold rimmed spectacles About three hundred yards west of the Temple Station on the Underground Colonel Walton glanced across at his subordinate but refrained from asking further questions Have you warned Dene he enquired instead No use replied Sage with conviction Might as well warn a fly Colonel Walton nodded understandingly Still he remarked I think he ought to be told Why not have a try yourself Sage looked up swiftly from the inevitable contemplation of his finger nails For fully a minute Colonel Walton sat revolving the proposal in his mind I think I will he said later He ll treat you like a superannuated policeman was the grim retort The Skipper wants to see us at eleven said Colonel Walton looking at his watch and rising The Skipper was the name by which mister Llewellyn John was known at Department Z Names were rarely referred to and very few documents were ever exchanged Colonel Walton picked up his hat from a bookcase and followed by Sage who extracted a cap from his pocket left the room and Department Z and walked across to Downing Street As Colonel Walton and Malcolm Sage were shown into mister Llewellyn John s room the Prime Minister gave instructions that he was not to be disturbed for a quarter of an hour Was the John Dene Report what you wanted sir enquired Colonel Walton as he took the seat mister Llewellyn John indicated Excellent cried mister Llewellyn John then with a smile he added I was able to tell Sir Lyster quite a lot of things this morning The Admiralty report was not ready until late last night It was not nearly so instructive The main facts of John Dene s career had not been difficult to obtain His father had emigrated to Canada in the early eighties but possessing only the qualifications of a clerk he had achieved neither fame nor fortune He had died when John Dene was eight years old and his wife had followed him within eighteen months After a varied career John Dene had drifted to the States where as a youth he had entered a large engineering firm and was instantly singled out as an inventor in embryo Several fortunate speculations had formed the foundation of a small fortune of twenty thousand dollars with which he returned to Toronto From that point his career had been one continual progression of successes Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold until John s luck became a well known phrase in financial circles Unlike most successful business men he devoted a large portion of his time to his hobby electrical engineering and when the war broke out he sought to turn this to practical and patriotic uses And when may we expect mister Dene s new submarine over enquired Malcolm Sage casually mister Dene s new submarine mister Llewellyn John s hands dropped to his sides as he gazed at Sage in blank amazement His new submarine he repeated Yes sir What on earth do you know about it demanded mister Llewellyn John looking at Sage with a startled expression John Dene has invented a submarine proceeded the literal Sage with some novel features including a searchlight that has overcome the opacity of water The thing is lying on the saint Lawrence River just below Quebec Yesterday he called to see Sir Lyster Grayne who brought him here with Admiral Heyworth mister Llewellyn John gazed in bewilderment at Malcolm Sage his eyes shifted to Colonel Walton and then back again to Sage But he began you re watching us not the enemy Did you know of this he turned to the chief of Department Z Colonel Walton shook his head I haven t seen Sage since you telephoned yesterday until a few minutes ago he said Where how mister Llewellyn John paused It s our business to know things sir was Sage s quiet reply And yet you didn t report this to began mister Llewellyn John It saves time telling you both at once responded Sage looking at his chief with a smile Suppose you tell us how you found out suggested mister Llewellyn John a little irritably Does that matter sir Sage looked up calmly from an earnest examination of the nail of his left forefinger For some moments mister Llewellyn John gazed across at Malcolm Sage frowning heavily Sage has his own methods remarked Colonel Walton tactfully Methods cried mister Llewellyn John his brow clearing it s a good job he didn t live in the Middle Ages or else he d have been burned I m not so sure that he ought not to be burned now He turned on Sage that smile that never failed in its magical effect There are one or two links missing said Sage I want to know where and when the Destroyer will arrive and what steps you are taking in regard to John Dene All arrangements will be left in mister Dene s hands He is mister Lewellyn John paused A little self willed suggested Sage Self willed exclaimed mister Llewellyn John He is a dictator in embryo He happens also to be a patriot said Sage quietly Wait until you meet him said the Prime Minister grimly I have met him said Sage quietly I trod on his toe last night at Chu Chin Chow We had quite a pleasant little chat about it I think that is all I need trouble you with sir he concluded And we are to see the thing through interrogated Colonel Walton as mister Llewellyn John rose There won t be any No one else knows anything about it except Sir Lyster Sir Bridgman and Admiral Heyworth By the way mister Llewellyn John added our Canadian friend has an idea that our Secret Service is run by superannuated policemen in regulation boots I know said Sage as he followed his chief towards the door Good bye cried mister Llewellyn John I m sure I shall have to send you to the Tower Sage before I ve finished with you Then I ll spend the time writing the History of Department Z sir was the quiet reply The two men went out and mister Llewellyn John rang for his secretary You have rather began Colonel Walton but he stopped short Sage suddenly knocked him roughly with his elbow I have never seen the Mons Star he said Can we go round by Whitehall The Horse Guards sentries I believe wear it The two men had reached the top of the steps leading down into saint James s Park Without a moment s pause Sage turned quickly and nearly cannoned into a pretty and stylishly dressed girl who was walking close behind them He lifted his hat and apologised and he and Colonel Walton passed up Downing Street into Whitehall For the rest of the walk back to saint James s Square Sage chatted about medals Seated once more one on either side of Colonel Walton s table Sage proceeded to light his pipe Clever wasn t it he asked She s fairly new too Who was she Vera Ellerton employed as a Temporary Ministry typist Sage replied drily So that was it remarked Colonel Walton cutting the end of a cigar with great deliberation She was following us on the chance of catching any odd remarks that might be useful On the way back here two others picked us up on the relay system Do you think she knew who we were enquired Colonel Walton No just an off chance We were callers on the Skipper and might let something drop It s a regular thing picking up the callers generally when they ve got some distance away though They must have learned quite a deal about numismatics said Colonel Walton drily A constitutional government is a great obstacle to an efficient Secret Service it imposes limitations remarked Sage regretfully Colonel Walton looked across in the act of lighting his cigar There are six hundred and seventy of them at Westminster In war time we require a system of the lettre de cachet And now said Sage rising I think I ll get a couple of hours sleep I ve been pretty busy By the way he said with his hand upon the door handle I think we might get the papers of that fellow on the Bergen boat also a photograph clothing and full details of his appearance Colonel Walton nodded and Malcolm Sage took his departure II It s curious Malcolm Sage was seated at his table carefully studying several sheets of buff coloured paper fastened together in the top left hand corner with thin green cord In a tray beside him lay a number of similar documents He glanced across at a small man with a dark moustache and determined chin sitting opposite The man made a movement as if to speak then apparently thinking better of it remained silent How many false calls did you say enquired Sage Nine in five days sir was the response Malcolm Sage nodded his head several times his eyes still fixed on the papers before him One of his first acts on being appointed to Department Z was to give instructions through the proper channels that all telephone operators were to be warned to report to their supervisors anything that struck them as unusual no matter how trivial the incident might appear carefully noting the numbers of the subscribers whose messages seemed out of the ordinary This was quite apart from the special staff detailed to tap conversations particularly call box conversations throughout the Kingdom A bright young operator at the Streatham Exchange coveting the reward of five pounds offered for any really useful information had called attention to the curious fact that mister Montagu Naylor of The Cedars Apthorpe Road was constantly receiving wrong calls This operator s report had been considered of sufficient importance to send to Department Z Instructions had been given for a complete record to be kept of all mister Montagu Naylor s calls in coming and out going The first thing that struck Sage as significant was that all these false calls were made from public call boxes He gave instructions that at the Streatham Exchange they were to enquire of the exchanges from which the calls had come if any complaint had been made by those getting wrong numbers The result showed that quite a number of people seemed content to pay threepence to be told that they were on to the wrong subscriber What do you make of it Thompson Malcolm Sage looked up in that sudden way of his which many found so disconcerting Thompson shook his head I ve had enquiries made at all the places given and they seem quite all right sir was his reply It s funny he added after a pause It began with short streets and small numbers and then gradually took in the larger thoroughfares with bigger numbers The calls have always come through in the same way queried Malcolm Sage First the number and then the street and no mention of the exchange Yes sir was the response It s a bit of a puzzle he added Malcolm Sage nodded For some minutes they sat in silence Sage staring with expressionless face at the papers before him Suddenly with a swift movement he pushed them over towards Thompson Get out a list of the whole range of numbers immediately and bring it to me as soon as you can Tell them to get me through to Smart at the Streatham Exchange Very good sir and the man took his departure A minute later the telephone bell rang Malcolm Sage took up the receiver That you Smart he enquired re Z eighteen in future transcribe figures in words exactly as spoken thus double one three one hundred and thirteen or one one three as the case may be He jammed the receiver back again on to the rest and proceeded to gaze fixedly at the finger nails of his left hand A quarter of an hour later Special Service Officer Thompson entered with a long list of figures which he handed to Malcolm Sage You ve hit it Thompson said Sage glancing swiftly down the list Have I sir said Thompson not quite sure what it was he was supposed to have hit They are At that moment the telephone bell rang Malcolm Sage put the receiver to his ear Yes Malcolm Sage speaking he said There was a pause Yes Another pause Good continue to record in that manner and once more he replaced the receiver Vanity Thompson is at the root of all error Yes sir said Thompson dutifully Those figures continued Sage are times not numbers With a quick indrawing of breath which with Thompson always indicated excitement he reached across for the list his eyes glinting That was Smart on the telephone another call just come through three twenty Oxford Street not three two o but three twenty Make a note of it Thompson produced a note book and hastily scribbled a memorandum At three twenty this afternoon you will probably find mister Montagu Naylor meeting somebody in Oxford Street Have both followed If by chance they don t turn up have someone there at three twenty every afternoon and morning for a week it may be the second third fourth or fifth day after the call for all we know morning or evening It s the old story Thompson said Sage who never lost a chance of pointing the moral over confidence Here s a fellow who has worked out a really original means of communication Instead of running it for a few months and then dropping it he carries on until someone tumbles to his game Yes sir said Thompson respectfully It was an understood thing at Department Z that these little homilies should be listened to with deference It s like a dog hiding a bone in a hat box continued Sage He s so pleased with himself that he imagines no one else can attain to such mental brilliancy He makes no allowance for the chapter of accidents That is so sir We mustn t get like that in Department Z Thompson Thompson shook his head Time after time Sage had impressed upon the staff of Department Z that mentally they must be elastic It s only a fool who is blinded by his own vapour he had said He had pointed out the folly of endeavouring to fit a fact by an hypothesis That s all and Malcolm Sage became absorbed in the paper before him As he closed the door behind him Thompson winked gravely at a print upon the wall of the corridor opposite He was wondering how it was possible for one man to watch the whole of Oxford Street for a week CHAPTER IV GINGERING UP THE ADMIRALTY Boss in mister Blair started violently he had not heard John Dene enter his room Er yes mister Dene he replied I ll tell him He half rose but before he could complete the movement John Dene had opened the door communicating with Sir Lyster s private room mister Blair sank back in his chair He was a man who assimilated innovation with difficulty All his life he had been cradled in the lap of as it was in the beginning He was a vade mecum on procedure and the courtesies of life which made him extremely valuable to Sir Lyster He was a gentle zephyr whereas John Dene was something between a sudden draught and a cyclone mister Blair fixed his rather prominent blue eyes on the door that had closed behind John Dene He disliked colonials They always said what they meant and went directly for what they wanted all of which was in opposition to his standard of good breeding As he continued to gaze at the door it suddenly opened and John Dene s head appeared Say he cried if that yellow headed girl comes send her right in and the door closed with a bang Inwardly mister Blair gasped it was not customary for yellow haired girls to be sent in to see the First Lord The difference between this country and Can da remarked John Dene as he planted upon Sir Lyster s table a large shapeless looking parcel from which he proceeded to remove the wrapping is that here every one wants to know who your father was but in Can da they ask what can you do I got that pound of tea he added inconsequently The pound of tea repeated Sir Lyster uncomprehendingly as he watched John Dene endeavouring to extract a packet from his pocket with one hand and undo the string of the parcel with the other Yes for that yellow headed girl I ran into her in the corridor and smashed her teapot yesterday I promised I d get her some more tea Here it is and John Dene laid the package on the First Lord s table If she comes after I m gone you might give it to her I told her to run in here and fetch it This is the pot he added still struggling with the wrappings Presently he disinterred from a mass of paper wound round it in every conceivable way a large white pink and gold teapot Sir Lyster gazed from the teapot terrifying in the crudeness of its shape and design to John Dene and back again to the teapot Like it asked John Dene as he looked admiringly at his purchase Ought to cheer those girls up some Sir Lyster continued to gaze at the teapot as if fascinated I told her to run in here and fetch it continued John Dene indicating the packet of tea She doesn t know about the pot he added with self satisfaction In here repeated Sir Lyster unwilling to believe his ears Sure replied John Dene his eyes still fixed admiringly upon the teapot at eleven o clock It s that now he added looking at his watch As he did so mister Blair entered and closed the door behind him He was obviously embarrassed A young person he began Send her right in cried John Dene mister Blair glanced uncertainly from Sir Lyster to John Dene then back again to his chief Seeing no contradiction in his eye he turned and held open the door to admit Dorothy West Ah here you are cried John Dene rising and indicating that the girl should occupy his chair There s your pound of tea pointing to the package lying before Sir Lyster and there s a new teapot for you he added indicating that object which seemed to flaunt its pink and white and gold as if determined to brazen things out The girl looked at the teapot at Sir Lyster and on to John Dene and back to the teapot Then she laughed She had pretty teeth John Dene decided It s very kind of you she said but there wasn t a pound of tea in the teapot you broke yesterday and and Never mind said John Dene you can keep the rest Now see here I want someone to take down my letters You re a stenographer he asked The girl nodded her head Speeds enquired John Dene A hundred and twenty was the response Typing Sixty five words You ll do said John Dene with decision In future you ll do my work only Nine o clock every morning The girl looked enquiringly at Sir Lyster who coughed slightly We will take up your references Miss er Oh cut it out said John Dene impatiently I don t want references But replied Sir Lyster this is work of a confidential nature See here cried John Dene I started life selling newspapers in T ronto I never had a reference I never gave a reference and I never asked a reference and the man who can get ahead of John Dene had better stay up all night for fear of missing the buzzer in the morning That girl s straight else she wouldn t be asked to do my letters he added Now don t you wait he said to Dorothy seeing she was embarrassed at his remark nine o clock to morrow morning I think it will be necessary to take up references began Sir Lyster as John Dene closed the door on Dorothy John Dene span round on his heel I run my business on Canadian lines not on British he cried If you re always going to be around telling me what to do then I ll see this country to hell before they get my Destroyer The man who deals with John Dene does so on his terms and with that he left the room closing the door with a bang behind him For a moment he stood gazing down at mister Blair Can you tell me he asked slowly why the British Empire has not gone to blazes long ago mister Blair gazed at him mild surprise in his prominent eyes I am afraid I don t I cannot he began Neither can I said John Dene You re all just about as cute as dead weasels John Dene walked along the corridor and down the staircase in high dudgeon Ha mister Dene what s happened enquired Sir Bridgman who was mounting the stairs as John Dene descended I ve been wondering how it is the British Empire has hung together as long as it has was the response What have we been doing now enquired Sir Bridgman It s my belief remarked John Dene that in this country you wouldn t engage a janitor without his great grandmother s birth certificate I m afraid we are rather a prejudiced nation said Sir Bridgman genially I don t care a cousin Mary what you are responded John Dene so long as you don t come up against me I m out to win this war it doesn t matter to me a red cent who s got the most grandmothers and the sooner you tell the First Lord and that prize seal of his the better we shall get on and John Dene abruptly continued on his way Sir Bridgman smiled as he slowly ascended the stairs I suppose he murmured we are in the process of being gingered up The rest of the day John Dene devoted to sight seeing and wandering about the streets keenly interested in and critical of all he saw The next morning he was at the Admiralty a few minutes to nine and was conducted by an attendant to the room that had been assigned to him He gave a swift glance round and apparently satisfied that it would suit his purpose seated himself at the large pedestal table and took out his watch As he did so he noticed an envelope addressed to him lying on the table Picking it up he tore off the end extracted and read the note Just as he had finished there came a tap at the door Come he called out The door opened and Dorothy West entered looking very pretty and business like with a note book and pencil in her hand Good morning she said Mornin Miss West he replied gazing at her apparently without seeing her He was obviously thinking of something else She seated herself beside his table and looked up awaiting his signal to begin the day s work There are some things in this country that get my goat he remarked John Dene threw down the letter he was reading twirled the cigar between his lips and snorted his impatience as he jumped from his chair and proceeded to stride up and down the room There are quite a lot that get mine she remarked demurely as she glanced up from her note book A lot that get yours he repeated coming to a standstill and looking down at her Things that get my goat There was the slightest possible pause between the my and the goat Then John Dene smiled In Toronto it was said that when John Dene smiled securities could always be trusted to mount at least a point Well listen to this He picked up the letter again and read DEAR mister DENE Sir Lyster desires me to write and express it as his most urgent wish that you will pay special regard to your personal safety He fears that you may be inclined to treat the matter too lightly hence this letter Yours truly REGINALD BLAIR If that chap hadn t such a dandy set of grandmothers and first cousins he d be picking up cigarette stubs instead of wasting his time telling me what I knew a year ago But he s only carrying out Sir Lyster s instructions suggested Dorothy There s something in that he admitted grudgingly but if they re going to be always running around warning me of danger I know all about He broke off Why he continued a moment later I was shot at on the steamer nearly hustled into the docks at Liverpool set on by toughs in Manchester and followed around as if I was a bell mule I tell you it gets my goat This country wants gingering up John Dene continued his pacing of the room Couldn t you wear a red beard and blue glasses and What s that John Dene span round and fixed his eyes on the girl I mean disguise yourself said Dorothy dropping her eyes beneath his gaze Why The interrogation was rapped out in such a tone as to cause the girl to shrink back slightly They wouldn t know and then it wouldn t she hesitated Wouldn t what he demanded Get your goat said Dorothy after a moment s hesitation He continued to gaze intently at Dorothy who was absorbed in a blank page of her note book Here take this down and he proceeded to dictate MY DEAR mister BLAIR I am in receipt of yours of to day s date Will you tell Sir Lyster that I have bought a machine gun a blue beard false eyebrows and Miss West and I are going to do bayonet drill every morning with a pillow With kind regards Yours sincerely For a few moments Dorothy sat regarding her book with knitted brows I don t think I should send that if I were you mister Dene she said at length Why not he demanded unaccustomed to having his orders questioned It sounds rather flippant doesn t it John Dene smiled grimly and as he made no further comment Dorothy struck out the letter from her note book All through the morning John Dene threw off letters The way in which he did his dictating reminded Dorothy of a retriever shaking the water from its coat after a swim He hurled short sharp sentences at her as if anxious to be rid of them Sometimes he would sit hunched up at his table at others he would spring up and proceed feverishly to pace about the room As she filled page after page of her note book Dorothy wondered when she would have an opportunity of transcribing her notes Hour after hour John Dene dictated in short bursts interspersed with varying pauses during which he seemed to be deep in thought Once Sir Bridgman looked in and Dorothy had a space in which to breathe but with the departure of the First Sea Lord the torrent jerked forth afresh At two o clock Dorothy felt that she must either scream or faint Her right hand seemed as if it would drop off At last she suggested that even Admiralty typists required lunch In a flash John Dene seemed to change into a human being solicitous and self reproachful Too bad he said as he pulled out his watch Why it s a quarter after two You must be all used up I m sorry And aren t you hungry as well mister Dene she asked as she closed her note book and rose Hungry he repeated as if she had asked him a surprising question I ve no use for food when I m hustling Where do you go for lunch I go to a tea shop said Dorothy after a moment s hesitation And what do you eat demanded John Dene with the air of a cross examining counsel Oh all sorts of things she laughed buns and eggs and and That s no good was the uncompromising rejoinder They re really quite nourishing she said with a smile At the Admiralty it was not customary for the chiefs to enquire what the typists ate You d better come with me and have a good meal he said bluntly reaching for his hat Dorothy flushed The implication was too obvious to be overlooked Drawing herself up slightly and with her head a little thrown back she declined I m afraid I have an engagement she said coldly John Dene looked up puzzled to account for her sudden hauteur He watched her leave the room and then throwing down his hat reseated himself at his table and once more became absorbed in his work Dorothy went to the Admiralty staff restaurant and spent a week s lunch allowance upon her meal It seemed to help her to regain her self respect When she returned to John Dene s room some forty minutes later determined to get some of her notes typed before he returned she found him still sitting at his table As she entered he took out his watch looked at it and then up at her Dorothy crimsoned as if discovered in some illicit act She was angry with herself for her weakness and with John Dene why she could not have said You ve been hustling some he remarked as he returned the watch to his pocket We ve both been quick said Dorothy curious to know if John Dene had been to lunch Oh I stayed right here he said still gazing up at her Dorothy felt rebuked He had evidently felt snubbed she told herself and it was her fault that he had remained at work See here said John Dene I can t breathe in this place It s all gold braid and brass buttons I m going to rent my own offices and have lunch sent in and we ll get some work done You can get a rest or a walk about three I don t like breaking off in the midst of things he added a little lamely Dorothy thought Very well mister Dene she said as she resumed her seat Do you mind Say right out if you d hate it There was a suspicion of anxiety in his tone I m here to do whatever you wish she said with dignity With a sudden movement John Dene sprang up and proceeded to pace up and down the room From time to time he glanced at Dorothy who sat pencil and note book ready for the flood of staccatoed sentences that usually accompanied these pacings to and fro At length he came to a standstill in the middle of the room planted his feet wide apart as if to steady the resolution to which he had apparently come Say what s all this worth to you he blurted out Dorothy looked up in surprise not grasping his meaning Worth to me she queried her head on one side the tip of her pencil resting on her lower lip Yes what do they pay you Oh I see Thirty five shillings a week and if I become a permanent a pension when I m too old to enjoy it she laughed That is if the Hun hasn t taken us over by then That ll be about nine dollars a week mumbled John Dene twisting his cigar round between his lips Well you re worth twenty dollars a week to me so I ll make up the rest I m quite satisfied thank you she said drawing herself up slightly Well I m not he blurted out You re going to work well for me and you re going to be well paid I m afraid I cannot accept it she said firmly although it s very kind of you she added with a smile He regarded her in surprise It was something new to him to find anyone refusing an increase in salary His cigar twirled round with remarkable rapidity I suppose I m getting his goat thought Dorothy as she watched him from beneath lowered lashes Why won t you take it he demanded I m afraid I cannot accept presents she said with what she thought a disarming smile Oh shucks John Dene was annoyed If the Admiralty thought I was worth more than thirty five shillings a week they would pay me more Well I m not going to have anyone around that doesn t get a living wage he announced explosively Does that mean that I had better go she inquired calmly No it doesn t You just stay right here till I get back was the reply and he opened the door and disappeared leaving Dorothy with the conviction that someone was to suffer because in John Dene s opinion she was inadequately paid As she waited for John Dene s return she could not keep her thoughts from what an extra forty five shillings a week would mean to her She could increase the number and quality of the little surprises she took home with her to the mother in whose life she bulked so largely Peaches could be bought without the damning prefix tinned salmon without the discouraging modification Canadian eggs that had not long since forgotten what hen had laid them and when She could take her more often to a theatre or for a run in a taxi when she was tired In short a hundred and seventeen pounds a year would buy quite a lot of rose leaves with which to colour her mother s life Whilst Dorothy was building castles in Spain upon a foundation of eleven dollars a week John Dene walked briskly along the corridor leading to Sir Lyster s room mister Blair was seated at his desk reading with calm deliberation and self evident satisfaction a letter he had just written for Sir Lyster to one of his constituents He had devoted much time and thought to the composition as it was for publication and he was determined that no one should find in it flaw or ambiguity The morning had been one of flawless serenity and he was looking forward to a pleasant lunch with some friends at the Berkeley Here what the hell do you mean by giving that girl only nine dollars a week Suddenly the idyllic peaceful ness of his mood was shattered into a thousand fragments John Dene had burst into the room with the force of a cyclone and stood before him like an accusing fury Nine dollars a week What girl he stuttered looking up weakly into John Dene s angry eyes I I Miss West was the retort She s getting nine dollars a week less than I pay an office boy in T ronto But I it s nothing to do with me began mister Blair miserably He had become mortally afraid of John Dene and prayed for the time to come when the Hun submarine menace would be ended and John Dene could return to Toronto where no doubt he was understood and appreciated Well it ought to be snapped John Dene just as Sir Bridgman North came out of Sir Lyster s room Good morning mister Dene he cried genially What are you doing to poor Blair John Dene explained his grievance I d pay the difference myself just to make you all feel a bit small only she won t take it from me Well I think I can promise that the matter shall be put right and we ll make Blair take her out to lunch by way of apology shall we he laughed I d like to see him ask her said John Dene grimly That girl s a high stepper sir Nine dollars a week he grumbled as he left the room to the manifest relief of mister Blair You re being gingered up Blair said Sir Bridgman in fact we re all being gingered up It s a bit surprising at first but it s a great game played slow You ll get to like it in time and it s all for the good of the British Empire mister Blair smiled weakly as Sir Bridgman left the room but in his heart he wished it were possible to have a sentinel outside his door with strict injunctions to bayonet John Dene without hesitation should he seek admittance I ve fixed it announced John Dene as he burst in upon Dorothy s day dream You ll get twenty dollars in future She looked up quickly You re very kind mister Dene she said but is it is it she hesitated It s a square deal I told them you wouldn t take it from me and that I wasn t going to have my secretary paid less than an office boy in T ronto I gingered em up some Nine dollars a week for you The tone in which the last sentence was uttered brought a slight flush to Dorothy s cheeks Now you can get on he announced picking up his hat I m going to find offices and he went out like a gust of wind Dorothy typed steadily on Of one thing she had become convinced that the position of secretary to John Dene of Toronto was not going to prove a rest billet At a little after four Marjorie Rogers knocked at the door and recognising Dorothy s Come in entered stealthily as if expecting someone to jump out at her Where s the bear Wessie she enquired keeping a weather eye on the door in case John Dene should return Gone out to buy bear biscuits laughed Dorothy leaning back in her chair to get the kink out of her spine Do you think he ll marry you enquired the little brunette romantically as she perched herself upon John Dene s table and swung a pretty leg They don t usually you know He ll probably kill you if he catches you said Dorothy Oh if he comes I m here to ask if you would like some tea was the airy reply You angel cried Dorothy I should love it Has he tried to kiss you yet demanded the girl looking at Dorothy searchingly Don t be ridiculous cried Dorothy conscious that she was flushing I see he has she said regarding Dorothy judicially and nodding her head wisely Dorothy re started typing It was absurd she decided to endeavour to argue with this worldly child of Whitehall They re all the same continued Marjorie lifting her skirt slightly and gazing with obvious approval at the symmetry of her leg You didn t let him I hope continued the girl You see it makes it bad for others Then a moment later she added It should be chocs before kisses and they ve got to learn the ropes And you you little imp have got to learn morals Dorothy laughed in spite of herself at the quaint air of wisdom with which this girl of eighteen settled the ethics of Whitehall What s the use of morals cried the girl I mean morals that get in the way of your having a good time Of course I wouldn t She paused Never mind what you wouldn t do Brynhilda the Bold said Dorothy but concentrate on the woulds and bring me the tea you promised The girl slipped off the table and darted across the room returning a few minutes later with a cup of tea and a few biscuits I can t stop she panted Old Goggles has been giving me the bird and with that she was gone It was a quarter to seven before John Dene returned Without a word he threw his hat on the bookcase and seated himself at his table For the next quarter of an hour he was absorbed in reading the lists and letters Dorothy had typed At seven o clock Dorothy placed the last list on the table before him Is there anything more mister Dene she enquired She was conscious of feeling inexpressibly weary Yes said John Dene without looking up You re coming out to have some dinner I m afraid I can t thank you she said My mother is waiting Oh shucks he cried looking up quickly But it isn t she said wearily Isn t what demanded John Dene Shucks she said then seeing the absurdity of the thing she laughed We ll send your mother an express message or a wire You look dead beat He smiled and Dorothy capitulated It would be nice she told herself not to have to go all the way to Chiswick before having anything to eat But where are you taking me mister Dene enquired Dorothy as they turned from Waterloo Place into Pall Mall To the Ritzton But I m I m she stopped dead What s wrong he demanded looking at her in surprise I I can t go there she stammered I m not dressed for She broke off lamely That ll be all right he said It s my hotel It may be your hotel said Dorothy resuming the walk but I don t care to go there in a blouse and a skirt to be stared at Who ll stare at you Not at me at my clothes she corrected Then we ll go to the grill room he replied with inspiration That might be She hesitated You re not going home until you have something to eat he announced with determination You look all used up he added Dorothy submitted to the inevitable conscious of a feeling of content at having someone to decide things for her Suddenly she remembered Marjorie Rogers remarks What was she doing If any of the girls saw her they would She had done the usual thing sent a telegram to her mother to say she should be late and was dining out with her chief on the first day Oh it was horrible Would you would you she turned to John Dene appealingly would you mind if I went home she faltered I m not feeling very well She gulped out the last words conscious of the lie Why sure he said solicitously I m sorry To her infinite relief he hailed a taxi I ll come along and see you safe he announced in a matter of fact tone Oh please no she cried I d much sooner She broke off distressed Without a word he handed her into the taxi Where am I to tell him he enquired Douglas Mansions Chiswick please gasped Dorothy and she sank back in the taxi with a feeling that she had behaved very ridiculously CHAPTER V JOHN DENE LEAVES WHITEHALL I Come shouted John Dene irritably The door opened and mister Blair entered John Dene swung round from his table and glared at him angrily I tried to telephone began mister Blair Well you can t snapped John Dene receiver s off Your boys have been playing dido all morning on my phone I m sorry if That don t help any Why don t you stop em Seem to think I m a sort of enquiry bureau Dorothy bent low over her notes to hide the smile she could not restrain at the sight of the obvious wretchedness of mister Blair Sir Lyster would like you to step round Well I won t tell him that was the irascible reply He wants you to meet Sir Harold Winn the chief naval constructor explained mister Blair Tell him to go to blazes and take his constructions with him Now vamoose mister Blair hesitated glanced at John Dene seemed about to speak then evidently thinking better of it withdrew closing the door noiselessly behind him As John Dene swung round once more to his table he caught Dorothy s eye She smiled With a little grumble in his throat John Dene became absorbed in his papers Dorothy decided that he was a little ashamed of his outburst All the day he had shown marked irritability under the constant interruptions to which he had been subjected They worked on steadily for a quarter of an hour Presently there was a gentle tap at the door With one bound John Dene was out of his chair and across the room A second later he threw open the door ready to annihilate whoever might be there from the First Lord downwards Oo er Marjorie Rogers stood there her pretty eyes dilated with fear as John Dene glared at her His set look relaxed at the sight of the girl Is is Miss West here she enquired timidly Sure come right in he said Dorothy was surprised at the change produced by the appearance of Marjorie Rogers The girl came a few steps into the room then seeing Dorothy tripped over to her and turning to John Dene said still a little nervously I I came to ask Miss West if she would like some tea She smiled up at John Dene a picture of guileless innocence Sorry if I scared you he said awkwardly Oh you didn t frighten me she said regaining confidence at the sight of John Dene s embarrassment Perhaps mister Dene would like a cup of tea too Rojjie suggested Dorothy Oh would you cried the girl eagerly Why sure said John Dene and he smiled for the first time that day Dorothy mentally noted In a flash Marjorie disappeared I m I m sorry said John Dene to Dorothy I didn t know she was a friend of yours She s in the room I used to be in and she s very sweet and brings me tea He nodded comprehendingly They do a lot of that here don t they A lot of what asked Dorothy Drinking tea We only have it in the afternoon and At that moment Marjorie entered with a small tray containing three cups of tea and a plate of biscuits These she placed on John Dene s table Dorothy gasped at the sight of the three cups wondering what John Dene would think I brought mine in to have with you said Marjorie with perfect self possession as she handed Dorothy her cup then turning to John Dene she smiled He nodded as if she had done a most ordinary thing Perching herself upon the corner of John Dene s table Marjorie chatted brightly having apparently quite overcome her fears You know mister Dene she said we re all dreadfully intrigued about you John Dene looked at her with a puzzled expression All the other girls are terribly afraid of you she continued I m not Of me He looked at her in surprise as if he regarded himself as the last person in the world to inspire fear They say you glare at them She smiled a wicked little smile that she called the rouser As John Dene did not reply Marjorie continued They call you the bear Rojjie gasped Dorothy in horror The bear repeated John Dene Why Oh but I am going to tell them you re not said Marjorie nibbling at a biscuit and looking across at John Dene appraisingly I think you re really rather nice John Dene glanced across at Dorothy as if unable quite to classify the girl before him Of course they don t know that you can smile like that added Marjorie John Dene was about to make some remark when there came another knock Come he cried and a moment later the door opened and Sir Lyster entered followed by a tall sedate looking man with a bulging forehead and ragged moustache For a moment the two regarded the scene Sir Lyster having recourse to his monocle Marjorie slipped down from the table all her self possession deserting her at the sight of Sir Lyster s disapproving gaze Dorothy bent over her notes conscious of her burning cheeks whilst John Dene rose with entire unconcern I m afraid we ve interrupted you mister Dene said Sir Lyster It s the one thing they do well in this shack was John Dene s uncompromising retort Sir Lyster gazed a little anxiously at his companion Taking advantage of the diversion Marjorie slipped out and Dorothy deciding that she would not be wanted for at least a few minutes followed her I want to introduce you to Sir Harold Winn said Sir Lyster Pleased to meet you said John Dene shaking Sir Harold vigorously by the hand Take a seat John Dene and the Chief Naval Constructor were soon deep in the intricacies of submarine construction When at length Sir Harold rose to go there was something like cordiality in John Dene s voice as he bade him good bye Sir Harold had been able to meet him on common ground and show an intelligent and comprehensive interest in his work Immediately they had gone Dorothy who had been waiting in the corridor slipped back to her chair first removing the tea tray from John Dene s table Soon she was busily taking down notes While she was thus occupied Sir Lyster was narrating to Sir Bridgman North the latest John Dene outrage first his open flouting of the Chief Naval Constructor by refusing to see him secondly the interrupted tea and the girl perched upon John Dene s table Sir Bridgman laughed loudly as much at the expression on Sir Lyster s face as at the occurrence itself Such incidents said Sir Lyster are I think very undesirable It looks as if John Dene were a dark horse suggested Sir Bridgman Was the other girl pretty I really didn t notice said Sir Lyster stiffly I thought perhaps you might he hesitated for a fraction of a second just drop him a hint he added And be gingered up as high as our own aerials laughed Sir Bridgman No my dear Grayne he added I find gingering up intensely interesting in its application to others Get Blair to do it But I m afraid it may create a scandal said Sir Lyster Oh another little scandal won t do us any harm laughed Sir Bridgman Now I must be off By the way he said as he reached the door what time did this little tea fight take place It was about four o clock when Winn and I Right said Sir Bridgman I ll drop in about that time to morrow and see what s doing and the door closed behind him A moment later he put his head round the door One of these days you ll be finding Blair with a girl on each knee he laughed and with that he was gone John Dene s reason for wishing to have offices somewhere away from the Admiralty had been twofold For one thing he did not desire those he knew were closely watching should see him in close association with Whitehall for another he felt that he could breathe more freely away from gold braid and those long dreary corridors which seemed so out of keeping with the headquarters of a Navy at war He now determined to get out at once The constant interruptions to which he found himself subjected rendered concentration impossible He therefore informed Dorothy that at nine o clock next morning they would start work in the new offices he had taken in Waterloo Place They consisted of two rooms one leading off the other The larger room John Dene decided to use himself the smaller he handed over to Dorothy With a celerity that had rather surprised John Dene the telephone had been connected and a private wire run through to the Admiralty The thing about a Britisher he remarked to Dorothy is that he can hustle but won t She allowed the remark to pass unchallenged Now things will begin to hum he said as he settled himself down to his table Throwing aside his coat he set to work There was little over three weeks in which to get everything organised and planned Long lists of stores for the Destroyer had to be prepared the details of the structural alterations to the Toronto the name given to the mother ship that was to act as tender to the Destroyer instructions to the Canadian crew that was coming over and a thousand and one other things that kept them busily occupied He arranged to have luncheon sent in from the Ritzton After the first day the ordering of these meals was delegated to Dorothy John Dene s ideas on the subject of food proved original resulting in the ordering of about five times as much as necessary Dorothy came to look forward to these dainty meals which she could order with unstinted hand and she liked the tete a tete half hours during their consumption Then John Dene would unbend and tell her of Canada about his life there and in America how he had planned and built the Destroyer He seemed to take it for granted that she could be trusted to keep her own counsel The night after John Dene s entry into his new offices the place was burgled In the morning when he arrived he found papers tossed about in reckless disorder The fourth set of plans of German U boats had disappeared With grim humour he drew a fifth set from his pocket and placed it in the safe which he did not keep locked as it contained nothing of importance John Dene s method was to burn every paper or duplicate that was no longer required and to have sent over to the Admiralty each day before five o clock such documents as were of importance For the first time in her life Dorothy felt she was doing something of national importance John Dene trusted her and took her patriotism as a matter of course Sometimes he would enquire if she were tired and on hearing that she was not he would nod his approval You re some worker he once remarked casually whereat Dorothy had flushed with pleasure Later she remembered that this was the first word of praise she had heard him bestow on anything or anybody British At first a buttons had called from the Ritzton each morning and afternoon for orders but after the second day he had been superseded by a waiter One morning after the order had been given John Dene enquired of Dorothy if she had ever tasted lobster a l Americaine Typists don t eat lobster a l Americaine in England mister Dene she had replied It s too expensive Whereupon he had told her to ring up the Ritzton and order lobster a l Americaine for lunch in place of the order already given Ten minutes later a ring came through from the hotel to the effect that there must be some mistake as there was no lunch on order for mister John Dene Dorothy protested that they had been supplied with lunch each day for the last four days The management deprecatingly suggested that there had been a mistake as after the first two days the order had been cancelled Dorothy repeated the information to John Dene who then took the receiver If you didn t supply lunch yesterday who the blazes did he demanded and a suave voice answered that it did not know who it was that had that honour but certainly it was not the Ritzton John Dene banged back the receiver impatiently We ll wait and see what happens at twelve o clock he exclaimed as he turned once more to the papers on his table Somebody s feeding us he muttered Perhaps it s the ravens murmured Dorothy to herself At twelve o clock a waiter entered with a tray At the sound of his knock John Dene revolved round in his chair Here where do you come from he demanded glaring as if he suspected the man of being of German parentage The man started violently and nearly dropped the tray I obey orders he stammered Yes but whose orders For a moment the man hesitated Do you come from the Ritzton demanded John Dene aggressively I obey orders repeated the man John Dene looked from the tray to Dorothy and then to the man but said nothing contenting himself with waving the man out with an impatient motion of his hand After the meal he picked up his hat lighted a cigar and told Dorothy he would be back in a quarter of an hour Five minutes later he burst in upon mister Blair Here what the hell s all this about my meals John Dene seemed to take a delight in descending upon Sir Lyster s secretary mister Blair turned towards him with that expression he seemed to keep expressly for John Dene Your meals he stammered Yes replied John Dene blowing volumes of acrid smoke towards the sensitive nostrils of mister Blair Why was my order to the Ritzton cancelled That sort of thing rattles me I m afraid that I know nothing of this said mister Blair but I will enquire Well I d like somebody to put me wise as to why he interferes with my affairs and John Dene stamped out of the room and back to Waterloo Place II Shucks cried John Dene irritably You make me tired I doubt if you appreciate the seriousness of the situation was Colonel Walton s quiet retort I appreciate the seriousness of a situation that turns my phone into a sort of elevator bell and makes my office like a free drink saloon at an election Colonel Walton smiled indulgently Dorothy kept her eyes upon her note book You get your notion about spies from ten cent thrillers continued John Dene scornfully Don t you worry about me If there s a hungry dog I believe in feeding it he added enigmatically I might as well be a lost baggage office Every mutt that has ten minutes to waste seems to blow in on me You re the tenth this a m At that rate you will soon have exhausted all the Government Departments said Colonel Walton with a smile I doubt if any will venture a second visit he added quietly John Dene glanced across at him quickly Say I didn t mean to make you mad he said in a conciliatory tone but all this rattles me I can t get along with things while they re playing rags on my phone It makes me madder n a wet hen I quite understand mister Dene said Colonel Walton with that imperturbable good humour that was the envy of his friends You are rather valuable to us you see and if we err on the side of over caution He paused Sure cried John Dene thawing under the influence of Colonel Walton s personality then after a pause he added See here your boys seem to have a notion that I m particular green goods You just let one of em try and corral me one of these nights and when you ve explained things to the widow you can just blow in here and tell me how she took it It s the insidious rather than the overt act began Colonel Walton The what John Dene looked at him with a puzzled expression Instead of replying Colonel Walton drew from his right hand pocket something in a paper bag such as is used by confectioners This he placed upon the table He then extracted from his other pocket a small package rolled in newspaper which he laid beside the paper bag John Dene stared at him as if not quite sure of his sanity Perhaps you will open those packets With his eyes still on his visitor John Dene picked up the paper bag and turning it upside down shook out upon the table a brown and white guinea pig dead Dorothy drew back with a little cry This some of your funny work demanded John Dene angrily There s still the other parcel said Colonel Walton his eyes upon the small roll done up in newspaper Very gingerly John Dene unrolled the paper Dorothy watching from a safe distance with wide eyed curiosity Gee he muttered as a large dead grey rat lay exposed its upper lip drawn back from his teeth giving it a snarling appearance He looked interrogatingly at Colonel Walton There but for the grace of God lies John Dene of Toronto he remarked quietly nodding in the direction of the two rodents Here what the hell began John Dene then catching sight of Dorothy he stopped suddenly Two days ago you ordered for lunch ris de veau and apple tart among other things The rat is the victim of the one the guinea pig of the other Dorothy gave a little cry of horror John Dene looked across at her quickly then back to Colonel Walton You mean he began That a certain Department has assumed the responsibility of catering for a distinguished visitor was the quiet reply It is but one of the pleasant obligations of empire John Dene sat gazing at the dead animals as if fascinated With distended eyes and slightly parted lips Dorothy looked from the table to Colonel Walton and then back to the table again as if unable to comprehend the full significance of what was taking place I would suggest said Colonel Walton that you never take food regularly at any one hotel or restaurant Avoid being out late at night particularly raid nights Raid nights You might be knocked on the head and removed as a casualty John Dene nodded Dorothy gasped Never take food or drink of any sort in your room at the hotel and don t travel on the Tube or Underground at least never stand on the edge of the platform and don t use taxis And what about a nurse demanded John Dene If you observe these points I scarcely think one would be necessary was the quiet rejoinder It would also be advisable continued Colonel Walton for Miss West to be particularly careful about making chance acquaintances Dorothy drew herself up stiffly During the last few days continued Colonel Walton a number of attempts have been made by women as well as men How did you know she cried in surprise We have sources of information smiled Colonel Walton For instance the day before yesterday at lunch a pleasant spoken old lady asked you to go with her to the theatre one Saturday afternoon Dorothy gasped You very rightly declined A few days ago a man ran after you just as you had left the Tube train at Piccadilly Circus saying that you had left your umbrella How funny that you should know cried Dorothy Such a number of people have spoken to me lately First it was men and now it s always women Make no acquaintances at all Miss West said Colonel Walton I ll remember she said nodding her head with decision Well mister Dene I fear I mustn t take up any more of your time said Colonel Walton rising with that air of indolence which with him invariably meant that something important was coming If you will not allow us to be responsible for your own safety we must at least provide for that of Government servants What s that We should not like anything to happen to Miss West To Colonel Walton s Good day John Dene made no response he seemed unaware that he had left the room Gee he muttered at length then swinging round to Dorothy with a suddenness that caused her to start You had better vamoose he cried Vam she began How do I do it Quit clear out of here He sprang from his chair and proceeded to pace up and down the room Does that mean that I m discharged she enquired smiling You heard what he said They re up to their funny work They missed us this time and got the rat and guinea pig They re always at it I don t make a fuss but I know There ll be a bomb in my bed one of these nights You d better call a halt right here Shall we get on with the letters mister Dene said Dorothy quietly Father was a soldier For a moment he looked at her with his keen penetrating eyes then swinging round to his table caught sight of the two dead rodents Here what the blazes does he want to leave these things here for he cried irritably and seizing a ruler he swept them into the waste paper basket For the rest of the day Dorothy was conscious that John Dene s heart was not in his work Several times when happening to look up unexpectedly she found his eyes on her and there was in them an anxiety too obvious to be dissimulated John Dene was clearly worried It s an extraordinary thing Sage remarked later that afternoon to Colonel Walton that apparently no one has ever thought of encouraging a taste for apple tart in guinea pigs CHAPTER VI mister MONTAGU NAYLOR OF STREATHAM Whilst John Dene was preparing interminable lists for the Victualling and Stores Departments of the Admiralty Department Z was making discreet and searching enquiries regarding mister Montagu Naylor of Streatham Among other things it discovered that he was essentially English The atrocities in Belgium and Northern France rendered him almost speechless with indignation Wherever he went and to whomsoever he met he proclaimed the German an enemy to civilisation It was his one topic of conversation and in time his friends and acquaintance came to regard the word Hun as a danger signal mister Naylor had arrived at Streatham towards the end of nineteen oh nine coming from no one knew whither but according to his own account from Norwich He was of independent means without encumbrances beyond a wife a deaf servant registered as a Swiss and a particularly fierce dispositioned chow an animal that caused marked irregularity in the delivery of his milk newspapers and letters Sometimes the animal chose to resent the approach of all comers and after the postman had lost a portion of his right trouser leg he had decided that whatever might happen to His Majesty s mails the postman s calf was sacred Thenceforth he never delivered letters when James was at large Without participating in the postman s mishap the paper boy and milkman had adopted his tactics The dustman point blank refused to touch the refuse from The Cedars unless it were placed on the pavement and the gate securely closed Sometimes the readings of the electric and gas meters were formally noted by officials whose uniform began and ended with their caps sometimes they were not Everything depended upon the geographical position of James at the moment of the inspector s call The baker who supplied mister Naylor had as a result of a complaint from his man made a personal call of protest but he had succeeded only in losing his temper to mister Naylor and the seat of his trousers to James Thenceforth The Cedars had to seek its bread elsewhere Incidentally the master baker obtained a new pair of trousers at mister Naylor s expense Why mister Naylor continued to keep James was a puzzle to all the neighbours who knowing him as a champion of the rights of man votes for women the smaller nations and many other equally uncomfortable things were greatly surprised that he should keep a dog that was clearly of a savage and dangerous disposition About mister Naylor himself there was nothing of the ferocity of his dog He was suave with a somewhat deprecating manner a ready almost automatic smile in which his eyes never seemed to join a sallow complexion large round glasses a big nose and ugly teeth He had a thick voice thick ears and a thick skin when it so served his purpose His love for England was almost alien and he was never tired of motoring from one part of the country to another that is before the war His car had been something unique as in a few seconds it could be turned into a moderately comfortable sleeping apartment Thus he was independent of hotels or lodgings missus Naylor was a woman of negative personality She looked after the house fed James and never asked questions of mister Naylor thus justifying her existence Susan the maid was also negative from her stupid round moist face to the shapeless feet that she never seemed to be able to lift from the floor She had acquired great dexterity in shuffling out of the way just before mister Naylor appeared This she seemed to have reduced to a fine art If mister Naylor were going upstairs and Susan was about to descend by the time he was halfway up she would have disappeared as effectively as if snatched away by some spirit agency Susan was dumb but her sense of sound was extremely acute It seemed as if conscious of her inability to hold her own verbally with her employer she had fallen back upon the one alternative disappearance The Naylors were possessed of few friends although mister Naylor had many acquaintances the result of the way in which he had identified himself with local clubs and institutions It was largely due to him that the miniature rifle range had been started He was one of the governors of the Cranberry Cottage Hospital He always subscribed to the annual Territorial sports patronised the boy scouts openly advocated conscription and the two power standard for the Navy There were times when Streatham found it almost embarrassing to be possessed of a patriot in its midst Never had a breath of scandal tarnished the fair name of mister Montagu Naylor He was what a citizen should be and seldom is When war broke out his activities became almost bewildering He joined innumerable committees helped to form the volunteers and encouraged every one and everything that was likely to make things uncomfortable for the enemy Later he became a member of the local exemption tribunal and earned fame by virtue of his clemency It was he who was instrumental in obtaining exemption for some of James s most implacable enemies The baker who had lost the whole of his temper and a portion of his trousers probably owed his life to the manner in which mister Naylor championed his claim that bread is mightier than the sword Before the war the Naylors received twice each month once their friends and once their relatives Never were the two allowed to meet Our friends we make ourselves our relatives are given to us mister Naylor had explained with ponderous humour I hate to mix the two It was noticed that the relatives stayed much longer than the friends and some commiseration was felt for the Naylors by their immediate neighbours There had been one curious circumstance in connection with these social functions Whenever the friends were invited James was always in the front garden restrained by a chain that allowed of the guests carrying their calves into the hall with an eighteen inch margin of safety When however it was the turn of the relatives to seek the hospitality of The Cedars James was never visible A cynic might have construed this into indicating that from his relatives mister Naylor had expectations Within his own home mister Naylor was a changed man He ruled missus Naylor Susan and James with an iron hand They all fawned upon him vainly inviting the smiles that when others were present seemed never to fail in the mechanical precision with which they illumined his features at appropriate moments They gave the impression of being turned on as if controlled by a tap or switch Never was this smile seen once the hall door was passed Then mister Naylor s jaw squared and his whole attitude seemed to become more angular A knock at the door would cause him to look up quickly from whatever he was doing just as a gamekeeper might look up at the report of a gun By his orders missus Naylor and Susan between them kept a complete list of all callers even hawkers if they were sufficiently courageous to risk an encounter with the redoubtable James mister Naylor was a tall man of broad build with a head that would persist in remaining square in spite of his best endeavours to grow the hair upon it in such a way as to soften its angularity His eyes were steely his forehead low his mouth hard and his manner furtive That was within doors The breath of heaven however seemed to mitigate all these unamiable characteristics and it was only on very rare occasions that once beyond his own threshold an observer would see the harshness of the man He smiled down at children sometimes he patted their heads he was never lacking in a tip appropriate or inappropriate he was the smoother out of discordant situations he nodded to all the tradespeople smiled genially at his inferiors and saluted his superiors and equals In short he was an ideal citizen The outbreak of war in August nineteen fourteen was responsible for two changes in the Naylor menage First the at home days were discontinued secondly James was more than ever in evidence Nobody however noticed the changes because in Streatham such things are not considered worthy of notice mister Naylor received few letters for which the postman was grateful to providence Had Streatham been a little more curious it would have noticed that mister Naylor s comings and goings were fraught with some curious and interesting characteristics For one thing he appeared constitutionally unable to proceed direct to a given point For instance if Hampstead were his object he would in all probability go to Charing Cross take a bus along Strand the tube to Piccadilly Circus a taxi to Leicester Square tube to Golders Green and bus to Hampstead Another curious circumstance connected with mister Naylor was the number of people who seemed to stop him to enquire their way obviously people who found it difficult to pronounce the names and addresses of those they sought for they invariably held in their hands pieces of paper which mister Naylor would read and then proceed to direct them This would occur in all parts of London To the casual observer interested in the details of mister Naylor s life it would have appeared that London waited for his approach and then incontinently made a bee line for him to enquire its way With smiling geniality mister Naylor would read the paper offered to him make one or two remarks then with a wave of his hand and a further genial smile proceed on his way His courtesy was almost continental He would take great pains to direct the enquirer sometimes even proceeding part of the way with him to ensure that he should not go astray Since the war mister Naylor had patriotically given up his car handing it over to the Red Cross and receiving from the local secretary a letter of very genuine thanks and appreciation There had also been a paragraph in The Streatham Herald notifying this splendid act of citizenship In nothing was mister Naylor s sense of Christian charity so manifest as in the patience with which he answered the number of false rings he received on the telephone It was extraordinary the way in which wrong numbers seemed to be put through to him yet his courtesy never forsook him His reply was always the same No I am mister Montague Naylor of Streatham It frequently happened that shortly after such a call mister Naylor would go out when James would be left in the front garden missus Naylor had particular instructions always to make a note of any rings that came on the telephone during mister Naylor s absence no matter whether they were for him or for anyone else She was to take down every word that was said and always say in response that the subscriber was on to mister Naylor of Streatham One morning whilst John Dene was giving down letters to Dorothy in his customary jerky manner mister Naylor sat at breakfast his attention equally divided between the meal and the morning paper Opposite sat missus Naylor watching him as a dog watches a master of uncertain temper She was a little woman with a colourless face from which sparse grey hair was drawn with puritan severity In her weak blue eyes was fear fear of her lord and master and in her manner deprecation and apology The only sound to be heard were the champing of mister Naylor s jaws and the occasional rustle of the newspaper mister Naylor was a hearty eater and an omnivorous reader of newspapers In the front garden James gave occasional tongue protesting against the existence of some passer by After a particularly vigorous bout of barking on James s part mister Naylor looked up suddenly and fixing missus Naylor with astern eye demanded Any post I haven t heard the post woman yet faltered missus Naylor apologetically She was at heart a pacifist in the domestic sense Go and see was the gruff retort as mister Naylor thrust into his mouth a large piece of bread which he had previously wiped round his plate to absorb the elemental juices of the morning bacon missus Naylor rose meekly and left the room A few moments later she returned carrying in her hand two envelopes mister Naylor looked up over his spectacles They were on the path she explained timidly James is in the garden The post woman had tacitly carried on the tradition of her predecessor the postman If James were about the letters went over the garden gate if James were not about they went into the letter box With a grunt mister Naylor snatched the letters from missus Naylor s hand and looked at them keenly One bore a halfpenny stamp and was consequently of no particular importance This he laid beside his plate The other however he subjected to a rigorous and elaborate examination He scrutinised the handwriting examined carefully the postmark turned it over and gazed at the fastening Then taking a letter opener from his pocket he slowly slit the top of the envelope and taking out a sheet of notepaper unfolded it Gott He bit off the phrase savagely and looked up fiercely at missus Naylor as if she was responsible for his lapse Instinctively she shrank back From the garden James s vigorous barking swelled out into a fortissimo of protest Stop that dog he shouted whereat missus Naylor rose and left the room With scowling eyebrows mister Naylor read his letter and ground his teeth with suppressed fury Der mann muss verrueckt sein He re read the letter then placing it in his pocket looked across the table seeming for the first time to notice that missus Naylor had left the room Going to the door he opened it and shouted a peremptory Here As missus Naylor entered with obvious trepidation he fixed her with a stern disapproving eye There s somebody coming this afternoon at four he said I ll see him in the study and with that he once more drew the letter from his pocket and read it for the third time whilst missus Naylor withdrew The letter which was typewritten even to the signature ran DEAR mister NAYLOR I hope to call upon you on Thursday afternoon at four o clock I regret that unforseen circumstances have prevented me from giving myself this pleasure before Yours very truly J VAN HELDER With a grumble in his throat mister Naylor walked out of the dining room across the hall and into his study Closing and locking the door he went over to his writing table and seemed to collapse into rather than sit on the chair He was oblivious to everything except the scrap of paper before him The cloud upon his brow seemed to intensify his face became more cruel The mister Naylor of Streatham patriot philanthropist and good citizen had vanished giving place to a man in whose heart was anger and fear At the end of five minutes he drew towards him a small metal tray Taking a match from a stand he struck it and deliberately setting light to the paper held it while it burned When the flame seared his fingers he placed the whole upon the metal dish scowling at the paper as it writhed and crackled in its death agony He then proceeded to burn the envelope When both were reduced to twisted shapes of carbon he opened a drawer took from it a duster and pressed it down upon the metal plate reducing the contents to black powder Picking up the tray he carried it over to the grate emptied the powder into the fireplace wiped the tray and replaced it upon the table thrusting the duster back into the drawer He then sank once more into his chair conscious that the morning had begun ill Ten minutes later he rose unlocked the door and went out into the hall He took his hat from the stand and brushed it carefully Picking up his gloves and umbrella he gave a final look round then composing his features for the outside world he opened the door and passed out into Apthorpe Road For such of his neighbours as he encountered he had a cheery word a lifting of his hat or a wave of the hand Housewives would sigh enviously as they saw mister Naylor pass genially on his way He was always the same they told themselves remembering with a little pang the vagaries of their own husbands Before his return to The Cedars for lunch mister Naylor with unaccustomed emphasis foretold the doom of the Government unless it immediately rushed a measure through Parliament for the internment of all aliens He was nothing if not thorough CHAPTER VII mister NAYLOR RECEIVES A VISITOR I Height five feet six and a half inches Five feet eight sir Chest thirty eight Thirty eight and a half sir Weight eleven stone nine Twelve stone sir Near enough Yes sir replied Thompson You ve got everything Down to his under wear sir was the response The ring Yes sir Malcolm Sage looked up from the buff coloured paper before him then picking up a photograph from the table proceeded to study it with great intentness Yes he said Finlay can do it At that moment Colonel Walton strode into the room smoking the inevitable cigar Thompson straightened himself to attention Malcolm Sage nodded then once more became absorbed in the photograph I hear Finlay s here said Colonel Walton Sage looked up and nodded We ve just been checking his measurements he said With that Bergen fellow s Sage nodded It s a considerable risk said Colonel Walton Finlay likes em retorted Sage without looking up I d give a good deal to solve that little mystery The mystery to which Malcolm Sage referred was the arrest of a man on a Bergen Hull boat some ten days previously Although his passport and papers were in order his story when he had been interrogated was not altogether satisfactory It had been decided to deport him but Malcolm Sage who had subjected him to a lengthy cross examination had decided that it would be better to detain him for the time being and the suspect was consequently lodged in the Tower Both Malcolm Sage and Colonel Walton were convinced that he had been sent over on a special mission Where s Finlay asked Colonel Walton He s painting the lily said Sage with a glint in his eye In other words enquired Colonel Walton Seeing how near he can get to this Bergen fellow I took him down to the Tower to see the men together Colonel Walton nodded Malcolm Sage regarded disguise as exclusively the asset of the detective of fiction A disguise he maintained could always be identified although not necessarily penetrated Few men could disguise their walk or bearing no matter how clever they might be with the aid of false beards and wigs You remember the lost code book Sage queried I do said Colonel Walton A remarkable piece of work of Finlay s continued Sage It wasn t a disguise it was an alteration trim of moustache cut and colour of hair darkened skin and such trifles And the black eye sir interpolated Thompson That was certainly a happy stroke cried Colonel Walton It takes a good deal of moral courage to black your own eye said Sage quietly I tried it once myself How do you plan to proceed It was Colonel Walton who spoke If Naylor is really the man we re after and this Bergen fellow is on a secret mission then it s pretty sure they were intended to get into touch Sage paused for a moment then added Anyhow it s worth trying It s a risk of course Naylor may have met him before The risk will be mainly Finlay s said Colonel Walton drily as he smoked meditatively It would be yours or mine chief only nature cast us in a different mould For some moments Colonel Walton did not reply I don t like sending a man on a He paused There s no question of sending Finlay it s more a matter of holding him back By the way he continued casually Thompson burgled John Dene s place last night got a set of plans the chit signed by Sir Lyster and the Skipper and one or two other papers that should be useful I don t quite like it Sage Colonel Walton knitted his brows It s giving the Yard something to do was Sage s indifferent retort They re buzzing about John Dene like flies to day He s expressing himself to them in choice Canadian too so Thompson tells me Thompson gave an appreciative grin I dropped in there this morning sir and He did not conclude his sentence but his look was one of keen appreciation He s got some words has Inspector Bluggers he added but mister Dene left him standing We ve just been going over the points of Finlay and the Bergen man explained Sage They re pretty well in agreement Personally I believe there s a lot in that ring We stripped the other fellow of his clothes Finlay insisted on having them baked Fussy sort of chap in things like that he added but that ring Men don t generally wear turquoises set in an eccentric pattern Ha He looked up suddenly Colonel Walton looked across at him interrogatingly You remember the initials inside chief Colonel Walton nodded D U A weren t they What about Deutsches ueber alles A bit obvious suggested Colonel Walton The Hun always is There was a knock at the door Come in called Colonel Walton A moment later there entered a man of foreign appearance with dark well brushed hair sallow skin and the deprecating manner of one who is in a country where he is not quite sure either of the customs or of the language For a moment he stood smiling Malcolm Sage caught Colonel Walton s eye Upon Thompson s face there spread a grin of admiration Wonderful Finlay said Colonel Walton Wonderful You think it is like enquired he who had been addressed as Finlay Wonderful repeated Colonel Walton but he added a moment after it s a dangerous game Finlay shrugged his shoulders in a manner that was almost aggressively un English He possessed one remarkable characteristic once he had assumed a personality he continued to be that man until he finally relinquished the part He ll put you to sleep if you make a mistake said Sage with uncompromising candour Again the shrug of the shoulders That ring said Sage pointing to a flat gold band on the third finger of the left hand in which were set three turquoises in the form of a triangle What do you make of the inscription I do not know said Finlay with the finnicking inflection of one talking in a strange tongue What about Deutsches ueber alles suggested Walton Ah you have discovered Perfect said Sage absolutely perfect You re a genius Finlay With a smile and a half shrug of his shoulders Finlay deprecated the compliment Where are you going to stay enquired Colonel Walton At the Ritzton with John Dene same floor if possible said Sage He starts from the Tower to morrow Released you know Colonel Walton nodded By the way Thompson you didn t happen to drop any finger prints about in Waterloo Place Rubber gloves sir said Thompson with a smile Malcolm Sage nodded It would embarrass us a bit if you got lodged in Brixton prison said Colonel Walton No chance of that sir was the confident retort The account will be in the papers this afternoon I understand Malcolm Sage nodded Well Finlay said Walton off you go and the best of luck If you bring this off you ought to get a C B E Gott in himmel cried Finlay in such tragic consternation that both Colonel Walton and Sage were forced to smile No sir said Sage drily we must guard Department Z against the Order of the British Empire it deserves well of the country When does he go to Streatham enquired Colonel Walton I go now responded Finlay if I find the place These suburbs He rolled his eyes expressively Malcolm Sage smiled grimly II For some time mister Naylor had sat staring in front of him immobile but for the movement of his eyes and the compression of his pouch like lips as he swallowed Irritation or anxiety always caused him to swallow with a noisy gulp like sound Since lunch he had scowled impartially upon everything missus Naylor Susan James the paper his food all seemed to come under the ban of his displeasure From time to time he muttered under his breath He made several efforts to concentrate upon the newspaper before him but without success His eyes would wander from the page and scowl into vacancy The heavy jowls seemed to mould his face into a brutal square which with his persistent swallowing gave him the appearance of a toad His original anger at the threatened advent of a visitor seemed to have changed into irritation at his non arrival From time to time he looked at his watch A step echoing in the street brought him to a listening attitude When at last a ring sounded at the bell followed by a peremptory rat tat he started violently He listened intently to the pad of missus Naylor s footsteps along the passage to the murmur of voices that followed and the sound of steps approaching When the door opened the scowl had fled from mister Naylor s features the jowls had lifted the set frown had passed from his brows His mouth was pursed up into a smile only one degree less repellent than the look that it had replaced mister Naylor had assumed his best public meeting manner mister Van Helder he queried as he shook hands and motioned his visitor to a seat We shall not be overheard no interrogated Van Helder mister Naylor shook his head transferring his eyes from a paper weight before him to his visitor s face and back again to the paper weight These London suburbs exclaimed Van Helder as he drew a silk handkerchief from his pocket and proceeded to wipe his face I seem to have pursued you to everywhere I crossed from Bergen on the twenty first he added with a smile The twenty first repeated mister Naylor Just ten days ago continued Van Helder I came not before because He raised his eyes suddenly and looked straight at mister Naylor who smiled but there was guile behind the momentary exposure of his yellow teeth The crossing continued Van Helder three times the alarm of U boats He smiled a crafty little smile The Germans they make the sea unsafe Again he smiled So you have been in London since the twenty first mister Naylor s tone was casual but his eyes glinted Van Helder nodded indifferently Where are you staying mister Naylor s eyes never left his visitor s face At the Ritzton You have been comfortable The tone was conversational Again Van Helder shrugged his shoulders You have been seeing the sights Again the tone was casual but in mister Naylor s eyes there was a crafty look It is as I have been told said Van Helder with a smile Always cautious You are fond of dogs he added irrelevantly I heard one James does not like strangers This with a sinister smile No continued the other taking a cigarette case from his pocket and offering it to mister Naylor who declined I may smoke mister Naylor nodded Van Helder lighted a cigarette and proceeded to blow smoke rings with quiet content He wanted to think It was obvious to him that something was wrong something lacking There was the suggestion in his host s manner of a cat watching a mouse watching and waiting You are becoming how do you call it ungeschickt he said with a disarming smile as he blew three rings in rapid succession You think so mister Naylor smiled amiably Yes how do you call it awkward clumsy You have lived long in England he continued a little contemptuously as he ejected more smoke rings You find London interesting asked mister Naylor with ominous calm He was determined to pick up the thread of conversation that had been snatched from his hand You are a fool Van Helder turned just as he emitted a smoke ring At the calm insolence of his tone mister Naylor started slightly but quickly recovered himself What do you mean I have been in the Tower For the fraction of a second Van Helder s eyes sought those of mister Naylor Was it relief that he saw The change was only momentary just a flash Van Helder continued to blow smoke rings as if entirely indifferent alike to his host s presence and emotions I was released yesterday morning They apologised for my detention And you came here f mister Naylor s voice was even and devoid of inflection Deliberately Van Helder took from his pocket a gold ring set with three turquoises in the form of a triangle It was his last card Ah I see you look at my ring he said seeing mister Naylor s eyes fix greedily upon it It was given to me by one whom I serve Deliberately he drew it from his finger again and handed it to mister Naylor who took it casually and proceeded to examine it The other watched him closely Yes he was looking at the inscription on the inside They are not my initials said Van Helder mister Naylor looked up quickly No he said returning the ring The other shrugged his shoulders without replying mister Naylor s manner had undergone a change And now about John Dene Ah as one smoke ring passed through another John Dene Yes of Toronto continued Van Helder smiling and continuing to blow rings with apparent enjoyment He is staying at the Ritzton too London is full of visitors My friend we waste time There is such a thing as over caution As I say you are ungeschickt There was that affair of John Dene s lunch Such things will not please those He shrugged his shoulders For fully a minute Naylor gazed at him quietly searchingly There was then the chocolates and the girl I do not understand mister Naylor looked across at him craftily We waste time I know I will tell you The secretary you make your woman offer her chocolates at a tea shop and to go for a ride in a taxi The chocolates He shrugged his shoulders expressively She refuses You are clumsy The contemptuous insolence of his visitor seemed to impress mister Naylor The look of suspicion in his eyes became less marked How did you know he asked still wary We waste time was the response with a wave of the hand For a few moments mister Naylor sat watching Van Helder as he continued to blow rings with manifest content Listen continued Van Helder John Dene has brought over here an invention a submarine that is to end the war He has given it to the Admiralty Given it involuntarily repeated mister Naylor Given it There are patriots even in England You think he is trying to sell it therefore you try to remove him Not selling it mister Naylor leaned slightly forward He gives it on condition that he commands it with his own men It makes easy the matter Then it is true what mister Naylor stopped How did you learn this He slobbered his words slightly as he spoke I know things it is my duty was the response But what proof With great deliberation Van Helder drew from his pocket a large envelope extracting a single sheet of paper he handed it across the table mister Naylor snatched it eagerly and proceeded to devour it with his eyes I also got a set of plans of a submarine but it was one of our own He is clever this man How did you get it Van Helder smiled How did you get the copy he enquired The copy How did you know mister Naylor stared at him his jaw a little dropped He swallowed noisily You have been clumsy repeated Van Helder You try to kill the cock that lays the eggs of gold He shrugged his shoulders contemptuously mister Naylor flushed angrily And you he almost snarled I am here to watch He looked across at mister Naylor with a cunning smile He was at last sure of his ground Watch who Van Helder shrugged his shoulders and proceeded to light a new cigarette from the burning end of the old one You must not kill yet he said gazing at the end of his cigarette to see that it was well alight What then demanded mister Naylor His jowls had returned and the yellow of his teeth was visible between his slightly parted lips Wait and watch was the reply And let him go North sneered the other If you kill where are the plans Do as you would he continued indifferently There will be The Day for you too Now I go He made a movement to rise but mister Naylor motioned him back into his chair Two hours later mister Naylor himself let out his visitor Closing the front door he returned to his study where for an hour he sat at his table gazing straight in front of him mister Naylor was puzzled Conscious that he was being followed by a small man in a grey suit with shifty eyes James Finlay made his way leisurely to the High Road where he took a bus bound for Piccadilly Circus CHAPTER VIII DOROTHY WEST AT HOME Mother mine cried Dorothy West as she withdrew the pins from her hat John Dene s a dear and I think his passion for me is developing Dorothy cried missus West a tiny white haired lady whose face still retained traces of youthful beauty You needn t be shocked lovie John Dene is as worthy as his namesake in Evangeline She laughed lightly Now I must eat John Dene s like sea air he s so stimulating and she began to eat the dinner that missus West always prepared with such care For some minutes she watched with a smile of approval her daughter s healthy appetite I think I should like mister Dene Dorothy she said at length I have always heard that Canadians are very nice to women You must ask him to call Oh you funny little mother she laughed You forget that we have come down in the world and that I m a typist A secretary dear corrected missus West gently Well secretary then but even a secretary doesn t invite her employer to tea even when the tea is as mother makes it It s not done so the less that s said of John I think the better she quoted gaily Oh by the way she added you might get his goat Sir Lyster does His goat dear missus West looked up with a puzzled expression Dorothy explained the allusion She went on to tell of some of the doings of John Dene his impatience his indifference to and contempt for constituted authority In short she added a few vivid side lights to the picture she had already given her mother of how John Dene had come and carried all before him I think she said in conclusion screwing up her pretty features that John Dene is rather a dear Then after a pause she added You see he is also a man A man my dear questioned missus West looking at her daughter with a smile Yes mother he s so intensely masculine I get so fed up with Dorothy expostulated missus West Yes I know it s trying mother but I get so weary of the subaltern and junior naval officer Of course they re splendid and brave but they don t seem men But think of how they have given their lives began missus West Yes but we see those who haven t mother and very few of them have chevrons on their sleeves Now John Dene is quite different He always seems to be a man yet he never forgets that you are a woman although he never appears to be conscious of your being a woman Dorothy caught her mother s eye and laughed Of course it sounds utterly ridiculous I know but there it is and then think of what She suddenly broke off Yes dear said missus West gently I was nearly letting out official secrets mother Of course I mustn t do that must I Of course not dear said missus West Yes continued Dorothy her head on one side I like John Dene It must be ripping to be able to bully a First Lord of the Admiralty she added irrelevantly Bully a First Lord said missus West missus West seemed to be in a perpetual state of repeating in a bewildered manner her daughter s startling statements He doesn t care for anybody He calls mister Blair that s Sir Lyster s secretary the prize seal and I m sure he takes a delight in frightening the poor man That s the best of being a Canadian you see you don t care a damn Dorothy There was horror in missus West s voice I m so sorry mother dear but it slipped out you know and really it s such an awfully convenient word isn t it It s so different from not caring a bother or not caring a blow Anyway when you re a Canadian you don t care a well you know for anybody If a man happens to be a lord or a duke you re rude to him just to show that you re as good as he is Sometimes mother I wish I were a Canadian said Dorothy pensively I should so like to ginger up Sir Lyster Your language my dear said missus West gently Oh that s John Dene said Dorothy airily That s his favourite expression ginger up He came over here to ginger up the Admiralty and in fact ginger up anybody who didn t very strongly object to being gingered up and those who did well he gingers them up just the same You should see poor mister Blair under the process Dorothy laughed as she thought of mister Blair s sufferings The girls call him Oh Reginald and he looks it she added missus West smiled vaguely finding it a little difficult to follow her daughter along these paths of ultra modernism You see if Sir Lyster says to me go I have to go continued Dorothy and if he says to me come I have to come but if he says to John Dene go he just says shucks Says what Dorothy Shucks she repeated with a laugh it means go to well you know mother And does he say that to Sir Lyster enquired missus West in awe struck voice Dorothy nodded vigorously The only one that seems to understand him is Sir Bridgman North and he never stands on his dignity you know If I were in the Navy said Dorothy meditatively I should like to be under Sir Bridgman he s really rather a dear But why do began missus West why does Sir Lyster allow Allow broke in Dorothy It doesn t matter what you allow with John Dene If you agree with him he just grunts if you don t he says shucks or else he questions whether you ve got any head filling Any what asked missus West Head filling that means brains Oh you ve got an awful lot to learn she added nodding at her mother in mock despair I think John Dene very clever she added Dorothy you mustn t call him John Dene He s always called John Dene said Dorothy You can t think of him as anything but John Dene and do you know mother all the other girls are so intrigued They re always asking me how I get on with the bear as they call him That s because he doesn t take any notice of them except Marjorie Rogers and she s as cheeky as a robin But he isn t a bear is he Dorothy A bear He s the most polite creature that ever existed said Dorothy when he remembers it she added after a moment s pause You see they all expect me to marry him Dorothy I m not so sure that they re wrong either she added naively You see he s got plenty of money and I don t like to hear you talk like that dear said missus West gravely Oh I m horrid aren t I she cried running over to her mother and putting her arm round her neck What a dreadful thing it must be for you poor mother mine to have such a daughter She outrages all the dear old Victorian conventions doesn t she You mustn t talk like that Dorothy dear said missus West There was in her voice that which told her daughter she was in earnest All right mother dear I won t you know my bark is worse than my bite don t you Yes but dear You see way down as John Dene would say in his own heart there is chivalry and that is very very rare nowadays among men He is much nicer to me than he would be to Lady Grayne or missus Llewellyn John or to the Queen herself I believe I m sure he likes me added Dorothy half to herself You see she added he broke my teapot and he owes me something for that doesn t he Dorothy you are very naughty There was no rebuke in missus West s voice And you re wondering how it came about that such a dear sweet conventional lovely Victorian symbol of respectability and convention should have had such a dreadfully outrageous daughter as Dorothy West Now confess mother aren t you missus West merely smiled the indulgent smile that Dorothy always interpreted into forgiveness for her lapses past present and to come You see mother John Dene has got it into his head that we re hopelessly out of date she said He s quite sincere He thinks we re fools Sir Lyster Sir Bridgman and the whole lot of us and as for poor mister Blair he knows he s a fool He thinks that mister Llewellyn John is almost a fool in fact he s sure in his own mind that unless you happen to be born a Canadian you re a fool and can t help it He s quite nice about it because it really isn t your fault I m afraid he must be very narrow minded said missus West gently No he isn t that s where it s so funny it s just his idea He looks upon himself as a heaven sent corrective to the British Government I m afraid poor John Dene is going to have a nasty jar before he s through as he would say himself How do you mean Dorothy enquired missus West I mustn t say any more because I should be divulging official secrets The other girls are so curious to know what is happening Bishy that s Miss Bishcroft asked me whether John Dene made love to me and Rojjie is sure that he kisses me Dorothy rippled off into laughter How impertinent of her missus West was shocked It wasn t impertinence mother it was funny If you could only see John Dene and imagine him making love to anyone It really is funny Sometimes I sit and wonder if he knows how to kiss a girl Dorothy you are began missus West Why shouldn t we be frank and open about such matters Every man kisses a girl at some time during his life except John Dene she added In Whitehall it s nothing but minutes and kisses Why shouldn t we talk about it It s helping to win the war It s so silly to hide everything in that silly Victorian way of ours If a nice girl meets a nice man she wants him to kiss her and she s disappointed if he doesn t Now isn t she challenged Dorothy as she perched herself upon the arm of her mother s chair and looked down at her her eyebrows and mouth screwed up impertinent and provocative I wish you wouldn t talk like that dear said missus West as she regarded her daughter s pretty features Why mother she enquired bending and brushing a swift kiss upon her mother s white hair It it doesn t seem she paused then added rather weakly it doesn t seem quite nice Dorothy jumped up and stood before her mother smiling mischievously And so you don t think I m quite nice missus West She made an elaborate curtsey Thank you very much indeed At the Admiralty there are quite a lot of young men and some old ones too who don t agree with you she added returning to her chair But you mustn t say such such things protested missus West weakly But mother when you were a girl and knew a nice man didn t you want him to kiss you We never thought about such things We Didn t you want father to kiss you persisted Dorothy We were engaged my dear and your dear father was so But before you were engaged Suppose father had tried to kiss you What would you have done The girl s eyes were on her mother mischievous and challenging A faint blush tinged missus West s cheeks I ll tell you what you d have done you dear naughty little mother You d have pretended to be shocked but in your heart you would have been glad and you d have lain awake all night thinking what an awful rip you had been She nodded her head wisely Sometimes said missus West after a pause I wish it had not been necessary for you to work Girls seem so different nowadays from what they were when I was young We are you dear little mouse smiled Dorothy We know a lot more and to be forewarned is to be forearmed I m glad I didn t live when you had to faint at the sight of a mouse or swoon when you were kissed It would be such a waste she added gaily missus West sighed conscious that a new age of womanhood had dawned with which she was out of touch Mother said Dorothy presently what made you love father missus West looked up in surprise at her daughter but continued to fold her napkin and place it in her ring before replying Because your father Dorothy was she hesitated My father suggested Dorothy missus West smiled but there was a far away look in her eyes Everybody loved your father she went on a moment later Yes mother but everybody didn t marry him she said practically Noooo hesitated missus West But you mean to say that everybody would have liked to marry him He was very wonderful said missus West a note of sadness creeping into her voice But you haven t answered my question persisted Dorothy Why is it that we women love men missus West was not conscious of the quaint phrasing of her daughter s remark We don t love men Dorothy she cried we love a man the right man But persisted Dorothy why do we do it They re not pretty and they re not very interesting she emphasised the very and only a few of them are clever Sometimes in the Tube coming home I see a girl and a man holding hands What is it that makes them want to hold hands It s natural to fall in love said missus West gently But that s not falling in love protested Dorothy scornfully If I fell in love with a man I shouldn t want to hold his hand in a train I should hate him if he expected it It s a question of class said missus West a little primly Oh mother what an awful snob you are cried Dorothy jumping up and going round and giving her mother a hug Let s go into the drawing room and be comfy and have a chat When they were seated missus West in an armchair and Dorothy on a stool at her feet the girl continued her interrogations Now suppose she continued I were to fall in love with a man who was ugly ill mannered badly dressed with very little to say for himself Why should I do it Dorothy looked challengingly up at her mother But you wouldn t dear said missus West with gentle conviction Oh mother you re awfully trying you know she cried in mock despair You ve got to suppose that I have or could Why should I do it missus West gazed at her daughter a little anxiously then shook her head Now I can quite understand went on Dorothy half to herself why a man should fall in love with me I m pretty and bright wear nice things particularly underneath Dorothy broke in missus West in a tone of shocked protest She laughed Oh mother you re a dreadful prude Why do you think girls wear pretty shoes and stockings and low cut blouses as thin as a cobweb Hush Dorothy you mustn t say such things There was pain in missus West s voice I wish we could face facts said Dorothy with a sigh You see mother dear she continued when you re in a government office with heaps of other girls and men about you get to know things see things and sometimes you get to hate things I have always regretted began missus West sadly You mustn t do that mother dear cried Dorothy it has been an education But what I want to know is what is it in a man that attracts a girl Goodness honour and began missus West No it isn t said Dorothy at least they don t attract me missus West looked pained but said nothing You see continued Dorothy there are such a lot of good men about and honourable men and and they re so dreadfully dull and monotonous I couldn t marry that sort of man she added with conviction But began missus West You wouldn t Then she paused I can t explain it mother she said but I should hate to be doing the same thing always But we are doing the same things always Dorothy said missus West Oh no we re not protested Dorothy I never know until I get home on Saturday where I m going to take you Now if I had a husband a good and honourable husband he would begin about Thursday saying that on Saturday afternoon we would go to Hampstead or to Richmond or to oh anywhere Then when Saturday came I should hate the very name of the place he had chosen Then on Sunday we should go to church in the morning for a walk in the afternoon pay a call or two then church or a cinema in the evening That s good and honourable married life she concluded with decision missus West looked down with a puzzled expression on her face Wait a minute mother said Dorothy Now we ll imagine the real me married to a good and honourable man At twelve thirty on the Saturday that he has arranged to lose himself and me at the maze at Hampton Court I telephone to say that we re going to Brighton and that he s to meet me at Victoria at half past one and I ll bring his things Now what do you think he d do With head on one side she gazed challengingly at her mother I I don t know faltered missus West I do said Dorothy with conviction He d have a fit Then if I wanted him to come for a bus ride just as he was going to bed went on Dorothy he d have another fit and if one fine morning just as he was off to the office I were to ask him not to go but to take me to Richmond instead he d have a third fit and then I should be a widow A widow questioned missus West What are you talking about Third fits are always fatal mother she said wisely Then with a laugh she added Oh there s a great time in store for the man who marries Dorothy West He will have to have a strong heart a robust constitution and above all any amount of stamina and she gave a mischievous little chuckle of joy Then a moment after looking gravely at her mother she said You must have been very wicked lovie or you d never have had such a daughter to plague you I m your cross but missus West merely smiled CHAPTER IX DEPARTMENT Z AT WORK Naylor isn t satisfied then Colonel Walton glanced across at Malcolm Sage who was gazing appreciatively at his long lender fingers He s the shyest bird I ve ever come across said Sage without looking up He gave Finlay a rare wigging for that call Now he s having him watched I expected that said Colonel Walton engrossed in cutting the end of a cigar I think it s jealousy continued Sage He s afraid of the special agent getting all the kudos and the plunder he added It was a happy chance getting that Bergen chap I m rather concerned about Finlay said Colonel Walton Good man Finlay There was a note of admiration in Sage s voice He s quite cut adrift from us He s nothing if not thorough I can t get in touch with him Of course he knows That he s being watched Yes Who s looking after him Hoyle Sage drew his pipe from his pocket and proceeded to charge it from a chamois leather tobacco pouch I ve had to call Thompson off I think they linked him up with us That s a pity said Colonel Walton gazing at the end of his cigar He s a better man than Hoyle It s that little chap they ve got continued Sage lives at Wimbledon retired commercial traveller clever devil Malcolm Sage never grudged praise to an opponent How about John Dene He s not taking any risks said Sage as he applied a match to his pipe But they ll never let him go north Then we must prevent him Perhaps you d like to take on that little job chief There was a momentary suspicion of a twinkle in Sage s eye before a volume of tobacco smoke blotted it out I m afraid it ll force our hand said Colonel Walton That burglary business complicated things said Sage as he sucked in his lips with him a sign of annoyance It was a mistake to keep it dark That was Sir Lyster It made Naylor suspicious Has Finlay seen him since enquired Colonel Walton Naylor must have given him the secret code They ve met several times but I believe Naylor is determined to act on his own He s a weird creature I wish I could get in touch with Finlay however Why not try the taxi I ve had Rogers following him round all the time but Finlay hasn t once taken a taxi I m afraid he s taking a big risk began Colonel Walton That Naylor fellow He paused Sage nodded During the previous ten days Department Z had learned a great deal about the comings and goings of mister Montagu Naylor of Streatham It had become manifest to Sage that he had to do with a man who had reduced cunning and caution to a fine art His every act seemed to have been carefully thought out beforehand not only in relation to himself but to what might grow directly out of it During a walk he would sometimes turn suddenly and proceed swiftly in the direction from which he had come as if he had forgotten something looking keenly at every one he passed At others he would step into a shop where he could be seen keeping a careful watch through the window A favourite trick was to walk briskly round a corner then stop and look in some shop window with a small mirror held in the palm of his hand From the first Malcolm Sage had realised that the conventional methods of shadowing a suspect would be useless for his purpose Those in whom Department Z were interested would be old hands at the game and to set a single person to watch them would inevitably result in the discovery of what was afoot He therefore set at least three men or women to dog the footsteps of the suspect These would follow each other at intervals of from twenty five to a hundred yards according to the district in which they were operating At a signal that the first in the line was dropping out the trail would be taken up by number two who in turn would relinquish the work to number three Sometimes as many as six were allocated to one shadowing This method had the additional advantage of enabling the Department to assure itself that the watchers were not in turn being watched It was no uncommon thing for a suspect to arrange to have himself shadowed in order to ascertain whether or no there were any one on his track This was a favourite device with mister Naylor For nearly two years Department Z had been endeavouring to solve the problem of a secret organisation with the offshots of which they were constantly coming into contact The method this organisation adopted was one of concentration upon a single object At one time it would be at the sailing of vessels from home ports at another the munitions output or again the anti aircraft defences of London Malcolm Sage was convinced that somewhere there was at work a controlling mind one that weighed every risk and was prepared for all eventualities Individuals had been shadowed some had been arrested much to Sage s disgust The efforts of the organisation had frequently been countered and its objects defeated but Department Z had hitherto been unable to penetrate beyond the outer fringe The most remarkable thing of all was that no document of any description had been discovered either on the person of those arrested or through the medium of the post Scotland Yard stoutly denied the existence of the organisation They claimed to have made a clean sweep of all secret service agents in their big round up on the outbreak of war Whatever remained were a few small fry that had managed to slip through the meshes of their net Malcolm Sage merely shrugged his shoulders and worked the harder When it had been discovered that the famous Norvelt aeroplane which was to give the Allies the supremacy of the air had been copied by the Germans the War Cabinet regarded the matter as one of the gravest setbacks the Allied cause had received mister Llewellyn John had openly reproached Colonel Walton with failure Again when time after time a certain North Sea convoy was attacked the Authorities knew that it could be only as a result of information having leaked out to the enemy A raid into the Bight of Heligoland had been met in a way that convinced those who had planned it that the enemy had been warned although the utmost secrecy had been observed All these things had tended to cause the War Cabinet uneasiness and Department Z had been urged to redouble its efforts to find out the means by which information was conveyed to the enemy We must watch and wait just hang about on the outer fringe When we find the thread it will lead to the centre of things Sage had remarked philosophically In the meantime he worked untiringly keeping always at the back of his mind the problem of this secret organisation Day by day the record of mister Montagu Naylor s activities enlarged With him caution seemed to have become an obsession As Malcolm Sage went through the daily reports of his agents he was puzzled to account for many of mister Naylor s actions other than by the fact that circumlocution had become with him a habit Among other things that came to light was mister Naylor s fondness for open spaces and the frequency with which he got into conversation with strangers He would wander casually into Kew Gardens or Waterlow Park or in fact anywhere seat himself somewhere on a bench and before he had been there ten minutes someone would inevitably select the same bench on which to rest himself or herself with the result that they would soon drift into desultory conversation with mister Naylor The same thing would happen at a restaurant at which mister Naylor might be lunching dining or taking tea With strangers his manner seemed irresistible It would sometimes happen that he would keep one of the telephone appointments pass through the thoroughfare indicated and proceed either to a park or a tea shop where later he would find himself in casual conversation with someone who curiously enough had been in that particular thoroughfare when he passed through it For some time Malcolm Sage was greatly puzzled by the fact that even when the name of a long thoroughfare were indicated in one of the telephone messages such as Oxford Street Marylebone Road or even the Fulham Road mister Naylor never experienced any difficulty in locating the whereabouts of his subordinate Sage gave instructions for the exact position of each thoroughfare to be indicated As a result he discovered that contact was always established in the neighbourhood of the building numbered ten It s the German mind remarked Sage one day to Colonel Walton It leaves nothing to chance or to the intelligence of the other fellow As each one of mister Naylor s associates was located he or she was continuously shadowed In consequence the strain upon the resources of Department Z became increasingly severe It was like an army advancing into an enemy country and having to furnish the lines of communication from its striking force Sometimes Sage himself was engaged in the shadowing and once or twice even Colonel Walton By the time we ve finished there won t be even the office cat left Thompson one day remarked to Gladys Norman a typist whom Malcolm Sage had picked out of one of the Departments through which he had passed during his non stop career She had already shown marked ability by her cleverness and resource to say nothing of her impudence Never mind Tommy she had replied It s all experience and after the war when I marry you and we start our private inquiry bureau She nodded her head knowingly Why I ve got enough facts from my own department to divorce half the officers on the staff she added The work of shadowing mister Naylor was not without its humours Sometimes Department Z was led away on false scents On one occasion a week was spent in tracking a venerable looking old gentleman he turned out to be a quite respectable pensioned civil servant who out of the kindness of his own heart had passed the time of day with mister Naylor The plan decided upon by Colonel Walton and Malcolm Sage was carefully to watch all mister Naylor s associates and at a given time make a clean sweep of the lot To achieve this effect a zero hour was to be established on a certain day Each was to be arrested as soon after that time as it was possible This was mainly due to Malcolm Sage s suspicion that some scheme of warning existed between the various members of the combination whereby any danger threatening one was quickly notified to all the others In all probability we shall get a few harmless birds into the net Malcolm Sage had remarked Probably the sister of an M P or the head of a department in one of the new Ministries but that can t be helped Still I should prefer that it didn t happen Colonel Walton had said drily You know the Skipper hates questions in the House By the way said Malcolm Sage to Colonel Walton one day Thompson sent in an interesting report this morning Naylor queried Colonel Walton Malcolm Sage nodded He s having a sort of small greenhouse arrangement fitted in the window of the front room of the basement It may be for flowers or for salad Or interrogated Colonel Walton Malcolm Sage merely shrugged his shoulders as he proceeded to dig the ashes out of his pipe The work of Department Z continued quietly and unostentatiously John Dene was never permitted out of sight except when in some private place This meant the constant changing of those responsible for keeping him under observation The necessity of this was not more evident to Department Z than to John Dene himself In spite of his scornful manner he was not lacking in caution as soon became obvious to Malcolm Sage At the hotel he was careful taking neither food nor drink in his room He never dined two consecutive nights at the same restaurant and he consistently refused all overtures from strangers It soon became evident to Malcolm Sage that John Dene realised how great was the danger by which he was threatened The ransacking of his room at the Ritzton left John Dene indifferent The fact that he never locked the small safe he kept at his office at Waterloo Place was not without its significance for Malcolm Sage In the course of the next few weeks Malcolm Sage learned a great deal about John Dene of Toronto Although proof against the wiles of confidence men always on the look out for the colonials he fell an easy victim to the plausible beggar He never refused a request for assistance and the record of his unostentatious charities formed a no inconsiderable portion of the rapidly increasing dossier at Department Z Many were the incidents recorded of John Dene s kindness of heart A child smiling up into his eyes would cause him to stop bend down and ask its name or where it lived Whilst the little one was sucking an embarrassed finger John Dene would be feeling in his pocket for a coin that a moment later would cause the youngster to gaze after him in speechless wonder clutching in his grimy hand a shilling or a half a crown Once he was observed leading a tearful little girl of about five years old up the Haymarket The child had apparently become lost and John Dene was seeking a policeman into whose care to consign her It became obvious to Malcolm Sage that John Dene s weak points were children and lame dogs Thompson who first had charge of the guarding of John Dene reported that one of the most assiduous of those who seemed to interest themselves in the movements of the Canadian was a little man in a grey suit with a pair of shifty eyes that never remained for more than a second on any one object He s clever sir Thompson had remarked to Sage clever as a vanload of monkeys and he takes cover like an alien he added grinning at his own joke Has he linked up with Naylor yet Thompson shook his head The old bird s too crafty for that sir he said He only comes up against the small fry This little chap in the grey suit is something bigger The officials at Department Z soon discovered that the chiefs of the organisation against which they were working never came into contact with each other Communication was established verbally by subordinates Another thing that added to the difficulties of Sage s task was that a man who had for some days been particularly active would suddenly drop out apparently being superseded by someone else with whom he had not previously been in contact Later the man who had dropped out would pick up an entirely different thread This meant innumerable loose ends all of which had to be followed up and then held until they began to develop along new lines It s a great game played slow Gladys Thompson remarked one day to Gladys Norman as they sat waiting for Malcolm Sage Slow cried the girl If this is slow what s fast Her initials are G N was the reply Malcolm Sage entered at the moment when Gladys had succeeded in making her colleague s hair look like that of an Australian aborigine CHAPTER X JOHN DENE GOES TO KEW And now we ll go to Kew and say how do you do to the rhododendrons cried Dorothy as she rolled up her napkin and slipped it into the silver ring that lay beside her plate I ll go and make myself smart and mother she paused at the door mind you put on your new hat that makes you look so wicked missus West smiled what Dorothy called her Saturday afternoon smile Half an hour later Dorothy was gazing at herself in the looking glass over the dining room mantelpiece With a sigh half of content half of rebelliousness she turned as missus West entered For a moment she stood looking enquiringly at her daughter Shall I do she demanded impudently I ve put on my very best undies and all But why Dorothy began missus West Oh I just wanted to feel best to day I wonder if John Dene notices legs mother she added inconsequently Really Dorothy began missus West with widening eyes Well I ve got rather nice legs and Oh but I m sure he doesn t We had fillets of sole done up in a most wonderful way the other day and he asked if it was cod He s got cod on the brain poor dear With a sigh she turned once more to regard herself in the looking glass If he could see me in this hat it would be all u p with Honest John and she laughed wickedly as she caught her mother s eye I wish you wouldn t use such expressions protested missus West gently and and She stopped and looked appealingly at her daughter I know I m a horrid little beast she cried turning quickly and I say outrageous things don t I Then with a sudden change of mood she added But why shouldn t a girl be pleased because she s got nice legs mother It s not nice for a young girl to talk about legs said missus West a little primly making the slightest possible pause before the last words But why mother persisted Dorothy It s it s not quite nice Well mine are anyway said Dorothy with a little grimace Now we must be off missus West merely sighed the sigh of one who fails to understand Mother dear said Dorothy observing the sigh if I didn t laugh I m afraid I should cry All the brightness had left her as she looked down at her mother I wonder why it is she added musingly To missus West Saturday afternoons were the oases in her desert of loneliness During the long and solitary days of the week she looked forward with the eagerness of a child to the excursions Dorothy never failed to plan for her entertainment If it were dull or wet there would be a matinee or the pictures if fine they would go to Kew Richmond or the Zoo It was an understood thing that missus West should know nothing about the arrangement until the actual day itself I think remarked Dorothy as they walked across Kew Bridge that I must be looking rather nice to day That s the third man who has given me the glad eye since Oh Dorothy I wish you wouldn t say such dreadful things protested missus West in genuine distress Slipping her arm through her mother s the girl squeezed it to her side I know I m an outrageous little beast she said but I love shocking you you dear funny little mother and and you know I love you don t you But suppose anyone heard you dear what would they think There was genuine concern in missus West s voice Oh I m dreadfully respectable with other people I never talk to John Dene about legs or glad eyes really Her eyes were dancing with mischief as she looked down at her mother Now I ll promise to be good for the rest of the day but how can a girl say prunes and prisms with a mouth like mine It s too wide for that and then there are those funny little cuts at the corners they are what make me wicked she announced with a wise little nod missus West sighed once more she had learned that it was useless to protest when her daughter was in her present mood They entered the Gardens and for an hour walked about absorbing their atmosphere of peace and warmth sunlight and shadow and the song of birds the war seemed very far away Presently they seated themselves by the broad walk leading to the large tropical greenhouse and gazed idly at the stream of passers by I wish I were a girl bird said Dorothy dreamily as she listened to the outpourings of a blackbird fluting from a neighbouring tree missus West smiled She was very happy It would be lovely to be made love to like that continued Dorothy so much nicer than Mother darling look she broke off suddenly clutching missus West s arm There s John Dene Following the direction of her daughter s eyes missus West saw a rather thick set man with hunched up shoulders looking straight in front of him a cigar gripped aggressively between his teeth He was walking in the direction that would bring him within a few feet of the seat on which they sat He ll never see us whispered Dorothy excitedly He never sees anything not even a joke Oh I wish he would she added I should so like you to meet him missus West did not speak she was gazing with interest at the approaching figure Mother dear do you think you could faint Dorothy s eyes were shining with excitement Faint echoed missus West Yes then I could call for help and John Dene would come and you would get to know him I m sure he ll never see us Hush dear he might hear what you are saying said missus West When John Dene was within a few feet of them Dorothy s sunshade fell forward seeming to bring him back with a start to his surroundings Instinctively he stepped forward picked up the sunshade and lifting his hat handed it to Dorothy For a moment there was a puzzled expression in his eyes followed instantly by one of recognition and then John Dene smiled and missus West liked him You see I found my way he said to Dorothy when she had introduced him to her mother and for some reason she blushed We often come here said Dorothy lamely conscious that her mother s eyes were upon her It s fine I ve just been looking around he remarked as he took a seat beside missus West We haven t anything like this in Can da he added generously I suppose you have parks though said missus West conversationally Sure he replied but this is way beyond anything we ve got You don t think it wants gingering up then mister Dene asked Dorothy demurely Dorothy expostulated missus West in shocked tones but John Dene merely looked at her at first without understanding and then seeing the point of her remark he smiled right into her eyes and again Dorothy blushed and dropped her eyes You see he said turning to missus West we re a new country and it doesn t matter a bean to us how a thing was done yesterday if some one comes along and tells us how we can do it better to morrow and we don t mind its getting known That s what she meant he added nodding in Dorothy s direction You must all feel delightfully free murmured missus West tactfully Free echoed John Dene in a tone of voice that seemed to suggest that in no place of the world was freedom so well understood as in the Dominion In Can da we re just about as free as drinks at an election Dorothy giggled but John Dene seemed to see nothing strange in the simile You see mother mister Dene thinks we re all hopelessly old fashioned said Dorothy with a mischievous side glance at John Dene then as he made no response she added mister Dene can do three or four different things at the same time and and She broke off and began to poke holes in the gravel with the point of her sunshade And what he demanded peremptorily Well we re not all so clever she concluded angry to feel herself flushing again Oh Suddenly Dorothy started forward A little boy who had been playing about in front of them for some time past had tripped and fallen on his face In an instant she was down on her knees striving to soothe the child s frightened cries and using her dainty lace edged handkerchief to staunch the blood that oozed from a cut on his cheek John Dene who had risen also stood watching her his usual expression changed to one of deep concern He looked from the child to Dorothy obviously struck by the change in her There was knowledge and understanding of children in the way in which she handled the situation he decided He also noticed that she seemed quite oblivious of the fact that she was kneeling on the rough gravel to the detriment of her pretty frock When eventually the mother of the child had led it away pacified by the attentions of Dorothy and the largesse of John Dene he turned to the girl You like them he asked nodding in the direction of the retreating infant I love them she said softly with a dreamy look Then catching John Dene s eye she blushed and John Dene smiled For the next half hour missus West and John Dene talked Dorothy remaining a listener The sympathy and gentleness of missus West led John Dene to talk in a way that surprised Dorothy accustomed to his habitual suspicion of strangers British strangers Say does this bother you any he enquired presently of missus West indicating the cigar from which he was puffing clouds of smoke Not at all said missus West striving to keep from choking I I like smoke Dorothy tittered in spite of herself at the expression of martyrdom on her mother s face John Dene turned to her enquiringly she developed her giggle into a cough But you like England mister Dene asked missus West by way of bridging the slight gulf that Dorothy s giggle had caused Sure said John Dene but I don t seem to be able to figure things out here as I did at T ronto Over there we re just as dead keen on winning this war as we are on keeping alive but here He filled in the hiatus with a volume of cigar smoke And don t you think we want to win the war mister Dene asked Dorothy Well some of those dancing lizards up at the Admiralty have a funny way of showing it was the grim rejoinder Please mister Dene what is a dancing lizard asked Dorothy demurely developing a design that she was making in the gravel with the end of her sunshade Dorothy expostulated missus West and then without giving him an opportunity of replying she continued but mister Dene I m sure they are all extremely patriotic and and Perhaps it s because I don t understand Englishmen he conceded Why the other day when Sir Lyster took me along to see mister Llewellyn John about one of the biggest things that s ever likely to come his way what do you think he talked about missus West shook her head with a smile that seemed to say it was not for her to suggest what First Lords talked of Pelicans Into that simple and unoffending word John Dene managed to precipitate whole dictionaries of contempt and disapproval Pelicans repeated missus West in surprise whilst Dorothy turned aside to hide the smile that was in danger of becoming a laugh Sure replied John Dene Birds with beaks like paddle blades he added as if to leave no room for misunderstanding But didn t Nero fiddle while Rome burned enquired Dorothy mischievously Maybe was the reply but I ll auction it didn t put the fire out Dorothy laughed You see mister Dene said missus West gently different countries have different traditions I ve no use for traditions was the uncompromising rejoinder It seems to me that in this country every one s out to try and prevent every one else from knowing what they re thinking I ve a rare picnic to find out what Sir Lyster s thinking when I m talking to him He bit savagely into the end of his cigar when turning suddenly to missus West he said Here will you and your daughter come and have some tea with me I suppose we can get tea around here he enquired apparently of the surrounding landscape It s very kind of you mister Dene said missus West sweetly We should be delighted shouldn t we Dorothy Yes mother said Dorothy without enthusiasm John Dene turned suddenly and looked at her Again he smiled Why I hadn t thought of that he said Thought of what she asked Why you see enough of me all the week without my butting in on your holidays Oh mister Dene cried Dorothy reproachfully how can you be so unkind Now we shall insist upon your taking us to tea won t we mother missus West smiled up at John Dene who had risen I m afraid we can t let you off now mister Dene she said sweetly Well I take it I shan t be tugging at the halter he said as they walked towards where the pagoda reared its slim un English body above the trees Having found a table and ordered tea John Dene looked about him appreciatively We haven t got anything like this in T ronto he repeated as if anxious to give full justice to the old country for at least one unique feature Thank you for that tribute said Dorothy demurely But it s true said John Dene turning to her But you don t always say a thing just because it s true do you she enquired Sure was the uncompromising response But continued Dorothy suppose one day I was looking very plain and unattractive would you tell me of it You couldn t This was said with such an air of conviction that Dorothy felt her cheeks burn and she lowered her eyes John Dene she decided could be extremely embarrassing His conversation seemed to consist of one pound notes he had no small change For some time she remained silent again leaving the conversation to John Dene and her mother He was telling her something of his early struggles and adventures first in Canada then in America and finally in Canada again How he had lost both his parents when a child and had been adopted by an uncle and aunt who apparently made no attempt to disguise the fact that they regarded him as an expensive nuisance At twelve he had run away determined to carve out his own career And I did it he concluded But how did you manage to do it in the time asked missus West I was thirty seven last fall I began at twelve You can do a rare lot in twenty five years if you don t happen to have too many ancestors hanging around he added grimly I think you are very wonderful was missus West s comment and John Dene knew she meant it If I d been in this country he remarked with a return of his old self assertiveness I d probably be driving a street car or picking up cigarette stubs Why enquired missus West puzzled at the remark You can t jump over a wall when you re wearing leaden soles on your boots was the terse rejoinder And haven t you sometimes missed not having a mother enquired missus West gently tears in her sympathetic eyes at the thought of this solitary man who had never known the comforts of a home She would have been proud of you Would she he enquired simply as he crumbled his cake and threw it to a flurry of birds that was hopefully fluttering on the fringe of the tables A son s success means more to a mother than anything else said missus West I seem to have been hustling around most of my time said John Dene I m always working when I m not asleep Perhaps I haven t felt it as much He left the sentence uncompleted but there was a look in his eyes that was not usually there missus West sighed with all a mother s sympathy for a lonely man Do you like birds mister Dene asked Dorothy Why sure he replied I like all animals That s what I don t understand about you over here he continued But we love animals said missus West I mean stag and fox hunting There was a hard note in his voice If I had a place in this country and anyone came around hunting foxes on my land there d be enough trouble to keep the whole place from going to sleep for the next month What should you do enquired Dorothy wickedly Well if anything had to be killed that day it wouldn t be the fox I m afraid you wouldn t be very popular with your neighbours said Dorothy I don t care a pea nut whether I m popular or not he said grimly but they d have to sort of learn that if they wanted to run foxes they must go somewhere else than on my land Dorothy decided that the English county that opened its gates to John Dene would have an unexpectedly exciting time Mentally she pictured him a revolver in each hand holding up a whole fox hunt the sudden reining in of horses the shouting of the huntsman and the master whilst the dogs streamed across the country after their quarry Perhaps it was as well she decided that John Dene had no intention of settling in England This has been fine said John Dene after a long silence during which the three seemed content to enjoy the beauty of the afternoon I wonder if you Then he paused as he looked across at missus West You wonder if I would what mister Dene she asked with a smile I was just going to invite you to dine with me continued John Dene only I remembered that your daughter probably has enough of me If you word all your invitations like that said Dorothy we shall accept every one shan t we mother missus West smiled Say that s bully he cried We ll get a taxi and drive back I d hate to spoil a good day by dining alone and he called for his bill That s the third time I ve seen that little man this afternoon said Dorothy lowering her voice as a man in a blue suit and light boots paused a few yards in front of them to read the label on a tree Isn t it funny how one runs across the same person time after time Sure said John Dene There was in his voice a note of grimness that neither Dorothy nor missus West seemed to detect At the main gates they secured a taxi As they hummed eastward Dorothy noticed that the heavy preoccupied look so characteristic of John Dene s face had lifted He smiled more frequently and looked about him not with that almost fierce penetrating glance to which she had been accustomed but with a look of genuine interest If it wouldn t bother you any said John Dene suddenly leaning across to missus West I d like to get an automobile and perhaps you d show me one or two places I ought to see I d be glad if He looked at her and smiled It s very kind of you began missus West Of course I don t want to butt in he said a little hastily Am I included in the invitation asked Dorothy quietly Sure he replied looking at her a little surprised Then seeing the twitching at the corners of her mouth he smiled Then that s fixed up he said I ll have an automobile for next Saturday and you shall arrange where we re to go But you mustn t joy ride said Dorothy suddenly remembering D O R A and all her Don t s Mustn t what demanded John Dene in the tone of a man who finds his pleasures suddenly threatened from an unexpected angle It s forbidden to use petrol for pleasure she explained John Dene made a noise in his throat that from her knowledge of him Dorothy recognised as a sign that someone was on the eve of being gingered up I ll get that automobile he announced and Dorothy knew that there was trouble impending for mister Blair And we ll have a picnic hamper shall we she cried excitedly Sure replied John Dene I ll order one Oh won t that be lovely mother she cried clapping her hands missus West smiled her pleasure Where are you taking us to dinner enquired Dorothy of John Dene The Ritzton he replied Oh but we re not dressed for that It s war time and I never dress he announced as if that settled the matter But began missus West hesitatingly Perhaps you d rather not come he began tentatively his disappointment too obvious to disguise Oh but we want to come said missus West only we re not in quite the right clothes for the Ritzton are we Don t you worry he reassured her then a moment later added that s what I m up against in this country Everybody s putting on the clothes they think other people expect them to wear If people don t like my clothes they can look where I m not sitting We re not going to win this war by wearing clothes he announced Then Dorothy started to gurgle The picture of endeavouring to win the war without clothes struck her as comical Dorothy admonished missus West I I was just thinking mother Thinking of what asked John Dene I was just wondering how Sir Lyster would look trying to win the war without clothes and she trailed off into a splutter of laughter Dorothy missus West turned to John Dene with a comical look of concern I m afraid my daughter is in one of her wilful moods to day mister Dene she explained She ll do as she is he announced with decision And again Dorothy felt her cheeks burn I like mister Dene announced missus West that night as she and Dorothy sat at the open window of the drawing room before going to bed So you approve of your future son in law mother mine I m so glad said Dorothy You mustn t say such things my dear expostulated missus West I m afraid I shall have to do the proposing though Dorothy added It was very strange meeting mister Dene to day remarked missus West half to herself Very remarked Dorothy and she hastened to talk of something else That night John Dene dreamed he was a little boy again and had fallen down and hurt himself and a beautiful lady had knelt beside him and kissed him He awakened with a start just as the lady had turned into Dorothy with her note book asking if there were any more letters 
7128_84121_000004_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XI
none	none	 THE STRANGENESS OF JOHN DENE
7128_84121_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Here I m being trailed 
none	none	mister Blair looked up from his writing table with a startled expression as John Dene burst into his room In entering a room John Dene gave the impression of first endeavouring to break through the panels and appearing to turn the handle only as an afterthought Trailed repeated mister Blair in an uncomprehending manner John Dene stood looking down at him accusingly as if he were responsible Yes trailed watched tracked shadowed followed bumped into trodden on snapped John Dene irritably He was annoyed that a man occupying an important position should not be able to grasp his meaning without repetition You know anything about it he demanded 
7128_84121_000011_000000	train-clean-360	mister Blair merely shook his head 
none	none	He in John Dene jerked his head in the direction of Sir Lyster s room
7128_84121_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 He s he s rather busy began mister Blair 
none	none	Oh shucks cried John Dene and striding across to the door he passed into Sir Lyster s room Morning he cried as Sir Lyster looked up from his table
7128_84121_000014_000002	train-clean-360	 Someone s following me around again he announced and I want to know whether it s you or them 
7128_84121_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Me or who queried Sir Lyster 
7128_84121_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Whether it s some of your boys or the other lot 
none	none	After a moment s reflection Sir Lyster seemed to grasp John Dene s meaning I ll make enquiry he said suavely
7128_84121_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you might suggest that it doesn t please me mightily 
7128_84121_000018_000001	train-clean-360	I don t like being trailed in this fashion so if it s any of your boys just you whistle em off 
7128_84121_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I doubt if you would be aware of the fact if we were having you shadowed mister Dene said Sir Lyster quietly and in any case it would be for your own safety 
none	none	When John Dene can t take care of himself was the reply he d better give up and start a dairy How is the Destroyer progressing enquired Sir Lyster with the object of changing the conversation Fine was the reply
7128_84121_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 Your man had better be ready on Friday 
7128_84121_000022_000002	train-clean-360	One of my boys ll pick him up Jim Grant s his name 
7128_84121_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir Goliath Maggie has appointed Commander Ryles said Sir Lyster 
none	none	Well let him be ready by Friday Grant ll pick him up on his way north Your man can t mistake him little chap with red hair all over him 
7128_84121_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Don t forget to call off your boys and with that John Dene was gone 
7128_84121_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Ten minutes later Sir Bridgman North found the First Lord sitting at his table apparently deep in thought 
none	none	I can see John Dene s been here laughed Sir Bridgman You and Blair both show all the outward visible signs of having been gingered up 
7128_84121_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Sir Lyster smiled feebly 
none	none	He felt that Sir Bridgman was wearing the joke a little threadbare He s been here about one of his men picking up Ryles on his way to Auchinlech said Sir Lyster A little man with red hair all over him was his description That seems pretty comprehensive remarked Sir Bridgman He d better go right through and pick up Ryles at Scapa 
7128_84121_000029_000002	train-clean-360	They ll probably appreciate him there 
none	none	It s rather dull for em I take it that mister Dene will follow in a day or two 
7128_84121_000030_000001	train-clean-360	It Sir Lyster paused then seeing that he was expected to finish his sentence he added It will really be something of a relief 
none	none	He quite upset Rickards a few days ago over some requisitions I ve never known him so annoyed Profane you mean laughed Sir Bridgman
7128_84121_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 What happened 
7128_84121_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Apparently he objected to being called a dancing lizard and told to quit his funny work Sir Lyster smiled as if finding consolation in the fact that another had suffered at the hands of John Dene 
7128_84121_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 It s nothing to what he did to poor old Rayner laughed Sir Bridgman A dear old chap you know but rather of the old blue water school 
none	none	Sir Lyster nodded He remembered that Admiral Rayner seemed to take a delight in reminding him of his civilian status 
7128_84121_000034_000002	train-clean-360	With Sir Lyster he was always as technical in his language as a midshipman back from his first cruise 
none	none	Rayner wanted to fit up the Toronto with an Archie gun and John Dene told him to cut it out Rayner protested that he was the better judge and all that sort of thing John Dene ended by telling poor old Rayner that next time he d better come in a dressing gown as he d be damned if gold bands went with the colour of his skin Rayner hasn t been civil to anyone since and Sir Bridgman laughed loudly I think my sympathies are with Rayner smiled Sir Lyster as Sir Bridgman moved towards the door
7128_84121_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 Frankly I don t like John Dene 
7128_84121_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t like him 
none	none	Why Well Sir Lyster hesitated for the fraction of a second he will persist in treating us as equals Now I call that damned nice of him and Sir Bridgman left the First Lord gazing at the panels of the door that closed behind him Whilst Sir Lyster and Sir Bridgman were discussing his unconventional methods with admirals John Dene had returned to his office and was working at high pressure Sometimes Dorothy wondered if his energy were like the widow s cruse Finishing touches had to be put to everything Instructions had to be sent to Blake as to where to pick up Grant and Commander Ryles and a hundred and one things rounded off as John Dene phrased it 
7128_84121_000041_000000	train-clean-360	During his absence Dorothy was to be at the office each day until lunch time to attend to any matters that might crop up 
none	none	If John Dene required anything it was arranged that he would wireless for it and Dorothy was to see that his instructions were carried out to the letter 
7128_84121_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The quality about John Dene that had most impressed Dorothy was his power of concentration 
none	none	He would become so absorbed in his work that nothing else seemed to have the power of penetrating to his brain 
7128_84121_000042_000002	train-clean-360	A question addressed to him that was unrelated to what was in hand he would ignore appearing not to have heard it on the other hand a remark germane to the trend of his thoughts would produce an instant reply 
none	none	It appeared as if his mind were so attuned as to throw off all extraneous matter 
7128_84121_000043_000000	train-clean-360	His quickness of decision and amazing vitality Dorothy found bewildering accustomed as she was to the more methodical procedure of a Government department 
none	none	When you know all you re likely to know about a thing then make up your mind he had said on one occasion He had no use for a man who would wait until to morrow afternoon to see how things looked then
7128_84121_000043_000002	train-clean-360	 I sleep on a bed not on an idea was another of his remarks that she remembered and once when commenting upon the cautiousness of Sir Lyster Grayne he had said The man who takes risks makes dollars 
none	none	Gradually Dorothy had fallen under the spell of John Dene s masterful personality She found herself becoming critical of others by the simple process of comparing them with the self centred John Dene She would smile at his eccentricities his intolerance his supreme belief in himself and his almost fanatical determination to ginger up any and every one in the British Empire whose misfortune it was to exist outside the Dominion of Canada At odd moments he told her much about Canada and how little that country was understood in England 
7128_84121_000046_000001	train-clean-360	How blind British statesmen were to the fact that the eyes of many Canadians were turned anxiously towards the great republic upon their borders how in the rapid growth of the U S A they saw a convincing argument in favour of a tightening of the bonds that bound the Dominion to the Old Country 
7128_84121_000047_000000	train-clean-360	When on the subject he would stride restlessly up and down the room snapping out short sharp sentences of protest and criticism 
none	none	His Imperialism was that of the enthusiast 
7128_84121_000047_000002	train-clean-360	To him a Canada lost to the British Empire meant a British Empire lost to itself 
7128_84121_000047_000003	train-clean-360	His great idea was to see the Old Country control the world by virtue of its power its brain and its justice 
none	none	His memory was amazing If Dorothy found her notes obscure and to complete a sentence happened to insert a word that was not the one he had dictated John Dene would note it as he read the letter with a little grunt sometimes of approval sometimes of doubt or correction 
7128_84121_000049_000000	train-clean-360	There were times when she felt as she expressed it to her mother as if she had been dining off beef essence and oxygen 
none	none	Sometimes she wondered where John Dene obtained all his amazing vitality 
7128_84121_000049_000002	train-clean-360	He was a small eater seeming to regard meals as a waste of time and he seldom drank anything but water 
7128_84121_000050_000000	train-clean-360	At the end of the day Dorothy would feel more tired than she had ever felt before but she had caught something of John Dene s enthusiasm which seemed to carry her along and defy the fatigues of the body 
none	none	Had it not been for the Saturday afternoons and the whole day s rest on Sunday she felt that she would not have been able to continue In his intolerance John Dene was sometimes amusing sometimes monotonous but always uncompromising One day Dorothy ventured a word of expostulation 
7128_84121_000051_000002	train-clean-360	He had just been expressing his unmeasured contempt for mister Blair 
7128_84121_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 You mustn t judge the whole British Navy by mister Blair she said looking up from her note book with a smile 
none	none	One fool makes many he had snapped decisively
7128_84121_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 So that if I prove a fool continued Dorothy quietly it convicts you of being a fool also 
7128_84121_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 But that s another transaction he objected 
none	none	Is it she asked and became absorbed in her notes 
7128_84121_000057_000000	train-clean-360	For some time John Dene had continued to dictate 
7128_84121_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Presently he stopped in the middle of a letter 
none	none	I hadn t figured it out that way he said Dorothy looked up at him in surprise then she realised that he was referring to her previous remark and that he was making the amende honorable 
7128_84121_000059_000000	train-clean-360	His manner frequently puzzled Dorothy 
7128_84121_000059_000001	train-clean-360	At times he seemed unaware of her existence at others she would on looking up from her work find him regarding her intently 
none	none	He showed entire confidence in her discretion allowing her access to documents of a most private and confidential nature 
7128_84121_000060_000000	train-clean-360	For week after week they worked incessantly 
none	none	Dorothy was astonished at the mass of detail requisite for the commissioning of a ship 
7128_84121_000060_000002	train-clean-360	Indents for stores and equipment had to be prepared for the Admiralty reports from Blake read and replied to requisitions for materials required had to be confirmed samples obtained examined and finally passed and instructions sent to Blake 
none	none	Strange documents they seemed to Dorothy rendered bewildering by their technicalities and flung at her in short jerky sentences as John Dene strode up and down the room If you could only see John Dene prancing mother mine said Dorothy one day to missus West and the demure Dorothy taking down whole dictionaries of funny words she never even knew existed you d be a proud woman missus West had smiled at her daughter as she sat at her favourite place on a stool at her feet
7128_84121_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 You see what John Dene wants is managing continued Dorothy sagely and no one understands how to do it except Sir Bridgman and me 
none	none	With us he ll stand without hitching
7128_84121_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Stand without what dear asked missus West 
7128_84121_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Without hitching laughed Dorothy 
7128_84121_000065_000001	train-clean-360	 That s one of his phrases 
none	none	It means that he s so tame that he ll eat out of your hand and she laughed gaily at the puzzled look on her mother s face mister Dene has been very kind said missus West presently I should miss him very much if he went away There was regret in her voice
7128_84121_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Now mother no poaching cried Dorothy 
7128_84121_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 John Dene is mine for keeps and if I let you come out with us and play gooseberry you mustn t try and cut me out because looking critically at her mother you could if you liked 
none	none	Nobody could help loving my little Victorian white mouse and she hugged her mother s knee missing the faint flush of pleasure that her words had aroused Finding his welcome assured John Dene had taken to joining Dorothy and her mother on their Saturday and Sunday excursions 
7128_84121_000068_000001	train-clean-360	The picnic had proved a great success and Dorothy had been surprised at the change in John Dene s manner 
none	none	The hard keen look of a man who is thinking how he can bring off some deal was entirely absent He seemed always ready to smile and be amused Once he had almost laughed 
7128_84121_000068_000005	train-clean-360	She was touched by the way in which he always looked after her mother his gentleness and solicitude 
none	none	Wessie darling Marjorie Rogers had said one day you re taming the bear 
7128_84121_000069_000001	train-clean-360	He ll dance soon but my dear his boots and the comical grimace that had accompanied the remark had caused Dorothy to laugh in spite of herself 
7128_84121_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 If ever I marry a man continued Marjorie it will be because of his boots 
none	none	Let him have silk socks and beautiful shoes or boots and I am as clay in his hands For such a man I would sin like a temporary
7128_84121_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Marjorie you re a little idiot cried Dorothy 
none	none	I saw John Dene a few days ago continued Marjorie Did you
7128_84121_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and I stopped him 
7128_84121_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 You didn t Marjorie There was incredulity in Dorothy s voice 
none	none	Didn t I though was the retort I gave him a hint too A hint Dorothy felt uncomfortable 
7128_84121_000077_000001	train-clean-360	The downrightness of Marjorie Rogers was both notorious and embarrassing 
7128_84121_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Well nonchalantly I just said that at the Admiralty men always kept their secretaries well supplied with flowers and chocolates 
none	none	You little beast cried Dorothy remembering the chocolates and flowers that had recently been reaching her
7128_84121_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 I should like to slap you 
none	none	Why not give me one of the chocolates instead said Marjorie imperturbably I saw the box directly I came in nodding at a large white and gold box that Dorothy had unsuccessfully striven to hide beneath a filing cabinet as Marjorie entered If it hadn t been for me you wouldn t have had them at all she added Presently she was munching chocolates contentedly whilst Dorothy found herself hating both the chocolates and flowers At the end of the fifth week Blake wrote that the Destroyer would be ready for sea on the following Wednesday The effect of the news upon John Dene was curious 
7128_84121_000081_000002	train-clean-360	Instead of appearing elated at the near approach of the fruition of his schemes he sat at his table for fully half an hour looking straight in front of him 
7128_84121_000081_000003	train-clean-360	When at last he spoke it was to enquire of Dorothy if she liked men in uniform 
7128_84121_000082_000000	train-clean-360	That afternoon he worked with unflagging industry 
none	none	It seemed to Dorothy that he was deliberately calling to mind every little detail that had for some reason or other temporarily been put aside He seemed to be determined to leave no loose ends Such matters as he was unable to clear up himself he gave elaborate instructions to Dorothy that would enable her to act without reference to him At half past five after a final glance round the room he leaned back in his chair I shall sleep some to night he remarked Don t you always sleep enquired Dorothy I sleep better when there are no loose ends tickling my brain was the reply 
7128_84121_000086_000000	train-clean-360	As Dorothy left the office a few minutes after six he called her back 
7128_84121_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 If I ve forgotten anything you d best remind me 
none	none	Mother she remarked when she got home that evening John Dene s the funniest man in all the world
7128_84121_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 Is he dear said missus West non committally 
none	none	Dorothy nodded her head with decision He wastes an awful lot of time and then he hustles like like well you know
7128_84121_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 How do you mean dear queried missus West 
7128_84121_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Well he ll sit sometimes for an hour looking at nothing 
7128_84121_000092_000001	train-clean-360	It s not complimentary when I m there she added 
none	none	Perhaps he s thinking suggested missus West Oh no Dorothy shook her head with decision He thinks while he s eating You can see him do it That s why he thinks salmon is pink cod 
7128_84121_000094_000004	train-clean-360	No John Dene is a very remarkable man but he d be very trying as a husband 
7128_84121_000095_000000	train-clean-360	Dorothy spoke lightly but during the last few days she had been asking herself what she would do when John Dene was gone 
none	none	Sometimes she would sit and ponder over it then with a movement of impatience she would plunge once more into her work What was John Dene to her that she should miss him 
7128_84121_000095_000003	train-clean-360	He was just her employer and in a few months he would go back to Canada and she would never see him again 
none	none	One morning she awakened crying from a dream in which John Dene had just said good day to her and stepped on a large steamer labelled To Canada That day she was almost brusque in her manner so much so that John Dene had asked her if she were not well The next morning when Dorothy arrived at the office she found John Dene sitting at his table As she entered he looked round stared at her for a moment and then nodded and as if as an after thought added Good morning Dorothy passed into her own room 
7128_84121_000097_000001	train-clean-360	She was a little puzzled 
none	none	This was the first morning that John Dene had been there before her As she came out with her note book she looked at him closely conscious of something in his manner that was strange something she could not altogether define His voice seemed a little husky and he lacked the quick bird like movements so characteristic of him 
7128_84121_000099_000000	train-clean-360	She made no remark however merely seating herself in her customary place and waited for letters 
none	none	He drew from his pocket some notes and began to dictate Never before had he used notes when dictating 
7128_84121_000101_000001	train-clean-360	Several times she glanced at him and noted that he appeared to be reading from the manuscript rather than dictating but she decided that he had probably written out rough drafts in order to assure accuracy 
7128_84121_000101_000002	train-clean-360	His voice was very strange 
none	none	Did you sleep well last night mister Dene she enquired during a pause in the dictation
7128_84121_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 Sleep well he repeated looking up at her I always sleep well 
7128_84121_000104_000000	train-clean-360	Dorothy was startled 
7128_84121_000104_000001	train-clean-360	There was something in the glance and the brusque tone that puzzled her 
7128_84121_000104_000002	train-clean-360	Both were so unlike John Dene 
none	none	She had mentally decided that he spoke to her as he spoke to no one else She had compared his inflection when addressing her with that he adopted to others even so important a person as Sir Bridgman North Now he spoke gruffly as if he were irritated at being spoken to 
7128_84121_000105_000000	train-clean-360	Apparently he sensed what was passing through her mind for he turned to her again and said 
7128_84121_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 I m not feeling very well this morning Miss West I 
none	none	Then he hesitated Perhaps you didn t sleep very well she suggested mischievously
7128_84121_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 No I m afraid that s what it was he acknowledged Dorothy s eyes opened just a little in surprise 
none	none	A minute ago he had stated that he always slept well Either John Dene was mad or ill and Dorothy continued to take down greatly puzzled 
7128_84121_000108_000003	train-clean-360	Had he been drugged 
7128_84121_000108_000004	train-clean-360	The thought caused her to pause in her work and glance up at him 
none	none	He certainly seemed vague and uncertain and then he looked so strange When he had dictated for about half an hour John Dene handed her a large number of documents to copy telling her that there would not be any more letters that day 
7128_84121_000109_000001	train-clean-360	To her surprise he picked up his hat and announced that he would not be back until five o clock to sign the letters 
none	none	Never before had he missed lunching at his office 
7128_84121_000109_000003	train-clean-360	Dorothy was now convinced that something was wrong 
none	none	Everything about him seemed strange and forced 
7128_84121_000110_000000	train-clean-360	Once or twice she caught him looking at her furtively but immediately she raised her eyes he hastily shifted his as if caught in some doubtful act 
7128_84121_000111_000000	train-clean-360	At twelve o clock lunch arrived and Dorothy had to confess to herself that it was a lonely and unsatisfactory meal 
none	none	At five o clock John Dene returned and signed the letters with a rubber stamp which he had recently adopted
7128_84121_000113_000000	train-clean-360	 When are you going away mister Dene asked Dorothy 
7128_84121_000114_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know he responded gruffly 
7128_84121_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 I merely asked because two people on the telephone enquired when you were going away 
none	none	And what did you say
7128_84121_000117_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I just said what you told me 
none	none	A man called this afternoon also with the same question For a moment he looked at her then turning on his heel said good evening and with a nod walked out 
7128_84121_000119_000000	train-clean-360	Dorothy had expected him to make some remark about these enquiries She knew that John Dene had no friends in London and the questions as to when he was going away had struck her as strange 
none	none	The next day was a repetition of the first 
7128_84121_000120_000001	train-clean-360	A few letters were dictated a sheaf of documents handed to her to copy and John Dene disappeared 
7128_84121_000120_000002	train-clean-360	Again lunch was brought for her which she ate alone and at five o clock he came in and signed the letters 
none	none	By this time Dorothy was convinced that he was ill The strain of the past few weeks had evidently been telling on him 
7128_84121_000121_000002	train-clean-360	When he had signed the last letter she bluntly enquired if he felt better 
7128_84121_000122_000000	train-clean-360	 Better he interrogated 
7128_84121_000122_000001	train-clean-360	 I haven t been ill 
none	none	I thought you didn t seem quite well said Dorothy hesitatingly but he brushed aside the enquiry by picking up his hat and bidding her good evening Dorothy was feeling annoyed and a little hurt and preserved an attitude of businesslike brevity in all her remarks to John Dene If he chose to adopt the attitude of the uncompromising employer she on her part would humour him by becoming an ordinary employee 
7128_84121_000124_000002	train-clean-360	Still she had to confess to herself that the old pleasure in her work had departed 
none	none	Hitherto she had looked forward to her arrival at the office the coming of John Dene their luncheons together and the occasional little chats that were sandwiched in between her work She had become deeply interested in the Destroyer and what it would achieve in the war She had been flattered by the confidence that John Dene had shown hi her discretion and had felt that she was doing her bit Again the sense of being behind the scenes pleased her She was conscious of knowing secrets that were denied even to Cabinet Ministers The members of the War Cabinet knew less than she did about the Destroyer and what was expected of it John Dene was a man who did everything thoroughly 
7128_84121_000126_000001	train-clean-360	If he trusted anyone he did it implicitly if he distrusted anyone he did it uncompromisingly 
7128_84121_000126_000002	train-clean-360	Where he liked he liked to excess where he disliked he disliked to the elimination of all good qualities 
none	none	Half measures did not exist for John Dene of Toronto When Dorothy discovered that all the old intimacy had passed away and John Dene had become merely an employer treating her as a secretary she was conscious that the glamour had fallen from her work Somehow or other the Destroyer had receded into something impersonal whereas hitherto it had appeared to her as if she had been in some way or other intimately associated with it 
7128_84121_000128_000000	train-clean-360	It was all very strange and very puzzling she told herself 
none	none	Sometimes she wondered if she had done anything to annoy him Then she told herself that there was something more than personal pique in his manner 
7128_84121_000128_000003	train-clean-360	His whole bearing seemed to have changed as if he had decided to regard her merely as a piece of mechanism just as he did the typewriter or his office chair 
7128_84121_000129_000000	train-clean-360	It was at this period of her reasoning that Dorothy discovered her dignity 
7128_84121_000129_000001	train-clean-360	From that time her attitude was that of the injured woman yet perfect secretary 
7128_84121_000129_000002	train-clean-360	Her sense of humour had deserted her and she arrived at the office and left it very much upon her dignity 
none	none	Even missus West noticed the difference in her manner and at last enquired if anything were wrong or if she were unwell but Dorothy reassured her with a hug and a kiss and for the rest of that evening had been particularly bright and vivacious When missus West mentioned the name of John Dene Dorothy did not pursue the topic although missus West failed to notice that she was switched off to other subjects At the end of the week she noticed that John Dene handed her the week s salary in notes Hitherto it had been his custom to place the money in an envelope and put it on her table She concluded that this new method was to impress upon her that she was a dependent and that the old relationship between them had been severed 
7128_84121_000131_000003	train-clean-360	That evening Dorothy was always paid on the Friday evening she held her head very high when she left the office 
none	none	If mister John Dene required decorum then he should have it in plenty from his secretary The next morning and the Monday following Dorothy was very much on her dignity 
7128_84121_000132_000001	train-clean-360	She seemed suddenly to have become imbued with all the qualities of the perfect secretary 
none	none	No hint of a smile was allowed to wanton across her features she was grave ceremonial efficient 
7128_84121_000132_000003	train-clean-360	She worked harder than ever and when she had finished the tasks John Dene set her she manufactured others so that her time should be fully occupied 
none	none	For a day and a half she laboured to show John Dene that she was offended but apparently he was oblivious not only of having offended her but of the fact that she was endeavouring to convey to him the change that had come about in their relations On the Monday evening he did not return to sign his letters until nearly six By that time Dorothy was almost desperate in her desire to show this obtuse man that she was annoyed with him 
7128_84121_000134_000002	train-clean-360	She felt at the point of tears when he bade her good night and left the office just as Big Ben was booming out the hour 
none	none	She would go home and forget all about the stupid creature Dorothy decided as she hastily put on her coat and dug the hat pins through her hat On reaching the street she saw John Dene standing at the corner of Charles Street 
7128_84121_000135_000002	train-clean-360	For a moment she thrilled 
none	none	Was he waiting for her 
7128_84121_000135_000004	train-clean-360	No he was looking in the opposite direction apparently deep in thought 
7128_84121_000135_000005	train-clean-360	She saw a taxi draw up beside him 
7128_84121_000135_000006	train-clean-360	The driver a little man with a grey moustache Dorothy remembered to have seen him several times crawling about on the look out for fares 
none	none	The taxi stopped and the man bent towards John Dene 
7128_84121_000135_000008	train-clean-360	Dorothy stood and watched 
none	none	John Dene was right in her line of route to the Piccadilly Tube and she did not wish him to see her 
7128_84121_000136_000000	train-clean-360	For a moment John Dene seemed to hesitate then with a word to the driver he opened the door and got in 
none	none	Suddenly Dorothy remembered Colonel Walton s warning 
7128_84121_000136_000002	train-clean-360	Impulsively she started forward just as the taxi started and a moment later whizzed swiftly past her 
7128_84121_000136_000003	train-clean-360	John Dene was evidently in a hurry 
none	none	At that moment her attention was distracted by shouts and a smash A small run about car had suddenly dashed across Regent Street from the west side of Charles Street and crashed into the forepart of another taxi A crowd gathered a policeman arrived and she had a vision of an angry taxi driver another man pointing to the roadway as if the blame lay there whilst the passenger from the taxi was running towards the Florence Nightingale statue shouting and waving his arms at the vehicles passing along Pall Mall 
7128_84121_000137_000000	train-clean-360	Slowly Dorothy turned and pursued her way up Regent Street 
none	none	She was tired and and oh it was so stupid going on living That night as she was undressing she remembered the passenger from the second taxi Why had he been so interested in the taxi that was bearing John Dene away and why had he tried to signal to other vehicles passing along Pall Mall He had seemed greatly excited Above all why had John Dene taken a taxi when he had been warned against it CHAPTER XII THE DESTROYER READY FOR SEA James Blake stood in the bows of the Toronto gazing down at the long cigar shaped object that lay like a huge grey cocoon reposing in her bowels The morrow would see the Destroyer floated out to carry her three hundred odd feet of menace into the blues and greys of the ocean 
7128_84122_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Blake was a man upon whom silence had descended as a blight heavy of build slow of thought ponderous of movement he absorbed all and apparently gave out nothing 
7128_84122_000001_000001	train-clean-360	His most acute emotion he expressed by fingering the right hand side of his ragged beard whilst his eyes seemed to smoulder as his thoughts slowly took shape 
none	none	As he gazed down at the grey shape of the Destroyer s hull there was in his eyes a strange look of absorption For nearly two years he had lived for the Destroyer It had been wife and family to him home and holiday labour and recreation food and drink 
7128_84122_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Nothing else mattered because nothing else was 
none	none	The war existed only in so far as it was concerned with the Destroyer It was the mise en scene for this wonder boat 
7128_84122_000002_000006	train-clean-360	It was to be her setting just as a stage is the setting for a play 
none	none	As he gazed down at her he fumbled in the pocket of his pilot jacket and drew forth a cigar one of a box that John Dene had sent him Slowly and deliberately he pulled out his jack knife cut off the end and taking a good grip of the cigar with his teeth lighted it all without once raising his eyes from the Destroyer 
7128_84122_000004_000000	train-clean-360	As he puffed clouds of smoke for the breeze to pick up and scurry off with to the west he thought lovingly of the work of the last two years of the last month in particular 
none	none	Never had men worked as had James Blake and his boys It was not for country or for gain that they slaved and sweated it was not patriotism or pride of race that caused them to work until forced by sheer inability to keep awake to lie down for a few hours sleep always within sound of their comrades hammers often beside the Destroyer herself 
7128_84122_000004_000002	train-clean-360	It was the Boss for whom they worked 
7128_84122_000004_000003	train-clean-360	They were his men and this was their boat 
7128_84122_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Every time John Dene wrote to Blake there was always a message for the boys I know the boys will show these Britishers what Canada can do he would write or see that the boys get all they want and plenty to smoke Remembering was John Dene s long suit and his men would do anything for the Boss 
7128_84122_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Blake had not spared himself 
7128_84122_000005_000001	train-clean-360	When not engaged in the work of overseeing he had thrown off his coat and worked with the most vigorous 
7128_84122_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He seemed never to sleep or rest 
none	none	Every detail of the Destroyer s construction he carried in his head Plans there had been in his shack but what were the use of plans to a man who had every line every bolt and nut engraved upon his brain 
7128_84122_000005_000005	train-clean-360	He had them merely for reference 
7128_84122_000006_000000	train-clean-360	And now all was ready 
none	none	That morning the Destroyer had been floated into the Toronto to see that everything on the mother ship was in order Once floated out again there remained only the taking on board stores and munitions These lay piled upon the Toronto s deck ready at the word of command to be transferred to the Destroyer In design the Destroyer was very similar to the latest form of submarine three hundred ten fort six ins in length she had a breadth of twenty six fort six ins 
7128_84122_000007_000003	train-clean-360	amidships tapering to a point fore and aft 
none	none	She carried two ordinary torpedo tubes and mounted two three in 
7128_84122_000007_000005	train-clean-360	guns but these were in the nature of an auxiliary armament 
none	none	Her main armament consisted of eight pneumatic tubes two in the bows two in the stern one on either bow and one on either beam 
7128_84122_000007_000007	train-clean-360	These fired small arrow headed missiles rather like miniature torpedoes fitted with lance heads for cutting through nets 
7128_84122_000007_000008	train-clean-360	They had sufficient power to penetrate the plates of a submarine and were furnished with an automatic detonator which caused the bursting charge to explode three seconds after impact 
none	none	The charge was sufficient to blow a hole in the side of a U boat large enough to ensure its immediate destruction 
7128_84122_000008_000000	train-clean-360	These projectiles were rendered additionally deadly by the fact that their heads became automatically magnetic as they sped through the water 
7128_84122_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Thus the target against which they were launched achieved its own destination 
7128_84122_000008_000002	train-clean-360	They were fitted with small gyroscopes to keep them straight until the magnetic heads began to exert a dominating influence 
7128_84122_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Amidships was the conning tower with its four searchlights so arranged as to be capable of being used singly or together 
7128_84122_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Thus it was possible to illuminate the waters for half a mile in every direction 
none	none	Above the conning tower were two collapsible periscopes and beneath it the central ballast beneath which lay the charge of T N T that John Dene had boasted would send the Destroyer to Kingdom Come should she ever be in danger of capture 
7128_84122_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Abaft the conning tower were the engines a switchboard and finally the berths of the engine room staff 
none	none	For ard of the conning tower were the berths of the crew and still further for ard were those of John Dene and the officers John Dene s invention of a new and lighter storage battery had enabled him to control the Destroyer entirely by electricity 
7128_84122_000010_000003	train-clean-360	She possessed an endurance of fifteen hundred miles and as for the most part she held a watching brief this would mean that she could remain at sea for a month or more 
7128_84122_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Her speed submerged was fourteen knots which gave her a superiority over the fastest German craft and she could remain submerged for two days 
7128_84122_000011_000001	train-clean-360	She could then recharge her compressed air chambers without coming to the surface by means of a tube through which fresh air could be sucked from the surface and the foul discharged 
7128_84122_000011_000002	train-clean-360	These were weighted and floated in various parts in such a manner that they could be thrown out in a diagonal direction 
none	none	The object of this was to protect the Destroyer from depth charges in the event of her whereabouts being discovered by an enemy ship which would render it dangerous for her to come to the surface The Destroyer s a submarine John Dene had remarked and submarines fight and live under water and not on it Consequently in designing the Destroyer he had first considered the special requirements entailed by the novelty of the methods she would employ She had deck guns periscopes and torpedo tubes but they were in every sense subsidiary to those qualities that rendered her unique among boats capable of submersion viz her searchlights and her magnetic projectiles 
7128_84122_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Under water there were only two dangers capable of threatening her mines and depth charges 
none	none	Properly handled and without mishap there was no reason why she should ever return to the surface except in the neighbourhood of her own harbour Her most remarkable device however was the microphone so sensitive that with the aid of her searchlights it would enable the Destroyer to account for any U boat that came within seven or eight miles of where she was lying As Blake stood surveying his handiwork he was joined by his second in command Jasper Quinton known among his intimates as Spotty a nickname due to the irregularity of his complexion Quinton was an Englishman who had gone to Canada to make his fortune as a mining engineer Soon after war broke out he had successfully applied to John Dene for a job and had acquitted himself so well that John Dene had taken him into his confidence in regard to the Destroyer and Jasp as he called him had proved a cinch John Dene made few mistakes about men and none about women the one he understood the other he avoided Spotty Quint on spat meditatively upon the hull of the Destroyer He was a man to whom words came infrequently and with difficulty but he could spit a whole gamut of emotions anger contempt approval indifference all were represented by salivation 
7128_84122_000016_000001	train-clean-360	If he were forced to speech he built up his phrases upon the foundation of a single word ruddy but apparently with entire unconsciousness that it had its uses as an oath 
none	none	To Spotty Quinton John Dene was the ruddy boss his invention the ruddy Destroyer the enemy the ruddy Hun the ocean the ruddy water He served out his favourite adjective with entire impartiality 
7128_84122_000016_000003	train-clean-360	He no more meant reproach to the Hun than to John Dene 
7128_84122_000016_000004	train-clean-360	He tacitly accepted them both the one as a power for evil the other as a power for good 
none	none	As Quinton silently took up a position by his side Blake turned and looked at him interrogatingly Ruddy masterpiece exclaimed Quinton spitting his admiration 
7128_84122_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Blake gazed upon the unprepossessing features of his subordinate and tugging a cigar from his pocket handed it to him 
none	none	Silently Spotty took the cigar bit off the end and spat it together with his thanks into the hold of the Toronto 
7128_84122_000020_000001	train-clean-360	He then proceeded to light the cigar 
7128_84122_000020_000002	train-clean-360	The two men turned and made their way to the cabin allotted to them as a sort of office of works 
none	none	Both were thinking of the morrow when the Destroyer would be floated out from the parent ship ready for her first voyage In addition to John Dene and his second in command she would carry Commander Ryles who had a distinguished record in submarine warfare 
7128_84122_000020_000005	train-clean-360	He would represent the Admiralty 
none	none	John Dene had experienced some difficulty at the Admiralty over the personnel of the Destroyer s crew but he had stood resolutely to his guns and the Authorities had capitulated 
7128_84122_000020_000007	train-clean-360	This was largely due to Sir Bridgman North s wise counsels 
7128_84122_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 When he remarked I have to choose between giving John Dene his head and being gingered up I prefer the first 
7128_84122_000021_000001	train-clean-360	It s infinitely less painful 
7128_84122_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Sir Lyster had been inclined to expostulate with his colleague upon the manner in which he gave way to John Dene s demands 
none	none	Sir Lyster felt that the dignity of his office was being undermined by the blunt spoken Canadian Do you not think he had remarked in the early days of the descent of John Dene upon the Admiralty that it would be better for us to stand up to mister Dene 
7128_84122_000023_000001	train-clean-360	I think the effect would be salutary 
7128_84122_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 For us undoubtedly Sir Bridgman had said drily 
7128_84122_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Personally I object to being gingered up 
7128_84122_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Look at poor Blair 
7128_84122_000024_000003	train-clean-360	There you see the results of the process 
7128_84122_000024_000004	train-clean-360	He ceased to be an Imperialist within twenty four hours of John Dene s coming upon the scene 
7128_84122_000024_000005	train-clean-360	Now he goes about with a hunted look in his eyes and a prayer in his heart that he may get through the day without being gingered up by the unspeakable John Dene 
none	none	I really think I shall have to speak to mister Dene about Sir Lyster had begun Take my advice and don t was the retort
7128_84122_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Blair and John Dene represent two epochs Blair is the British Empire that was John Dene is the British Empire that is to be 
7128_84122_000026_000002	train-clean-360	It s like one of Nelson s old three deckers against a super dreadnought and Blair ain t the dreadnought 
7128_84122_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 He is certainly a remarkable man Sir Lyster had admitted conventionally referring to John Dene 
none	none	He s more than that Grayne said Sir Bridgman he s the first genus patriot produced by the British Empire possibly by the world he added drily proceeding to light a cigarette Think of it he added half to himself he could have got literally millions for his invention from any of the big naval powers yet he chooses to give it to us for nothing and what s more he s not out for honours 
7128_84122_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Ginger or no ginger John Dene s a man worth meeting Grayne on my soul he is 
none	none	Blake and Quinton seated themselves one on either side of the little wooden table in the cabin of the Toronto that answered as an office of works Blake looking straight in front of him Quinton absorbed in smoking and expectoration 
7128_84122_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Presently Blake took from his pocket a large silver watch gazed at it with deliberation then raising his eyes nodded to his companion 
none	none	With a final expectoration Spotty rose and left the cabin walked over to the starboard side and climbed down into the motor boat that lay there manned by her crew of three men 
7128_84122_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Without a word the man with the boat hook pushed off the motor was started and the boat throbbed her way to the entrance to the little harbour 
none	none	The crew of the Destroyer had learned from Blake the virtue of silence For half an hour the motor boat tore her way over the waters heading due south 
7128_84122_000030_000003	train-clean-360	From time to time Quinton gazed ahead through a pair of binoculars 
none	none	Starb d he called to the helmsman as he lowered the glass from his eyes for the twentieth time then by way of explanation added The ruddy chaser Steady he added a moment later 
7128_84122_000032_000000	train-clean-360	A few minutes later a cloud of white spray indicated the approach of a small craft travelling at a high rate of speed 
7128_84122_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Quinton continued to watch the approaching boat until the humped shoulders of a submarine chaser were distinguishable through the spume 
7128_84122_000032_000002	train-clean-360	As the boats neared each other he gave a quick command to the engineer and the speed of the motor boat decreased 
7128_84122_000032_000003	train-clean-360	At the same moment the curtain of spray that screened the on coming chaser died down her fine and sinister lines becoming discernible 
none	none	Dexterously the helmsman brought the motor boat alongside the larger vessel and without a word there stepped on board a little man wearing motor goggles and a red beard of rather truculent shape and a naval commander whom the stranger introduced to Quinton as Commander Ryles With a nod to the man with the boathook and a wave of his arm to those aboard the chaser James Grant took his seat together with Commander Ryles beside Quinton the motor boat pushed off and with a graceful sweep turned her nose northwards and proceeded to run up her own track 
7128_84122_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Grant and Quinton continued to talk in undertones Grant asking questions Quinton answering with great economy of words and prodigious salivation 
7128_84122_000034_000001	train-clean-360	The chaser steering a south westerly course was soon out of sight

gaiety as she rose from the breakfast table missus West looked up quickly Why she asked a falter in her voice He s going away announced Dorothy indifferently as she pinned on her hat To Canada asked missus West anxiously No replied Dorothy in a toneless voice he s going away on business Oh missus West s relief was too obvious for dissimulation He won t be back for months continued Dorothy relentlessly and I shall spend my time in counting my fingers and flirting with Sir Bridgman Good byeeeeee and brushing a kiss on her mother s cheek she was gone leaving missus West puzzled more by her manner than the announcement she had made Arrived at the office Dorothy cleared up what remained of the previous night s work ordered luncheon tidied things generally and then sat down to wait From time to time she glanced at the watch upon her wrist at first mechanically then curiously finally anxiously For the last few days she had been more concerned than she was prepared to admit by John Dene s strangeness of manner She was hurt that he should now treat her as if she were a stranger whereas hitherto he had been so confidential and friendly Womanlike she ascribed it to illness He had been over working He was a man of such impulsive energy so full of ideas so impatient of delays He seemed always to want to do everything at the moment he thought of it Incidentally he expected others to be imbued with his own vitality He had worn himself out she decided or was it that he was being drugged Time after time the idea had suggested itself to her only to be dismissed as melodramatic Sometimes there would cross her mind a suspicion so strange so fantastic that she would brush it aside as utterly ridiculous Luncheon arrived and no John Dene Dorothy made an indifferent meal One o clock passed two o clock came She had visions of him lying in his room at the hotel too ill to summon assistance She determined upon action and rang up the Ritzton To her enquiry as to whether or no mister John Dene were in came the reply that he was not Would they find out at what time he left the hotel It was his secretary speaking Yes they would if Dorothy would hold on At the end of what seemed an age came the reply mister John Dene had left the hotel on the previous morning and had not since returned With a clatter the receiver fell from Dorothy s hand It was something worse than illness then that had kept John Dene from his office This she saw clearly Probably he was lying dead in some out of the way spot a victim of the hidden hand She felt physically sick at the thought He was such a splendid man she told herself Ready to give everything for nothing The sort of man that made for victory Suddenly she remembered the episode of the taxi on the previous evening and became galvanised to action What a fool she had been Seizing the receiver of the private line to the Admiralty she demanded to be put through to mister Blair Presently she heard his mellow patient voice No he had heard nothing of John Dene nor had he seen him for several days There was a note of plaintive gratitude in mister Blair s voice but Dorothy was too worried to notice it Putting up the receiver she snatched up her hat jabbed the pins through it one of them into her head and almost throwing herself into her coat dashed down the stairs and literally ran across Waterloo Place down the Duke of York s steps into the Admiralty She passed swiftly in and up to mister Blair s room into which she burst with a lack of ceremony that convinced him she had already imbibed the qualities that made John Dene the terror of his existence I want to see Sir Lyster at once she panted mister Blair looked up at her in surprise He s engaged just now Miss West he said mildly Is there anything I can do It doesn t matter whether he s engaged you must go into him at once mister Blair and tell him I must see him mister Blair still continued to gaze at her with bovine wonder Oh you stupid creature Dorothy stamped her foot in her impatience Then with a sudden movement she made for Sir Lyster s door knocked and entered leaving mister Blair gazing before him marvelling that so short an association with John Dene should have produced such startling results However it was for Sir Lyster to snub her now and he resumed his work Sir Lyster Sir Bridgman North and Admiral Heyworth were bending over a table on which a large plan lay spread out Sir Lyster was the first to look up at the sight of the flushed and excited girl his gaze became fixed Sir Bridgman and Admiral Heyworth followed the direction of his eyes to where Dorothy stood with heaving breast and fear in her eyes mister Dene has disappeared she gasped without any preliminary apology The devil exclaimed Sir Bridgman Admiral Heyworth jumped to his feet Sir Bridgman rose and placed a chair for Dorothy into which she sank Then she told her story concluding with It s all my fault for not doing something about the taxi The three men listened without interruption When she had concluded they looked anxiously from one to the other It was Sir Bridgman who broke the silence We had better get Walton here Sir Lyster nodded and going to the door requested mister Blair to ask Colonel Walton to come round at once on a matter of importance Then it was that Sir Bridgman seemed to notice Dorothy s excited state With that courtesy that made him a great favourite with women he poured out a glass of water from a carafe on a side table and handed it to her With her eyes she thanked him Sir Bridgman decided that she was an extremely pretty girl The water seemed to company ordinate Dorothy s ideas For the first time she appreciated that she had unceremoniously burst into the private room of the First Lord of the Admiralty I I m very sorry she faltered but it seemed so important and mister Blair wouldn t let me come in Sir Lyster nodded his approval of her action You did quite right Miss West said Dorothy Miss West continued Sir Lyster There are occasions when He hesitated for a word John Dene s methods are best suggested Sir Bridgman Sir Lyster smiled but there was no answering smile in Dorothy s eyes What do you think has happened she asked looking from one to the other It s impossible to say began Sir Lyster it s it s Spies she said with a catch in her voice I m sure of it They ve drugged him They tried to poison our food Poison your food repeated Sir Lyster uncomprehendingly Yes said Dorothy and she proceeded to tell how it came about that the luncheon and dinners were supplied from an anonymous source That s Walton said Admiral Heyworth and the other nodded For a few minutes they sat in silence all waiting for the arrival of Colonel Walton When the telephone bell rang Sir Lyster started perceptibly Taking up the receiver from the instrument he listened for a few seconds Show him in he said then turning to the others he explained Walton is out but Sage is here Good said Sir Bridgman sometimes Jack is better than his master Sir Lyster looked at him meaningly and then at Dorothy With perfect self possession Malcolm Sage entered gave a short jerky bow and without invitation drew a chair up opposite to where Dorothy was sitting For a moment he gazed at her and saw the anxiety in her eyes Don t be alarmed he said quietly the situation is well in hand There was the ghost of a smile about the corners of his mouth Is he safe enquired Dorothy leaning forward whilst the three men looked at Sage as if not quite sure of his sanity I can only repeat what I have said replied Sage the situation is well in hand But how the devil began Sir Bridgman I should like to ask Miss West a few questions said Sage Sir Bridgman subsided Why did you come here he asked turning to Dorothy mister Dene didn t come this morning I waited until past two then I rang up the Ritzton she paused Go on said Sage They told me he had not been back since yesterday morning And then enquired Sage I rang up mister Blair He had heard nothing so I thought I had better come round and and I m afraid I burst in here very rudely mister Blair You did quite right Miss West said Sir Lyster Why didn t you act before Dorothy felt Sage s eyes were burning through her brain so intent was his gaze I had forgotten about the taxi I I thought he might be unwell said Dorothy Why Well she began and then paused Go on said Sage encouragingly He has seemed rather strange for some days she said his memory was very bad As a rule he has a wonderful memory and never makes a note How was his memory bad He seemed to forget what he had written and was always having letters turned up Sage nodded Go on he said Then she continued he seemed to want always to put things off He was undecided so unlike his normal self Most of the things he asked me to attend to And that made you think he was ill suggested Sage Yes she said that and other things What other things Dorothy screwed up her eyebrows her head on one side as if striving to find words to express what was in her mind His manner was strange she began It is very difficult to give instances but previously he had always been so pleasant and and Unconscious of himself shall we say suggested Sage That s it she said brightly He was just mister Dene Afterwards he seemed to be always watching me as if not quite sure who I was It was almost uncanny I thought perhaps She hesitated What That he was being drugged she concluded reluctantly When did you first notice this Let me see said Dorothy This is Tuesday It was on Thursday morning that I first noticed it What struck me then was that he said Good morning when he came in And what did he usually say enquired Sage He used to say morning or what really sounded more like morn she said with a smile Thank you said Sage Unless these gentlemen have any further questions to put to you there is nothing more to be done at present But is he she began then she paused I should not be unnecessarily alarmed Miss West if I were you said Sage Above all keep your own counsel mister Dene disapproves of people who talk I know said Dorothy rising and drawing herself up with dignity I regard your prompt action as highly commendable Miss West said Sir Lyster You will of course continue in attendance at the office until you hear further If anything unusual transpires please get into touch with me immediately even to the extent of he paused a moment Bursting in as you did just now said Sir Bridgman with a laugh It s the real John Dene manner Exactly said Sir Lyster Sir Lyster conducted Dorothy into mister Blair s room mister Blair he said if Miss West ever wishes to see me urgently please tell me no matter with whom I am engaged If I do not happen to be in Sir Bridgman will see her or failing that get through to Colonel Walton or to mister Sage Sir Lyster bowed to Dorothy and returned to his room mister Blair blinked his eyes in bewilderment the influence of John Dene upon the British Admiralty was most extraordinary I don t understand the drift of all your questions mister Sage said Sir Lyster resuming his seat Malcolm Sage turned his eyes upon the First Lord I will explain that later sir he said but for the present I must ask your indulgence But began Sir Lyster I might advance a hundred theories but until I am sure it would be better for me to keep silence I must confer with my chief Sir Bridgman nodded approval Quite so said Sir Lyster In the meantime what is to be done Raise the hue and cry said Sage quietly Good God man exclaimed Sir Bridgman It would give the whole game away I propose said Sage quietly that photographs of John Dene be inserted in every paper in the kingdom that every continental paper likewise has full particulars of his disappearance That you offer a thousand pounds reward for news that will lead to his discovery and go on increasing it by a thousand every day until it reaches ten thousand Malcolm Sage paused his three listeners stared at him as if he were out of his senses You seriously suggest this publicity enquired Sir Lyster in cold and even tones I do said Sage You know why mister Dene is here I do And yet you still advise this course asked Sir Lyster I do responded Sage Well I m damned said Sir Bridgman For a moment a flicker of a smile crossed Malcolm Sage s serious features What are your reasons demanded Sir Lyster My reasons are closely connected with my conclusions sir and at the present time they are too nebulous to express We will consider this said Sir Lyster with an air of concluding the interview Malcolm Sage rose The time is not one for consideration sir he said but for action If you hesitate in this publicity I must ask your permission to see the Prime Minister then with a sudden change of tone and speaking with an air of great seriousness he added This is a matter of vital importance The announcement should be made in the late editions of all the evening papers and the full story must appear in to morrow s papers There is not much time Have I your permission to proceed No sir you have not thundered Sir Lyster I shall report this matter to Colonel Walton That sir you are quite at liberty to do said Sage calmly Incidentally you might report that I have resigned from my position at Department Z I wish you good afternoon gentlemen and with that Malcolm Sage left the room Good Lord Grayne you ve done it now said Sir Bridgman L J thinks the world of that chap He s a most impertinent fellow said Sir Lyster with heat Clever men frequently are laughed Sir Bridgman It seems to me that everybody s getting under the influence of John Dene I suppose it s Bolshevism he muttered to himself Half an hour later Colonel Walton was seated in earnest conversation with mister Llewellyn John It s very awkward very awkward said mister Llewellyn John still you must act along your own lines It s no good creating a department and then allowing another department to dictate to it but it s very awkward he added It would be more awkward sir if Sage were allowed to go said Colonel Walton Of course of course said mister Llewellyn John that s unthinkable If I were only told he muttered if I were only told They keep so much from me Then after a pause he added I m inclined to blame you though Walton for not not mister Llewellyn John hesitated Keeping John Dene under proper observation suggested Colonel Walton quietly Exactly mister Llewellyn John looked at him quickly He was always guarded Then you began mister Llewellyn John Our men were tricked Tricked mister Llewellyn John looked startled Yes continued Colonel Walton McLean was on duty that night Immediately he saw John Dene hail a taxi he jumped into his own taxi but he had hardly started when he was run into by a small runabout and the other taxi got away But the number of Fictitious both the taxi and the run about We thought it expedient not to detain the man who ran into McLean Colonel Walton added For nearly a minute mister Llewellyn John sat staring at the Chief of Department Z It s most unfortunate disastrous in fact he said at length We must try and get into touch with Auchinlech by wireless I m afraid it will be useless was the response There s the War Cabinet to be considered murmured mister Llewellyn John to himself The war does not He hesitated Make men tractable suggested Colonel Walton helpfully Exactly agreed mister Llewellyn John They may not take the same view as Sir Lyster and myself with regard to that memorandum of ours to Dene It s very awkward happening just now he added with all this trouble about interning aliens What am I to do sir There is very little time Do said mister Llewellyn John why run your department in your own way Walton I have an absolutely free hand enquired Colonel Walton Absolutely said mister Llewellyn John but I wish you could tell me more To be quite frank I m as much in the dark as you are Sage is as obstinate as a pack mule and as sure footed He s no respecter of Prime Ministers or First Lords suggested mister Llewellyn John with a smile Exactly Well go your own way said mister Llewellyn John but I should like to know what it all means Frankly I m puzzled We are cut off entirely from Auchinlech and without John Dene the Destroyer can t sail We re losing valuable time It s very unfortunate it s a disaster in fact But he burst out excitedly why on earth does Sage want to advertise our anxiety as to Dene s whereabouts That s what puzzles me It puzzles me too sir said Colonel Walton quietly It s such a confession of weakness continued mister Llewellyn John such a showing of our hand What will people think when we offer ten thousand pounds for news of John Dene of Toronto They ll probably think that he s an extremely valuable man was the dry retort That s it exactly said mister Llewellyn John and Berlin will congratulate itself upon a master stroke Colonel Walton felt inclined to suggest that was exactly what Malcolm Sage seemed most to desire but he refrained Very well Walton carry on said mister Llewellyn John but frankly I don t like it he added half to himself Colonel Walton left No one hundred ten Downing Street and ten minutes later Malcolm Sage withdrew his resignation Whilst Department Z hummed and buzzed with energy and men and women were coming and going continuously Dorothy sat at the window of John Dene s room gazing out at a prospect of white enamelled bricks punctuated by windows She had nothing to do Everything seemed so different John Dene s impulsive energy had vitalised all about him Now she felt as if all her faculties had suddenly wilted In her own mind she was convinced that he was ill She could not blot from her mind the strangeness of his manner during the last few days His sudden loss of memory proved that he was unwell For a man to forget where the postage stamps are kept or the position in the room of the letter files was in itself a proof that something very strange had suddenly come over him the more so in the case of one who was almost aggressively proud of his memory Then there had been other little details His movements did not seem the same that jerkiness and sudden upward glance from his table had disappeared It was as if he had been drugged Dorothy wondered if that really were the explanation Oh but she was very miserable and horribly lonely That night Dorothy and her mother sat up long after midnight talking of John Dene To both had come the realisation that he stood to them in the light of an intimate friend As she said Good night missus West put her arm round Dorothy s shoulders and in a shaky voice said I don t think God would let anything happen to a good man like mister Dene and Dorothy turned and left the room abruptly CHAPTER XIV THE HUE AND CRY The late editions of the evening papers contained no mention of the disappearance of John Dene For one thing much valuable time had been lost owing to the attitude of Sir Lyster Grayne for another Malcolm Sage had decided to make a great display in the morning papers All that afternoon Department Z was feverishly busy Photographs of John Dene had to be duplicated and the story distributed through the Press Bureau in order that it might possess an official character On the morning following the discovery of John Dene s disappearance the British public was startled at its breakfast table by an offer of Lten thousand reward for details that would lead to the discovery of the whereabouts of one John Dene a citizen of Toronto Canada who had last been seen at six p m on the previous Monday outside his offices in Waterloo Place The notice drawn up by Department Z ran MISSING Lten thousand REWARD Where is JOHN DENE of TORONTO On Monday at six p m mister John Dene the well known Canadian inventor and engineer of Toronto left his offices in Waterloo Place after bidding his secretary good night Since then a shroud of mystery seems to have enveloped his movements HIS SECRETARY BECOMES ALARMED His Secretary Miss Dorothy West arrived at the office at the usual time on Tuesday morning mister Dene was most punctual in his habits invariably reaching his office a few minutes after nine Miss West waited until two o clock then fearing that he might be ill she rang through to the Ritzton Hotel where mister Dene was staying To her surprise she was informed that he had not returned to his hotel the night before WHERE IS JOHN DENE OF TORONTO Miss West immediately got into communication with the head of a certain Government department with which mister Dene was associated but nothing was known of his whereabouts The authorities have reason to believe that mister Dene has been spirited away by some organisation that has a special object in view IS IT FOUL PLAY A reward of Lten thousand will be paid to anyone who will give such information as will lead directly to the discovery of mister John Dene s whereabouts It may be added that mister Dene is a distinguished engineer and inventor and it is the duty of every citizen of the British Empire to endeavour to assist the Authorities in tracing the missing man THIS IS WHAT HE IS LIKE The following is a description of mister John Dene Height five fort five ins Clean shaven with grey eyes and a determined expression invariably carried a cigar in his mouth very frequently unlighted Has a peculiar habit of twisting and twirling the cigar in his mouth Thick set with keen rather jerky movements and a habit of looking at people suddenly and piercingly A square jaw and tightly closed lips When last seen was wearing a dark grey tweed suit trilby hat dark blue tie and brown boots Spoke with a marked Canadian accent All communications should be addressed to Scotland Yard S W In addition to the foregoing semi official particulars there followed much information that had been gleaned by various reporters Most of the papers gave a leader and several hinted at the hidden hand urging that this new outrage obviously pointed to the necessity for the internment of all aliens Great emphasis was laid upon the importance of tracing the present whereabouts of John Dene of Toronto and anyone who had seen a man at all answering to his description was called upon to communicate with Scotland Yard The afternoon papers contained practically the same information but elaborated and adorned Several hinted at the fact that John Dene had come to England with a new invention of great importance and that he had disappeared just on the eve of the fruition of his schemes with the result that everything was at a stand still In support of this theory the writers pointed to the amount of the reward Ten thousand pounds would not have been offered they argued unless there were good reasons for it One paper went so far as to suggest that the Government itself was offering the reward although in its next issue it apologised for and contradicted the statement this was a little stroke of Malcolm Sage s Dorothy was besieged by interviewers until at last she was forced to refrain from answering the succession of knocks at the outer door Her head was in a whirl The prevailing topic of conversation was the disappearance of John Dene Everybody was asking why such a reward had been offered Shoals of letters descended upon Scotland Yard Hundreds of callers lined up in a queue waiting their turn to be interviewed Telegrams rained in from the provinces Apparently John Dene had been seen in places as far distant as saint Andrews and Bournemouth Aberystwyth and King s Lynn He had been observed in conversation with men women and children some of harmless some of sinister appearance He had been seen in trains buses trams and cars He had been seen perturbed and calm hastening and loitering in uniform and in mufti Scotland Yard was almost out of its mind and the officer in charge of the John Dene investigation rang through to Malcolm Sage demanding what the funny peter he was to do with the enormous correspondence and the bewildering queue that already stretched along the Embankment halfway to Charing Cross railway bridge Burn the telegrams and letters and tell the queue to write was Sage s laconic response as he put up the receiver whereat the officer had sworn heavily into the mouth piece of the instrument The Chief Commissioner was particularly annoyed because all his own correspondence had been engulphed in the epistolary flood and he was expecting a letter from his wife telling him where to meet her on the following day on her return from a motor tour Those who knew Lady Wrayle understood the Chief Commissioner s anxiety All day long Scotland Yard worked in a conscientious endeavour to sift the mass of evidence that streamed in upon it from all parts of the kingdom Some of the stories to which weary but patient officials listened were grotesque in the extreme As the chief expressed it Half the idiots and all the damned fools in the country are descending upon us The callers were interesting as studies in obtuseness and optimism but they were as nothing to the telegrams One man wired from saint Andrews that he was tracking a strange man round the golf course would Scotland Yard telegraph a warrant for his arrest Another enquired if the reward would be in cash or war bonds and if the Government guaranteed the money this man telegraphed from Aberdeen Several asked for railway warrants to London that they might lay certain facts before the authorities Scores telegraphed for photographs as the pictures in the papers were indistinct One lady telegraphed from Suffolk that a man with a beard identical with that worn by John Dene in the picture in The Daily Photo had that day come to her door begging The telegrams were however nothing to the letters that followed them The lady who had telegraphed about a bearded John Dene wrote to apologise for her mistake explaining it by saying that the paper boy must have accidentally rubbed the paper before delivering it She was not to be denied however and went on to say that she thought the picture strangely like the man who had begged of her Did Scotland Yard think that John Dene had disguised himself with a false beard Some correspondents wrote bitterly censuring the Government for not interning all aliens for allowing John Dene out of its sight for an Imperialistic policy for plunging the country into war for offering the reward and for a thousand and one other irrelevant things The one thing that no one did was to supply any information that would be remotely useful to the authorities in tracing the missing man People waited eagerly for the morrow s papers They contained another surprise this time in the form of a two column advertisement offering Ltwenty thousand for information that would lead to the discovery of the whereabouts of John Dene Clearly somebody was determined that John Dene should be found When mister Llewellyn John opened the first morning paper he picked up from the pile awaiting him he gasped Himself a great believer in the possibilities of the press he felt nevertheless that Department Z was overdoing things and he telephoned for its chief and Malcolm Sage to call upon him at ten o clock At two minutes to ten the two presented themselves at No one hundred ten Downing Street and were immediately shown into the presence of the Prime Minister Has it struck you asked mister Llewellyn John indicating one of the advertisements that questions will be asked in the House as to whether or no the Government is offering these large rewards I should think it highly probable sir was Sage s response And what are we to say demanded mister Llewellyn John He was a keen politician and saw that the situation might be fraught with considerable difficulties Acknowledge that they are sir was the response Acknowledge it cried mister Llewellyn John Certainly sir mister Sage said mister Llewellyn John severely you do not appear to appreciate that this may seriously compromise the Government Then turning to Colonel Walton he continued Hitherto you have been given a free hand now I must ask you to explain why you are offering these large rewards You first of all suggested Lone thousand rising daily from Lone thousand to Lten thousand In two days it has amounted to Ltwenty thousand It won t rise any higher sir It has reached the limit That is not the point said mister Llewellyn John I want to know why it is that you are advertising to Germany that we want John Dene It is an obvious confession of weakness He made a quick nervous movement with his right hand he was far from easy in his mind Malcolm Sage continued to examine his finger nails with great intentness Seeing that he made no indication of replying mister Llewellyn John continued I m afraid that this cannot go on There was a suggestion of irritability in his voice Then have it stopped sir said Sage calmly still intent upon the finger nails of his right hand The mischief is done said mister Llewellyn John What is at the back of your mind Sage he demanded I m working on a hypothesis sir was the reply I think I m right in fact I m convinced of it but until I know for certain I must keep my theories to myself If you wish it I ll tell you what I actually know but I make it a rule never to air theories mister Llewellyn John smiled Well tell me what you actually know then he said When mister Dene left his office at three minutes past six on Monday evening he stood for nearly a minute as if making up his mind in what direction to go Just as he was about to turn and walk up Regent Street a taxi crawled past him The driver spoke to him and John Dene got in and drove away Kidnapped exclaimed mister Llewellyn John Malcolm Sage shrugged his shoulders In which direction did he drive enquired mister Llewellyn John eagerly Along Pall Mall sir was the reply Colonel Walton told you what happened mister Llewellyn John nodded And have you informed the police he asked Malcolm Sage shook his head Why enquired mister Llewellyn John eagerly If my theory is right said Sage it s unnecessary If my theory s wrong it s useless Believe me sir our best course is to continue to boom John Dene s disappearance for all we are worth But the Destroyer exclaimed mister Llewellyn John excitedly You know the conditions sir that the island of Auchinlech was to be left severely alone for four months Do you imagine that Dene slipped off to the north to trick the Germans That wouldn t trick them sir said Malcolm Sage quietly John Dene would never have been allowed to reach Auchinlech alive That was settled I may add that I have every reason to believe that the taxi and its occupant did not go fifty miles from London And that he is a prisoner mister Llewellyn John jumped from his chair Malcolm Sage inclined his head in the affirmative Good heavens exclaimed mister Llewellyn John we must Depend entirely upon the advertisements said Sage rising You will of course regard this as strictly confidential and to be told to no one I cannot tell you how important it is There was an unaccustomed note of seriousness in Sage s voice which did not fail to impress mister Llewellyn John But the questions in the House as to why we are offering this reward persisted mister Llewellyn John What reply are we to make You might fall back on the old cliche sir Wait and see mister Llewellyn John smiled That phrase continued Sage was a great asset to one party why should it not be to another Look at this mister Llewellyn John held out a slip of paper which Colonel Walton took and read aloud Has the attention of the Home Secretary been drawn to a statement in The Tribune to the effect that it is the Government that is offering the reward of Lten thousand for information that will lead to the discovery of the whereabouts of mister John Dene of Toronto and if so can it justify the offer of so large a sum of public money They haven t lost any time remarked Sage quietly They never do There was an unaccustomed note of irascibility in mister Llewellyn John s voice These questions are a scandal Except when one happens to be in opposition sir said Sage apparently absorbed in examining the nails of his left hand mister Llewellyn John made no response and Colonel Walton handed back to him the slip which he tossed upon the table Well he demanded looking from Colonel Walton to Sage what are we to reply The answer is in the affirmative sir said Malcolm Sage For a moment mister Llewellyn John looked at him frowning then he broke into a smile That s all very well Sage but it s not sufficient If I may venture a suggestion began Sage Do do that s why I sent for you both he added as if in deference to Colonel Walton I would say that for reasons not unconnected with the prosecution of the war the discovery of mister John Dene s whereabouts is imperative But that would be giving us away more than ever I think it would be desirable to temporise said Sage mister Llewellyn John made a movement of impatience You might reply that it is not in the public interest to answer the question continued Sage But that would be tantamount to acknowledging that we are offering the reward said mister Llewellyn John with a suspicion of irritation in his voice Malcolm Sage looked at him steadily but without speaking There will inevitably be other questions arising out of this continued mister Llewellyn John I was going to suggest sir that if we could arrange for some newspaper to make a definite statement that the Government is offering the reward we could prosecute it under D O R A For fully a minute mister Llewellyn John gazed at Malcolm Sage as if not quite sure of his sanity But he began and then broke off looking helplessly across at Colonel Walton Of course sir I ll relinquish the enquiry if you wish it This is not the time to talk of relinquishing anything Sage said mister Llewellyn John with some asperity in his tone What I want to know is what all this means That s exactly what I m endeavouring to discover said Sage evenly If I were a stage detective I should be down on my knees smelling your carpet or examining Pall Mall with a strong lens but I m not I never carry a magnifying glass and I know nothing about finger prints The solving of mysteries like the detection of crime is invariably due to a mistake on the part of somebody who ought not to have made a mistake Then tell me how far you have got mister Llewellyn John glanced across to Colonel Walton and was conscious of a slight knitting of his brows then he looked back again at Malcolm Sage who for some moments remained silent If you were uncertain of my sanity sir said Sage quietly would you discuss the matter with others or would you first assure yourself of the accuracy of your suspicions He looked up suddenly straight into mister Llewellyn John s eyes We all know you are hopelessly and irretrievably mad Sage said mister Llewellyn John with a smile When I know definitely what has become of John Dene I ll tell you sir said Sage I m not spectacular sir I can t deduce bigamy from a bootlace or murder from a meringue I can tell you this however he paused and both his listeners leaned forward eagerly that if my hypothesis is correct the policy to pursue is to magnify the importance of John Dene s disappearance Incidentally he added it might result in mister John Dene revising his opinion of the incapacity of British officialdom Then you refuse to tell me It would be highly injudicious on my part to tell you of a mere suspicion which might Malcolm Sage lifted his eye from the nail of his left thumb and looked straight at mister Llewellyn John which might dictate your policy sir But the time we are wasting protested mister Llewellyn John rising and pacing up and down impatiently Nothing is lost that s wrought with tears sir was the enigmatical response Sage said mister Llewellyn John as he shook hands with Malcolm Sage you re the most pig headed official in the British Empire Chappeldale can be tiresome but you re nothing short of an inconvenience Mind Walton he continued turning to the chief of Department Z I shall hold you responsible for Sage If he lets me down over this Dene business I shall lose faith in Department Z The smile that accompanied his words however robbed them of any sting they might have contained Why don t you take the Skipper into your confidence Sage enquired Walton as they walked towards the Duke of York s steps Vanity chief sheer vanity was the response We have never failed him yet and if I started barking up the wrong tree he d never again have confidence in Department Z I suppose he added irrelevantly that some day we shall be taken over altogether by the colonies It would not be a bad thing for the British Empire either John Dene might be our first president There was one man who was deeply thankful for the disappearance of John Dene mister Blair went about as if he had received a new lease of life He became almost sprightly in his demeanour and no longer looked up apprehensively when the door of his room opened Sir Bridgman North commented on the circumstance to Sir Lyster Grayne and as he passed through mister Blair s room openly taxed him with being responsible for the kidnapping of John Dene mister Blair smiled a little wearily for to him John Dene was no matter for joking When mister McShane s question with regard to the disappearance of John Dene came up for answer the Home Secretary replied that for the present at least it was not in the public interest to give the information required That s tantamount to an acknowledgment cried mister McShane springing to his feet It s a scandal that public money He got no further as at this point he was called to order by the Speaker It was clear that the House was not satisfied In the lobbies mister McShane s question and the answer given were discussed to an extent out of all proportion to their apparent importance The feeling seemed to be that if John Dene were of such value to the Government he should have been guarded with a care that would have prevented the possibility of his disappearance If on the other hand the Government had no interest in the enormous reward offered for information concerning him then a statement to that effect should have been made Whatever the facts the Government was obviously in the wrong That was the general impression The next day several newspapers commented very strongly upon the incident There seemed to be a determination on the part of the press to make an affaire John Dene out of the Canadian s disappearance The Government was attacked for adopting German bureaucratic methods A dark age of bureaucracy is settling down upon the country said The Morning Age The real danger of Prussianism is not military but bureaucratic The Government was called upon to lift the curtain of mystery with which it had surrounded itself If it were responsible for the rewards offered then let it say so If however these rewards were in no way connected with the Government then a denial should immediately be made At the moment everybody regarded the Government as responsible for the tremendous press campaign resulting from John Dene s disappearance Malcolm Sage read the newspapers with obvious relish mister Llewellyn John on the other hand frowned heavily at finding his administration attacked The Home Secretary rang up the Deputy Commissioner at Scotland Yard telling him that something must be done and the Deputy Commissioner had replied with some heat that if the Home Secretary would step across to the Yard he would see what actually was being done He further intimated that the whole work of the Yard had been disorganised The Prime Minister sent over for Colonel Walton Look here Walton he cried as the chief of Department Z entered the room This affair is getting rather out of hand and it looks dangerous You ve seen the papers Colonel Walton nodded He was a man to whom words came with difficulty Well I don t like the look of it continued mister Llewellyn John Sir Roger has just rung through that he s been urging Scotland Yard to greater efforts They can do no harm remarked Colonel Walton drily I want Sage to go round and see the Deputy Commissioner I doubt if he ll do it was the grim response Not do it cried mister Llewellyn John with a note of anger in his voice In fact I m quite sure he won t If you tell him that those are my instructions began mister Llewellyn John It s no use sir he ll merely resign He s as independent as an American boot boy mister Llewellyn John flopped down in a chair and sat gazing at Colonel Walton But he s got us into this muddle he began I ve never known Sage s judgment at fault yet replied Colonel Walton Then you advise began mister Llewellyn John I never venture to advise was the reply Now look here Walton said mister Llewellyn John persuasively this is a very serious matter It has already been magnified out of all proportion to its actual importance I want to know what you would do if you were in my place Exactly as Sage advises was the terse response Why you re as bad as he is grumbled mister Llewellyn John Still I suppose I must do as you suggest I don t like the look of things however It s invariably the neglected trifle that wrecks a government The mysterious disappearance of John Dene was made the subject of special consideration at a meeting of the War Cabinet It was urged that the curious nature of the circumstances exonerated the Prime Minister and the First Lord of the Admiralty from the personal pledge they had given to John Dene and that it was a matter of vital national importance that the Destroyer should be put into commission with the least possible delay mister Llewellyn John looked interrogatingly across at Sir Lyster Grayne who shook his head decisively We have given a personal pledge he said under no circumstances whatever to communicate or endeavour to communicate other than by wireless with the island of Auchinlech for the period of four months from the date of our undertaking The words under no circumstances whatever admit of only one interpretation But protested Sir Roger Flynn the Home Secretary mister Dene could not have foreseen his own disappearance Circumstances surely alter the aspect of the case he urged If you Flynn were to promise under no circumstances to move from this room then fire or flood would not justify you in breaking that promise said Sir Lyster with decision He was notorious for his punctiliousness in matters of personal honour What was possible to the Roman sentry is imperative with responsible Ministers he added mister Llewellyn John nodded and made a mental note of the phrase Besides continued Sir Lyster mister Dene was particularly emphatic on this point I recall his saying to the Prime Minister When I say under no circumstances I mean under no circumstances and he went on to expound his interpretation of the phrase But persisted Sir Roger if the majority of the War Cabinet take the opposite view then you and the Prime Minister would be absolved from your promise Nothing can absolve a man from his personal pledge was Sir Lyster s calm retort He can be outvoted politically but he has always his alternative resignation mister Llewellyn John looked up quickly I think he said that Grayne is right Nothing can absolve us from our pledge The point is said Sir Roger what is happening at Auchinlech He fixed an almost accusing eye upon Sir Lyster Grayne who merely shook his head with the air of one who has been asked an insoluble conundrum Here we are continued Sir Roger indignantly with a weapon that would exercise a considerable effect in bringing victory nearer debarred from using it because The Prime Minister has given his word interpolated Sir Lyster quietly Sir Roger glared at him Death nullifies a contract of this description retorted Sir Roger But the Prime Minister is not yet dead said Sir Lyster drily mister Llewellyn John started slightly He did not like these references to death and resignation In law began Sir Roger This is not a matter of law but of a private promise Sir Lyster was insistent I think gentlemen you are looking at it from different points of view interrupted mister Llewellyn John with a tactful smile Let us hope that mister John Dene will be found If it can be proved he is dead then we shall be fully justified in sending to Auchinlech acquainting his second in command with what has happened and instructing him to assume command of the Destroyer in accordance with mister Dene s wishes The matter was then dropped although it was clear that the members of the War Cabinet were not at one on the subject either of John Dene or his disappearance The Home Secretary promised personally to urge the police to greater efforts Slowly and with infinite labour Scotland Yard sifted the enormous volume of evidence that poured in upon it proving conclusively that John Dene had been seen in every part of the United Kingdom not to mention a number of places on the Continent Police officers swore and perspired as they strove to grapple with this enormous problem Night and day they worked with the frenzy of despair They cursed the war they cursed the colonies they cursed John Dene Why had he not stayed in Toronto and disappeared there if he must disappear anywhere Why had he come to London to drive to desperation an already over worked department One thing that the police found particularly embarrassing was that constables were constantly being called upon by enthusiastic and excited members of the public to arrest inoffensive citizens on the suspicion of their being John Dene of Toronto In some instances the constables would point out that no resemblance existed but the invariable reply was that the object of suspicion was disguised All these false scents were duly reported to headquarters through the local police stations with no other result than to increase the sultriness of the atmosphere at Scotland Yard An elaborate description of John Dene was sent to every coroner and mortuary attendant in the country The river police were advised to keep a sharp look out for floating bodies In its heart of hearts Scotland Yard yearned to discover proof of the death of John Dene whilst all the time it worked steadily through the deluge of correspondence and listened patiently to the testimonies of the avaricious optimists who were convinced that they and they alone could supply the necessary information that would lead to the discovery of the whereabouts of John Dene and transfer to themselves the not inconsiderable sum of Ltwenty thousand If ever another blighter comes from Toronto remarked Detective Inspector Crabbett as he mopped his brow it would be worth while for the Yard to subscribe Ltwenty thousand for him to disappear quietly Having thus relieved his feelings he plunged once more into the opening of letters letters that convinced him that the whole population of Great Britain and Ireland had gone suddenly mad Articles appeared in many of the German newspapers upon the subject of the mysterious disappearance of John Dene A great point was made of the fact that he was an inventor and was known to be in close touch with the British war chiefs Emphasis was laid upon the extraordinary efforts being made to discover his whereabouts It is inconceivable said the Koelnische Zeitung that the anxiety of the relatives of the missing man could have prompted them to offer a reward of four hundred thousand marks for news of his whereabouts and that within two days of his disappearance Imagine a private citizen in Germany being absent from home for two days and his friends offering this colossal reward for news of him What would be said The writer went on to point out that behind this almost hysterical anxiety of the English to find John Dene lay a mystery that whatever its solution might be was certainly not detrimental to German interests The Vorwaerts hinted darkly at something more than John Dene having disappeared a something that was so embarrassing the British authorities as to be likely to have a very serious influence upon the conduct of the war The Berliner Tageblatt openly stated that the British Admiralty was offering the reward and left its readers to draw their own conclusions Victory it concluded is not always won with machine guns and high explosive Fitness to win means something more than well trained battalions and valiant soldiers it means a perfect organisation in every department of the great game of war violence bluff and intrigue The country with the best balanced machinery was the country that would win because it was fit to win In Germany where everybody does everything at the top of his voice italics are very popular An excitable people think and live italics and a daily newspaper either reflects its public or ceases to be With great tact the Paris papers limited themselves to the news element in John Dene s disappearance reproducing his portrait with the details translated from the London dailies The neutral press was frankly puzzled Those favourable to Germany saw in this incident a presage of victory for the Fatherland whilst the pro Allies journals hinted at the fact that someone had blundered in giving such publicity to an event that should have been regarded as a subject for the consideration of the War Cabinet rather than for the daily press CHAPTER XV mister LLEWELLYN JOHN BECOMES ALARMED I mister Llewellyn John was obviously troubled With the forefinger of his right hand he tapped the table meditatively as he gazed straight in front of him The disappearance of John Dene was proving an even greater source of embarrassment to the War Cabinet than the internment of aliens The member of parliament who translated his duty to his constituents into asking as many awkward questions as possible of the Government found a rich source of inspiration in the affaire John Dene mister Llewellyn John disliked questions but never had he shown so whole hearted an antipathy for interrogation as in the case of John Dene The fact of the Home Secretary being responsible for the answers constituted an additional embarrassment as Sir Roger Flynn was frankly critical of his chief in regard to the disappearance of John Dene He had not been consulted in the matter of offering a reward as he should have been and he was piqued His answers to the questions that seemed to rain down upon him from all parts of the House were given in anything but a conciliatory tone and the method he adopted of dispatching them in batches like rebels as mister Chappeldale put it still further alienated from the Government the sympathy of the more independent members In this mister Llewellyn John saw a smouldering menace that might at any time burst into flame He had come to wish with deep rooted earnestness that Sir Roger Flynn would take a holiday He had even gone to the length of suggesting that the Home Secretary was not looking altogether himself but Sir Roger had not risen to the bait Ah here you are cried mister Llewellyn John with a smile that in no way mirrored the state of his feelings as Sir Roger entered and with a nod dropped into a chair Eight more questions on the paper he said grimly I suppose you appreciate the seriousness of it all What would you suggest doing enquired mister Llewellyn John tactfully Get a new lock for the stable door now the horse is gone was the uncompromising retort I ve asked Colonel Walton to step round said mister Llewellyn John ignoring his colleague s remark It s all that fellow Sage grumbled Sir Roger I went round to see him yesterday and he was as urbane as a money lender But surely you wouldn t quarrel I always quarrel with a fool who doesn t see the consequences likely to arise out of his folly said Sir Roger If he would only play golf murmured mister Llewellyn John plaintively He d resign at the first green because someone had shouted fore The man s a freak Sir Roger was very downright this morning I wish we had a few more of the same sort was mister Llewellyn John s smiling rejoinder Sir Roger grumbled something in his throat Malcolm Sage was too often in antagonism with his Department for the Home Secretary to contemplate with anything but alarm a multiplicity of Sages mister Llewellyn John who deeply commiserated with those heads of departments who had suffered from Malcolm Sage s temperament was always anxious to keep him from coming into direct touch with other Ministers the invariable result was a protest from the Minister and resignation from Malcolm Sage Once he had been summoned before the War Cabinet to expound and explain a certain rather complicated enquiry in connection with a missing code book Before he had been in the room five minutes he had resigned At Scotland Yard he was known as Sage and Onions the feebleness of the jeu d esprit being to some extent mitigated by the venom with which it was uttered Nothing short of the anti criminal traditions of the Yard had saved Malcolm Sage from assassination at the hands of its outraged officials His indifference was to them far more galling than contempt He seemed sublimely unconscious of the fact that he was not popular with the police officials a circumstance that merely added to the dislike with which he was regarded There was much to be said for Scotland Yard which was called upon to carry out instructions from a pack of blinking amachoors as one of Sage s most pronounced antagonists had phrased it Added to which was the fact that they were dealing with a man who seemed entirely unable to discriminate between courtesy and venomous hatred Like the German nation the officials discovered that there was little virtue in a hymn of hate that was not recognised as such It s no good scrapping a man because he doesn t keep to your own time table said mister Llewellyn John mentally making a note of the phrase for future use Sir Roger had remarked that the Prime Minister lay awake half the night coining phrases which would not win the war This John Dene has caused more trouble at the Home Office than all the rest of the war put together Sir Roger was obviously in a bad temper We must learn to think Imperially my dear Flynn The Home Secretary made a movement of impatience There ll be murder at Scotland Yard one of these days he announced That fellow Sage goads the officials there to madness And yet he s so popular with his own men said mister Llewellyn John At Department Z they would do anything for him Well I wish they d do it and keep him there Whilst mister Llewellyn John and Sir Roger Flynn were discussing Department Z Colonel Walton was seated at his table drawing diagrams upon the blotting paper and Malcolm Sage sat opposite engaged in the never ending examination of his finger nails The Skipper s got the wind up Sage said Colonel Walton I expected as much I ve got to go round there in a quarter of an hour Sir Roger s trying to force his hand Let him said Malcolm Sage Colonel Walton shook his head with a smile That s all very well Sage but it isn t the language of diplomacy Ours isn t the department of diplomacy chief Why not promise him something dramatic in a few weeks time That s bound to appeal to him For a moment a fugitive smile flittered across Sage s features I think he added we shall surprise him In the meantime we must be diplomatic said Colonel Walton That s why I m not taking you with me this morning You think I d resign queried Sage with an odd movement at the corners of his mouth I m sure of it was the response as Colonel Walton rose I suppose you know he continued that Scotland Yard is absolutely congested You can have no idea of what Sir Roger said when I met him in Whitehall yesterday If it s anything at all like what comes through to me and Malcolm Sage shrugged his shoulders Ten minutes later Colonel Walton was shown into mister Llewellyn John s room Ah here you are cried mister Llewellyn John as he motioned Colonel Walton to a seat Is there any news None sir was the response This is getting very serious Walton said mister Llewellyn John something really must be done Have you tried Scotland Yard sir asked Colonel Walton evenly looking across at Sir Roger who made a movement as if to speak but evidently thought better of it I didn t mean that as a rebuke Walton said mister Llewellyn John diplomatically But this John Dene business is really most awkward Scotland Yard has apparently been entirely disorganised through your advertisements and Sir Roger has just been telling me that there are eight more questions down on the paper for to day Every day the Admiralty endeavours to call up Auchinlech by wireless continued mister Llewellyn John but they can get no response The thing is where is John Dene demanded Sir Roger speaking for the first time and looking at Colonel Walton as if he suspected him of having the missing man secreted about his person I think the popular conception of the detective is responsible for all the trouble said Colonel Walton quietly looking from Sir Roger to the Prime Minister What do you mean demanded Sir Roger I think Sage expressed it fairly accurately continued Colonel Walton when he said that if a man disappears or a criminal is wanted the detective is always expected to produce him as a conjurer does a guinea pig out of a top hat It isn t that said mister Llewellyn John irritably It s the reward that s causing all the trouble What is the detective for if it s not to solve mysteries demanded Sir Roger aggressively I think that is a question for Scotland Yard sir said Colonel Walton Sir Roger flushed angrily and was about to speak when mister Llewellyn John stepped into the breach You know Walton we have to consider the political aspect he said What is Department Z s conception of the detective then demanded Sir Roger To watch for the other side s mistakes and take advantage of them was the reply just as in politics with a smile at mister Llewellyn John mister Llewellyn John nodded agreement You remember the Winthorpe murder case Sir Roger I do said the Home Secretary There Scotland Yard tracked a man who had been three weeks at large He made the mistake of calling somewhere for his washing and the police had been watching the place for three weeks That s all very well said Sir Roger obviously annoyed But you must remember Colonel Walton that this John Dene business has a political significance It s it s embarrassing the Government But while they are worrying about that remarked Colonel Walton imperturbably they re dropping the intern all aliens cry mister Llewellyn John smiled I m convinced he said that there s quite a large section of the public that would like me to intern everybody whose name is not Smith Brown Jones or Robinson Or Sage suggested Colonel Walton slyly Sage cried mister Llewellyn John he ought to be in the Tower But seriously Walton What I want to know is how long this will last In all probability until the full four months have expired was the rejoinder Good heavens cried mister Llewellyn John in consternation I should not be alarmed sir if I were you said Colonel Walton with a smile The public will soon get another cry Sage suggests they may possibly hang an ex minister mister Llewellyn John laughed Colonel Walton s reference was to a previous Prime Minister who on one occasion had enquired of a distinguished general if he had ever contemplated the effect on the public of the possibility of Great Britain losing the war They d hang you sir the general had replied leaning forward and tapping the then Prime Minister on the knee with an impressive forefinger For a few moments there was silence broken at length by Sir Roger But that does not relieve my congested Department he said complainingly I m afraid said Colonel Walton turning to mister Llewellyn John that it s impossible for Department Z to work along any but its own lines If Sage and I do not possess the confidence of the War Cabinet may I suggest that we be relieved of our duties Good heavens Walton cried mister Llewellyn John Surely you re not going to start resigning In the light of Sir Roger s remark it s the only course open for me was the dignified retort as Colonel Walton rose No no murmured mister Llewellyn John looking across at the Home Secretary You must remember Walton that Sir Roger has had a very trying time owing to to these advertisements and and He paused and again he looked expectantly at Sir Roger who seemed engrossed in fingering the lower button of his waistcoat Neither Sage nor I have any desire to embarrass you or the Home Secretary continued Colonel Walton but I m sure of it Walton I m sure of it and so is Sir Roger Again mister Llewellyn John looked across at his colleague who seeming to lose interest in his lower waistcoat button suddenly looked up The question is how long is this to continue he asked For some moments Colonel Walton did not reply He appeared to be weighing something in his mind We re up against the cleverest organisation in the world he said at length and Sage believes that a single man controls the lot Nonsense broke in Sir Roger This spy craze is pure imagination In any case it causes the War Cabinet a great amount of concern said mister Llewellyn John drily I think proceeded Colonel Walton that before the expiration of the four months stipulated for by John Dene Department Z will have justified itself How demanded Sir Roger I can say nothing more said Colonel Walton moving towards the door at present Well carry on Walton said mister Llewellyn John and with a wave of his hand and good luck Those two men have megalomania in its worst possible form growled Sir Roger as he too rose to take his departure Well if they don t make good on this said mister Llewellyn John you can decide whether or not their resignations be accepted With a nod Sir Roger left the room conscious that he had to explain to the permanent officials at the Home Office why Department Z was still in being II During the weeks that followed the disappearance of John Dene a careful observer of Apthorpe Road could not have failed to observe the trouble that it was apparently giving the local authorities A fatality seemed to brood over this unfortunate thoroughfare First of all the telephone mains seemed to go wrong Workmen came and later there arrived a huge roll of lead covered cable Labour was scarce and never did labourers work less industriously for their hire On the morning after the arrival of the men mister Montagu Naylor paused at the spot where they were working and for a minute or two stood watching them with interest Was there any danger of the telephone system being interrupted No the cable was being laid as a precaution The existing cable was showing faults mister Naylor passed on his way and from time to time would exchange greetings with the men They were extremely civil fellows he decided mister Naylor felt very English The telephone men had not completed their work when the water main as if jealous of the care and attention being lavished upon a rival system developed some strange and dangerous symptoms involving the picking up of the road Again mister Naylor showed interest and learned that the water pressure was not all that it should be in the neighbourhood and it was thought that some foreign substance had got into the pipes Just as the watermen were preparing to pack up and take a leisurely departure two men their overalls smeared and spotted with red lead arrived at the end of the street with a hand barrow In due course a cutting of some fifteen or twenty feet was made in the roadway and the reek of stale gas assailed the nostrils of the passer by Obviously some shadow of misfortune brooded over Apthorpe Road for no sooner were these men beginning to pack up their tools than the road men arrived with a full blooded steam roller bent upon ploughing up and crushing down Apthorpe Road to a new and proper symmetry In short the thoroughfare in which mister Montagu Naylor lived seemed never to be without workmen by day and by night watchmen to protect municipal property from depredation I m not so sure remarked Malcolm Sage to Thompson who had entered his room soon after Colonel Walton had gone to pay his call at one hundred ten Downing Street that the menage Naylor isn t a subject for investigation by the Food Controller Thompson grinned Eighty pounds of potatoes seems to be a generous week s supply for three people And other things to match sir said Thompson with another grin Haricot beans cabbage they re nuts on cabbage salad and all sorts of things that are not rationed I think it must be diabetes he added with another grin Possibly Thompson possibly said Malcolm Sage but in the meantime we will assume other explanations Some people eat more than others For instance the German is a very big eater And a dirty one too sir added Thompson with disgust I ve been at hotels with em Seven meals a day is one of the articles of faith of the good German Thompson continued Malcolm Sage And what s the result sir remarked Thompson I suppose remarked Sage meditatively it s the same as with a bean fed horse They go out looking for trouble And they re going to get it was the grim rejoinder Well carry on Thompson said Sage by way of dismissal You ll learn a great deal about the green grocery trade in the process And waterworks and gas and things sir grinned Thompson As Thompson opened the door of Malcolm Sage s room he stepped aside to allow Colonel Walton to enter and then quietly closed the door behind him Bad time enquired Sage as Colonel Walton dropped into a chair and taking off his cap mopped his forehead On this occasion I resigned for both of us For once in his life Malcolm Sage was surprised He looked incredulously across at his chief who gazed back with a comical expression in his eyes I thought I was left at home for fear I might resign said Malcolm Sage drily when Colonel Walton had finished telling him of the interview But Colonel Walton did not look up from the end of his cigar which he was examining with great intentness I m not a sceptic remarked Malcolm Sage presently as he gazed at his brilliantly polished fingernails but I would give a great deal for a dumb patriot domiciled in Apthorpe Road Dumb queried Colonel Walton Malcolm Sage nodded without raising his eyes from his finger nails I have no doubt that Apthorpe Road is exclusively patriotic but if we were to ask one of its residents to lend us a front bedroom and furthermore if we spent all our days in the bedroom at the window He shrugged his shoulders There s always the domestic servant suggested Colonel Walton Not much use in this case chief was the reply It means that Thompson has had to turn road mender Good man Thompson he added He d extract facts from a futurist picture Colonel Walton nodded CHAPTER XVI FINLAY S S O S I Well I think it s spies announced Marjorie Rogers as she sat perched on the corner of John Dene s table swinging a pretty foot Dorothy looked up quickly But she began then paused And it s all mister Llewellyn John s fault He ought to intern all aliens On raid nights the Tube is simply disgusting Dorothy smiled at the wise air of decision with which Marjorie settled political problems The strain of the past week with its hopes and fears was beginning to tell upon her There had been interminable interrogations by men in plain clothes who with large hands and blunt pencils wrote copious notes in fat note books The atmosphere with which they surrounded themselves was so vague so non committal that Dorothy began to feel that she was suspected of having stolen John Dene Oh mother she had cried on the evening of the first day of her ordeal at the hands of Scotland Yard you should see your poor defenceless daughter surrounded by men who do nothing but ask questions and look mysterious They re so different from mister Sage she had added as an afterthought If it isn t the spies continued Marjorie then what is it Dorothy shook her head wearily She missed John Dene It was just beginning to dawn upon her how much she missed him The days seemed interminable There was nothing to do but answer the door to the repeated knocks either of detectives or of journalists It was a relief when Marjorie ran in to pick her up for lunch Dorothy had felt it only fair to discontinue the elaborate lunches that were sent in or on her way home in the evening A man doesn t get lost like a pawn ticket announced Marjorie What do you know about pawn tickets Rojjie Oh I often pop things when I m hard up she announced nonchalantly You don t cried Dorothy incredulously Of course What should I do when I m stoney if it wasn t for uncle You outrageous little creature cried Dorothy I should like to shake you He s quite a nice youth with black hair greased into what I think he would call a quiff What on earth are you talking about Uncle of course He always gives me more than anyone else she announced with the air of one conscious of a triumph Where will you end Rojjie cried Dorothy Suburbs probably she replied practically These old wasters take you out to dinner but marry you not much She shook her wise little head so vigorously that her bobbed hair shook like a fringe I wish I had a John Dene she said after a pause A John Dene Ummm nodded Marjorie Why Marry him of course Don t be absurd Suddenly Marjorie slipped off the table and going over to Dorothy threw her arms round her impulsively I m so sorry Dollikins she cried snuggling up against her Sorry for what asked Dorothy in a weak voice That he got lost I I know she added Know what asked Dorothy her voice still weaker That you re keen on him I m not Dorothy sniffed I m not so there Again she sniffed and Marjorie with the wisdom of her sex was silent wondering how long she would be able to stand the tickling of Dorothy s tears as they coursed down her cheeks At the end of a fortnight Sir Lyster Grayne decided to close John Dene s offices and Dorothy returned to the Admiralty resuming her former position but thanks to Sir Bridgman North s intervention her salary remained the same as before John Dene s disappearance All the girls were greatly interested in what they called John Dene s vanishing trick Dorothy became weary of answering their questions and parrying their not ill natured impertinences Sometimes she felt she must scream Everybody she encountered seemed to think it necessary to refer to the very subject she would have wished left unmentioned One day she had encountered Sir Bridgman North in one of the corridors Recognising her he had stopped to enquire if she were still receiving her full salary Then with a cheery I don t want to be gingered up when the good John Dene returns he had passed on with a smile and a salute At home it was the same A pall of depression seemed to have descended upon the little flat missus West tactfully refrained from asking questions but Dorothy was conscious that John Dene was never very far from her thoughts Their week end excursions had lost their savour and they both recognised how much John Dene had become part of their lives Sometimes when Dorothy was in bed tears would refuse to be forced back however hard she strove against them Then she would become angry with herself jump out of bed dab her eyes with a wet towel and return to bed and start counting sheep until the very thought of mutton seemed to drive her mad mister Blair she hated the sight of he was so obviously satisfied with the course of events Sometimes she found herself longing for the return of John Dene merely that he might ginger up Sir Lyster s private secretary Week after week passed and no news The volume of questions in the House died down and finally disappeared altogether The state of affairs at Scotland Yard returned to the normal Newspapers ceased to refer either to John Dene or to his disappearance and the tide of war flowed on Marshal Foch had struck his great blow and had followed it up with others The stream of Hun invasion had been stemmed and slowly France and Belgium were being cleared mister Montagu Naylor s comings and goings continued to interest Department Z and Apthorpe Road was still in the grip of the workman Day by day Dorothy seemed to grow more listless It was the heat she explained to missus West whilst Marjorie nodded her wise little head but said nothing Whenever she saw Dorothy she always talked John Dene as she expressed it to herself She could see that it was a relief You see Rojjie darling I should always be a little afraid of him said Dorothy one day as they sat in John Dene s room I suppose that is why I She paused Marjorie nodded understandingly and continued to swing a dainty grey stockinged leg You you see continued Dorothy a little wistfully I ve always had to do the taking care of and he Again she broke off Then suddenly jumping up she cried Let s go to the pictures Bother John Dene and Marjorie smiled a little smile that was really her own Finally there came the time when for a fortnight Dorothy would have no one to say to her either come or go and she and missus West went to Bournemouth Dorothy inwardly dreading two weeks with nothing to do II Whilst the John Dene sensation was slowly fading from the public mind Malcolm Sage was continuing with unabated energy the task he had set himself He was aware that Finlay was being watched even more closely than John Dene had been watched and Sage realised that it was in all probability impossible for him to communicate with headquarters By an ingenious device however Finlay had at length succeeded in establishing contact with Department Z It had been reported to Sage that on two occasions Finlay had been seen to leave behind him at restaurants a silver mounted ebony walking stick He had however always returned for it a few minutes later as if having discovered his loss Learning that the stick was of an ordinary stock pattern Malcolm Sage gave instructions for one exactly like it to be purchased An endeavour was then to be made to effect an exchange with that carried by Finlay It was not until a week later that this was effected and the stick handed to Thompson A careful examination disclosed nothing The silver nob and ferrule were removed but without bringing to light anything in the nature of a communication It s a wash out sir said Thompson as he entered Malcolm Sage s room the stick in one hand and the knob and ferrule in the other Sage glanced up from his desk Holding out his hand he took the stick and proceeded to examine it with elaborate care The wood at the top just beneath the knob had been hollowed out Sage glanced up at Thompson interrogatingly Nothing in it sir he said interpreting the question There will be when you next make the exchange was the dry retort and with a motion of dismissal Malcolm Sage returned to the papers before him What s the matter Tommy enquired Gladys Norman a few minutes later as she came across Thompson gazing at the hollowed out end of a stick and murmuring to himself with suppressed passion I m the biggest fool in London said Thompson without looking up Only just discovered it she asked casually Poor old Tommikins she added prepared to dodge at the least sign of an offensive movement on the part of her colleague but Thompson was too engrossed in introspective analysis to be conscious of what was taking place about him We re on the eve of developments said Malcolm Sage one afternoon some weeks later as Colonel Walton entered his room closing the door behind him Anything new he enquired dropping into a chair beside Sage s table I m afraid there s going to be trouble Not resigning there was a twinkle in Colonel Walton s eye In their infinite variety the resignations of Malcolm Sage would have filled a Blue Book I don t like the look of things continued Sage pulling steadily at his pipe and ignoring the remark Naylor s playing his own game I m sure and he added looking up suddenly it s an ugly game Bluff that accusing Finlay of acting on his own about John Dene Malcolm Sage nodded his head slowly several times For some minutes he continued to smoke with a mechanical precision that with him always betokened anxiety It s the dug out business I don t like he said at length Colonel Walton nodded You think he queried Sage nodded his face was unusually grave During the previous week it had been discovered that mister Naylor was having constructed in his back garden a dug out to which to retire in case of air raids and he was himself assisting with the work of excavation Finlay had confirmed Malcolm Sage s suggestion that Naylor was suspicious There had been a quarrel between the two which had taken place through intermediaries Naylor had accused Finlay of being responsible for the disappearance of John Dene Finlay had responded by a like accusation and the threat of serious consequences to Naylor when the facts were known in a certain quarter We ve got to speed up Malcolm Sage addressed the remark apparently to the thumbnail of his left hand Colonel Walton nodded I don t like that dug out business at all continued Sage The changing of the site too he added Had they got far with the first one enquired Colonel Walton About five feet down but they haven t filled it in yet Colonel Walton looked up quickly His face was grave Naylor says they must get the dug out finished first in case of a raid He can fill in the old hole at any time A dug out after nearly four years of raids Exactly said Sage that and the unfilled hole and Naylor s own activities He broke off significantly About the reward It would be awkward if Come in Colonel Walton broke off at the sound of a knock at the door Thompson entered with an ebony walking stick in one hand a silver knob and a small piece of paper in the other He held out the paper to Malcolm Sage who with a motion of his head indicated Colonel Walton He was very punctilious in such matters Colonel Walton took the slip of paper and read aloud Arrest me late to night and have me taken to Tower Slip the dogs to morrow certain delay dangerous J F For fully a minute the three men were silent Colonel Walton began to draw diagrams upon his blotting pad Malcolm Sage gazed at his finger nails whilst Thompson stood stiffly erect his face pale and his mouth rigid Presently Sage looked up I m afraid there ll be no spring mattress for you to night Thompson he said I ll ring in a few minutes and Thompson drew a sigh of relief as he turned towards the door which a moment afterwards closed behind him We can t do it to night announced Sage with decision Colonel Walton shook his head He must take the risk until the morning continued Sage You ll be here until it s all through he interrogated Colonel Walton nodded When thoughtful he was more than usually sparing of words About the reward he interrogated as Sage rose and moved towards the door We ll withdraw it in to morrow evening s papers was the response if you agree Again Colonel Walton nodded and Malcolm Sage went out bent on reminding Scotland Yard of his existence CHAPTER XVII MALCOLM SAGE CASTS HIS NET I I m afraid there ll be trouble with the people at the Tower remarked Malcolm Sage who with the aid of his briar pipe was doing his best to reduce the visibility Zero is noon mused Colonel Walton Sage nodded They ll begin to drift in about twelve thirty he continued puffing placidly at his cigar Well it s been interesting and it ll give the Skipper a sort of joy day with the War Cabinet said Sage quietly To morrow ought to be rather a large breakfast party he added drily He had the wind up rather badly at one time Celt was Sage s comment Colonel Walton nodded For some minutes the two smoked in silence I hope they won t start any of that O B E business said Sage at length Sure to It will be a triumph for the Skipper continued Colonel Walton He deserves it said Sage ungrudgingly He s always believed in us By the way I told Hoyle to bring Finlay here after they had got Naylor Colonel Walton continued to puff contentedly at his cigar Early that morning Malcolm Sage had given final instructions to the various members of his staff He and Colonel Walton had been working all through the night in perfecting their plans The demands made upon Scotland Yard for men had at first evoked surprise which later developed into sotto voce ridicule What the devil s up with old Sage and Onions Inspector Crabbett had muttered as he cast his eyes down the list of plain clothes and uniformed officers required Who the devil s going to issue all these warrants Department Z however had its own means of obtaining such warrants as were required without questions being asked Early that morning Malcolm Sage had got through to Inspector Crabbett That you Inspector he enquired What s left of me was the surly retort Got that little list of mine enquired Sage We re engaging new men as fast as we can so as to have enough was the grumbling reply I ve asked the W O to demobilise a few divisions to help us he added with ponderous sarcasm Thank you said Sage imperturbably as he replaced the receiver mister Montagu Naylor had been reserved for Department Z Sage was determined to get him alive but his knowledge of the man was sufficient to tell him that mister Naylor was equally determined never to be taken alive He had seen that little corrugated iron covered building at the Tower that had once been a miniature rifle range and involuntarily he had shuddered II Was that the telephone mister Naylor barked the question down from the first floor There was a pad pad of feet and missus Naylor appeared from the basement Yes she replied timidly Shall I go No I ll go myself and mister Naylor descended the stairs heavily Passing into his study he closed the door behind him and seated himself at the table Hullo he called into the mouthpiece lifting off the receiver Is that twelve Haymarket came the reply No was the suave response This is mister Montagu Naylor of Apthorpe Road Streatham You re on to the wrong number and with that he replaced his receiver pulled out his watch and scowled at the dial The hands pointed to half past eleven With a muttered exclamation and a murmur about a taxi mister Naylor stamped out of the room just as missus Naylor was leaving the dining room She shrank back as if expecting to be struck Back about two he grunted Keep that damned dog tied up I ll see to it said missus Naylor in a voice that seemed to come through cotton wool Since post time that morning mister Naylor s temper had been bad even for him An intimation had come from the local police station to the effect that several complaints had been made of the savage nature and aggressive disposition of a dog he was alleged to keep on his premises The officer who had been sent round to call attention to this fact on the previous day had been prevented from entering the garden by the valiant defence put up by James himself mister Naylor had been out at the time of the call and missus Naylor had not dared to tell him of the constable s visit and discomfiture Department Z was taking no risks where James was concerned During the whole of breakfast strange sounds had rumbled in mister Naylor s throat whilst on one occasion when he happened to catch missus Naylor s eye he glared so ferociously at her that she let the lid of the teapot fall with a crash into a fast filling cup With this the volcano had burst and the grumbles in mister Naylor s larynx matured into deep throated oaths and execrations Three times he had descended to the basement from whence his voice could be heard in passionate protest against any and every thing he encountered missus Naylor had gone about the house with the air of one convinced of disaster Susan as usual succeeded in shuffling out of the way just as mister Naylor appeared As the front door banged behind him mister Naylor s scowl lifted as by magic giving place to an expression of benignant geniality befitting a prominent and respected citizen mister Naylor managed the distance to the Haymarket in the time without involving a taxi thus greatly improving his temper He was a man who grudged unnecessary expense and all expense not directly connected with the delights of the table was to his way of thinking unnecessary That morning just as Big Ben was booming out the tenth stroke of noon a commotion was observed to take place outside the Pall Mall Restaurant Suddenly four men precipitated themselves upon a fifth who was walking calmly and peaceably towards Coventry Street In a flash he was handcuffed and thrown somebody called out Police but before anyone had properly realised what was happening a motor car had drawn up and the handcuffed man was bundled into it struggling vainly against the rope with which his legs had been quickly bound When a policeman arrived it was to be told by an excited group of spectators that a man had been assaulted and kidnapped in broad daylight Thus was mister Montagu Naylor of Streatham secured and conducted to the Tower there eventually to make acquaintance with the miniature rifle range Whilst mister Naylor was rapidly nearing the place of the most remarkable appointment he had ever kept James was reduced to a state of frenzy by several strange men in the adjoining back gardens They were according to their own account given to the residents whose houses flanked that of mister Naylor engaged upon survey work The instruments they had with them seemed to give colour to their words The apathy of the workmen who for the last few days had surrendered Apthorpe Road to others different from themselves only in that they belonged to another union and brought with them a steam roller instead of picks and shovels seemed suddenly to develop into an unusual activity Immediately after the departure of mister Naylor the asphalt of the footpath just in front of his gate was picked up with an energy that merited rebuke from any self respecting father of the chapel A few minutes later a man knocked at mister Naylor s door and stated that it would be necessary to dig up the path leading to the front door At this information a look of fear sprang into missus Naylor s eyes She was terrified of deciding anything in mister Naylor s absence When the men announced that it would be necessary to descend to the basement she shook her head violently No no she cried mister Naylor is away Come again this afternoon It was pointed out to her that the afternoon might be too late something had gone wrong with the gas and if they waited until the afternoon anything might happen The man was respectful but insistent He so played upon missus Naylor s fears by hinting darkly at the possibility of there being nothing for mister Naylor to return to by the afternoon unless the gas meter were immediately seen to that she consented to allow a man to descend to the basement after being told that it would not be necessary for him to go into any of the rooms First however she insisted that she must go down and see that everything was tidy After a lapse of five minutes she returned but when four men presented themselves prepared to descend the stairs she resolutely refused Very well mum said the foreman we ll see what the police can do Just pop round to the police station Bill and bring a copper he said to a mate Sooner ave the ole bloomin street blown up than let us go down and dirty your stairs There was in his voice all the indignation of the outraged British workman missus Naylor wavered The word police had for her a peculiar and terrifying significance You you only want to go in the passage she said That ll do us mum said the foreman You stay up ere Bill he added turning to the man he had instructed to go for the police missus Naylor led the way to the lower regions unconscious that not three but seven men were following her the last four with rubber soled boots She had scarcely taken a step along the passage at the foot of the basement stairs when her arms were gripped from behind and a pad held over her mouth She struggled against the sweet smelling sickly fumes then the relaxing of her limbs told that she had temporarily left for realms where mister Naylor was not The basement was composed of a kitchen immediately on the right of the stairs and a breakfast room the entrance to which lay a few paces along the passage At the end of the passage was a door leading into the area Without a sound the men divided themselves one went to the area door two remained by the kitchen door where Susan could be heard clattering crockery whilst the other four stood outside the door leading to the breakfast room One of them gently turned the handle it was locked He made a signal to the two men at the kitchen door One quietly entered A moment later Susan looked up with a start to find herself gazing down the barrel of an automatic pistol whilst before her eyes was presented a card on which was printed Come and make the signal to get the door of the breakfast room open otherwise you will be shot For a fraction of a second she hesitated then a strange light flashed into her eyes suggestive half of cunning half of relief and with an understanding nod she walked to the breakfast room door One of the men placed her in such a position that she would not be in the way of the entrance of the others when the door was opened Very deliberately she knocked and paused knock knock knock pause knock knock They waited breathlessly The sound of a key being cautiously turned was presently heard A moment after a line of white appeared beside the green paint of the door as it was slowly and cautiously opened Then a score of things seemed to happen at once The waiting men threw themselves into the room the man at the end of the passage dashed out into the area he who had been left at the kitchen door rushed into the back yard and whistled The breakfast room was in total darkness but for the brilliant electric torches carried by the assailants For a moment there was wild confusion a shot was fired and then all was quiet Got him Thompson It was Malcolm Sage who spoke but from a physical substance that was not Malcolm Sage Got them and it sir was the response Are you hit Only in the arm sir Nothing to write home about was the cheery response Here switch on the light someone said Malcolm Sage and a moment after there was a click and a three lamp electrolier burst into light Get a window open Thompson thrust all that greenery stuff out cried Malcolm Sage Right sir With the aid of the fire irons mister Montagu Naylor s little greenhouse was soon demobilised and lay a heap of ruins in the area That s better murmured Malcolm Sage What a stink He then turned to an examination of the room The window had been blocked up with a sort of glass case on which shelves had been built and flower pots placed This had the effect not only of cutting off all communications from outside except from the door but of preventing anyone from seeing into the room The atmosphere of the place was heavy and foetid as the only means of ventilation was the door There were three pallet beds a table and several chairs Malcolm Sage shuddered at the thought of living week after week under such conditions He turned to his prisoners On the floor lay two men handcuffed each with a member of the staff of Department Z sitting contentedly on his chest One was foaming at the mouth with suppressed fury the other a heavily built fellow lay apathetic In a corner upon one of the pallet beds sat a man looking about him in a dazed fashion It s all right mister Dene said Malcolm Sage We ll attend to you in a minute Then turning to Thompson he said Get these fellows up into the car Keep the two women here under guard Then we ll see to your arm Right sir said Thompson The arrival of three closed motor cars outside The Cedars had aroused some interest among the residents of Apthorpe Road The absence of flowers from the lamps and the buttonholes of the chauffeurs negatived the idea of a wedding and three cars were scarcely necessary to take mister Naylor s small household for a holiday A group of neighbours and errand boys gathered outside mister Naylor s gate The windows opposite and on each side were manned in force Presently the onlookers were astonished to see two handcuffed men half carried half dragged out of the house and hurried into the first car They were followed by two more of the men who a few minutes before had been engaged in picking up mister Naylor s path As soon as they were in the car these men proceeded to fetter their two prisoners Apthorpe Road gasped its astonishment In the breakfast room Malcolm Sage drew a chair up to the man seated on the bed seemingly quite unconscious of what was happening Leaning forward he lifted one of his eyelids then turned to the others who stood round Dope was all he said There was an angry murmur from the others For a moment Malcolm Sage sat looking at the wasted form of what once might have been John Dene of Toronto Then he turned to Thompson quite unrecognisable as the foreman gas mechanic whose arm was being bandaged with a field dressing Take him in one of the cars to Sir Bryllith Riley and explain He s expecting you Do exactly as he orders Take Rogers with you and then get your wound seen to Sir Bryllith Riley was the great specialist in nervous disorders who had made a special study of the drug habit Without a word Thompson left the room followed two of the workmen who had raised the patient to his feet Then half leading half carrying they took him from the room The crowd of spectators which had been considerably reinforced received its second thrill that morning at the sight of a short sturdily built man apparently drunk being helped into the second car They noticed that he blinked violently in the sunlight and those who were near enough saw that his eyes were watering profusely One or two of the more observant observed that he stumbled as he entered the taxi and would have fallen but for those supporting him The second car immediately drove off A few minutes later two more men left The Cedars and entered the third car which with the first then drove off leaving mister Naylor s residence in the charge of the survey men and two of the workmen In the back garden James was having a meal it was to be his last I should like a smoke chief I left my pipe behind said one of the men in the third car as he took from his pocket a pair of gold rimmed spectacles and proceeded to put them on Here try one of these and a gold mounted cigar case was passed towards him a case that seemed strangely out of keeping with the corduroys of the owner Well it s been a happy day said Malcolm Sage as he proceeded to light the cigar Colonel Walton had given him I hope the other fellows have got their lot said the Chief of Department Z as the car ran into the High Road Trust them was the answer Finlay wouldn t let Naylor escape him I should like to know what they re saying at the Tower he added a moment later From half past twelve until nearly two that day the officials at the Tower were kept busily occupied in receiving guests The appetite for lunch of the officer of the guard was entirely spoiled Where the deuce are we going to put them all he asked of one of his N C O s The man shook his head helplessly It might be a Rowton s lodging house grumbled the officer as he made the twenty third entry in what he facetiously called the Goods Received Book Damn the war III Well Thompson remarked Colonel Walton with a smile you have earned A wound stripe interrupted Sage Thompson grinned as he looked down at his right arm resting in a sling It was meant for mister Dene sir he said I just got there in time It was that ferret eyed little blighter he added without the slightest suggestion of animosity Thompson was a sportsman taking and giving hard knocks with philosophic good humour Plucky little devil murmured Malcolm Sage He bit and scratched with the utmost impartiality Malcolm Sage and Thompson were seated in Colonel Walton s room discussing the events of the morning We were only just in time said Sage Finlay was right Colonel Walton nodded It was dope sir Thompson looked from Colonel Walton to Malcolm Sage Sir Bryllith said he ll be months in a home Yes said Sage He won t be fit to answer questions for a long time Been doped all the time nearly three months If there s nothing more began Thompson No Thompson go and get a sleep said Colonel Walton Look after that arm and take things easy for a few days Thank you sir said Thompson but I m afraid I ve forgotten the way and with a grin he went out You ve wirelessed asked Colonel Walton The whole story They re bound to pick it up at Auchinlech And the Skipper Oh just what we actually know I should say responded Sage and Colonel Walton nodded his agreement They re puzzled over those announcements withdrawing the reward said Sage a few minutes later We ought to be hearing from the Skipper soon He s already been through while you were changing I m going round at five You re coming too added Colonel Walton as he lighted a fresh cigar What about Finlay Gone home to see his wife said Sage He s as domesticated as a Persian kitten he added with all the superiority of a confirmed bachelor In another room Gladys Norman was fussing over a wounded hero Poor ickle Tommikins she crooned as she sat on the arm of his chair and rumpled the hair of Special Service Officer Thompson Did ums hurt ums poor ickle arm Brave boy and then she bent down and kissed him lightly on the cheek whereat Thompson blushed crimson Department Z makes its traditions as it goes along Malcolm Sage had once said It s more natural CHAPTER XVIII THE RETURN OF JOHN DENE It s very strange murmured Sir Lyster Grayne as he raised his eyes from an official looking document What are the official figures for the last six weeks Heyworth he enquired Seven certainties and two doubtful was the reply About normal then Admiral Heyworth nodded Then why the devil should the Hun get the wind up demanded Sir Bridgman a look of puzzlement taking the place of the usual smile in his eyes What does the I D say That during the last four weeks thirty seven U boats have failed to return to their bases as they should have done replied Admiral Heyworth referring to a buff coloured paper before him That leaves twenty eight in the air said Sir Bridgman more to himself than to the others Sir Lyster nodded thoughtfully No wonder they re getting the wind up mused Sir Bridgman The I D says that Kiel and Wilhelmshaven are in a state of panic said Admiral Heyworth It s damned funny remarked Sir Bridgman thoughtfully Structural defects won t explain it He looked interrogatingly across at Admiral Heyworth who shook his head in negation It might of course be wangle murmured Sir Bridgman Sir Lyster shook his head decidedly The I D says no he remarked They re doing everything they can to keep it dark Well it s damned funny repeated Sir Bridgman What does L J say He s as puzzled as the rest of us said Sir Lyster in response He s making enquiries through Department Z There was the merest suggestion of patronage in Sir Lyster s voice at the mention of Department Z Sir Bridgman lit a cigarette then after a short silence Sir Lyster said tentatively I suppose it isn t the Americans Impossible said Sir Bridgman You can t base ships on ether and we were bound to know besides frankness is their strong point They are almost aggressively open he added I began Sir Lyster then paused It s damned funny murmured Sir Bridgman for the third time Well I must buzz off he added rising I shall see you at L J s this afternoon It s a conference I think said Sir Lyster Walton is to tell us what has been discovered Again there was the note of patronage in his voice Well said Sir Bridgman I ll try and prevent it spoiling my lunch and he stretched his big frame lazily By the way he remarked turning to Sir Lyster did you see about that convoy a hundred miles off its course bleating like a lost goat to know where it was It might have been very serious said Sir Lyster gravely Oh the luck of the navy laughed Sir Bridgman We have to do it all even teach the other fellows their job Mark it Grayne we shall take over the whole blessed country before we ve finished then perhaps they ll raise our screws and with that he left the room Two minutes later his cheery laugh was heard outside again as he enquired of mister Blair if it were true that he was going to double the reward for the discovery of John Dene A moment later he rejoined Sir Lyster and Admiral Heyworth I forgot about that flying boat business he said and soon the three were engaged in a technical discussion For more than three months mister Blair had known peace He had been able to walk leisurely across saint James s Park from his chambers in saint Mary s Mansions pause for a moment to look at the pelicans dwell upon the memory of past social engagements and anticipate those to come receive the salute of the policeman at the door of the Admiralty and the respectful bows of the attendants within and walk up the stairs and along the corridors to his room conscious that in his heart was an abiding peace It was true that a war raged in various parts of the world and that mister Blair s work brought him constantly into close touch with the horrors of that war but it was all so far away and his was a nature that permitted the contemplation of such matters with philosophical detachment A scorched shirt front an ill ironed collar or an omelette that was not all an omelette should be bulked vastly more in mister Blair s imagination than the fall of Kut the over running of Roumania or the tragedy of Caporetto National disaster he could bear with a stoical calm befitting in a man of long ancestry but personal discomfort reduced him to a state of acute nervousness The Hun ravaged Belgium invaded Russia over ran Lombardy mister Blair was appropriately shocked and on occasion expressed his indignation in a restrained and well bred manner but John Dene crashing in upon the atmosphere of intellectual quiet and material content with which mister Blair was surrounded ravaged his nerves and produced in him something of a mental palpitation Therefore of the two events the irruptions of John Dene were infinitely more disturbing to mister Blair than those of the hordes of the modern Attila mister Blair sat at his table pen in hand before him a pad of virgin blotting paper His thoughts had wandered back to a dinner party at which he had been present the previous night His eyes were fixed upon an antique family ring he wore upon the fourth finger of his left hand The dinner had been a success a conspicuous success He was conscious of having shone by virtue of the tactful way in which he had parried certain direct and rather impertinent questions of a professional nature addressed to him by one of the guests They related to the disappearance of John Dene mister Blair had experienced an additional gratification from the discovery that he had been able to hear mentioned the name of John Dene without experiencing an inward thrill of misgiving As he sat this morning pen in hand he pondered over the subject of John Dene in relation to himself Reginald Blair Possibly he had been a little weak in not standing more upon his dignity with this rough and uncouth colonial In such cases a bold and determined front was all that was necessary Of course there would have been one great contest and mister Blair detested such things but yes he had been weak In future he Here who the hell s shut my offices and where s Miss West The pen slipped from mister Blair s limp hand and his jaw dropped as he found himself gazing up into the angry eyes of John Dene who had entered the room like a tornado This ain t a seal tank and it s not feeding time cried John Dene angrily Who s shut my offices Then with a sudden look in the direction of the door he called out Here come in Jasp mister Blair looked more than ever like a seal as he gazed stupidly at John Dene His eyes widened at the uncouth appearance of Spotty Quinton mister Blair started violently as Spotty seeing the fireplace expectorated towards it with astonishing accuracy Spotty could always be depended upon to observe the rules of good breeding in such matters When a room possessed a fireplace the ornaments and carpet were always safe as far as he was concerned mister Blair gazed stupidly at his visitors I I he stammered Without a word John Dene turned strode across the room and opening Sir Lyster s door disappeared closing the door behind him with a bang Sir Lyster was in the act of reaching across the table for a letter that Sir Bridgman was handing him Both men turned to see the cause of the interruption Sir Bridgman dropped the letter and Sir Lyster slowly withdrew his arm as he gazed in a dazed manner at John Dene Sir Bridgman was the first to recover from his surprise Why it s John Dene he cried heartily as he rose and grasped the interrupter s hand Where the deuce have you been hiding all this time What the hell have you done with that girl and who s closed my offices demanded John Dene looking from Sir Bridgman to the First Lord Girl what girl enquired Sir Lyster Miss West snapped John Dene Miss West repeated Sir Lyster vaguely then memory suddenly coming to his aid he added weakly Yes I remember She became your secretary John Dene regarded him steadily Sir Bridgman hid a smile he always enjoyed a situation that brought Sir Lyster into antagonism with John Dene Yes but that don t help any cried John Dene irascibly Where is she now Really mister Dene began Sir Lyster stiffly when his gaze suddenly became fixed on the door which had opened slowly whilst round the corner appeared the unprepossessing features of Spotty Quinton Following the direction of Sir Lyster s eyes John Dene saw his henchman Come right in Jasp he cried and Spotty sidled round the door cap in hand Catching sight of the fireplace he expectorated neatly into it Sir Lyster stared at him as if he had suddenly appeared from another planet This is Jasp Quinton one of my boys announced John Dene looking from Sir Lyster to Sir Bridgman with a take it or leave it air Sir Bridgman advanced a step and held out his hand which Spotty clasped warmly first however wiping his hand on the leg of his trousers with the air of a man unaccustomed to his hands being in a fit condition for the purpose of greeting Pleased to meet you said Spotty briefly How s the Destroyer asked Sir Bridgman with some eagerness Ruddy miracle said Spotty as he once more got the fireplace dead in the centre Sir Lyster seemed temporarily to have lost the power of speech He gazed at Quinton as if hypnotised by the inequality of his complexion When he expectorated Sir Lyster s eyes wandered from Spotty to the fireplace as if to assure himself that a bull had really been registered At last by an obvious effort he turned to John Dene I congratulate you upon your escape he said but I thought you were too ill to My escape replied John Dene Yes from that place where was it North He turned to Sir Bridgman Streatham Ah yes Streatham I ve been up north sending Huns to merry hell where I d like to send the whole Admiralty outfit was the uncompromising retort I ve come into contact with some fools John Dene broke off Shutting up my offices he muttered But began Sir Lyster then paused I ve been over to Chiswick and she s not there flat s shut continued John Dene Chiswick repeated Sir Lyster Whose flat missus West s and you ve shut my offices he added with the air of one unwilling to relinquish an obvious grievance But I understood that you had just been released from a house in Streatham persisted Sir Lyster Well there s a good many mutts in this place who ve been released too soon You re talking about Jim Jim repeated Sir Lyster Jim who My brother They were all after me good and hard so Jim came along and I just slipped up north with your man Then you were the fellow with red hair all over him laughed Sir Bridgman Sure was the laconic reply They were out for me he continued a moment later and I d never have got away Jim didn t mind But where is he now asked Sir Lyster He s probably the John Dene that they think was released from that place in Streatham suggested Sir Bridgman Jim s all right said John Dene but where s Miss West and my keys At that moment the telephone bell rang Sir Lyster lifted the receiver from the rest and listened Yes that s all right thank you Blair he said then turning to John Dene he added mister Blair has your keys and he also has Miss West s address at Bournemouth Here come on Jasp cried John Dene just as Spotty was in the act of letting fly at the fireplace for the sixth time He turned a reproachful gaze upon his chief But the Destroyer broke in Admiral Bridgman She has been doing her bit said John Dene grimly She s refitting now I m off to Bournemouth and Spotty s going north to night with some indents mister Dene began Sir Lyster in his most impressive manner your patriotism has Here forget it and with that John Dene was gone followed by his lieutenant leaving Sir Lyster Sir Bridgman and Admiral Heyworth gazing at the door that closed behind him As Spotty passed mister Blair he turned and thrusting his face forward growled Ruddy tyke It was his way of indicating loyalty to his chief but it spoiled mister Blair s lunch For some moments after John Dene had gone Sir Lyster and Sir Bridgman and Admiral Heyworth gazed at each other without speaking Do you think it s drink Grayne or only the heat Sir Bridgman laughed Sir Lyster winced and looked across at him as a man might at a boy who has just blown a trumpet in his ear Without replying he lifted the telephone receiver from its rest Get me through to the Prime Minister What s that Yes Sir Bridgman s here Very well we ll come round at once As he replaced the receiver he rose The Prime Minister would like us to step round he said Walton and Sage are there It s about John Dene Seen John Dene asked Sir Bridgman of mister Blair as they passed through the room You d better apply for that twenty thousand pounds Blair Sir Lyster wondered why Sir Bridgman persisted in his jokes however much they might have become frayed at the edges When they entered mister Llewellyn John s room it was to find him a veritable aurora borealis of smiles He was obviously in the best of spirits John Dene has been found he cried before his callers had taken the chairs to which he waved them We left poor Blair with the same conviction laughed Sir Bridgman Then you know I telephoned Sir Lyster said Colonel Walton mister Dene has only just left us explained Sir Lyster He was extremely annoyed at the closing of his office and the disappearance of his secretary But mister Llewellyn John looked from Colonel Walton to Malcolm Sage and then on to Sir Lyster in bewilderment Perhaps Sage suggested Colonel Walton You d better tell the story Sage as Colonel Walton suggests said mister Llewellyn John There is an official report in preparation said Colonel Walton mister Llewellyn John nodded In the course of the next half hour Malcolm Sage kept his hearers in a state of breathless interest by the story of the coming and going of John Dene as known to Department Z I gave mister Dene the credit of being possessed of more than the ordinary amount of what he calls head filling began Sage but I didn t realise at first that he possessed a twin brother but I ll begin at the beginning When you turned over the matter to Department Z continued Malcolm Sage we made exhaustive inquiries and discovered that the Huns were determined to prevent the Destroyer from putting to sea and they were prepared at any cost to stop mister Dene from going north In Canada and on the way over they made attempts upon his life but then as so frequently happens they became the victims of divided councils They wanted the plans Thanks to er certain happenings they learned that the Destroyer would not sail without mister Dene How interpolated mister Llewellyn John They obtained the guarantee I remember said mister Llewellyn John it was stolen mister Dene used to leave his safe open with such papers in it as he wanted the enemy to see That s what he meant when on one occasion he said If you ve got a hungry dog feed it Sir Bridgman North laughed Sir Lyster turned to him reproachfully mister Dene became convinced that an effort would be made to kidnap and hold him to ransom the price being the plans of the Destroyer Department Z also became convinced of this but at a later date As a precaution John Dene sent to England by another ship his twin brother known as James Grant When everything was ready the two changed places that accounted for the strangeness of manner that Miss West noticed with mister Dene a few days before his disappearance Malcolm Sage then went on to explain the method by which the false John Dene had been kidnapped and of Department Z s discovery with relation to mister Montagu Naylor But all that time what happened to the Destroyer The Destroyer was responsible for the extraordinary increase in the mortality among U boats mister Llewellyn John jumped from his chair as if he had been thrown up by a hidden spring But but he began mister Dene hit upon a clever ruse continued Sage and But the advertisements Did you know this at the time It was known at Department Z sir and the advertisements were to convince the Hun of our eagerness to find John Dene so that we might start operations I see I see cried mister Llewellyn John but how on earth did you ferret all this out We just sat down sir and waited for the other side to make mistakes said Malcolm Sage quietly just as the Opposition does in the House of Commons he added slyly And mister Llewellyn John smiled It was better to say nothing about the Finlay business said Malcolm Sage as he and Colonel Walton walked back to saint James s Square It s results they re concerned with Colonel Walton nodded We must see John Dene however he said If only for the good of his own soul said Sage as he knocked his pipe against a railing CHAPTER XIX COMMANDER JOHN DENE GOES TO BOURNEMOUTH I Late one afternoon when Dorothy and missus West were walking along the Christchurch Road on their way back to the boarding house for dinner Dorothy suddenly gave vent to an exclamation and with both hands clutched her mother s arm so fiercely that she winced with the pain Look mother she cried it s Following the direction of her daughter s eyes missus West saw walking sturdily towards them on the other side of the road a man in the uniform of a naval commander In his mouth was a cigar from which he was puffing volumes of smoke With a little cry missus West recognised him It was John Dene of Toronto There was no mistaking that truculent aggressive air of a man who knows his own mind and is determined that every one else shall know it too Suddenly Dorothy released her mother s arm and running across the road planted herself directly in John Dene s path mister Dene she cried when he was within a yard or two of her Several passers by turned their heads For a fraction of a moment John Dene gazed at the apparition in front of him not recognising Dorothy in the white frock and large hat that shaded her eyes Then with what was to him a super smile he held out his hand Say this is bully he cried giving Dorothy a grip that caused her to wince I ve just been to your apartment house and found you out Then catching sight of missus West Why there s your mother he cried and gripping Dorothy s arm with an enthusiasm that she was convinced would leave bruises he guided her across the road A moment later missus West was having the greatest difficulty in preserving a straight face under John Dene s vigorous greeting I ve been chasing all over Robin Hood s barn to find you he cried still clasping missus West s hand And according to the papers other people have been doing the same with you said Dorothy deciding in her own mind that John Dene ought to spend the rest of his life in uniform It gave him a distinction that hitherto he had lacked in the ill cut and ill made clothes he habitually wore I found these waiting for me at my hotel he said looking down at himself as if divining her thoughts I ordered them way back he added You look very nice mister Dene said missus West smiling happily She had not yet recovered from her surprise All the girls are turning and envying mother and me said Dorothy mischievously Envying you John Dene turned upon her a look of interrogation For being with you she explained For some reason John Dene s face fell missus West hastened to the rescue We ve all been so anxious about you she smiled We we thought And shall I get twenty thousand pounds if I give you up to a policeman asked Dorothy She felt she wanted to cry from sheer happiness Reward s withdrawn Haven t you seen the papers he said practically but they nearly did for Jim he added inconsequently Jim repeated Dorothy Who is Jim My brother was the reply He took my place and I went north Oooooooh Gradually light was dawning upon Dorothy Then it wasn t you who forgot where the stamps were kept and she added wickedly seemed to disapprove of me so Disapprove of you John Dene managed to precipitate such a wealth of meaning into the words that Dorothy felt herself blushing furiously Even missus West appeared a little embarrassed at his directness Here it s about time we had some food he said turning his wrist to see the time We were just going home to dinner said missus West Won t you come with us I want you to come right along to my hotel I ve booked a table for you That s not very complimentary to our attractiveness mister Dene said Dorothy Again John Dene turned to her with a puzzled look in his eyes You should have assumed that two such desirable people as mother and me were dining out every night shouldn t he mother John Dene turned to missus West his brows meeting in a frown of uncertainty Dorothy will never be serious she explained with a little sigh She s only joking whereat John Dene s face cleared and without further ado he hailed a taxi As Sir Bridgman North had said John Dene never waited to be contradicted That evening many of the diners at the Imperial turned their heads in the direction of a table at which sat a man in the uniform of a naval commander a fair haired girl and a little white haired lady the happiness of whose face seemed to arouse responsive smiles in those who gazed at her Slowly and haltingly John Dene told of what had happened since that Wednesday night some three months before when his brother had taken his place Although John Dene never hesitated when telling of what he was going to do he seemed to experience considerable difficulty in narrating what he had actually done And aren t you happy enquired Dorothy her eyes sparkling with excitement at the story of what the Destroyer her Destroyer had done Sure he replied looking straight into her eyes whereat she dropped her gaze to the peach upon her plate I feel very proud that I know you mister Dene said missus West her eyes moist with happiness Proud to know me he repeated and then as if missus West s statement held some subtle humour that he alone had seen he smiled Why do you smile asked Dorothy looking up at him from beneath her lashes Well it tickled me some What did she demanded That anyone should be proud to know me he said simply Perhaps it s because you ve never gingered mother up said Dorothy pertly Dorothy missus West looked anxiously at John Dene but his eyes were on Dorothy And are you glad to know me he demanded Proud was the word corrected Dorothy playing with her fruit knife Glad will do he said watching her keenly Are you glad I m back You see I m your secretary she said demurely and I m I m paid to be glad aren t I John Dene s face fell When you get to know her better said missus West you will see that she only teases her friends And her poor mother put in Dorothy When do we resume work mister Dene she asked turning to him We ll go back to morrow a m he said obviously relieved at the suggestion But our holidays cried Dorothy in mock consternation You can have as long a vacation as you like when I m through was the answer and Dorothy drew a sigh of relief She was longing to get back to work That night she and missus West sat up until dawn was fingering the east talking of the miraculous reappearance of John Dene of Toronto as they leisurely packed ready for the morrow II For nearly an hour John Dene had sat in his chair listening From time to time he gave to the unlit half cigar in his mouth a rapid twirl with his tongue but beyond that he had manifested no sign of emotion Quietly and as succinctly as possible Malcolm Sage had gone over the happenings of the last few months telling of the discovery of mister Montagu Naylor s secret code how it had enabled Department Z to enlarge the scope of its operations how Finlay had hampered mister Naylor in his murderous intentions with regard to his prisoner by suggesting the displeasure that would be created in high quarters if anything happened to John Dene before the plans of the Destroyer had been secured I didn t figure on Jim getting corralled said John Dene at length That was where your reasoning was at fault was Malcolm Sage s quiet retort I warned him began John Dene then a moment later he added I d hate to have anything happen to Jim He seems all used up He ll be all right in a month or so said Colonel Walton reassuringly He s always sort of been around when I ve wanted things done has Jim continued John Dene with a note of real feeling in his voice He s a white man clean to the bone Malcolm Sage had already learned all he wanted to know with regard to James Dene Quiet taciturn seldom uttering more than a word or two at a time and then only when absolutely necessary he was entirely devoid of the brilliant qualities of his brother for whom however he possessed an almost dog like affection All their lives it had been John who had planned things and James who had stood admiringly by I was tickled to death about those advertisements said John Dene presently You probably thought we were barking up the wrong tree suggested Colonel Walton Sure until you put me wise We were trying to play into your hands and save your brother said Malcolm Sage as he knocked the ashes from his pipe against the heel of his boot and proceeded to stuff tobacco into the bowl If it hadn t been for those advertisements began John Dene then he paused The first hole dug in mister Naylor s back garden would have been filled in again said Sage quietly But how did they manage Jim after he d got into that taxi The driver released a multiple curtain that fell over his head As it dropped chloroform was sprayed over it Quite a simple automatic contrivance There was a look in John Dene s eyes that would have been instructive to mister Naylor could he have seen it They took him right out into the country continued Sage then brought him to and doped him He was taken to The Cedars between one and two the next morning That was where we picked up the scent again he added As Sage ceased speaking Colonel Walton offered his cigar case to John Dene who taking a cigar proceeded to light it By the way mister Dene said Sage casually do you remember some one treading on your toe at King s Cross the night you were going north You were quite annoyed about it John Dene nodded and looked across at Sage as if expecting something further That was one of our men But I told him to tread on your toe proceeded Malcolm Sage so that you might remember that Department Z was not quite so Now it gets me cried John Dene It was you who trod on my foot at the theatre At Chu Chin Chow said Malcolm Sage smiling Seems to be a sort of stunt of yours said John Dene as he rose Going mister Dene enquired Colonel Walton Yep he said as he shook hands with each in turn then with an air of conviction added I take it all back You d do well in T ronto and with a nod he went out I wonder if that s a testimonial to us or a reflection upon Toronto murmured Malcolm Sage as he polished his nails with a silk handkerchief What I like about colonials remarked Colonel Walton drily is their uncompromising directness Whilst John Dene was removing from the list of things that required gingering up Department Z and its two chiefs mister Llewellyn John was engaged in reading Commander Ryles s report upon the operations of the Destroyer It proved to be one of the most remarkable documents of the war First it described how the Destroyer had hung about the Danish coast but had been greatly embarrassed by the density of the water owing to the shallowness of the North Sea She had carefully to seek out the clear passages where the depth was sufficiently great to prevent the discolouration of water by sand After the first few weeks the Destroyer had been brought south there to catch U boats soon after they submerged That was where the Germans suffered their greatest losses Once the Destroyer had penetrated right into the Heligoland Bight her eyes enabling her to avoid submerged mines and entanglements Commander Ryles had himself witnessed the destruction of thirty four U boats Three times the Destroyer had returned to her base to re victual and recharge her batteries also to rest her crew At the termination of the third trip it had been decided that the boat was badly in need of a thorough overhaul and in accordance with the instructions received he had prepared his report and brought it south in order that he might deliver it in person to the First Lord When he had finished the lengthy document mister Llewellyn John laid it on the table beside him For some minutes he sat thinking Presently he pressed the knob of the bell As a secretary appeared he said Ring through to Sir Roger Flynn and tell him I shall be delighted if he can breakfast with me to morrow And mister Llewellyn John smiled CHAPTER XX JOHN DENE S PROPOSAL Marjorie Rogers had entered the outer office at Waterloo Place expecting to find Dorothy Instead John Dene sat half turned in her direction with one arm over the back of the chair She s gone home he said divining the cause of Marjorie s call The girl slipped into the room softly closing the door behind her and walked a hesitating step or two in John Dene s direction a picture of shy maidenhood Marjorie Rogers was an instinctive actress Gone home she repeated as a conversational opening Is she ill She gave him a look from beneath her lashes a look she had found equally deadly with subs and captains John Dene shook his head but continued to gaze at her He was a very difficult man to talk to Marjorie decided She had already come to the conclusion that she had been wrong in her suspicion that he made love to Dorothy You don t like us do you mister Dene She made a half step in his direction dropping her eyes and drawing in her under lip in a way that had once nearly caused a rear admiral to strike his colours Like who demanded John Dene wondering why the girl stayed now that he had told her Dorothy had gone home Us girls Marjorie flashed at him the sub captain look May I sit down she asked softly Sure John Dene was regarding her much as he might a blue zebra that had strayed into his office Thank you mister Dene Marjorie sat down crossing her legs in a way that gave him the full benefit of a dainty foot and ankle She had on her very best silk stockings silk all the way up so that there need be no anxiety as to the exact whereabouts of her skirt I have been wondering about Wessie Wessie who s she a cat Marjorie dimpled then she laughed outright You are funny mister Dene and again she drew in her lower lip and raked him with her eyes Who s Wessie anyhow he demanded Wessie s Dorothy she explained You see she went on her name s West and I get you John Dene continued to regard her with a look that suggested he was still at a loss to account for her presence As I said she continued I ve been wondering about Dorothy Wondering what John Dene was certainly a most difficult man to talk to she decided She s thinner announced Marjorie after a slight pause Thinner Yes not so fat How absurd he was with his She never was fat There was decision in John Dene s tone You know mister Dene you re very difficult for a girl to talk to said Marjorie I never had time to learn he said simply I think it s through you mister Dene She gave him a little fugitive smile she had learned from an American film and had practised assiduously at home What s through me he demanded hopelessly at sea as to her drift At first I thought you were working her too hard mister Dene but she added hastily as if in anticipation of protest but but But what John Dene rapped out the words with a peremptoriness that startled Marjorie But when you got lost She hesitated Got what I mean when you disappeared she added hastily then I knew Knew what Marjorie no longer had any doubts about John Dene s interest in Dorothy He had swung round his chair and was now seated directly facing her You know she worried continued Marjorie and she got pale and Again she paused John Dene continued to stare in a way that made her frightened to look up although she watched him furtively through her lowered lashes Is that what you came here to say demanded John Dene I I came to see Dorothy and now I must run away she cried jumping up I ve got an appointment Good bye mister Dene Thank you for asking me in and she held out her hand which John Dene took as a man takes a circular thrust upon him A moment later Marjorie had fluttered out closing the door behind her Well that s given him something to think about she murmured as she walked down the stairs Wessie must have me down to stay with her He s sure to get a title and she made for the Tube there to join the westward rolling tide of patient humanity that cheerfully pays for a seat and hangs on a strap For nearly an hour John Dene sat at his table as Marjorie had left him twirling in his mouth a half smoked cigar that had not been alight since the early morning His face was expressionless but in his eyes there was a strange new light The next morning when Dorothy arrived at the office she found Sir Bridgman North with John Dene who was angry Just because somebody s lost a spanner or a screw driver they re raising Cain about it Look at all these and he waved a bunch of papers in front of Sir Bridgman It s a way they have in the Navy We never lose sight of anything Except the main issue winning the war snapped John Dene Oh we ll get on with that when we ve found the spanner laughed Sir Bridgman good humouredly I don t want to be worried about a ten cent spanner and have a couple of letters a day about it grumbled John Dene and I won t have it What I used to do said Sir Bridgman was just to tell them that everything possible should be done Then they feel happier and don t worry so much Why I once lost a twelve inch gun and they were quite nice about it when I told them that somebody must have put it aside for safety and that it had probably got mislaid in consequence I never found that gun You see Dene he added a moment later we indent everything except an admiral and it doesn t matter much if he gets lost John Dene grumbled something in his throat He was still smarting under the demands from the Stores Department to produce forthwith the missing article Now I must be off said Sir Bridgman and with a nod to John Dene and a smile to Dorothy he departed All the morning John Dene was restless He seemed unable to concentrate upon anything Several times he span round in his revolving chair with a Say Miss West but as soon as Dorothy raised her eyes from her work he seemed to lose the thread of his ideas and with a mumbled incoherence turned to the mechanical sorting of the papers before him Dorothy was puzzled to account for his strangeness of manner and after a time determined that he must be ill Presently he jumped up and began restlessly pacing the room Three times he paused beside Dorothy as she was engaged in checking inventories Immediately she looked up he pivoted round on his heel and restarted the pacing twirling between his lips the cigar that had gone out an hour before On the fourth occasion that he stood looking down at her Dorothy turned If you do that I shall scream she cried He stepped back a pace obviously disconcerted by her threat Do what he enquired Why prance up and down like that and then come and stand over me It it makes me nervous she added lamely as she returned to her work Sorry said John Dene as he threw himself once more into his chair Suddenly with an air of decision Dorothy put down her pencil and turning faced him Aren t you well mister Dene she inquired Well he repeated with some asperity Of course I m well Oh she said disconcerted by his manner Then for a moment there was silence Why shouldn t I be well he demanded uncompromisingly No reason at all said Dorothy indifferently only She paused Only what he enquired sharply Only she continued calmly you seem a little a little may I say jumpy She looked up at him with a smile Without replying he sprang from his chair and once more started pacing the room with short nervous strides his head thrust forward his left hand in his jacket pocket his right hanging loosely at his side That s it he exclaimed at last Dorothy continued to regard him in wonder Something of vital importance must have happened she decided to produce this effect on a man of John Dene s character It s it s not the Destroyer she cried breathlessly at last Nothing has happened John Dene shook his head vigorously and continued his prancing Then what began Dorothy Listen he said I ve never had any use for women he began then stopped suddenly and stood looking straight at her Dorothy groaned inwardly convinced that she was about to be dismissed In a flash there surged through her mind all that this would mean She might be taken on again by the Admiralty but at less than half her present salary It was really rather bad luck she told herself when the extra money meant so much to her and she really had tried to be worth it You see I don t understand them The remark broke in upon her thoughts as something almost silly in its irrelevancy Again she looked up at him as he stood before her rather as if expecting rebuke Again he span round and continued his pacing of the room As he walked he threw staccatoed remarks from him rather than directed them at Dorothy There s nothing wrong with the Destroyer When you re after one thing you don t seem to notice all the other things buzzing around One day you wake up to find out that you ve been missing things I ve been telling myself all the time that some things didn t matter but they do He paused in front of Dorothy expressing the last three words with almost savage emphasis There s never been anybody except Jim and the boys he added until your mother was He stopped dead then a moment later continued I d like her to know To Dorothy his voice seemed a little husky May be it ud please her to think that she had you see I m telling you the whole shooting match he blurted out as he resumed his restless pacing up and down But that s just what you re not doing said Dorothy I don t in the least understand what you mean and Oh I wish you could stand still if only for a minute Instantly John Dene stopped in his walk and stood in the middle of the room looking over Dorothy s head I m trying to ask you to marry me only I haven t got the sand to do it he blurted out almost angrily Oh Dorothy s hands slipped into her lap her eyes widened and her lips parted as she looked up at him utterly dumbfounded There I knew what it would mean he said as he continued his pacing What have I got to offer Look at me I m not good looking My clothes are not right I don t wear them properly I can t say pretty things The best I can do is to buy flowers and chocolates and express them I daren t even hand them to you Oh I ve thought it all over What use am I to a woman Then as an after thought he added to a girl He turned and paced away from Dorothy without looking at her Oh shucks John Dene swung round on his heel as if he had been struck His jaw dropped his cigar fell from his mouth and he looked at her as if she had said the most surprising thing he had ever heard I said shucks she repeated Her eyelids flickered a little and she was unusually pale You mean His voice was far from steady I mean said Dorothy quietly that a man who could invent the Destroyer ought to be able to learn how to talk to to be nice to a girl The last five words came tumbling over each other as if she had found great difficulty in uttering them and then had thrown them all out at one time Say he began hope shining from his eyes Then he stopped abruptly and walked over to his chair throwing himself into it with a sigh You mean Perhaps said Dorothy dropping her eyes and playing about with a fastening on her blouse I might be able to help you Then after a pause she added You know you got me a rise And then John Dene smiled Say this is great he cried I I Then suddenly he jumped up dashed for his hat and made for the door As he opened it he threw over his shoulder We ll start right in to morrow I m through with work for to day I ll be over to night Then suddenly Dorothy laughed Was ever maid so wooed she murmured But and she left it at that As she thrust the pins into her hat she decided that John Dene had been right It would have been awkward to to well to do anything but go home Just as she was about to lock the outer door of the office she had an inspiration Returning to her table she removed her gloves and after a few minutes thought and reference to the London Directory she sat down to her typewriter and for a few minutes her fingers moved busily over the keys With a determined air she pulled the sheet from the clips and read JOHN DENE OF TORONTO Lesson one Tailors Pond and company one hundred thirty Sackville Street Hosiers Tye Brothers three hundred twenty Jermyn Street Bootmakers Ease Treadwell six hundred thirty Bond Street Hatters Messrs Bincoln and Lennet Piccadilly When a man knows his job let him do it and don t butt in With a determined little nod of approval she folded the sheet of paper inserted it in an envelope which she addressed to John Dene esquire The Ritzton Hotel S W Immediate and left the office I wonder what you would think of that mother mine she murmured as she left the hotel after having given strict injunctions that the note be handed to John Dene immediately he returned CHAPTER XXI MARJORIE ROGERS PAYS A CALL Well mother darling cried Dorothy as she jerked the pins into her hat you ve lost the odd trick The odd trick repeated missus West looking up with a smile into her daughter s flushed and happy face What odd trick John Dene of Toronto Whoop I want to jazz I wonder if he jazzes then with a sudden change of mood she dropped down beside her mother s chair and buried her face in her lap When she looked up her eyes were wet with tears Mother darling I m so happy She smiled a rainbow smile What did you mean about the odd trick dear enquired missus West greatly puzzled accustomed as she was to her daughter s rapid change of mood John Dene s the odd trick she repeated and I m going to marry him Again she hid her face Dorothy I am mother really and really She looked up for a moment then once more she buried her face in her mother s lap Dorothy dear what do you mean Oh he was so funny when he proposed gurgled Dorothy and I just said shucks That seemed to please him Dorothy dear are you joking Not unless John Dene s a joke mother dear she replied Wouldn t it be funny to call him Jack Then she told her mother of the happenings of the afternoon Please say you re glad she said a little wistfully I m I m so surprised dear said missus West stroking her daughter s head gently but I m glad very glad I thought you would be and I shall be Lady Dene Everybody at the Admiralty says he ll get a title and you ll have to say to the servants Is her ladyship at home You won t forget mother will you She looked up with mock anxiety into her mother s face missus West smiled down at Dorothy her eyes too were wet But oh there s such a lot of spade work to be done continued Dorothy I shall begin with his boots His boots They re so dreadful mother They re all built up in front as if they were made to kick with and when I marry him if there s any kicking to be done I m going to do it Of course you realise dear that he s much older than you said missus West hesitatingly He s a perfect baby in arms compared with me she smiled at her mother a quaint confident little smile But you re sure that that missus West hesitated Dorothy nodded her head violently When began missus West It it was when he disappeared she said with averted face I I seemed to miss him so much Oh but mother she cried clasping her mother s knee he s so funny and really he wants someone to look after him You see she continued slowly gazing away from her mother it s always difficult to What made you love care for father she corrected He was your father dear Yes but he wasn t before you married him Dear you began missus West a flush of embarrassment mounting to her cheeks Own up mother that you don t know You can t say it was the shape of his nose or the way he ate or his chest measurement Dorothy why will you never be serious protested missus West I can t mother cried Dorothy jumping up and walking over to the window No girl ever really knows why she wants to marry a man she remarked gazing out of the window It s just a feeling I ve got a feeling that I want to take care of John Dene and and oh mother see to his boots she finished with a laugh I like mister Dene Dorothy said missus West with a decisiveness that was with her uncommon I know you do said Dorothy mischievously That s what I m afraid of Dorothy dear you mustn t began missus West And continued Dorothy relentlessly I won t have any poaching I don t mind his being nice to you she continued leaving the window and planting herself in front of her mother because you really are rather nice She tilted her head on one side a picture of impudence Now missus West she said the sooner we understand each other the better Again she was back on the stool at her mother s feet For some minutes there was silence Mother She looked up with grave and serious eyes Yes dear I always prayed for for him to come back I I Oh bother as the bell rang I wonder who that is We won t answer it But we must dear expostulated missus West It might be a friend Oh well cried Dorothy getting up and going out into the tiny hall A moment later she re entered followed by Marjorie Rogers It s Marjorie mother missus West smiled up at her as the girl bent to kiss her I ve come to know began Marjorie then she hesitated To know what asked Dorothy If it s all right If what s all right J D What do you mean Rojjie cried Dorothy blushing Did he propose You know I ran in this afternoon and gave him a hint You what cried Dorothy aghast Oh I just gave him a sort of hint that he was You wretched little creature cried Dorothy seizing Marjorie and shaking her vigorously There was a look in her eyes that half frightened the girl Help Oh missus West cried Marjorie she s killing me What did you say to him demanded Dorothy fiercely I just gave him a hint repeated Marjorie airily I knew he was in love with you What did you say to him Again Dorothy shook her Oh Wessie if you do that you ll shake all my hair off not to speak of my teeth All I said was that you had wasted away when he was lost and mind you ve got to ask me down to your place wherever it is because it s all through me Oughtn t she missus West she appealed missus West smiled a little uncertainly Marjorie you re a pig cried Dorothy and I don t believe you did go and see him Oh didn t I then why do you suppose I ve got my new stockings on she cried lifting her skirts Children children smiled missus West My chief says he ll be made a baronet so that ll be all right for the kids said Marjorie Rojjie cried Dorothy in confusion and a moment later she had rushed from the room When Dorothy returned to the little drawing room a quarter of an hour later she found that Marjorie had accepted missus West s invitation to stay to dinner Is he going to call this evening she asked eagerly Don t be inquisitive cried Dorothy conscious that she was blushing You re in love with him Dorothy aren t you persisted Marjorie Oh mother please tread on this horrid little creature cried Dorothy but missus West merely smiled You know continued Marjorie candidly he s not much to look at but he beats all those boys at the Admiralty She shrugged her shoulders indifferently It s nothing but chocolates lunches and dinners and take it out in kisses My dear said missus West with quiet dignity you mustn t talk like that I m so sorry cried Marjorie contritely but you know I get so fed up missus West John Dene s so different If it hadn t have been for Dorothy I should have tried to get him for myself I could she added looking from one to the other You could probably get anything in the world except what you most wanted Rojjie said Dorothy sweetly What I most wanted repeated the girl Yes dear a good spanking Marjorie made a face at her Suddenly she jumped up from the table and throwing her arms round Dorothy kissed her impulsively then a moment later she returned to her seat a little shamefacedly as Dorothy and missus West smiled across at her I know you think I m a feather headed little cat missus West said Marjorie wisely No don t deny it she persisted as missus West made a movement as if to speak But I m not worldly all through really and I do like John Dene and of course I just love Dollikins she said with a quaint little smile in Dorothy s direction Would you sooner I went she asked looking from one to the other Sooner you went Yes after dinner I know that John Dene s coming to night although Dorothy won t own up We shouldn t let you go should we mother missus West smiled and shook her head Oh won t it be lovely cried Marjorie ecstatically when I refer to my friend Lady Dene And you will ask me down Wessie darling won t you and get a lot of nice boys Dorothy lowered her eyes to her plate and blushed Later in the evening when they were all sitting in the drawing room and a ring at the bell was heard Marjorie danced about the room with excitement Oh please let me open the door she cried I promise I won t kiss him No dear said missus West Dorothy With flaming cheeks and reluctant steps Dorothy left the room It seemed to Marjorie a long time before she returned followed by John Dene who when he had greeted missus West turned to Marjorie and shook hands His boots Dorothy whispered Marjorie a minute later Dorothy looked down at John Dene s feet The ugly American footwear had been replaced by a pair of well fitting brown boots Please mister Dene may I be a bridesmaid Marjorie cried Dorothy I may mayn t I persisted Marjorie I m sure Dorothy won t ask me unless you insist Sure replied John Dene genially He was always a different man when with missus West and Dorothy You hear Dorothy If you don t make me chief bridesmaid I shall I shall create a disturbance and say it s bigamy or something and that mister Dene has already got two wives in Toronto not to speak of Salt Lake City And now I must be running away Oh missus West you said you would give me that pattern she said suddenly That pattern dear began missus West whilst Dorothy felt her cheeks burn Yes don t you remember What pattern began missus West then conscious that Marjorie was making hideous grimaces at her she rose and walked towards the door leaving John Dene and Dorothy alone No one would ever think you were married missus West said Marjorie severely as they walked into the dining room Don t you know that young people want to be alone when they re only just engaged This with such a serious little air of womanly worldliness that missus West s smile almost developed into a laugh Don t you think missus West that God must be pleased when two nice people come together said Marjorie gravely missus West looked at her with slightly widening eyes then recovering herself said God is always glad because of happiness dear And Marjorie nodded her head as if in entire agreement with the sentiment An hour later when Marjorie had gone missus West entered the drawing room having been sent in by Dorothy to entertain John Dene whilst she wrote a letter After a few commonplaces they sat in silence John Dene smoking lustily missus West happy in her thoughts It was the Good Lord she decided who had ordained that Dorothy and John Dene should fall in love with each other and thus crown with happiness the autumn of her days I ve been trying to figure out all the afternoon why she said shucks John Dene suddenly burst in upon her thoughts in a way that startled her Said shucks she repeated missus West had a habit of repeating a phrase when not quite understanding it or desirous of gaining time before framing her reply Sure But who said shucks she asked lifting her brows in an endeavour to comprehend and what are shucks mister Dene Shucks repeated John Dene in his turn shucks are are He paused then as if determining that this was a side issue he added When I told her to day that I d never had any use for girls and and He looked at missus West helplessly She smiled She just said shucks I think she must have meant that you were too modest said missus West softly Me modest John Dene sat up straight in his surprise I think that is what she must have meant I take it that down at the Admiralty they don t figure it out that way he said grimly Me modest he repeated What have I got to give any girl he continued presently and a girl like Dorothy The name seemed to come with difficulty I m all wrong he added with conviction I can t talk We love you just for yourself John said missus West gently For a moment there was a look of surprise in John Dene s eye then with great deliberation he rose and walking over to missus West bent down and kissed her cheek Oh John Dene started up and turning to the door saw Dorothy standing on the threshold looking from one to the other her eyes dancing with mischief missus West had flushed rosily and with downcast eyes gave the impression of one who had been caught in some illicit act So this is what you two get up to when I leave the room said Dorothy severely Sure said John Dene and we ll be getting up to it again won t we mother And John Dene smiled THE END Transcriber s note underscored text is
