none	none	in a later generation would have been termed her line This son of mine he heard her tell a room full of awestruck admiring women one day is entirely sophisticated and quite charming but delicate we re all delicate here you know Her hand was radiantly outlined against her beautiful bosom then sinking her voice to a whisper she told them of the apricot cordial They rejoiced for she was a brave raconteuse but many were the keys turned in sideboard locks that night against the possible defection of little Bobby or Barbara These domestic pilgrimages were invariably in state two maids the private car or mister Blaine when available and very often a physician When Amory had the whooping cough four disgusted specialists glared at each other hunched around his bed when he took scarlet fever the number of attendants including physicians and nurses totalled fourteen However blood being thicker than broth he was pulled through The Blaines were attached to no city They were the Blaines of Lake Geneva they had quite enough relatives to serve in place of friends and an enviable standing from Pasadena to Cape Cod But Beatrice grew more and more prone to like only new acquaintances as there were certain stories such as the history of her constitution and its many amendments memories of her years abroad that it was necessary for her to repeat at regular intervals Like Freudian dreams they must be thrown off else they would sweep in and lay siege to her nerves But Beatrice was critical about American women especially the floating population of ex Westerners They have accents my dear she told Amory not Southern accents or Boston accents not an accent attached to any locality just an accent she became dreamy They pick up old moth eaten London accents that are down on their luck and have to be used by some one They talk as an English butler might after several years in a Chicago grand opera company She became almost incoherent Suppose time in every Western woman s life she feels her husband is prosperous enough for her to have accent they try to impress me my dear Though she thought of her body as a mass of frailties she considered her soul quite as ill and therefore important in her life She had once been a Catholic but discovering that priests were infinitely more attentive when she was in process of losing or regaining faith in Mother Church she maintained an enchantingly wavering attitude Often she deplored the bourgeois quality of the American Catholic clergy and was quite sure that had she lived in the shadow of the great Continental cathedrals her soul would still be a thin flame on the mighty altar of Rome Still next to doctors priests were her favorite sport Ah Bishop Wiston she would declare I do not want to talk of myself I can imagine the stream of hysterical women fluttering at your doors beseeching you to be simpatico then after an interlude filled by the clergyman but my mood is oddly dissimilar Only to bishops and above did she divulge her clerical romance When she had first returned to her country there had been a pagan Swinburnian young man in Asheville for whose passionate kisses and unsentimental conversations she had taken a decided penchant they had discussed the matter pro and con with an intellectual romancing quite devoid of sappiness Eventually she had decided to marry for background and the young pagan from Asheville had gone through a spiritual crisis joined the Catholic Church and was now Monsignor Darcy Indeed missus Blaine he is still delightful company quite the cardinal s right hand man Amory will go to him one day I know breathed the beautiful lady and Monsignor Darcy will understand him as he understood me Amory became thirteen rather tall and slender and more than ever on to his Celtic mother He had tutored occasionally the idea being that he was to keep up at each place taking up the work where he left off yet as no tutor ever found the place he left off his mind was still in very good shape What a few more years of this life would have made of him is problematical However four hours out from land Italy bound with Beatrice his appendix burst probably from too many meals in bed and after a series of frantic telegrams to Europe and America to the amazement of the passengers the great ship slowly wheeled around and returned to New York to deposit Amory at the pier You will admit that if it was not life it was magnificent After the operation Beatrice had a nervous breakdown that bore a suspicious resemblance to delirium tremens and Amory was left in Minneapolis destined to spend the ensuing two years with his aunt and uncle There the crude vulgar air of Western civilization first catches him in his underwear so to speak A KISS FOR AMORY His lip curled when he read it I am going to have a bobbing party it said on Thursday December the seventeenth at five o clock and I would like it very much if you could come Yours truly R S V P Myra saint Claire He had been two months in Minneapolis and his chief struggle had been the concealing from the other guys at school how particularly superior he felt himself to be yet this conviction was built upon shifting sands He had shown off one day in French class he was in senior French class to the utter confusion of mister Reardon whose accent Amory damned contemptuously and to the delight of the class mister Reardon who had spent several weeks in Paris ten years before took his revenge on the verbs whenever he had his book open But another time Amory showed off in history class with quite disastrous results for the boys there were his own age and they shrilled innuendoes at each other all the following week Aw I b lieve doncherknow the Umuricun revolution was lawgely an affair of the middul clawses or Washington came of very good blood aw quite good I b lieve Amory ingeniously tried to retrieve himself by blundering on purpose Two years before he had commenced a history of the United States which though it only got as far as the Colonial Wars had been pronounced by his mother completely enchanting His chief disadvantage lay in athletics but as soon as he discovered that it was the touchstone of power and popularity at school he began to make furious persistent efforts to excel in the winter sports and with his ankles aching and bending in spite of his efforts he skated valiantly around the Lorelie rink every afternoon wondering how soon he would be able to carry a hockey stick without getting it inexplicably tangled in his skates The invitation to Miss Myra saint Claire s bobbing party spent the morning in his coat pocket where it had an intense physical affair with a dusty piece of peanut brittle During the afternoon he brought it to light with a sigh and after some consideration and a preliminary draft in the back of Collar and Daniel s First Year Latin composed an answer My dear Miss saint Claire Your truly charming envitation for the evening of next Thursday evening was truly delightful to receive this morning I will be charm and inchanted indeed to present my compliments on next Thursday evening Faithfully Amory Blaine On Thursday therefore he walked pensively along the slippery shovel scraped sidewalks and came in sight of Myra s house on the half hour after five a lateness which he fancied his mother would have favored He waited on the door step with his eyes nonchalantly half closed and planned his entrance with precision He would cross the floor not too hastily to missus saint Claire and say with exactly the correct modulation My dear missus saint Claire I m frightfully sorry to be late but my maid he paused there and realized he would be quoting but my uncle and I had to see a fella Yes I ve met your enchanting daughter at dancing school Then he would shake hands using that slight half foreign bow with all the starchy little females and nod to the fellas who would be standing round paralyzed into rigid groups for mutual protection A butler one of the three in Minneapolis swung open the door Amory stepped inside and divested himself of cap and coat He was mildly surprised not to hear the shrill squawk of conversation from the next room and he decided it must be quite formal He approved of that as he approved of the butler Miss Myra he said To his surprise the butler grinned horribly Oh yeah he declared she s here He was unaware that his failure to be cockney was ruining his standing Amory considered him coldly But continued the butler his voice rising unnecessarily she s the only one what is here The party s gone Amory gasped in sudden horror What She s been waitin for Amory Blaine That s you ain t it Her mother says that if you showed up by five thirty you two was to go after em in the Packard Amory s despair was crystallized by the appearance of Myra herself bundled to the ears in a polo coat her face plainly sulky her voice pleasant only with difficulty Lo Amory Lo Myra He had described the state of his vitality Well you got here any ways Well I ll tell you I guess you don t know about the auto accident he romanced Myra s eyes opened wide Who was it to Well he continued desperately uncle n aunt n I Was any one killed Amory paused and then nodded Your uncle alarm Oh no just a horse a sorta gray horse At this point the Erse butler snickered Probably killed the engine he suggested Amory would have put him on the rack without a scruple We ll go now said Myra coolly You see Amory the bobs were ordered for five and everybody was here so we couldn t wait Well I couldn t help it could I So mama said for me to wait till ha past five We ll catch the bobs before it gets to the Minnehaha Club Amory Amory s shredded poise dropped from him He pictured the happy party jingling along snowy streets the appearance of the limousine the horrible public descent of him and Myra before sixty reproachful eyes his apology a real one this time He sighed aloud What inquired Myra Nothing I was just yawning Are we going to surely catch up with em before they get there He was encouraging a faint hope that they might slip into the Minnehaha Club and meet the others there be found in blase seclusion before the fire and quite regain his lost attitude Oh sure Mike we ll catch em all right let s hurry He became conscious of his stomach As they stepped into the machine he hurriedly slapped the paint of diplomacy over a rather box like plan he had conceived It was based upon some trade lasts gleaned at dancing school to the effect that he was awful good looking and English sort of Myra he said lowering his voice and choosing his words carefully I beg a thousand pardons Can you ever forgive me She regarded him gravely his intent green eyes his mouth that to her thirteen year old arrow collar taste was the quintessence of romance Yes Myra could forgive him very easily

none	none	yes sure He looked at her again and then dropped his eyes He had lashes I m awful he said sadly I m diff runt I don t know why I make faux pas Cause I don t care I s pose Then recklessly I been smoking too much I ve got t bacca heart Myra pictured an all night tobacco debauch with Amory pale and reeling from the effect of nicotined lungs She gave a little gasp Oh Amory don t smoke You ll stunt your growth I don t care he persisted gloomily I gotta I got the habit I ve done a lot of things that if my fambly knew he hesitated giving her imagination time to picture dark horrors I went to the burlesque show last week Myra was quite overcome He turned the green eyes on her again You re the only girl in town I like much he exclaimed in a rush of sentiment You re simpatico Myra was not sure that she was but it sounded stylish though vaguely improper Thick dusk had descended outside and as the limousine made a sudden turn she was jolted against him their hands touched You shouldn t smoke Amory she whispered Don t you know that He shook his head Nobody cares Myra hesitated I care Something stirred within Amory Oh yes you do You got a crush on Froggy Parker I guess everybody knows that No I haven t very slowly A silence while Amory thrilled There was something fascinating about Myra shut away here cosily from the dim chill air Myra a little bundle of clothes with strands of yellow hair curling out from under her skating cap Because I ve got a crush too He paused for he heard in the distance the sound of young laughter and peering through the frosted glass along the lamp lit street he made out the dark outline of the bobbing party He must act quickly He reached over with a violent jerky effort and clutched Myra s hand her thumb to be exact Tell him to go to the Minnehaha straight he whispered I wanta talk to you I got to talk to you Myra made out the party ahead had an instant vision of her mother and then alas for convention glanced into the eyes beside Turn down this side street Richard and drive straight to the Minnehaha Club she cried through the speaking tube Amory sank back against the cushions with a sigh of relief I can kiss her he thought I ll bet I can I ll bet I can Overhead the sky was half crystalline half misty and the night around was chill and vibrant with rich tension From the Country Club steps the roads stretched away dark creases on the white blanket huge heaps of snow lining the sides like the tracks of giant moles They lingered for a moment on the steps and watched the white holiday moon Pale moons like that one Amory made a vague gesture make people mysterieuse You look like a young witch with her cap off and her hair sorta mussed her hands clutched at her hair Oh leave it it looks good They drifted up the stairs and Myra led the way into the little den of his dreams where a cosy fire was burning before a big sink down couch A few years later this was to be a great stage for Amory a cradle for many an emotional crisis Now they talked for a moment about bobbing parties There s always a bunch of shy fellas he commented sitting at the tail of the bob sorta lurkin an whisperin an pushin each other off Then there s always some crazy cross eyed girl he gave a terrifying imitation she s always talkin hard sorta to the chaperon You re such a funny boy puzzled Myra How d y mean Amory gave immediate attention on his own ground at last Oh always talking about crazy things Why don t you come ski ing with Marylyn and I to morrow I don t like girls in the daytime he said shortly and then thinking this a bit abrupt he added But I like you He cleared his throat I like you first and second and third Myra s eyes became dreamy What a story this would make to tell Marylyn Here on the couch with this wonderful looking boy the little fire the sense that they were alone in the great building Myra capitulated The atmosphere was too appropriate I like you the first twenty five she confessed her voice trembling and Froggy Parker twenty sixth Froggy had fallen twenty five places in one hour As yet he had not even noticed it But Amory being on the spot leaned over quickly and kissed Myra s cheek He had never kissed a girl before and he tasted his lips curiously as if he had munched some new fruit Then their lips brushed like young wild flowers in the wind We re awful rejoiced Myra gently She slipped her hand into his her head drooped against his shoulder Sudden revulsion seized Amory disgust loathing for the whole incident He desired frantically to be away never to see Myra again never to kiss any one he became conscious of his face and hers of their clinging hands and he wanted to creep out of his body and hide somewhere safe out of sight up in the corner of his mind Kiss me again Her voice came out of a great void I don t want to he heard himself saying There was another pause I don t want to he repeated passionately Myra sprang up her cheeks pink with bruised vanity the great bow on the back of her head trembling sympathetically I hate you she cried Don t you ever dare to speak to me again What stammered Amory I ll tell mama you kissed me I will too I will too I ll tell mama and she won t let me play with you Amory rose and stared at her helplessly as though she were a new animal of whose presence on the earth he had not heretofore been aware The door opened suddenly and Myra s mother appeared on the threshold fumbling with her lorgnette Well she began adjusting it benignantly the man at the desk told me you two children were up here How do you do Amory Amory watched Myra and waited for the crash but none came The pout faded the high pink subsided and Myra s voice was placid as a summer lake when she answered her mother Oh we started so late mama that I thought we might as well He heard from below the shrieks of laughter and smelled the vapid odor of hot chocolate and tea cakes as he silently followed mother and daughter down stairs The sound of the graphophone mingled with the voices of many girls humming the air and a faint glow was born and spread over him Casey Jones mounted to the cab un Casey Jones th his orders in his hand Casey Jones mounted to the cab un Took his farewell journey to the prom ised land SNAPSHOTS OF THE YOUNG EGOTIST Amory spent nearly two years in Minneapolis The first winter he wore moccasins that were born yellow but after many applications of oil and dirt assumed their mature color a dirty greenish brown he wore a gray plaid mackinaw coat and a red toboggan cap His dog Count Del Monte ate the red cap so his uncle gave him a gray one that pulled down over his face The trouble with this one was that you breathed into it and your breath froze one day the darn thing froze his cheek He rubbed snow on his cheek but it turned bluish black just the same The Count Del Monte ate a box of bluing once but it didn t hurt him Later however he lost his mind and ran madly up the street bumping into fences rolling in gutters and pursuing his eccentric course out of Amory s life Amory cried on his bed Poor little Count he cried Oh poor little Count After several months he suspected Count of a

none	none	piece of emotional acting Amory and Frog Parker considered that the greatest line in literature occurred in Act III of Arsene Lupin They sat in the first row at the Wednesday and Saturday matinees The line was If one can t be a great artist or a great soldier the next best thing is to be a great criminal Amory fell in love again and wrote a poem This was it Marylyn and Sallee Those are the girls for me Marylyn stands above Sallee in that sweet deep love He was interested in whether McGovern of Minnesota would make the first or second All American how to do the card pass how to do the coin pass chameleon ties how babies were born and whether Three fingered Brown was really a better pitcher than Christie Mathewson Among other things he read For the Honor of the School Little Women twice The Common Law Sapho Dangerous Dan McGrew The Broad Highway three times The Fall of the House of Usher Three Weeks Mary Ware the Little Colonel s Chum Gunga Din The Police Gazette and Jim Jam Jems He had all the Henty biasses in history and was particularly fond of the cheerful murder stories of Mary Roberts Rinehart School ruined his French and gave him a distaste for standard authors His masters considered him idle unreliable and superficially clever He collected locks of hair from many girls He wore the rings of several Finally he could borrow no more rings owing to his nervous habit of chewing them out of shape This it seemed usually aroused the jealous suspicions of the next borrower All through the summer months Amory and Frog Parker went each week to the Stock Company Afterward they would stroll home in the balmy air of August night dreaming along Hennepin and Nicollet Avenues through the gay crowd Amory wondered how people could fail to notice that he was a boy marked for glory and when faces of the throng turned toward him and ambiguous eyes stared into his he assumed the most romantic of expressions and walked on the air cushions that lie on the asphalts of fourteen Always after he was in bed there were voices indefinite fading enchanting just outside his window and before he fell asleep he would dream one of his favorite waking dreams the one about becoming a great half back or the one about the Japanese invasion when he was rewarded by being made the youngest general in the world It was always the becoming he dreamed of never the being This too was quite characteristic of Amory CODE OF THE YOUNG EGOTIST Before he was summoned back to Lake Geneva he had appeared shy but inwardly glowing in his first long trousers set off by a purple accordion tie and a Belmont collar with the edges unassailably meeting purple socks and handkerchief with a purple border peeping from his breast pocket But more than that he had formulated his first philosophy a code to live by which as near as it can be named was a sort of aristocratic egotism He had realized that his best interests were bound up with those of a certain variant changing person whose label in order that his past might always be identified with him was Amory Blaine Amory marked himself a fortunate youth capable of infinite expansion for good or evil He did not consider himself a strong char c ter but relied on his facility learn things sorta quick and his superior mentality read a lotta deep books He was proud of the fact that he could never become a mechanical or scientific

none	none	From no other heights was he debarred Physically Amory thought that he was exceedingly handsome He was He fancied himself an athlete of possibilities and a supple dancer Socially Here his condition was perhaps most dangerous He granted himself personality charm magnetism poise the power of dominating all contemporary males the gift of fascinating all women Mentally Complete unquestioned superiority Now a confession will have to be made Amory had rather a Puritan conscience Not that he yielded to it later in life he almost completely slew it but at fifteen it made him consider himself a great deal worse than other boys unscrupulousness the desire to influence people in almost every way even for evil a certain coldness and lack of affection amounting sometimes to cruelty a shifting sense of honor an unholy selfishness a puzzled furtive interest in

none	none	concerning sex There was also a curious strain of weakness running crosswise through his make up a harsh phrase from the lips of an older boy older boys usually detested him was liable to sweep him off his poise into surly sensitiveness or timid stupidity he was a slave to his own moods and he felt that though he was capable of recklessness and audacity he possessed neither courage perseverance nor self respect Vanity tempered with self suspicion if not self knowledge a sense of people as automatons to his will a desire to pass as many boys as possible and get to a vague top of the world with this background did Amory drift into adolescence PREPARATORY TO THE GREAT ADVENTURE The train slowed up with midsummer languor at Lake Geneva and Amory caught sight of his mother waiting in her electric on the gravelled station drive It was an ancient electric one of the early types and painted gray The sight of her sitting there slenderly erect and of her face where beauty and dignity combined melting to a dreamy recollected smile filled him with a sudden great pride of her As they kissed coolly and he stepped into the electric he felt a quick fear lest he had lost the requisite charm to measure up to her Dear boy you re so tall look behind and see if there s anything coming She looked left and right she slipped cautiously into a speed of two miles an hour beseeching Amory to act as sentinel and at one busy crossing she made him get out and run ahead to signal her forward like a traffic policeman Beatrice was what might be termed a careful driver You are tall but you re still very handsome you ve skipped the awkward age or is that sixteen perhaps it s fourteen or fifteen I can never remember but you ve skipped it Don t embarrass me murmured Amory But my dear boy what odd clothes They look as if they were a set don t they Is your underwear purple too Amory grunted impolitely You must go to Brooks and get some really nice suits Oh we ll have a talk to night or perhaps to morrow night I want to tell you about your heart you ve probably been neglecting your heart and you don t know Amory thought how superficial was the recent overlay of his own generation Aside from a minute shyness he felt that the old cynical kinship with his mother had not been one bit broken Yet for the first few days he wandered about the gardens and along the shore in a state of superloneliness finding a lethargic content in smoking Bull at the garage with one of the chauffeurs The sixty acres of the estate were dotted with old and new summer houses and many fountains and white benches that came suddenly into sight from foliage hung hiding places there was a great and constantly increasing family of white cats that prowled the many flower beds and were silhouetted suddenly at night against the darkening trees It was on one of the shadowy paths that Beatrice at last captured Amory after mister Blaine had as usual retired for the evening to his private library After reproving him for avoiding her she took him for a long tete a tete in the moonlight He could not reconcile himself to her beauty that was mother to his own the exquisite neck and shoulders the grace of a fortunate woman of thirty Amory dear she crooned softly I had such a strange weird time after I left you Did you Beatrice When I had my last breakdown she spoke of it as a sturdy gallant feat The doctors told me her voice sang on a confidential note that if any man alive had done the consistent drinking that I have he would have been physically shattered my dear and in his grave long in his grave Amory winced and wondered how this would have sounded to Froggy Parker Yes continued Beatrice tragically I had dreams wonderful visions She pressed the palms of her hands into her eyes I saw bronze rivers lapping marble shores and great birds that soared through the air parti colored birds with iridescent plumage I heard strange music and the flare of barbaric trumpets what Amory had snickered What Amory I said go on Beatrice That was all it merely recurred and recurred gardens that flaunted coloring against which this would be quite dull moons that whirled and swayed paler than winter moons more golden than harvest moons Are you quite well now Beatrice Quite well as well as I will ever be I am not understood Amory I know that can t express it to you Amory but I am not understood Amory was quite moved He put his arm around his mother rubbing his head gently against her shoulder Poor Beatrice poor Beatrice Tell me about you Amory Did you have two horrible years Amory considered lying and then decided against it No Beatrice I enjoyed them I adapted myself to the bourgeoisie I became conventional He surprised himself by saying that and he pictured how Froggy would have gaped Beatrice he said suddenly I want to go away to school Everybody in Minneapolis is going to go away to school Beatrice showed some alarm But you re only fifteen Yes but everybody goes away to school at fifteen and I want to Beatrice On Beatrice s suggestion the subject was dropped for the rest of the walk but a week later she delighted him by saying Amory I have decided to let you have your way If you still want to you can go to school Yes To saint Regis s in Connecticut Amory felt a quick excitement It s being arranged continued Beatrice It s better that you should go away I d have preferred you to have gone to Eton and then to Christ Church Oxford but it seems impracticable now and for the present we ll let the university question take care of itself What are you going to do Beatrice Heaven knows It seems my fate to fret away my years in this country Not for a second do I regret being American indeed I think that a regret typical of very vulgar people and I feel sure we are the great coming nation yet and she sighed I feel my life should have drowsed away close to an older mellower civilization a land of greens and autumnal browns Amory did not answer so his mother continued My regret is that you haven t been abroad but still as you are a man it s better that you should grow up here under the snarling eagle is that the right term Amory agreed that it was She would not have appreciated the Japanese invasion When do I go to school Next month You ll have to start East a little early to take your examinations After that you ll have a free week so I want you to go up the Hudson and pay a visit To who To Monsignor Darcy Amory He wants to see you He went to Harrow and then to Yale became a Catholic I want him to talk to you I feel he can be such a help She stroked his auburn hair gently Dear Amory dear Amory Dear Beatrice So early in September Amory provided with six suits summer underwear six suits winter underwear one sweater or T shirt one jersey one overcoat winter et cetera set out for New England the land of schools There were Andover and Exeter with their memories of New England dead large college like democracies saint Mark s Groton saint Regis recruited from Boston and the Knickerbocker families of New York saint Paul s with its great rinks Pomfret and saint George s prosperous and well dressed Taft and Hotchkiss which prepared the wealth of the Middle West for social success at Yale Pawling Westminster Choate Kent and a hundred others all milling out their well set up conventional impressive type year after year their mental stimulus the college entrance exams their vague purpose set forth in a hundred circulars as To impart a Thorough Mental Moral and Physical Training as a Christian Gentleman to fit the boy for meeting the problems of his day and generation and to give a solid foundation in the Arts and Sciences At saint Regis Amory stayed three days and took his exams with a scoffing confidence then doubling back to New York to pay his tutelary visit The metropolis barely glimpsed made little impression on him except for the sense of cleanliness he drew from the tall white buildings seen from a Hudson River steamboat in the early morning Indeed his mind was so crowded with dreams of athletic prowess at school that he considered this visit only as a rather tiresome prelude to the great adventure This however it did not prove to be Monsignor Darcy s house was an ancient rambling structure set on a hill overlooking the river and there lived its owner between his trips to all parts of the Roman Catholic world rather like an exiled Stuart king waiting to be called to the rule of his land Monsignor was forty four then and bustling a trifle too stout for symmetry with hair the color of spun gold and a brilliant enveloping personality When he came into a room clad in his full purple regalia from thatch to toe he resembled a Turner sunset and attracted both admiration and attention He had written two novels one of them violently anti Catholic just before his conversion and five years later another in which he had attempted to turn all his clever jibes against Catholics into even cleverer innuendoes against Episcopalians He was intensely ritualistic startlingly dramatic loved the idea of God enough to be a celibate and rather liked his neighbor Children adored him because he was like a child youth revelled in his company because he was still a youth and couldn t be shocked In the proper land and century he might have been a Richelieu at present he was a very moral very religious if not particularly pious clergyman making a great mystery about pulling rusty wires and appreciating life to the fullest if not entirely enjoying it He and Amory took to each other at first sight the jovial impressive prelate who could dazzle an embassy ball and the green eyed intent youth in his first long trousers accepted in their own minds a relation of father and son within a half hour s conversation My dear boy I ve been waiting to see you for years Take a big chair and we ll have a chat I ve just come from school saint Regis s you know So your mother says a remarkable woman have a cigarette I m sure you smoke Well if you re like me you loathe all science and mathematics Amory nodded vehemently Hate em all Like English and history Of course You ll hate school for a while too but I m glad you re going to saint Regis s Why Because it s a gentleman s school and democracy won t hit you so early You ll find plenty of that in college I want to go to Princeton said Amory I don t know why but I think of all Harvard men as sissies like I used to be and all Yale men as wearing big blue sweaters and smoking pipes Monsignor chuckled I m one you know Oh you re different I think of Princeton as being lazy and good looking and aristocratic you know like a spring day Harvard seems sort of indoors And Yale is November crisp and energetic finished Monsignor That s it They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered I was for Bonnie Prince Charlie announced Amory Of course you were and for Hannibal Yes and for the Southern Confederacy He was rather sceptical about being an Irish patriot he suspected that being Irish was being somewhat common but Monsignor assured him that Ireland was a romantic lost cause and Irish people quite charming and that it should by all means be one of his principal biasses After a crowded hour which included several more cigarettes and during which Monsignor learned to his surprise but not to his horror that Amory had not been brought up a Catholic he announced that he had another guest This turned out to be the Honorable Thornton Hancock of Boston ex minister to The Hague author of an erudite history of the Middle Ages and the last of a distinguished patriotic and brilliant family He comes here for a rest said Monsignor confidentially treating Amory as a contemporary I act as an escape from the weariness of agnosticism and I think I m the only man who knows how his staid old mind is really at sea and longs for a sturdy spar like the Church to cling to Their first luncheon was one of the memorable events of Amory s early life He was quite radiant and gave off a peculiar brightness and charm Monsignor called out the best that he had thought by question and suggestion and Amory talked with an ingenious brilliance of a thousand impulses and desires and repulsions and faiths and fears He and Monsignor held the floor and the older man with his less receptive less accepting yet certainly not colder mentality seemed content to listen and bask in the mellow sunshine that played between these two Monsignor gave the effect of sunlight to many people Amory gave it in his youth and to some extent when he was very much older but never again was it quite so mutually spontaneous He s a radiant boy thought Thornton Hancock who had seen the splendor of two continents and talked with Parnell and Gladstone and Bismarck and afterward he added to Monsignor But his education ought not to be intrusted to a school or college But for the next four years the best of Amory s intellect was concentrated on matters of popularity the intricacies of a university social system and American Society as represented by Biltmore Teas and Hot Springs golf links In all a wonderful week that saw Amory s mind turned inside out a hundred of his theories confirmed and his joy of life crystallized to a thousand ambitions Not that the conversation was scholastic heaven forbid Amory had only the vaguest idea as to what Bernard Shaw was but Monsignor made quite as much out of The Beloved Vagabond and Sir Nigel taking good care that Amory never once felt out of his depth But the trumpets were sounding for Amory s preliminary skirmish with his own generation You re not sorry to go of course With people like us our home is where we are not said Monsignor I am sorry No you re not No one person in the world is necessary to you or to me Well Good by THE EGOTIST DOWN Amory s two years at saint Regis though in turn painful and triumphant had as little real significance in his own life as the American prep school crushed as it is under the heel of the universities has to American life in general We have no Eton to create the self consciousness of a governing class we have instead clean flaccid and innocuous preparatory schools He went all wrong at the start was generally considered both conceited and arrogant and universally detested He played football intensely alternating a reckless brilliancy with a tendency to keep himself as safe from hazard as decency would permit In a wild panic he backed out of a fight with a boy his own size to a chorus of scorn and a week later in desperation picked a battle with another boy very much bigger from which he emerged badly beaten but rather proud of himself He was resentful against all those in authority over him and this combined with a lazy indifference toward his work exasperated every master in school He grew discouraged and imagined himself a pariah took to sulking in corners and reading after lights With a dread of being alone he attached a few friends but since they were not among the elite of the school he used them simply as mirrors of himself audiences before which he might do that posing

none	none	essential to him He was unbearably lonely desperately unhappy There were some few grains of comfort Whenever Amory was submerged his vanity was the last part to go below the surface so he could still enjoy a comfortable glow when Wookey wookey the deaf old housekeeper told him that he was the best looking boy she had ever seen It had pleased him to be the lightest and youngest man on the first football squad it pleased him when Doctor Dougall told him at the end of a heated conference that he could if he wished get the best marks in school But Doctor Dougall was wrong It was temperamentally impossible for Amory to get the best marks in school Miserable confined to bounds unpopular with both faculty and students that was Amory s first term But at Christmas he had returned to Minneapolis tight lipped and strangely jubilant Oh I was sort of fresh at first he told Frog Parker patronizingly but I got along fine lightest man on the squad You ought to go away to school Froggy It s great stuff INCIDENT OF THE WELL MEANING PROFESSOR On the last night of his first term mister Margotson the senior master sent word to study hall that Amory was to come to his room at nine Amory suspected that advice was forthcoming but he determined to be courteous because this mister Margotson had been kindly disposed toward him His summoner received him gravely and motioned him to a chair He hemmed several times and looked consciously kind as a man will when he knows he s on delicate ground Amory he began I ve sent for you on a personal matter Yes sir I ve noticed you this year and I I like you I think you have in you the makings of a a very good man Yes sir Amory managed to articulate He hated having people talk as if he were an admitted failure But I ve noticed continued the older man blindly that you re not very popular with the boys No sir Amory licked his lips Ah I thought you might not understand exactly what it was they ah objected to I m going to tell you because I believe ah that when a boy knows his difficulties he s better able to cope with them to conform to what others expect of him He a hemmed again with delicate reticence and continued They seem to think that you re ah rather too fresh Amory could stand no more He rose from his chair scarcely controlling his voice when he spoke I know oh don t you s pose I know His voice rose I know what they think do you s pose you have to tell me He paused I m I ve got to go back now hope I m not rude He left the room hurriedly In the cool air outside as he walked to his house he exulted in his refusal to be helped That damn old fool he cried wildly As if I didn t know He decided however that this was a good excuse not to go back to study hall that night so comfortably couched up in his room he munched Nabiscos and finished The White Company INCIDENT OF THE WONDERFUL GIRL There was a bright star in February New York burst upon him on Washington s Birthday with the brilliance of a long anticipated event His glimpse of it as a vivid whiteness against a deep blue sky had left a picture of splendor that rivalled the dream cities in the Arabian Nights but this time he saw it by electric light and romance gleamed from the chariot race sign on Broadway and from the women s eyes at the Astor where he and young Paskert from saint Regis had dinner When they walked down the aisle of the theatre greeted by the nervous twanging and discord of untuned violins and the sensuous heavy fragrance of paint and powder he moved in a sphere of epicurean delight Everything enchanted him The play was The Little Millionaire with George M Cohan and there was one stunning young brunette who made him sit with brimming eyes in the ecstasy of watching her dance Oh you wonderful girl What a wonderful girl you are sang the tenor and Amory agreed silently but passionately All your wonderful words Thrill me through The violins swelled and quavered on the last notes the girl sank to a crumpled butterfly on the stage a great burst of clapping filled the house Oh to fall in love like that to the languorous magic melody of such a tune The last scene was laid on a roof garden and the cellos sighed to the musical moon while light adventure and facile froth like comedy flitted back and forth in the calcium Amory was on fire to be an habitui of roof gardens to meet a girl who should look like that better that very girl whose hair would be drenched with golden moonlight while at his elbow sparkling wine was poured by an unintelligible waiter When the curtain fell for the last time he gave such a long sigh that the people in front of him twisted around and stared and said loud enough for him to hear What a remarkable looking boy This took his mind off the play and he wondered if he really did seem handsome to the population of New York Paskert and he walked in silence toward their hotel The former was the first to speak His uncertain fifteen year old voice broke in in a melancholy strain on Amory s musings I d marry that girl to night There was no need to ask what girl he referred to I d be proud to take her home and introduce her to my people continued Paskert Amory was distinctly impressed He wished he had said it instead of Paskert It sounded so mature I wonder about actresses are they all pretty bad No sir not by a darn sight said the worldly youth with emphasis and I know that girl s as good as gold I can tell They wandered on mixing in the Broadway crowd dreaming on the music that eddied out of the cafes New faces flashed on and off like myriad lights pale or rouged faces tired yet sustained by a weary excitement Amory watched them in fascination He was planning his life He was going to live in New York and be known at every restaurant and cafe wearing a dress suit from early evening to early morning sleeping away the dull hours of the forenoon Yes sir I d marry that girl to night HEROIC IN GENERAL TONE October of his second and last year at saint Regis was a high point in Amory s memory The game with Groton was played from three of a snappy exhilarating afternoon far into the crisp autumnal twilight and Amory at quarter back exhorting in wild despair making impossible tackles calling signals in a voice that had diminished to a hoarse furious whisper yet found time to revel in the blood stained bandage around his head and the straining glorious heroism of plunging crashing bodies and aching limbs For those minutes courage flowed like wine out of the November dusk and he was the eternal hero one with the sea rover on the prow of a Norse galley one with Roland and Horatius Sir Nigel and Ted Coy scraped and stripped into trim and then flung by his own will into the breach beating back the tide hearing from afar the thunder of cheers finally bruised and weary but still elusive circling an end twisting changing pace straight arming falling behind the Groton goal with two men on his legs in the only touchdown of the game THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SLICKER From the scoffing superiority of sixth form year and success Amory looked back with cynical wonder on his status of the year before He was changed as completely as Amory Blaine could ever be changed Amory plus Beatrice plus two years in Minneapolis these had been his ingredients when he entered saint Regis But the Minneapolis years were not a thick enough overlay to conceal the Amory plus Beatrice from the ferreting eyes of a boarding school so saint Regis had very painfully drilled Beatrice out of him and begun to lay down new and more conventional planking on the fundamental Amory But both saint Regis and Amory were unconscious of the fact that this fundamental Amory had not in himself changed Those qualities for which he had suffered his moodiness his tendency to pose his laziness and his love of playing the fool were now taken as a matter of course recognized eccentricities in a star quarter back a clever actor and the editor of the saint Regis Tattler it puzzled him to see impressionable small boys imitating the very vanities that had not long ago been contemptible weaknesses After the football season he slumped into dreamy content The night of the pre holiday dance he slipped away and went early to bed for the pleasure of hearing the violin music cross the grass and come surging in at his window Many nights he lay there dreaming awake of secret cafes in Mont Martre where ivory women delved in romantic mysteries with diplomats and soldiers of fortune while orchestras played Hungarian waltzes and the air was thick and exotic with intrigue and moonlight and adventure In the spring he read L Allegro by request and was inspired to lyrical outpourings on the subject of Arcady and the pipes of Pan He moved his bed so that the sun would wake him at dawn that he might dress and go out to the archaic swing that hung from an apple tree near the sixth form house Seating himself in this he would pump higher and higher until he got the effect of swinging into the wide air into a fairyland of piping satyrs and nymphs with the faces of fair haired girls he passed in the streets of Eastchester As the swing reached its highest point Arcady really lay just over the brow of a certain hill where the brown road dwindled out of sight in a golden dot He read voluminously all spring the beginning of his eighteenth year The Gentleman from Indiana The New Arabian Nights The Morals of Marcus Ordeyne The Man Who Was Thursday which he liked without understanding Stover at Yale that became somewhat of a text book Dombey and Son because he thought he really should read better stuff Robert Chambers David Graham Phillips and E Phillips Oppenheim complete and a scattering of Tennyson and Kipling Of all his class work only L Allegro and some quality of rigid clarity in solid geometry stirred his languid interest As June drew near he felt the need of conversation to formulate his own ideas and to his surprise found a company philosopher in Rahill the president of the sixth form In many a talk on the highroad or lying belly down along the edge of the baseball diamond or late at night with their cigarettes glowing in the dark they threshed out the questions of school and there was developed the term slicker Got tobacco whispered Rahill one night putting his head inside the door five minutes after lights Sure I m coming in Take a couple of pillows and lie in the window seat why don t you Amory sat up in bed and lit a cigarette while Rahill settled for a conversation Rahill s favorite subject was the respective futures of the sixth form and Amory never tired of outlining them for his benefit Ted Converse At s easy He ll fail his exams tutor all summer at Harstrum s get into Sheff with about four conditions and flunk out in the middle of the freshman year Then he ll go back West and raise hell for a year or so finally his father will make him go into the paint business He ll marry and have four sons all bone heads He ll always think saint Regis s spoiled him so he ll send his sons to day school in Portland He ll die of locomotor ataxia when he s forty one and his wife will give a baptizing stand or whatever you call it to the Presbyterian Church with his name on it Hold up Amory That s too darned gloomy How about yourself I m in a superior class You are too We re philosophers 
125_121342_000036_000001	train-clean-100	I m not Sure 
none	none	you are You ve got a darn good head on you But Amory knew that nothing in the abstract no theory or generality ever moved Rahill until he stubbed his toe upon the concrete minutiae of it Haven t insisted Rahill I let people impose on me here and don t get anything out of it I m the prey of my friends damn it do their lessons get em out of trouble pay em stupid summer visits and always entertain their kid sisters keep my temper when they get selfish and then they think they pay me back by voting for me and telling me I m the big man of saint Regis s I want to get where everybody does their own work and I can tell people where to go I m tired of being nice to every poor fish in school You re not a slicker said Amory suddenly A what A slicker What the devil s that Well it s something that that there s a lot of them You re not one and neither am I though I am more than you are Who is one What makes you one Amory considered Why why I suppose that the sign of it is when a fellow slicks his hair back with water Like Carstairs Yes sure He s a slicker They spent two evenings getting an exact definition The slicker was good looking or clean looking he had brains social brains that is and he used all means on the broad path of honesty to get ahead be popular admired and never in trouble He dressed well was particularly neat in appearance and derived his name from the fact that his hair was inevitably worn short soaked in water or tonic parted in the middle and slicked back as the current of fashion dictated The slickers of that year had adopted tortoise shell spectacles as badges of their slickerhood and this made them so easy to recognize that Amory and Rahill never missed one The slicker seemed distributed through school always a little wiser and shrewder than his contemporaries managing some team or other and keeping his cleverness carefully concealed Amory found the slicker a most valuable classification until his junior year in college when the outline became so blurred and indeterminate that it had to be subdivided many times and became only a quality Amory s secret ideal had all the slicker qualifications but in addition courage and tremendous brains and talents also Amory conceded him a bizarre streak that was quite irreconcilable to the slicker proper This was a first real break from the hypocrisy of school tradition The slicker was a definite element of success differing intrinsically from the prep school big man THE SLICKER one Clever sense of social values two Dresses well Pretends that dress is superficial but knows that it isn t three Goes into such activities as he can shine in four Gets to college and is in a worldly way successful five Hair slicked THE BIG MAN one Inclined to stupidity and unconscious of social values two Thinks dress is superficial and is inclined to be careless about it three Goes out for everything from a sense of duty four Gets to college and has a problematical future Feels lost without his circle and always says that school days were happiest after all Goes back to school and makes speeches about what saint Regis s boys are doing five Hair not slicked Amory had decided definitely on Princeton even though he would be the only boy entering that year from saint Regis Yale had a romance and glamour from the tales of Minneapolis and saint Regis men who had been tapped for Skull and Bones but Princeton drew him most with its atmosphere of bright colors and its alluring reputation as the pleasantest country club in America Dwarfed by the menacing college exams Amory s school days drifted into the past Years afterward when he went back to saint Regis he seemed to have forgotten the successes of sixth form year and to be able to picture himself only as the unadjustable boy who had hurried down corridors jeered at by his rabid contemporaries mad with common sense CHAPTER two Spires and Gargoyles At first Amory noticed only the wealth of sunshine creeping across the long green swards dancing on the leaded window panes and swimming around the tops of spires and towers and battlemented walls Gradually he realized that he was really walking up University Place self conscious about his suitcase developing a new tendency to glare straight ahead when he passed any one Several times he could have sworn that men turned to look at him critically He wondered vaguely if there was something the matter with his clothes and wished he had shaved that morning on the train He felt unnecessarily stiff and awkward among these white flannelled bareheaded youths who must be juniors and seniors judging from the savoir faire with which they strolled He found that twelve University Place was a large dilapidated mansion at present apparently uninhabited though he knew it housed usually a dozen freshmen After a hurried skirmish with his landlady he sallied out on a tour of exploration but he had gone scarcely a block when he became horribly conscious that he must be the only man in town who was wearing a hat He returned hurriedly to twelve University left his derby and emerging bareheaded loitered down Nassau Street stopping to investigate a display of athletic photographs in a store window including a large one of Allenby the football captain and next attracted by the sign Jigger Shop over a confectionary window This sounded familiar so he sauntered in and took a seat on a high stool Chocolate sundae he told a colored person Double chocolate jiggah Anything else Why yes Bacon bun Why yes He munched four of these finding them of pleasing savor and then consumed another double chocolate jigger before ease descended upon him After a cursory inspection of the pillow cases leather pennants and Gibson Girls that lined the walls he left and continued along Nassau Street with his hands in his pockets Gradually he was learning to distinguish between upper classmen and entering men even though the freshman cap would not appear until the following Monday Those who were too obviously too nervously at home were freshmen for as each train brought a new contingent it was immediately absorbed into the hatless white shod book laden throng whose function seemed to be to drift endlessly up and down the street emitting great clouds of smoke from brand new pipes By afternoon Amory realized that now the newest arrivals were taking him for an upper classman and he tried conscientiously to look both pleasantly blase and casually critical which was as near as he could analyze the prevalent facial expression At five o clock he felt the need of hearing his own voice so he retreated to his house to see if any one else had arrived Having climbed the rickety stairs he scrutinized his room resignedly concluding that it was hopeless to attempt any more inspired decoration than class banners and tiger pictures There was a tap at the door Come in A slim face with gray eyes and a humorous smile appeared in the doorway Got a hammer No sorry Maybe missus Twelve or whatever she goes by has one The stranger advanced into the room You an inmate of this asylum Amory nodded Awful barn for the rent we pay Amory had to agree that it was I thought of the campus he said but they say there s so few freshmen that they re lost Have to sit around and study for something to do The gray eyed man decided to introduce himself My name s Holiday Blaine s my name They shook hands with the fashionable low swoop Amory grinned Where d you prep Andover where did you saint Regis s Oh did you I had a cousin there They discussed the cousin thoroughly and then Holiday announced that he was to meet his brother for dinner at six Come along and have a bite with us All right At the Kenilworth Amory met Burne Holiday he of the gray eyes was Kerry and during a limpid meal of thin soup and anaemic vegetables they stared at the other freshmen who sat either in small groups looking very ill at ease or in large groups seeming very much at home I hear Commons is pretty bad said Amory That s the rumor But you ve got to eat there or pay anyways Crime Imposition Oh at Princeton you ve got to swallow everything the first year It s like a damned prep school Amory agreed Lot of pep though he insisted I wouldn t have gone to Yale for a million Me either You going out for anything inquired Amory of the elder brother Not me Burne here is going out for the Prince the Daily Princetonian you know Yes I know You going out for anything Why yes I m going to take a whack at freshman football Play at saint Regis s Some admitted Amory depreciatingly but I m getting so damned thin You re not thin Well I used to be stocky last fall Oh After supper they attended the movies where Amory was fascinated by the glib comments of a man in front of him as well as by the wild yelling and shouting Yoho Oh honey baby you re so big and strong but oh so gentle Clinch Oh Clinch Kiss her kiss at lady quick Oh h h A group began whistling By the Sea and the audience took it up noisily This was followed by an indistinguishable song that included much stamping and then by an endless incoherent dirge Oh h h h h She works in a Jam Factoree And that may be all right But you can t fool me For I know DAMN WELL That she DON T make jam all night Oh h h h As they pushed out giving and receiving curious impersonal glances Amory decided that he liked the movies wanted to enjoy them as the row of upper classmen in front had enjoyed them with their arms along the backs of the seats their comments Gaelic and caustic their attitude a mixture of critical wit and tolerant amusement Want a sundae I mean a jigger asked Kerry Sure They suppered heavily and then still sauntering eased back to twelve Wonderful night It s a whiz You men going to unpack Guess so Come on Burne Amory decided to sit for a while on the front steps so he bade them good night The great tapestries of trees had darkened to ghosts back at the last edge of twilight The early moon had drenched the arches with pale blue and weaving over the night in and out of the gossamer rifts of moon swept a song a song with more than a hint of sadness infinitely transient infinitely regretful He remembered that an alumnus of the nineties had told him of one of Booth Tarkington s amusements standing in mid campus in the small hours and singing tenor songs to the stars arousing mingled emotions in the couched undergraduates according to the sentiment of their moods Now far down the shadowy line of University Place a white clad phalanx broke the gloom and marching figures white shirted white trousered swung rhythmically up the street with linked arms and heads thrown back Going back going back Going back to Nas sau Hall Going back going back To the Best Old Place of All Going back going back From all this earth ly ball We ll clear the track as we go back Going back to Nas sau Hall Amory closed his eyes as the ghostly procession drew near The song soared so high that all dropped out except the tenors who bore the melody triumphantly past the danger point and relinquished it to the fantastic chorus Then Amory opened his eyes half afraid that sight would spoil the rich illusion of harmony He sighed eagerly There at the head of the white platoon marched Allenby the football captain slim and defiant as if aware that this year the hopes of the college rested on him that his hundred and sixty pounds were expected to dodge to victory through the heavy blue and crimson lines Fascinated Amory watched each rank of linked arms as it came abreast the faces indistinct above the polo shirts the voices blent in a paean of triumph and then the procession passed through shadowy Campbell Arch and the voices grew fainter as it wound eastward over the campus The minutes passed and Amory sat there very quietly He regretted the rule that would forbid freshmen to be outdoors after curfew for he wanted to ramble through the shadowy scented lanes where Witherspoon brooded like a dark mother over Whig and Clio her Attic children where the black Gothic snake of Little curled down to Cuyler and Patton these in turn flinging the mystery out over the placid slope rolling to the lake Princeton of the daytime filtered slowly into his consciousness West and Reunion redolent of the sixties Seventy nine Hall brick red and arrogant Upper and Lower Pyne aristocratic Elizabethan ladies not quite content to live among shopkeepers and topping all climbing with clear blue aspiration the great dreaming spires of Holder and Cleveland towers From the first he loved Princeton its lazy beauty its half grasped significance the wild moonlight revel of the rushes the handsome prosperous big game crowds and under it all the air of struggle that pervaded his class From the day when wild eyed and exhausted the jerseyed freshmen sat in the gymnasium and elected some one from Hill School class president a Lawrenceville celebrity vice president a hockey star from saint Paul s secretary up until the end of sophomore year it never ceased that breathless social system that worship seldom named never really admitted of the bogey Big Man First it was schools and Amory alone from saint Regis watched the crowds form and widen and form again saint Paul s Hill Pomfret eating at certain tacitly reserved tables in Commons dressing in their own corners of the gymnasium and drawing unconsciously about them a barrier of the slightly less important but socially ambitious to protect them from the friendly rather puzzled high school element From the moment he realized this Amory resented social barriers as artificial distinctions made by the strong to bolster up their weak retainers and keep out the almost strong Having decided to be one of the gods of the class he reported for freshman football practice but in the second week playing quarter back already paragraphed in corners of the Princetonian he wrenched his knee seriously enough to put him out for the rest of the season This forced him to retire and consider the situation twelve Univee housed a dozen miscellaneous question marks There were three or four inconspicuous and quite startled boys from Lawrenceville two amateur wild men from a New York private school Kerry Holiday christened them the plebeian drunks a Jewish youth also from New York and as compensation for Amory the two Holidays to whom he took an instant fancy The Holidays were rumored twins but really the dark haired one Kerry was a year older than his blond brother Burne Kerry was tall with humorous gray eyes and a sudden attractive smile he became at once the mentor of the house reaper of ears that grew too high censor of conceit vendor of rare satirical humor Amory spread the table of their future friendship with all his ideas of what college should and did mean Kerry not inclined as yet to take things seriously chided him gently for being curious at this inopportune time about the intricacies of the social system but liked him and was both interested and amused Burne fair haired silent and intent appeared in the house only as a busy apparition gliding in quietly at night and off again in the early morning to get up his work in the library he was out for the Princetonian competing furiously against forty others for the coveted first place In December he came down with diphtheria and some one else won the competition but returning to college in February he dauntlessly went after the prize again Necessarily Amory s acquaintance with him was in the way of three minute chats walking to and from lectures so he failed to penetrate Burne s one absorbing interest and find what lay beneath it Amory was far from contented He missed the place he had won at saint Regis the being known and admired yet Princeton stimulated him and there were many things ahead calculated to arouse the Machiavelli latent in him could he but insert a wedge The upper class clubs concerning which he had pumped a reluctant graduate during the previous summer excited his curiosity Ivy detached and breathlessly aristocratic Cottage an impressive melange of brilliant adventurers and well dressed philanderers Tiger Inn broad shouldered and athletic vitalized by an honest elaboration of prep school standards Cap and Gown anti alcoholic faintly religious and politically powerful flamboyant Colonial literary Quadrangle and the dozen others varying in age and position Anything which brought an under classman into too glaring a light was labelled with the damning brand of running it out The movies thrived on caustic comments but the men who made them were generally running it out talking of clubs was running it out standing for anything very strongly as for instance drinking parties or teetotalling was running it out in short being personally conspicuous was not tolerated and the influential man was the non committal man until at club elections in sophomore year every one should be sewed up in some bag for the rest of his college career Amory found that writing for the Nassau Literary Magazine would get him nothing but that being on the board of the Daily Princetonian would get any one a good deal His vague desire to do immortal acting with the English Dramatic Association faded out when he found that the most ingenious brains and talents were concentrated upon the Triangle Club a musical comedy organization that every year took a great Christmas trip In the meanwhile feeling strangely alone and restless in Commons with new desires and ambitions stirring in his mind he let the first term go by between an envy of the embryo successes and a puzzled fretting with Kerry as to why they were not accepted immediately among the elite of the class Many afternoons they lounged in the windows of twelve Univee and watched the class pass to and from Commons noting satellites already attaching themselves to the more prominent watching the lonely grind with his hurried step and downcast eye envying the happy security of the big school groups We re the damned middle class that s what he complained to Kerry one day as he lay stretched out on the sofa consuming a family of Fatimas with contemplative precision Well why not We came to Princeton so we could feel that way toward the small colleges have it on em more self confidence dress better cut a swathe Oh it isn t that I mind the glittering caste system admitted Amory I like having a bunch of hot cats on top but gosh Kerry I ve got to be one of them But just now Amory you re only a sweaty bourgeois Amory lay for a moment without speaking I won t be long he said finally But I hate to get anywhere by working for it I ll show the marks don t you know Honorable scars Kerry craned his neck suddenly at the street There s Langueduc if you want to see what he looks like and Humbird just behind Amory rose dynamically and sought the windows Oh he said scrutinizing these worthies Humbird looks like a knock out but this Langueduc he s the rugged type isn t he I distrust that sort All diamonds look big in the rough Well said Kerry as the excitement subsided you re a literary genius It s up to you I wonder Amory paused if I could be I honestly think so sometimes That sounds like the devil and I wouldn t say it to anybody except you Well go ahead Let your hair grow and write poems like this guy D Invilliers in the Lit Amory reached lazily at a pile of magazines on the table Read his latest effort Never miss em They re rare Amory glanced through the issue Hello he said in surprise he s a freshman isn t he Yeah Listen to this My God A serving lady speaks Black velvet trails its folds over the day White tapers prisoned in their silver frames Wave their thin flames like shadows in the wind Pia Pompia come come away Now what the devil does that mean It s a pantry scene Her toes are stiffened like a stork s in flight She s laid upon her bed on the white sheets Her hands pressed on her smooth bust like a saint Bella Cunizza come into the light My gosh Kerry what in hell is it all about I swear I don t get him at all and I m a literary bird myself It s pretty tricky said Kerry only you ve got to think of hearses and stale milk when you read it That isn t as pash as some of them Amory tossed the magazine on the table Well he sighed I sure am up in the air I know I m not a regular fellow yet I loathe anybody else that isn t I can t decide whether to cultivate my mind and be a great dramatist or to thumb my nose at the Golden Treasury and be a Princeton slicker Why decide suggested Kerry Better drift like me I m going to sail into prominence on Burne s coat tails I can t drift I want to be interested I want to pull strings even for somebody else or be Princetonian chairman or Triangle president I want to be admired Kerry You re thinking too much about yourself Amory sat up at this No I m thinking about you too We ve got to get out and mix around the class right now when it s fun to be a snob I d like to bring a sardine to the prom in June for instance but I wouldn t do it unless I could be damn debonaire about it introduce her to all the prize parlor snakes and the football captain and all that simple stuff Amory said Kerry impatiently you re just going around in a circle If you want to be prominent get out and try for something if you don t just take it easy He yawned Come on let s let the smoke drift off We ll go down and watch football practice Amory gradually accepted this point of view decided that next fall would inaugurate his career and relinquished himself to watching Kerry extract joy from twelve Univee They filled the Jewish youth s bed with lemon pie they put out the gas all over the house every night by blowing into the jet in Amory s room to the bewilderment of missus Twelve and the local plumber they set up the effects of the plebeian drunks pictures books and furniture in the bathroom to the confusion of the pair who hazily discovered the transposition on their return from a Trenton spree they were disappointed beyond measure when the plebeian drunks decided to take it as a joke they played red dog and twenty one and jackpot from dinner to dawn and on the occasion of one man s birthday persuaded him to buy sufficient champagne for a hilarious celebration The donor of the party having remained sober Kerry and Amory accidentally dropped him down two flights of stairs and called shame faced and penitent at the infirmary all the following week Say who are all these women demanded Kerry one day protesting at the size of Amory s mail I ve been looking at the postmarks lately Farmington and Dobbs and Westover and Dana Hall what s the idea Amory grinned All from the Twin Cities He named them off There s Marylyn De Witt she s pretty got a car of her own and that s damn convenient there s Sally Weatherby she s getting too fat there s Myra saint Claire she s an old flame easy to kiss if you like it What line do you throw em demanded Kerry I ve tried everything and the mad wags aren t even afraid of me You re the nice boy type suggested Amory That s just it Mother always feels the girl is safe if she s with me Honestly it s annoying If I start to hold somebody s hand they laugh at me and let me just as if it wasn t part of them As soon as I get hold of a hand they sort of disconnect it from the rest of them Sulk suggested Amory Tell em you re wild and have em reform you go home furious come back in half an hour startle em Kerry shook his head No chance I wrote a saint Timothy girl a really loving letter last year In one place I got rattled and said My God how I love you She took a nail scissors clipped out the My God and showed the rest of the letter all over school Doesn t work at all I m just good old Kerry and all that rot Amory smiled and tried to picture himself as good old Amory He failed completely February dripped snow and rain the cyclonic freshman mid years passed and life in twelve Univee continued interesting if not purposeful Once a day Amory indulged in a club sandwich cornflakes and Julienne potatoes at Joe s accompanied usually by Kerry or Alec Connage The latter was a quiet rather aloof slicker from Hotchkiss who lived next door and shared the same enforced singleness as Amory due to the fact that his entire class had gone to Yale Joe s was unaesthetic and faintly unsanitary but a limitless charge account could be opened there a convenience that Amory appreciated His father had been experimenting with mining stocks and in consequence his allowance while liberal was not at all what he had expected Joe s had the additional advantage of seclusion from curious upper class eyes so at four each afternoon Amory accompanied by friend or book went up to experiment with his digestion One day in March finding that all the tables were occupied he slipped into a chair opposite a freshman who bent intently over a book at the last table They nodded briefly For twenty minutes Amory sat consuming bacon buns and reading missus Warren s Profession he had discovered Shaw quite by accident while browsing in the library during mid years the other freshman also intent on his volume meanwhile did away with a trio of chocolate malted milks By and by Amory s eyes wandered curiously to his fellow luncher s book He spelled out the name and title upside down Marpessa by Stephen Phillips This meant nothing to him his metrical education having been confined to such Sunday classics as Come into the Garden Maude and what morsels of Shakespeare and Milton had been recently forced upon him Moved to address his vis a vis he simulated interest in his book for a moment and then exclaimed aloud as if involuntarily Ha Great stuff The other freshman looked up and Amory registered artificial embarrassment Are you referring to your bacon buns His cracked kindly voice went well with the large spectacles and the impression of a voluminous keenness that he gave No Amory answered I was referring to Bernard Shaw He turned the book around in explanation I ve never read any Shaw I ve always meant to The boy paused and then continued Did you ever read Stephen Phillips or do you like
249_121331_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 poetry 
none	none	Yes indeed Amory affirmed eagerly I ve never read much of Phillips though He had never heard of any Phillips except the late David Graham It s pretty fair I think Of course he s a Victorian They sallied into a discussion of poetry in the course of which they introduced themselves and Amory s companion proved to be none other than that awful highbrow Thomas Parke D Invilliers who signed the passionate love poems in the Lit He was perhaps nineteen with stooped shoulders pale blue eyes and as Amory could tell from his general appearance without much conception of social competition and such phenomena of absorbing interest Still he liked books and it seemed forever since Amory had met any one who did if only that saint Paul s crowd at the next table would not mistake him for a bird too he would enjoy the encounter tremendously They didn t seem to be noticing so he let himself go discussed books by the dozens books he had read read about books he had never heard of rattling off lists of titles with the facility of a Brentano s clerk D Invilliers was partially taken in and wholly delighted In a good natured way he had almost decided that Princeton was one part deadly Philistines and one part deadly grinds and to find a person who could mention Keats without stammering yet evidently washed his hands was rather a treat Ever read any Oscar Wilde he asked No Who wrote it It s a man don t you know Oh surely A faint chord was struck in Amory s memory Wasn t the comic opera Patience written about him Yes that s the fella I ve just finished a book of his The Picture of Dorian Gray and I certainly wish you d read it You d like it You can borrow it if you want to Why I d like it a lot thanks Don t you want to come up to the room I ve got a few other books Amory hesitated glanced at the saint Paul s group one of them was the magnificent exquisite Humbird and he considered how determinate the addition of this friend would be He never got to the stage of making them and getting rid of them he was not hard enough for that so he measured Thomas Parke D Invilliers undoubted attractions and value against the menace of cold eyes behind tortoise rimmed spectacles that he fancied glared from the next table Yes I ll go So he found Dorian Gray and the Mystic and Somber Dolores and the Belle Dame sans Merci for a month was keen on naught else The world became pale and interesting and he tried hard to look at Princeton through the satiated eyes of Oscar Wilde and Swinburne or Fingal O Flaherty and Algernon Charles as he called them in precieuse jest He read enormously every night Shaw Chesterton Barrie Pinero Yeats Synge Ernest Dowson Arthur Symons Keats Sudermann Robert Hugh Benson the Savoy Operas just a heterogeneous mixture for he suddenly discovered that he had read nothing for years Tom D Invilliers became at first an occasion rather than a friend Amory saw him about once a week and together they gilded the ceiling of Tom s room and decorated the walls with imitation tapestry bought at an auction tall candlesticks and figured curtains Amory liked him for being clever and literary without effeminacy or affectation In fact Amory did most of the strutting and tried painfully to make every remark an epigram than which if one is content with ostensible epigrams there are many feats harder twelve Univee was amused Kerry read Dorian Gray and simulated Lord Henry following Amory about addressing him as Dorian and pretending to encourage in him wicked fancies and attenuated tendencies to ennui When he carried it into Commons to the amazement of the others at table Amory became furiously embarrassed and after that made epigrams only before D Invilliers or a convenient mirror One day Tom and Amory tried reciting their own and Lord Dunsany s poems to the music of Kerry s graphophone Chant cried Tom Don t recite Chant Amory who was performing looked annoyed and claimed that he needed a record with less piano in it Kerry thereupon rolled on the floor in stifled laughter Put on Hearts and Flowers he howled Oh my Lord I m going to cast a kitten Shut off the damn graphophone Amory cried rather red in the face I m not giving an exhibition In the meanwhile Amory delicately kept trying to awaken a sense of the social system in D Invilliers for he knew that this poet was really more conventional than he and needed merely watered hair a smaller range of conversation and a darker brown hat to become quite regular But the liturgy of Livingstone collars and dark ties fell on heedless ears in fact D Invilliers faintly resented his efforts so Amory confined himself to calls once a week and brought him occasionally to twelve Univee This caused mild titters among the other freshmen who called them Doctor Johnson and Boswell Alec Connage another frequent visitor liked him in a vague way but was afraid of him as a highbrow Kerry who saw through his poetic patter to the solid almost respectable depths within was immensely amused and would have him recite poetry by the hour while he lay with closed eyes on Amory s sofa and listened Asleep or waking is it for her neck Kissed over close wears yet a purple speck Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out Soft and stung softly fairer for a fleck That s good Kerry would say softly It pleases the elder Holiday That s a great poet I guess Tom delighted at an audience would ramble through the Poems and Ballades until Kerry and Amory knew them almost as well as he Amory took to writing poetry on spring afternoons in the gardens of the big estates near Princeton while swans made effective atmosphere in the artificial pools and slow clouds sailed harmoniously above the willows May came too soon and suddenly unable to bear walls he wandered the campus at all hours through starlight and rain A DAMP SYMBOLIC INTERLUDE The night mist fell From the moon it rolled clustered about the spires and towers and then settled below them so that the dreaming peaks were still in lofty aspiration toward the sky Figures that dotted the day like ants now brushed along as shadowy ghosts in and out of the foreground The Gothic halls and cloisters were infinitely more mysterious as they loomed suddenly out of the darkness outlined each by myriad faint squares of yellow light Indefinitely from somewhere a bell boomed the quarter hour and Amory pausing by the sun dial stretched himself out full length on the damp grass The cool bathed his eyes and slowed the flight of time time that had crept so insidiously through the lazy April afternoons seemed so intangible in the long spring twilights Evening after evening the senior singing had drifted over the campus in melancholy beauty and through the shell of his undergraduate consciousness had broken a deep and reverent devotion to the gray walls and Gothic peaks and all they symbolized as warehouses of dead ages The tower that in view of his window sprang upward grew into a spire yearning higher until its uppermost tip was half invisible against the morning skies gave him the first sense of the transiency and unimportance of the campus figures except as holders of the apostolic succession He liked knowing that Gothic architecture with its upward trend was peculiarly appropriate to universities and the idea became personal to him The silent stretches of green the quiet halls with an occasional late burning scholastic light held his imagination in a strong grasp and the chastity of the spire became a symbol of this perception Damn it all he whispered aloud wetting his hands in the damp and running them through his hair Next year I work Yet he knew that where now the spirit of spires and towers made him dreamily acquiescent it would then overawe him Where now he realized only his own inconsequence effort would make him aware of his own impotency and insufficiency The college dreamed on awake He felt a nervous excitement that might have been the very throb of its slow heart It was a stream where he was to throw a stone whose faint ripple would be vanishing almost as it left his hand As yet he had given nothing he had taken nothing A belated freshman his oilskin slicker rasping loudly slushed along the soft path A voice from somewhere called the inevitable formula Stick out your head below an unseen window A hundred little sounds of the current drifting on under the fog pressed in finally on his consciousness Oh God he cried suddenly and started at the sound of his voice in the stillness The rain dripped on A minute longer he lay without moving his hands clinched Then he sprang to his feet and gave his clothes a tentative pat I m very damn wet he said aloud to the sun dial HISTORICAL The war began in the summer following his freshman year Beyond a sporting interest in the German dash for Paris the whole affair failed either to thrill or interest him With the attitude he might have held toward an amusing melodrama he hoped it would be long and bloody If it had not continued he would have felt like an irate ticket holder at a prize fight where the principals refused to mix it up That was his total reaction HA HA HORTENSE All right ponies Shake it up Hey ponies how about easing up on that crap game and shaking a mean hip Hey ponies The coach fumed helplessly the Triangle Club president glowering with anxiety varied between furious bursts of authority and fits of temperamental lassitude when he sat spiritless and wondered how the devil the show was ever going on tour by Christmas All right We ll take the pirate song The ponies took last drags at their cigarettes and slumped into place the leading lady rushed into the foreground setting his hands and feet in an atmospheric mince and as the coach clapped and stamped and tumped and da da d they hashed out a dance A great seething ant hill was the Triangle Club It gave a musical comedy every year travelling with cast chorus orchestra and scenery all through Christmas vacation The play and music were the work of undergraduates and the club itself was the most influential of institutions over three hundred men competing for it every year Amory after an easy victory in the first sophomore Princetonian competition stepped into a vacancy of the cast as Boiling Oil a Pirate Lieutenant Every night for the last week they had rehearsed Ha Ha Hortense in the Casino from two in the afternoon until eight in the morning sustained by dark and powerful coffee and sleeping in lectures through the interim A rare scene the Casino A big barnlike auditorium dotted with boys as girls boys as pirates boys as babies the scenery in course of being violently set up the spotlight man rehearsing by throwing weird shafts into angry eyes over all the constant tuning of the orchestra or the cheerful tumpty tump of a Triangle tune The boy who writes the lyrics stands in the corner biting a pencil with twenty minutes to think of an encore the business manager argues with the secretary as to how much money can be spent on those damn milkmaid costumes the old graduate president in ninety eight perches on a box and thinks how much simpler it was in his day How a Triangle show ever got off was a mystery but it was a riotous mystery anyway whether or not one did enough service to wear a little gold Triangle on his watch chain Ha Ha Hortense was written over six times and had the names of nine collaborators on the programme All Triangle shows started by being something different not just a regular musical comedy but when the several authors the president the coach and the faculty committee finished with it there remained just the old reliable Triangle show with the old reliable jokes and the star comedian who got expelled or sick or something just before the trip and the dark whiskered man in the pony ballet who absolutely won t shave twice a day doggone it There was one brilliant place in Ha Ha Hortense It is a Princeton tradition that whenever a Yale man who is a member of the widely advertised Skull and Bones hears the sacred name mentioned he must leave the room It is also a tradition that the members are invariably successful in later life amassing fortunes or votes or coupons or whatever they choose to amass Therefore at each performance of Ha Ha Hortense half a dozen seats were kept from sale and occupied by six of the worst looking vagabonds that could be hired from the streets further touched up by the Triangle make up man At the moment in the show where Firebrand the Pirate Chief pointed at his black flag and said I am a Yale graduate note my Skull and Bones at this very moment the six vagabonds were instructed to rise conspicuously and leave the theatre with looks of deep melancholy and an injured dignity It was claimed though never proved that on one occasion the hired Elis were swelled by one of the real thing They played through vacation to the fashionable of eight cities Amory liked Louisville and Memphis best these knew how to meet strangers furnished extraordinary punch and flaunted an astonishing array of feminine beauty Chicago he approved for a certain verve that transcended its loud accent however it was a Yale town and as the Yale Glee Club was expected in a week the Triangle received only divided homage In Baltimore Princeton was at home and every one fell in love There was a proper consumption of strong waters all along the line one man invariably went on the stage highly stimulated claiming that his particular interpretation of the part required it There were three private cars however no one slept except in the third car which was called the animal car and where were herded the spectacled wind jammers of the orchestra Everything was so hurried that there was no time to be bored but when they arrived in Philadelphia with vacation nearly over there was rest in getting out of the heavy atmosphere of flowers and grease paint and the ponies took off their corsets with abdominal pains and sighs of relief When the disbanding came Amory set out post haste for Minneapolis for Sally Weatherby s cousin Isabelle Borge was coming to spend the winter in Minneapolis while her parents went abroad He remembered Isabelle only as a little girl with whom he had played sometimes when he first went to Minneapolis She had gone to Baltimore to live but since then she had developed a past Amory was in full stride confident nervous and jubilant Scurrying back to Minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty six hours PETTING On the Triangle trip Amory had come into constant contact with that great current American phenomenon the petting party None of the Victorian mothers and most of the mothers were Victorian had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed Servant girls are that way says missus Huston Carmelite to her popular daughter They are kissed first and proposed to afterward But the Popular Daughter becomes engaged every six months between sixteen and twenty two when she arranges a match with young Hambell of Cambell Hambell who fatuously considers himself her first love and between engagements the P D she is selected by the cut in system at dances which favors the survival of the fittest has other sentimental last kisses in the moonlight or the firelight or the outer darkness Amory saw girls doing things that even in his memory would have been impossible eating three o clock after dance suppers in impossible cafes talking of every side of life with an air half of earnestness half of mockery yet with a furtive excitement that Amory considered stood for a real moral let down But he never realized how wide spread it was until he saw the cities between New York and Chicago as one vast juvenile intrigue Afternoon at the Plaza with winter twilight hovering outside and faint drums down stairs they strut and fret in the lobby taking another cocktail scrupulously attired and waiting Then the swinging doors revolve and three bundles of fur mince in The theatre comes afterward then a table at the Midnight Frolic of course mother will be along there but she will serve only to make things more secretive and brilliant as she sits in solitary state at the deserted table and thinks such entertainments as this are not half so bad as they are painted only rather wearying But the P D is in love again it was odd wasn t it that though there was so much room left in the taxi the P D and the boy from Williams were somehow crowded out and had to go in a separate car Odd Didn t you notice how flushed the P D was when she arrived just seven minutes late But the P D gets away with it The belle had become the flirt the flirt had become the baby vamp The belle had five or six callers every afternoon If the P D by some strange accident has two it is made pretty uncomfortable for the one who hasn t a date with her The belle was surrounded by a dozen men in the intermissions between dances Try to find the P D between dances just try to find her The same girl deep in an atmosphere of jungle music and the questioning of moral codes Amory found it rather fascinating to feel that any popular girl he met before eight he might

none	none	kiss before twelve Why on earth are we here he asked the girl with the green combs one night as they sat in some one s limousine outside the Country Club in Louisville I don t know I m just full of the devil Let s be frank we ll never see each other again I wanted to come out here with you because I thought you were the best looking girl in sight You really don t care whether you ever see me again do you No but is this your line for every girl What have I done to deserve it And you didn t feel tired dancing or want a cigarette or any of the things you said You just wanted to be Oh let s go in she interrupted if you want to analyze Let s not talk about it When the hand knit sleeveless jerseys were stylish Amory in a burst of inspiration named them petting shirts The name travelled from coast to coast on the lips of parlor snakes and P D s DESCRIPTIVE Amory was now eighteen years old just under six feet tall and exceptionally but not conventionally handsome He had rather a young face the ingenuousness of which was marred by the penetrating green eyes fringed with long dark eyelashes He lacked somehow that intense animal magnetism that so often accompanies beauty in men or women his personality seemed rather a mental thing and it was not in his power to turn it on and off like a water faucet But people never forgot his face ISABELLE She paused at the top of the staircase The sensations attributed to divers on spring boards leading ladies on opening nights and lumpy husky young men on the day of the Big Game crowded through her She should have descended to a burst of drums or a discordant blend of themes from Thais and Carmen She had never been so curious about her appearance she had never been so satisfied with it She had been sixteen years old for six months Isabelle called her cousin Sally from the doorway of the dressing room I m ready She caught a slight lump of nervousness in her throat I had to send back to the house for another pair of slippers It ll be just a minute Isabelle started toward the dressing room for a last peek in the mirror but something decided her to stand there and gaze down the broad stairs of the Minnehaha Club They curved tantalizingly and she could catch just a glimpse of two pairs of masculine feet in the hall below Pump shod in uniform black they gave no hint of identity but she wondered eagerly if one pair were attached to Amory Blaine This young man not as yet encountered had nevertheless taken up a considerable part of her day the first day of her arrival Coming up in the machine from the station Sally had volunteered amid a rain of question comment revelation and exaggeration You remember Amory Blaine of course Well he s simply mad to see you again He s stayed over a day from college and he s coming to night He s heard so much about you says he remembers your eyes This had pleased Isabelle It put them on equal terms although she was quite capable of staging her own romances with or without advance advertising But following her happy tremble of anticipation came a sinking sensation that made her ask How do you mean he s heard about me What sort of things Sally smiled She felt rather in the capacity of a showman with her more exotic cousin He knows you re you re considered beautiful and all that she paused and I guess he knows you ve been kissed At this Isabelle s little fist had clinched suddenly under the fur robe She was accustomed to be thus followed by her desperate past and it never failed to rouse in her the same feeling of resentment yet in a strange town it was an advantageous reputation She was a Speed was she Well let them find out Out of the window Isabelle watched the snow glide by in the frosty morning It was ever so much colder here than in Baltimore she had not remembered the glass of the side door was iced the windows were shirred with snow in the corners Her mind played still with one subject Did he dress like that boy there who walked calmly down a bustling business street in moccasins and winter carnival costume How very Western Of course he wasn t that way he went to Princeton was a sophomore or something Really she had no distinct idea of him An ancient snap shot she had preserved in an old kodak book had impressed her by the big eyes which he had probably grown up to by now However in the last month when her winter visit to Sally had been decided on he had assumed the proportions of a worthy adversary Children most astute of match makers plot their campaigns quickly and Sally had played a clever correspondence sonata to Isabelle s excitable temperament Isabelle had been for some time capable of very strong if very transient emotions They drew up at a spreading white stone building set back from the snowy street missus Weatherby greeted her warmly and her various younger cousins were produced from the corners where they skulked politely Isabelle met them tactfully At her best she allied all with whom she came in contact except older girls and some women All the impressions she made were conscious The half dozen girls she renewed acquaintance with that morning were all rather impressed and as much by her direct personality as by her reputation Amory Blaine was an open subject Evidently a bit light of love neither popular nor unpopular every girl there seemed to have had an affair with him at some time or other but no one volunteered any really useful information He was going to fall for her Sally had published that information to her young set and they were retailing it back to Sally as fast as they set eyes on Isabelle Isabelle resolved secretly that she would if necessary force herself to like him she owed it to Sally Suppose she were terribly disappointed Sally had painted him in such glowing colors he was good looking sort of distinguished when he wants to be had a line and was properly inconstant In fact he summed up all the romance that her age and environment led her to desire She wondered if those were his dancing shoes that fox trotted tentatively around the soft rug below All impressions and in fact all ideas were extremely kaleidoscopic to Isabelle She had that curious mixture of the social and the artistic temperaments found often in two classes society women and actresses Her education or rather her sophistication had been absorbed from the boys who had dangled on her favor her tact was instinctive and her capacity for love affairs was limited only by the number of the susceptible within telephone distance Flirt smiled from her large black brown eyes and shone through her intense physical magnetism So she waited at the head of the stairs that evening while slippers were fetched Just as she was growing impatient Sally came out of the dressing room beaming with her accustomed good nature and high spirits and together they descended to the floor below while the shifting search light of Isabelle s mind flashed on two ideas she was glad she had high color to night and she wondered if he danced well Down stairs in the club s great room she was surrounded for a moment by the girls she had met in the afternoon then she heard Sally s voice repeating a cycle of names and found herself bowing to a sextet of black and white terribly stiff vaguely familiar figures The name Blaine figured somewhere but at first she could not place him A very confused very juvenile moment of awkward backings and bumpings followed and every one found himself talking to the person he least desired to Isabelle manoeuvred herself and Froggy Parker freshman at Harvard with whom she had once played hop scotch to a seat on the stairs A humorous reference to the past was all she needed The things Isabelle could do socially with one idea were remarkable First she repeated it rapturously in an enthusiastic contralto with a soupcon of Southern accent then she held it off at a distance and smiled at it her wonderful smile then she delivered it in variations and played a sort of mental catch with it all this in the nominal form of dialogue Froggy was fascinated and quite unconscious that this was being done not for him but for the green eyes that glistened under the shining carefully watered hair a little to her left for Isabelle had discovered Amory As an actress even in the fullest flush of her own conscious magnetism gets a deep impression of most of the people in the front row so Isabelle sized up her antagonist First he had auburn hair and from her feeling of disappointment she knew that she had expected him to be dark and of garter advertisement slenderness For the rest a faint flush and a straight romantic profile the effect set off by a close fitting dress suit and a silk ruffled shirt of the kind that women still delight to see men wear but men were just beginning to get tired of During this inspection Amory was quietly watching Don t you think so she said suddenly turning to him innocent eyed There was a stir and Sally led the way over to their table Amory struggled to Isabelle s side and whispered You re my dinner partner you know We re all coached for each other Isabelle gasped this was rather right in line But really she felt as if a good speech had been taken from the star and given to a minor character She mustn t lose the leadership a bit The dinner table glittered with laughter at the confusion of getting places and then curious eyes were turned on her sitting near the head She was enjoying this immensely and Froggy Parker was so engrossed with the added sparkle of her rising color that he forgot to pull out Sally s chair and fell into a dim confusion Amory was on the other side full of confidence and vanity gazing at her in open admiration He began directly and so did Froggy I ve heard a lot about you since you wore braids Wasn t it funny this afternoon Both stopped Isabelle turned to Amory shyly Her face was always enough answer for any one but she decided to speak How from whom From everybody for all the years since you ve been away She blushed appropriately On her right Froggy was hors de combat already although he hadn t quite realized it I ll tell you what I remembered about you all these years Amory continued She leaned slightly toward him and looked modestly at the celery before her Froggy sighed he knew Amory and the situations that Amory seemed born to handle He turned to Sally and asked her if she was going away to school next year Amory opened with grape shot I ve got an adjective that just fits you This was one of his favorite starts he seldom had a word in mind but it was a curiosity provoker and he could always produce something complimentary if he got in a tight corner Oh what Isabelle s face was a study in enraptured curiosity 
249_121331_000091_000000	train-clean-360	Amory shook his head 
none	none	I don t know you very well yet Will you tell me afterward she half whispered He nodded We ll sit out Isabelle nodded Did any one ever tell you you have keen eyes she said Amory attempted to make them look even keener He fancied but he was not sure that her foot had just touched his under the table But it might possibly have been only the table leg It was so hard to tell Still it thrilled him He wondered quickly if there would be any difficulty in securing the little den up stairs BABES IN THE WOODS Isabelle and Amory were distinctly not innocent nor were they particularly brazen Moreover amateur standing had very little value in the game they were playing a game that would presumably be her principal study for years to come She had begun as he had with good looks and an excitable temperament and the rest was the result of accessible popular novels and dressing room conversation culled from a slightly older set Isabelle had walked with an artificial gait at nine and a half and when her eyes wide and starry proclaimed the ingenue most Amory was proportionately less deceived He waited for the mask to drop off but at the same time he did not question her right to wear it She on her part was not impressed by his studied air of blase sophistication She had lived in a larger city and had slightly an advantage in range But she accepted his pose it was one of the dozen little conventions of this kind of affair He was aware that he was getting this particular favor now because she had been coached he knew that he stood for merely the best game in sight and that he would have to improve his opportunity before he lost his advantage So they proceeded with an infinite guile that would have horrified her parents After the dinner the dance began smoothly Smoothly boys cut in on Isabelle every few feet and then squabbled in the corners with You might let me get more than an inch and She didn t like it either she told me so next time I cut in It was true she told every one so and gave every hand a parting pressure that said You know that your dances are making my evening But time passed two hours of it and the less subtle beaux had better learned to focus their pseudo passionate glances elsewhere for eleven o clock found Isabelle and Amory sitting on the couch in the little den off the reading room up stairs She was conscious that they were a handsome pair and seemed to belong distinctively in this seclusion while lesser lights fluttered and chattered down stairs Boys who passed the door looked in enviously girls who passed only laughed and frowned and grew wise within themselves They had now reached a very definite stage They had traded accounts of their progress since they had met last and she had listened to much she had heard before He was a sophomore was on the Princetonian board hoped to be chairman in senior year He learned that some of the boys she went with in Baltimore were terrible speeds and came to dances in states of artificial stimulation most of them were twenty or so and drove alluring red Stutzes A good half seemed to have already flunked out of various schools and colleges but some of them bore athletic names that made him look at her admiringly As a matter of fact Isabelle s closer acquaintance with the universities was just commencing She had bowing acquaintance with a lot of young men who thought she was a pretty kid worth keeping an eye on But Isabelle strung the names into a fabrication of gayety that would have dazzled a Viennese nobleman Such is the power of young contralto voices on sink down sofas He asked her if she thought he was conceited She said there was a difference between conceit and self confidence She adored self confidence in men Is Froggy a good friend of yours she asked Rather why He s a bum dancer Amory laughed He dances as if the girl were on his back instead of in his arms She appreciated this You re awfully good at sizing people up Amory denied this painfully However he sized up several people for her Then they talked about hands You ve got awfully nice hands she said They look as if you played the piano Do you I have said they had reached a very definite stage nay more a very critical stage Amory had stayed over a day to see her and his train left at twelve eighteen that night His trunk and suitcase awaited him at the station his watch was beginning to hang heavy in his pocket Isabelle he said suddenly I want to tell you something They had been talking lightly about that funny look in her eyes and Isabelle knew from the change in his manner what was coming indeed she had been wondering how soon it would come Amory reached above their heads and turned out the electric light so that they were in the dark except for the red glow that fell through the door from the reading room lamps Then he began I don t know whether or not you know what you what I m going to say Lordy Isabelle this sounds like a line but it isn t I know said Isabelle softly Maybe we ll never meet again like this I have darned hard luck sometimes He was leaning away from her on the other arm of the lounge but she could see his eyes plainly in the dark You ll meet me again silly There was just the slightest emphasis on the last word so that it became almost a term of endearment He continued a bit huskily I ve fallen for a lot of people girls and I guess you have too boys I mean but honestly you he broke off suddenly and leaned forward chin on his hands Oh what s the use you ll go your way and I suppose I ll go mine Silence for a moment Isabelle was quite stirred she wound her handkerchief into a tight ball and by the faint light that streamed over her dropped it deliberately on the floor Their hands touched for an instant but neither spoke Silences were becoming more frequent and more delicious Outside another stray couple had come up and were experimenting on the piano in the next room After the usual preliminary of chopsticks one of them started Babes in the Woods and a light tenor carried the words into the den Give me your hand I ll understand We re off to slumberland Isabelle hummed it softly and trembled as she felt Amory s hand close over hers Isabelle he whispered You know I m mad about you You do give a darn about me Yes How much do you care do you like any one better No He could scarcely hear her although he bent so near that he felt her breath against his cheek Isabelle I m going back to college for six long months and why shouldn t we if I could only just have one thing to remember you by Close the door Her voice had just stirred so that he half wondered whether she had spoken at all As he swung the door softly shut the music seemed quivering just outside Moonlight is bright Kiss me good night What a wonderful song she thought everything was wonderful to night most of all this romantic scene in the den with their hands clinging and the inevitable looming charmingly close The future vista of her life seemed an unending succession of scenes like this under moonlight and pale starlight and in the backs of warm limousines and in low cosy roadsters stopped under sheltering trees only the boy might change and this one was so nice He took her hand softly With a sudden movement he turned it and holding it to his lips kissed the palm Isabelle His whisper blended in the music and they seemed to float nearer together Her breath came faster Can t I kiss you Isabelle Isabelle Lips half parted she turned her head to him in the dark Suddenly the ring of voices the sound of running footsteps surged toward them Quick as a flash Amory reached up and turned on the light and when the door opened and three boys the wrathy and dance craving Froggy among them rushed in he was turning over the magazines on the table while she sat without moving serene and unembarrassed and even greeted them with a welcoming smile But her heart was beating wildly and she felt somehow as if she had been deprived It was evidently over There was a clamor for a dance there was a glance that passed between them on his side despair on hers regret and then the evening went on with the reassured beaux and the eternal cutting in At quarter to twelve Amory shook hands with her gravely in the midst of a small crowd assembled to wish him good speed For an instant he lost his poise and she felt a bit rattled when a satirical voice from a concealed wit cried Take her outside Amory As he took her hand he pressed it a little and she returned the pressure as she had done to twenty hands that evening that was all At two o clock back at the Weatherbys Sally asked her if she and Amory had had a time in the den Isabelle turned to her quietly In her eyes was the light of the idealist the inviolate dreamer of Joan like dreams No she answered I don t do that sort of thing any more he asked me to but I said no As she crept in bed she wondered what he d say in his special delivery to morrow He had such a good looking mouth would she ever Fourteen angels were watching o er them sang Sally sleepily from the next room Damn muttered Isabelle punching the pillow into a luxurious lump and exploring the cold sheets cautiously Damn CARNIVAL Amory by way of the Princetonian had arrived The minor snobs finely balanced thermometers of success warmed to him as the club elections grew nigh and he and Tom were visited by groups of upper classmen who arrived awkwardly balanced on the edge of the furniture and talked of all subjects except the one of absorbing interest Amory was amused at the intent eyes upon him and in case the visitors represented some club in which he was not interested took great pleasure in shocking them with unorthodox remarks Oh let me see he said one night to a flabbergasted delegation what club do you represent With visitors from Ivy and Cottage and Tiger Inn he played the nice unspoilt ingenuous boy very much at ease and quite unaware of the object of the call When the fatal morning arrived early in March and the campus became a document in hysteria he slid smoothly into Cottage with Alec Connage and watched his suddenly neurotic class with much wonder There were fickle groups that jumped from club to club there were friends of two or three days who announced tearfully and wildly that they must join the same club nothing should separate them there were snarling disclosures of long hidden grudges as the Suddenly Prominent remembered snubs of freshman year Unknown men were elevated into importance when they received certain coveted bids others who were considered all set found that they had made unexpected enemies felt themselves stranded and deserted talked wildly of leaving college In his own crowd Amory saw men kept out for wearing green hats for being a damn tailor s dummy for having too much pull in heaven for getting drunk one night not like a gentleman by God or for unfathomable secret reasons known to no one but the wielders of the black balls This orgy of sociability culminated in a gigantic party at the Nassau Inn where punch was dispensed from immense bowls and the whole down stairs became a delirious circulating shouting pattern of faces and voices Hi Dibby gratulations Goo boy Tom you got a good bunch in Cap Say Kerry Oh Kerry I hear you went Tiger with all the weight lifters Well I didn t go Cottage the parlor snakes delight They say Overton fainted when he got his Ivy bid Did he sign up the first day oh no Tore over to Murray Dodge on a bicycle afraid it was a mistake How d you get into Cap you old roue Gratulations Gratulations yourself Hear you got a good crowd When the bar closed the party broke up into groups and streamed singing over the snow clad campus in a weird delusion that snobbishness and strain were over at last and that they could do what they pleased for the next two years Long afterward Amory thought of sophomore spring as the happiest time of his life His ideas were in tune with life as he found it he wanted no more than to drift and dream and enjoy a dozen new found friendships through the April afternoons Alec Connage came into his room one morning and woke him up into the sunshine and peculiar glory of Campbell Hall shining in the window Wake up Original Sin and scrape yourself together Be in front of Renwick s in half an hour Somebody s got a car He took the bureau cover and carefully deposited it with its load of small articles upon the bed Where d you get the car demanded Amory cynically Sacred trust but don t be a critical goopher or you can t go I think I ll sleep Amory said calmly resettling himself and reaching beside the bed for a cigarette Sleep Why not I ve got a class at eleven thirty You damned gloom Of course if you don t want to go to the coast With a bound Amory was out of bed scattering the bureau cover s burden on the floor The coast he hadn t seen it for years since he and his mother were on their pilgrimage Who s going he demanded as he wriggled into his B V D s Oh Dick Humbird and Kerry Holiday and Jesse Ferrenby and oh about five or six Speed it up kid In ten minutes Amory was devouring cornflakes in Renwick s and at nine thirty they bowled happily out of town headed for the sands of Deal Beach You see said Kerry the car belongs down there In fact it was stolen from Asbury Park by persons unknown who deserted it in Princeton and left for the West Heartless Humbird here got permission from the city council to deliver it Anybody got any money suggested Ferrenby turning around from the front seat There was an emphatic negative chorus That makes it interesting Money what s money We can sell the car Charge him salvage or something How re we going to get food asked Amory Honestly answered Kerry eying him reprovingly do you doubt Kerry s ability for three short days Some people have lived on nothing for years at a time Read the Boy Scout Monthly Three days Amory mused and I ve got classes One of the days is the Sabbath Just the same I can only cut six more classes with over a month and a half to go Throw him out It s a long walk back Amory you re running it out if I may coin a new phrase Hadn t you better get some dope on yourself Amory Amory subsided resignedly and drooped into a contemplation of the scenery Swinburne seemed to fit in somehow Oh winter s rains and ruins are over And all the seasons of snows and sins The days dividing lover and lover The light that loses the night that wins And time remembered is grief forgotten And frosts are slain and flowers begotten And in green underwood and cover Blossom by blossom the spring begins The full streams feed on flower of What s the matter Amory Amory s thinking about poetry about the pretty birds and flowers I can see it in his eye No I m not he lied I m thinking about the Princetonian I ought to make up to night but I can telephone back I suppose Oh said Kerry respectfully these important men Amory flushed and it seemed to him that Ferrenby a defeated competitor winced a little Of course Kerry was only kidding but he really mustn t mention the Princetonian It was a halcyon day and as they neared the shore and the salt breezes scurried by he began to picture the ocean and long level stretches of sand and red roofs over blue sea Then they hurried through the little town and it all flashed upon his consciousness to a mighty paean of emotion Oh good Lord Look at it he cried What Let me out quick I haven t seen it for eight years Oh gentlefolk stop the car What an odd child remarked Alec I do believe he s a bit eccentric The car was obligingly drawn up at a curb and Amory ran for the boardwalk First he realized that the sea was blue and that there was an enormous quantity of it and that it roared and roared really all the banalities about the ocean that one could realize but if any one had told him then that these things were banalities he would have gaped in wonder Now we ll get lunch ordered Kerry wandering up with the crowd Come on Amory tear yourself away and get practical We ll try the best hotel first he went on and thence and so forth They strolled along the boardwalk to the most imposing hostelry in sight and entering the dining room scattered about a table Eight Bronxes commanded Alec and a club sandwich and Juliennes The food for one Hand the rest around Amory ate little having seized a chair where he could watch the sea and feel the rock of it When luncheon was over they sat and smoked quietly What s the bill Some one scanned it Eight twenty five Rotten overcharge We ll give them two dollars and one for the waiter Kerry collect the small change The waiter approached and Kerry gravely handed him a dollar tossed two dollars on the check and turned away They sauntered leisurely toward the door pursued in a moment by the suspicious Ganymede Some mistake sir Kerry took the bill and examined it critically No mistake he said shaking his head gravely and tearing it into four pieces he handed the scraps to the waiter who was so dumfounded that he stood motionless and expressionless while they walked out Won t he send after us No said Kerry for a minute he ll think we re the proprietor s sons or something then he ll look at the check again and call the manager and in the meantime They left the car at Asbury and street car d to Allenhurst where they investigated the crowded pavilions for beauty At four there were refreshments in a lunch room and this time they paid an even smaller per cent on the total cost something about the appearance and savoir faire of the crowd made the thing go and they were not pursued You see Amory we re Marxian Socialists explained Kerry We don t believe in property and we re putting it to the great test Night will descend Amory suggested Watch and put your trust in Holiday They became jovial about five thirty and linking arms strolled up and down the boardwalk in a row chanting a monotonous ditty about the sad sea waves Then Kerry saw a face in the crowd that attracted him and rushing off reappeared in a moment with one of the homeliest girls Amory had ever set eyes on Her pale mouth extended from ear to ear her teeth projected in a solid wedge and she had little squinty eyes that peeped ingratiatingly over the side sweep of her nose Kerry presented them formally Name of Kaluka Hawaiian queen Let me present Messrs Connage Sloane Humbird Ferrenby and Blaine The girl bobbed courtesies all around Poor creature Amory supposed she had never before been noticed in her life possibly she was half witted While she accompanied them Kerry had invited her to supper she said nothing which could discountenance such a belief She prefers her native dishes said Alec gravely to the waiter but any coarse food will do All through supper he addressed her in the most respectful language while Kerry made idiotic love to her on the other side and she giggled and grinned Amory was content to sit and watch the by play thinking what a light touch Kerry had and how he could transform the barest incident into a thing of curve and contour They all seemed to have the spirit of it more or less and it was a relaxation to be with them Amory usually liked men individually yet feared them in crowds unless the crowd was around him He wondered how much each one contributed to the party for there was somewhat of a spiritual tax levied Alec and Kerry were the life of it but not quite the centre Somehow the quiet Humbird and Sloane with his impatient superciliousness were the centre Dick Humbird had ever since freshman year seemed to Amory a perfect type of aristocrat He was slender but well built black curly hair straight features and rather a dark skin Everything he said sounded intangibly appropriate He possessed infinite courage an averagely good mind and a sense of honor with a clear charm and noblesse oblige that varied it from righteousness He could dissipate without going to pieces and even his most bohemian adventures never seemed running it out People dressed like him tried to talk as he did Amory decided that he probably held the world back but he wouldn t have changed him He differed from the healthy type that was essentially middle class he never seemed to perspire Some people couldn t be familiar with a chauffeur without having it returned Humbird could have lunched at Sherry s with a colored man yet people would have somehow known that it was all right He was not a snob though he knew only half his class His friends ranged from the highest to the lowest but it was impossible to cultivate him Servants worshipped him and treated him like a god He seemed the eternal example of what the upper class tries to be He s like those pictures in the Illustrated London News of the English officers who have been killed Amory had said to Alec Well Alec had answered if you want to know the shocking truth his father was a grocery clerk who made a fortune in Tacoma real estate and came to New York ten years ago Amory had felt a curious sinking sensation This present type of party was made possible by the surging together of the class after club elections as if to make a last desperate attempt to know itself to keep together to fight off the tightening spirit of the clubs It was a let down from the conventional heights they had all walked so rigidly After supper they saw Kaluka to the boardwalk and then strolled back along the beach to Asbury The evening sea was a new sensation for all its color and mellow age was gone and it seemed the bleak waste that made the Norse sagas sad Amory thought of Kipling s Beaches of Lukanon before the sealers came It was still a music though infinitely sorrowful Ten o clock found them penniless They had suppered greatly on their last eleven cents and singing strolled up through the casinos and lighted arches on the boardwalk stopping to listen approvingly to all band concerts In one place Kerry took up a collection for the French War Orphans which netted a dollar and twenty cents and with this they bought some brandy in case they caught cold in the night They finished the day in a moving picture show and went into solemn systematic roars of laughter at an ancient comedy to the startled annoyance of the rest of the audience Their entrance was distinctly strategic for each man as he entered pointed reproachfully at the one just behind him Sloane bringing up the rear disclaimed all knowledge and responsibility as soon as the others were scattered inside then as the irate ticket taker rushed in he followed nonchalantly They reassembled later by the Casino and made arrangements for the night Kerry wormed permission from the watchman to sleep on the platform and having collected a huge pile of rugs from the booths to serve as mattresses and blankets they talked until midnight and then fell into a dreamless sleep though Amory tried hard to stay awake and watch that marvellous moon settle on the sea So they progressed for two happy days up and down the shore by street car or machine or by shoe leather on the crowded boardwalk sometimes eating with the wealthy more frequently dining frugally at the expense of an unsuspecting restaurateur They had their photos taken eight poses in a quick development store Kerry insisted on grouping them as a varsity football team and then as a tough gang from the East Side with their coats inside out and himself sitting in the middle on a cardboard moon The photographer probably has them yet at least they never called for them The weather was perfect 
125_121342_000060_000001	train-clean-100	and again 
none	none	they slept outside and again Amory fell unwillingly asleep Sunday broke stolid and respectable and even the sea seemed to mumble and complain so they returned to Princeton via the Fords of transient farmers and broke up with colds in their heads but otherwise none the worse for wandering Even more than in the year before Amory neglected his work not deliberately but lazily and through a multitude of other interests company ordinate geometry and the melancholy hexameters of Corneille and Racine held forth small allurements and even psychology which he had eagerly awaited proved to be a dull subject full of muscular reactions and biological phrases rather than the study of personality and influence That was a noon class and it always sent him dozing Having found that subjective and objective sir answered most of the questions he used the phrase on all occasions and it became the class joke when on a query being levelled at him he was nudged awake by Ferrenby or Sloane to gasp it out Mostly there were parties to Orange or the Shore more rarely to New York and Philadelphia though one night they marshalled fourteen waitresses out of Childs and took them to ride down Fifth Avenue on top of an auto bus They all cut more classes than were allowed which meant an additional course the following year but spring was too rare to let anything interfere with their colorful ramblings In May Amory was elected to the Sophomore Prom Committee and when after a long evening s discussion with Alec they made out a tentative list of class probabilities for the senior council they placed themselves among the surest The senior council was composed presumably of the eighteen most representative seniors and in view of Alec s football managership and Amory s chance of nosing out Burne Holiday as Princetonian chairman they seemed fairly justified in this presumption Oddly enough they both placed D Invilliers as among the possibilities a guess that a year before the class would have gaped at All through the spring Amory had kept up an intermittent correspondence with Isabelle Borge punctuated by violent squabbles and chiefly enlivened by his attempts to find new words for love He discovered Isabelle to be discreetly and aggravatingly unsentimental in letters but he hoped against hope that she would prove not too exotic a bloom to fit the large spaces of spring as she had fitted the den in the Minnehaha Club During May he wrote thirty page documents almost nightly and sent them to her in bulky envelopes exteriorly labelled Part I and Part II Oh Alec I believe I m tired of college he said sadly as they walked the dusk together I think I am too in a way All I d like would be a little home in the country some warm country and a wife and just enough to do to keep from rotting Me too I d like to quit What does your girl say Oh Amory gasped in horror She wouldn t think of marrying that is not now I mean the future you know My girl would I m engaged Are you really Yes Don t say a word to anybody please but I am I may not come back next year But you re only twenty Give up college Why Amory you were saying a minute ago Yes Amory interrupted but I was just wishing I wouldn t think of leaving college It s just that I feel so sad these wonderful nights I sort of feel they re never coming again and I m not really getting all I could out of them I wish my girl lived here But marry not a chance Especially as father says the money isn t forthcoming as it used to be What a waste these nights are agreed Alec But Amory sighed and made use of the nights He had a snap shot of Isabelle enshrined in an old watch and at eight almost every night he would turn off all the lights except the desk lamp and sitting by the open windows with the picture before him write her rapturous letters Oh it s so hard to write you what I really feel when I think about you so much you ve gotten to mean to me a dream that I can t put on paper any more Your last letter came and it was wonderful I read it over about six times especially the last part but I do wish sometimes you d be more frank and tell me what you really do think of me yet your last letter was too good to be true and I can hardly wait until June Be sure and be able to come to the prom It ll be fine I think and I want to bring you just at the end of a wonderful year I often think over what you said on that night and wonder how much you meant If it were anyone but you but you see I thought you were fickle the first time I saw you and you are so popular and everthing that I can t imagine you really liking me best Oh Isabelle dear it s a wonderful night Somebody is playing Love Moon on a mandolin far across the campus and the music seems to bring you into the window Now he s playing Good by Boys I m Through and how well it suits me For I am through with everything I have decided never to take a cocktail again and I know I ll never again fall in love I couldn t you ve been too much a part of my days and nights to ever let me think of another girl I meet them all the time and 
125_121342_000040_000003	train-clean-100	they don t 
none	none	interest me I m not pretending to be blase because it s not that It s just that I m in love Oh dearest Isabelle somehow I can t call you just Isabelle and I m afraid I ll come out with the dearest before your family this June you ve got to come to the prom and then I ll come up to your house for a day and everything ll be perfect And so on in an eternal monotone that seemed to both of them infinitely charming infinitely new June came and the days grew so hot and lazy that they could not worry even about exams but spent dreamy evenings on the court of Cottage talking of long subjects until the sweep of country toward Stony Brook became a blue haze and the lilacs were white around tennis courts and words gave way to silent cigarettes Then down deserted Prospect and along McCosh with song everywhere around them up to the hot joviality of Nassau Street Tom D Invilliers and Amory walked late in those days A gambling fever swept through the sophomore class and they bent over the bones till three o clock many a sultry night After one session they came out of Sloane s room to find the dew fallen and the stars old in the sky Let s borrow bicycles and take a ride Amory suggested All right I m not a bit tired and this is almost the last night of the year really because the prom stuff starts Monday They found two unlocked bicycles in Holder Court and rode out about half past three along the Lawrenceville Road What are you going to do this summer Amory Don t ask me same old things I suppose A month or two in Lake Geneva I m counting on you to be there in July you know then there ll be Minneapolis and that means hundreds of summer hops parlor snaking getting bored But oh Tom he added suddenly hasn t this year been slick No declared Tom emphatically a new Tom clothed by Brooks shod by Franks I ve won this game but I feel as if I never want to play another You re all right you re a rubber ball and somehow it suits you but I m sick of adapting myself to the local snobbishness of this corner of the world I want to go where people aren t barred because of the color of their neckties and the roll of their coats You can t Tom argued Amory as they rolled along through the scattering night wherever you go now you ll always unconsciously apply these standards of having it or lacking it For better or worse we ve stamped you you re a Princeton type Well then complained Tom his cracked voice rising plaintively why do I have to come back at all I ve learned all that Princeton has to offer Two years more of mere pedantry and lying around a club aren t going to help They re just going to disorganize me conventionalize me completely Even now I m so spineless that I wonder how I get away with it Oh but you re missing the real point Tom Amory interrupted You ve just had your eyes opened to the snobbishness of the world in a rather abrupt manner Princeton invariably gives the thoughtful man a social sense You consider you taught me that don t you he asked quizzically eying Amory in the half dark Amory laughed quietly Didn t I Sometimes he said slowly I think you re my bad angel I might have been a pretty fair poet Come on that s rather hard You chose to come to an Eastern college Either your eyes were opened to the mean scrambling quality of people or you d have gone through blind and you d hate to have done that been like Marty Kaye Yes he agreed you re right I wouldn t have liked it Still it s hard to be made a cynic at twenty I was born one Amory murmured I m a cynical idealist He paused and wondered if that meant anything They reached the sleeping school of Lawrenceville and turned to ride back It s good this ride isn t it Tom said presently Yes it s a good finish it s knock out everything s good to night Oh for a hot languorous summer and Isabelle Oh you and your Isabelle I ll bet she s a simple one let s say some poetry So Amory declaimed The Ode to a Nightingale to the bushes they passed I ll never be a poet said Amory as he finished I m not enough of a sensualist really there are only a few obvious things that I notice as primarily beautiful women spring evenings music at night the sea I don t catch the subtle things like silver snarling trumpets I may turn out an intellectual but I ll never write anything but mediocre poetry They rode into Princeton as the sun was making colored maps of the sky behind the graduate school and hurried to the refreshment of a shower that would have to serve in place of sleep By noon the bright costumed alumni crowded the streets with their bands and choruses and in the tents there was great reunion under the orange and black banners that curled and strained in the wind Amory looked long at one house which bore the legend Sixty nine There a few gray haired men sat and talked quietly while the classes swept by in panorama of life UNDER THE ARC LIGHT Then tragedy s emerald eyes glared suddenly at Amory over the edge of June On the night after his ride to Lawrenceville a crowd sallied to New York in quest of adventure and started back to Princeton about twelve o clock in two machines It had been a gay party and different stages of sobriety were represented Amory was in the car behind they had taken the wrong road and lost the way and so were hurrying to catch up It was a clear night and the exhilaration of the road went to Amory s head He had the ghost of two stanzas of a poem forming in his mind So the gray car crept nightward in the dark and there was no life stirred as it went by As the still ocean paths before the shark in starred and glittering waterways beauty high the moon swathed trees divided pair on pair while flapping nightbirds cried across the air A moment by an inn of lamps and shades a yellow inn under a yellow moon then silence where crescendo laughter fades the car swung out again to the winds of June mellowed the shadows where the distance grew then crushed the yellow shadows into blue They jolted to a stop and Amory peered up startled A woman was standing beside the road talking to Alec at the wheel Afterward he remembered the harpy effect that her old kimono gave her and the cracked hollowness of her voice as she spoke You Princeton boys Yes Well there s one of you killed here and two others about dead My God Look She pointed and they gazed in horror Under the full light of a roadside arc light lay a form face downward in a widening circle of blood They sprang from the car Amory thought of the back of that head that hair that hair and then they turned the form over It s Dick Dick Humbird Oh Christ Feel his heart Then the insistent voice of the old crone in a sort of croaking triumph He s quite dead all right The car turned over Two of the men that weren t hurt just carried the others in but this one s no use Amory rushed into the house and the rest followed with a limp mass that they laid on the sofa in the shoddy little front parlor Sloane with his shoulder punctured was on another lounge He was half delirious and kept calling something about a chemistry lecture at eight ten I don t know what happened said Ferrenby in a strained voice Dick was driving and he wouldn t give up the wheel we told him he d been drinking too much then there was this damn curve oh my God He threw himself face downward on the floor and broke into dry sobs The doctor had arrived and Amory went over to the couch where some one handed him a sheet to put over the body With a sudden hardness he raised one of the hands and let it fall back inertly The brow was cold but the face not expressionless He looked at the shoe laces Dick had tied them that morning He had tied them and now he was this heavy white mass All that remained of the charm and personality of the Dick Humbird he had known oh it was all so horrible and unaristocratic and close to the earth All tragedy has that strain of the grotesque and squalid so useless futile the way animals die Amory was reminded of a cat that had lain horribly mangled in some alley of his childhood Some one go to Princeton with Ferrenby Amory stepped outside the door and shivered slightly at the late night wind a wind that stirred a broken fender on the mass of bent metal to a plaintive tinny sound CRESCENDO Next day by a merciful chance passed in a whirl When Amory was by himself his thoughts zigzagged inevitably to the picture of that red mouth yawning incongruously in the white face but with a determined effort he piled present excitement upon the memory of it and shut it coldly away from his mind Isabelle and her mother drove into town at four and they rode up smiling Prospect Avenue through the gay crowd to have tea at Cottage The clubs had their annual dinners that night so at seven he loaned her to a freshman and arranged to meet her in the gymnasium at eleven when the upper classmen were admitted to the freshman dance She was all he had expected and he was happy and eager to make that night the centre of every dream At nine the upper classes stood in front of the clubs as the freshman torchlight parade rioted past and Amory wondered if the dress suited groups against the dark stately backgrounds and under the flare of the torches made the night as brilliant to the staring cheering freshmen as it had been to him the year before The next day was another whirl They lunched in a gay party of six in a private dining room at the club while Isabelle and Amory looked at each other tenderly over the fried chicken and knew that their love was to be eternal They danced away the prom until five and the stags cut in on Isabelle with joyous abandon which grew more and more enthusiastic as the hour grew late and their wines stored in overcoat pockets in the coat room made old weariness wait until another day The stag line is a most homogeneous mass of men It fairly sways with a single soul A dark haired beauty dances by and there is a half gasping sound as the ripple surges forward and some one sleeker than the rest darts out and cuts in Then when the six foot girl brought by Kaye in your class and to whom he has been trying to introduce you all evening gallops by the line surges back and the groups face about and become intent on far corners of the hall for Kaye anxious and perspiring appears elbowing through the crowd in search of familiar faces I say old man I ve got an awfully nice Sorry Kaye but I m set for this one I ve got to cut in on a fella Well the next one What ah er I swear I ve got to go cut in look me up when she s got a dance free It delighted Amory when Isabelle suggested that they leave for a while and drive around in her car For a delicious hour that passed too soon they glided the silent roads about Princeton and talked from the surface of their hearts in shy excitement Amory felt strangely ingenuous and made no attempt to kiss her Next day they rode up through the Jersey country had luncheon in New York and in the afternoon went to see a problem play at which Isabelle wept all through the second act rather to Amory s embarrassment though it filled him with tenderness to watch her He was tempted to lean over and kiss away her tears and she slipped her hand into his under cover of darkness to be pressed softly Then at six they arrived at the Borges summer place on Long Island and Amory rushed up stairs to change into a dinner coat As he put in his studs he realized that he was enjoying life as he would probably never enjoy it again Everything was hallowed by the haze of his own youth He had arrived abreast of the best in his generation at Princeton He was in love and his love was returned Turning on all the lights he looked at himself in the mirror trying to find in his own face the qualities that made him see clearer than the great crowd of people that made him decide firmly and able to influence and follow his own will There was little in his life now that he would have changed Oxford might have been a bigger field Silently he admired himself How conveniently well he looked and how well a dinner coat became him He stepped into the hall and then waited at the top of the stairs for he heard footsteps coming It was Isabelle and from the top of her shining hair to her little golden slippers she had never seemed so beautiful Isabelle he cried half involuntarily and held out his arms As in the story books she ran into them and on that half minute as their lips first touched rested the high point of vanity the crest of his young egotism CHAPTER three The Egotist Considers Ouch Let me go He dropped his arms to his sides What s the matter Your shirt stud it hurt me look She was looking down at her neck where a little blue spot about the size of a pea marred its pallor Oh Isabelle he reproached himself I m a goopher Really I m sorry I shouldn t have held you so close She looked up impatiently Oh Amory of course you couldn t help it and it didn t hurt much but what are we going to do about it Do about it he asked Oh that spot it ll disappear in a second It isn t she said after a moment of concentrated gazing it s still there and it looks like Old Nick oh Amory what ll we do It s just the height of your shoulder Massage it he suggested repressing the faintest inclination to laugh She rubbed it delicately with the tips of her fingers and then a tear gathered in the corner of her eye and slid down her cheek Oh Amory she said despairingly lifting up a most pathetic face I ll just make my whole neck flame if I rub it What ll I do A quotation sailed into his head and he couldn t resist repeating it aloud All the perfumes of Arabia will not whiten this little hand She looked up and the sparkle of the tear in her eye was like ice You re not very sympathetic Amory mistook her meaning Isabelle darling I think it ll Don t touch me she cried Haven t I enough on my mind and you stand there and laugh Then he slipped again Well it is funny Isabelle and we were talking the other day about a sense of humor being She was looking at him with something that was not a smile rather the faint mirthless echo of a smile in the corners of her mouth Oh shut up she cried suddenly and fled down the hallway toward her room Amory stood there covered with remorseful confusion Damn When Isabelle reappeared she had thrown a light wrap about her shoulders and they descended the stairs in a silence that endured through dinner Isabelle he began rather testily as they arranged themselves in the car bound for a dance at the Greenwich Country Club you re angry and I ll be too in a minute Let s kiss and make up Isabelle considered glumly I hate to be laughed at she said finally I won t laugh any more I m not laughing now am I You did Oh don t be so darned feminine Her lips curled slightly I ll be anything I want Amory kept his temper with difficulty He became aware that he had not an ounce of real affection for Isabelle but her coldness piqued him He wanted to kiss her kiss her a lot because then he knew he could leave in the morning and not care On the contrary if he didn t kiss her it would worry him It would interfere vaguely with his idea of himself as a conqueror It wasn t dignified to come off second best pleading with a doughty warrior like Isabelle Perhaps she suspected this At any rate Amory watched the night that should have been the consummation of romance glide by with great moths overhead and the heavy fragrance of roadside gardens but without those broken words those little sighs Afterward they suppered on ginger ale and devil s food in the pantry and Amory announced a decision I m leaving early in the morning Why Why not he countered There s no need However I m going Well if you insist on being ridiculous Oh don t put it that way he objected just because I won t let you kiss me Do you think Now Isabelle he interrupted you know it s not that even suppose it is We ve reached the stage where we either ought to kiss or or nothing It isn t as if you were refusing on moral grounds She hesitated I really don t know what to think about you she began in a feeble perverse attempt at conciliation You re so funny How Well I thought you had a lot of self confidence and all that remember you told me the other day that you could do anything you wanted or get anything you wanted Amory flushed He had told her a lot of things Yes Well you didn t seem to feel so self confident to night Maybe you re just plain conceited No I m not he hesitated At Princeton Oh you and Princeton You d think that was the world the way you talk Perhaps you can write better than anybody else on your old Princetonian maybe the freshmen do think you re important You don t understand Yes I do she interrupted I do because you re always talking about yourself and I used to like it now I don t Have I to night That s just the point insisted Isabelle You got all upset to night You just sat and watched my eyes Besides I have to think all the time I m talking to you you re so critical I make you think do I Amory repeated with a touch of vanity You re a nervous strain this emphatically and when you analyze every little emotion and instinct I just don t have em I know Amory admitted her point and shook his head helplessly Let s go She stood up He rose abstractedly and they walked to the foot of the stairs What train can I get There s one about nine eleven if you really must go Yes I ve got to go really Good night Good night They were at the head of the stairs and as Amory turned into his room he thought he caught just the faintest cloud of discontent in her face He lay awake in the darkness and wondered how much he cared how much of his sudden unhappiness was hurt vanity whether he was after all temperamentally unfitted for romance When he awoke it was with a glad flood of consciousness The early wind stirred the chintz curtains at the windows and he was idly puzzled not to be in his room at Princeton with his school football picture over the bureau and the Triangle Club on the wall opposite Then the grandfather s clock in the hall outside struck eight and the memory of the night before came to him He was out of bed dressing like the wind he must get out of the house before he saw Isabelle What had seemed a melancholy happening now seemed a tiresome anticlimax He was dressed at half past so he sat down by the window felt that the sinews of his heart were twisted somewhat more than he had thought What an ironic mockery the morning seemed bright and sunny and full of the smell of the garden hearing missus Borge s voice in the sun parlor below he wondered where was Isabelle There was a knock at the door The car will be around at ten minutes of nine sir He returned to his contemplation of the outdoors and began repeating over and over mechanically a verse from Browning which he had once quoted to Isabelle in a letter Each life unfulfilled you see It hangs still patchy and scrappy We have not sighed deep laughed free Starved feasted despaired been happy But his life would not be unfulfilled He took a sombre satisfaction in thinking that perhaps all along she had been nothing except what he had read into her that this was her high point that no one else would ever make her think Yet that was what she had objected to in him and Amory was suddenly tired of thinking thinking Damn her he said bitterly she s spoiled my year THE SUPERMAN GROWS CARELESS On a dusty day in September Amory arrived in Princeton and joined the sweltering crowd of conditioned men who thronged the streets It seemed a stupid way to commence his upper class years to spend four hours a morning in the stuffy room of a tutoring school imbibing the infinite boredom of conic sections mister Rooney pander to the dull conducted the class and smoked innumerable Pall Malls as he drew diagrams and worked equations from six in the morning until midnight Now Langueduc if I used that formula where would my A point be Langueduc lazily shifts his six foot three of football material and tries to concentrate Oh ah I m damned if I know mister Rooney Oh why of course of course you can t use that formula That s what I wanted you to say Why sure of course Do you see why You bet I suppose so If you don t see tell me I m here to show you Well mister Rooney if you don t mind I wish you d go over that again Gladly Now here s A The room was a study in stupidity two huge stands for paper mister Rooney in his shirt sleeves in front of them and slouched around on chairs a dozen men Fred Sloane the pitcher who absolutely had to get eligible Slim Langueduc who would beat Yale this fall if only he could master a poor fifty per cent McDowell gay young sophomore who thought it was quite a sporting thing to be tutoring here with all these prominent athletes Those poor birds who haven t a cent to tutor and have to study during the term are the ones I pity he announced to Amory one day with a flaccid camaraderie in the droop of the cigarette from his pale lips I should think it would be such a bore there s so much else to do in New York during the term I suppose they don t know what they miss anyhow There was such an air of you and I about mister McDowell that Amory very nearly pushed him out of the open window when he said this Next February his mother would wonder why he didn t make a club and increase his allowance simple little nut Through the smoke and the air of solemn dense earnestness that filled the room would come the inevitable helpless cry I don t get it Repeat that mister Rooney Most of them were so stupid or careless that they wouldn t admit when they didn t understand and Amory was of the latter He found it impossible to study conic sections something in their calm and tantalizing respectability breathing defiantly through mister Rooney s fetid parlors distorted their equations into insoluble anagrams He made a last night s effort with the proverbial wet towel and then blissfully took the exam wondering unhappily why all the color and ambition of the spring before had faded out Somehow with the defection of Isabelle the idea of undergraduate success had loosed its grasp on his imagination and he contemplated a possible failure to pass off his condition with equanimity even though it would arbitrarily mean his removal from the Princetonian board and the slaughter of his chances for the Senior Council There was always his luck He yawned scribbled his honor pledge on the cover and sauntered from the room If you don t pass it said the newly arrived Alec as they sat on the window seat of Amory s room and mused upon a scheme of wall decoration you re the world s worst goopher Your stock will go down like an elevator at the club and on the campus Oh hell I know it Why rub it in Cause you deserve it Anybody that d risk what you were in line for ought to be ineligible for Princetonian chairman Oh drop the subject Amory protested Watch and wait and shut up I don t want every one at the club asking me about it as if I were a prize potato being fattened for a vegetable show One evening a week later Amory stopped below his own window on the way to Renwick s and seeing a light called up Oh Tom any mail Alec s head appeared against the yellow square of light Yes your result s here His heart clamored violently What is it blue or pink Don t know Better come up He walked into the room and straight over to the table and then suddenly noticed that there were other people in the room Lo Kerry He was most polite Ah men of Princeton They seemed to be mostly friends so he picked up the envelope marked Registrar s Office and weighed it nervously We have here quite a slip of paper Open it Amory Just to be dramatic I ll let you know that if it s blue my name is withdrawn from the editorial board of the Prince and my short career is over He paused and then saw for the first time Ferrenby s eyes wearing a hungry look and watching him eagerly Amory returned the gaze pointedly Watch my face gentlemen for the primitive emotions He tore it open and held the slip up to the light Well Pink or blue Say what it is We re all ears Amory Smile or swear or something There was a pause a small crowd of seconds swept by then he looked again and another crowd went on into time Blue as the sky gentlemen AFTERMATH What Amory did that year from early September to late in the spring was so purposeless and inconsecutive that it seems scarcely worth recording He was of course immediately sorry for what he had lost His philosophy of success had tumbled down upon him and he looked for the reasons Your own laziness said Alec later No something deeper than that I ve begun to feel that I was meant to lose this chance They re rather off you at the club you know every man that doesn t come through makes our crowd just so much weaker I hate that point of view Of course with a little effort you could still stage a comeback No I m through as far as ever being a power in college is concerned But Amory honestly what makes me the angriest isn t the fact that you won t be chairman of the Prince and on the Senior Council but just that you didn t get down and pass that exam Not me said Amory slowly I m mad at the concrete thing My own idleness was quite in accord with my system but the luck broke Your system broke you mean Maybe Well what are you going to do Get a better one quick or just bum around for two more years as a has been I don t know yet Oh Amory buck up Maybe Amory s point of view though dangerous was not far from the true one If his reactions to his environment could be tabulated the chart would have appeared like this beginning with his earliest years one The fundamental Amory two Amory plus Beatrice three Amory plus Beatrice plus Minneapolis Then saint Regis had pulled him to pieces and started him over again four Amory plus saint Regis five Amory plus saint Regis plus Princeton That had been his nearest approach to success through conformity The fundamental Amory idle imaginative rebellious had been nearly snowed under He had conformed he had succeeded but as his imagination was neither satisfied nor grasped by his own success he had listlessly half accidentally chucked the whole thing and become again six The fundamental Amory FINANCIAL His father died quietly and inconspicuously at Thanksgiving The incongruity of death with either the beauties of Lake Geneva or with his mother s dignified reticent attitude diverted him and he looked at the funeral with an amused tolerance He decided that burial was after all preferable to cremation and he smiled at his old boyhood choice slow oxidation in the top of a tree The day after the ceremony he was amusing himself in the great library by sinking back on a couch in graceful mortuary attitudes trying to determine whether he would when his day came be found with his arms crossed piously over his chest Monsignor Darcy had once advocated this posture as being the most distinguished or with his hands clasped behind his head a more pagan and Byronic attitude What interested him much more than the final departure of his father from things mundane was a tri cornered conversation between Beatrice mister Barton of Barton and Krogman their lawyers and himself that took place several days after the funeral For the first time he came into actual cognizance of the family finances and realized what a tidy fortune had once been under his father s management He took a ledger labelled nineteen oh six and ran through it rather carefully The total expenditure that year had come to something over one hundred and ten thousand dollars Forty thousand of this had been Beatrice s own income and there had been no attempt to account for it it was all under the heading Drafts checks and letters of credit forwarded to Beatrice Blaine The dispersal of the rest was rather minutely itemized the taxes and improvements on the Lake Geneva estate had come to almost nine thousand dollars the general up keep including Beatrice s electric and a French car bought that year was over thirty five thousand dollars The rest was fully taken care of and there were invariably items which failed to balance on the right side of the ledger In the volume for nineteen twelve Amory was shocked to discover the decrease in the number of bond holdings and the great drop in the income In the case of Beatrice s money this was not so pronounced but it was obvious that his father had devoted the previous year to several unfortunate gambles in oil Very little of the oil had been burned but Stephen Blaine had been rather badly singed The next year and the next and the next showed similar decreases and Beatrice had for the first time begun using her own money for keeping up the house Yet her doctor s bill for nineteen thirteen had been over nine thousand dollars About the exact state of things mister Barton was quite vague and confused There had been recent investments the outcome of which was for the present problematical and he had an idea there were further speculations and exchanges concerning which he had not been consulted It was not for several months that Beatrice wrote Amory the full situation The entire residue of the Blaine and O Hara fortunes consisted of the place at Lake Geneva and approximately a half million dollars invested now in fairly conservative six per cent holdings In fact Beatrice wrote that she was putting the money into railroad and street car bonds as fast as she could conveniently transfer it I am quite sure she wrote to Amory that if there is one thing we can be positive of it is that people will not stay in one place This Ford person has certainly made the most of that idea So I am instructing mister Barton to specialize on such things as Northern Pacific and these Rapid Transit Companies as they call the street cars I shall never forgive myself for not buying Bethlehem Steel I ve heard the most fascinating stories You must go into finance Amory I m sure you would revel in it You start as a messenger or a teller I believe and from that you go up almost indefinitely I m sure if I were a man I d love the handling of money it has become quite a senile passion with me Before I get any farther I want to discuss something A missus Bispam an overcordial little lady whom I met at a tea the other day told me that her son he is at Yale wrote her that all the boys there wore their summer underwear all during the winter and also went about with their heads wet and in low shoes on the coldest days Now Amory I don t know whether that is a fad at Princeton too but I don t want you to be so foolish It not only inclines a young man to pneumonia and infantile paralysis but to all forms of lung trouble to which you are particularly inclined You cannot experiment with your health I have found that out I will not make myself ridiculous as some mothers no doubt do by insisting that you wear overshoes though I remember one Christmas you wore them around constantly without a single buckle latched making such a curious swishing sound and you refused to buckle them because it was not the thing to do The very next Christmas you would not wear even rubbers though I begged you You are nearly twenty years old now dear and I can t be with you constantly to find whether you are doing the sensible thing This has been a very practical letter I warned you in my last that the lack of money to do the things one wants to makes one quite prosy and domestic but there is still plenty for everything if we are not too extravagant Take care of yourself my dear boy and do try to write at least once a week because I imagine all sorts of horrible things if I don t hear from you Affectionately MOTHER FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE TERM PERSONAGE Monsignor Darcy invited Amory up to the Stuart palace on the Hudson for a week at Christmas and they had enormous conversations around the open fire Monsignor was growing a trifle stouter and his personality had expanded even with that and Amory felt both rest and security in sinking into a squat cushioned chair and joining him in the middle aged sanity of a cigar I ve felt like leaving college Monsignor Why All my career s gone up in smoke you think it s petty and all that but Not at all petty I think it s most important I want to hear the whole thing Everything you ve been doing since I saw you last Amory talked he went thoroughly into the destruction of his egotistic highways and in a half hour the listless quality had left his voice What would you do if you left college asked Monsignor Don t know I d like to travel but of course this tiresome war prevents that Anyways mother would hate not having me graduate I m just at sea Kerry Holiday wants me to go over with him and join the Lafayette Esquadrille You know you wouldn t like to go Sometimes I would to night I d go in a second Well you d have to be very much more tired of life than I think you are I know you I m afraid you do agreed Amory reluctantly It just seemed an easy way out of everything when I think of another useless draggy year Yes I know but to tell you the truth I m not worried about you you seem to me to be progressing perfectly naturally No Amory objected I ve lost half my personality in a year Not a bit of it scoffed Monsignor You ve lost a great amount of vanity and that s all Lordy I feel anyway as if I d gone through another fifth form at saint Regis s No Monsignor shook his head That was a misfortune this has been a good thing Whatever worth while comes to you won t be through the channels you were searching last year What could be more unprofitable than my present lack of pep Perhaps in itself but you re developing This has given you time to think and you re casting off a lot of your old luggage about success and the superman and all People like us can t adopt whole theories as you did If we can do the next thing and have an hour a day to think in we can accomplish marvels but as far as any high handed scheme of blind dominance is concerned we d just make asses of ourselves But Monsignor I can t do the next thing Amory between you and me I have only just learned to do it myself I can do the one hundred things beyond the next thing but I stub my toe on that just as you stubbed your toe on mathematics this fall Why do we have to do the next thing It never seems the sort of thing I should do We have to do it because we re not personalities but personages That s a good line what do you mean A personality is what you thought you were what this Kerry and Sloane you tell me of evidently are Personality is a physical matter almost entirely it lowers the people it acts on I ve seen it vanish in a long sickness But while a personality is active it overrides the next thing Now a personage on the other hand gathers He is never thought of apart from what he s done He s a bar on which a thousand things have been hung glittering things sometimes as ours are but he uses those things with a cold mentality back of them And several of my most glittering possessions had fallen off when I needed them Amory continued the simile eagerly Yes that s it when you feel that your garnered prestige and talents and all that are hung out you need never bother about anybody you can cope with them without difficulty But on the other hand if I haven t my possessions I m helpless Absolutely That s certainly an idea Now you ve a clean start a start Kerry or Sloane can constitutionally never have You brushed three or four ornaments down and in a fit of pique knocked off the rest of them The thing now is to collect some new ones and the farther you look ahead in the collecting the better But remember do the next thing How clear you can make things So they talked often about themselves sometimes of philosophy and religion and life as respectively a game or a mystery The priest seemed to guess Amory s thoughts before they were clear in his own head so closely related were their minds in form and groove Why do I make lists Amory asked him one night Lists of all sorts of things Because you re a mediaevalist Monsignor answered We both are It s the passion for classifying and finding a type It s a desire to get something definite It s the nucleus of scholastic philosophy I was beginning to think I was growing eccentric till I came up here It was a pose I guess Don t worry about that for you not posing may be the biggest pose of all Pose Yes But do the next thing After Amory returned to college he received several letters from Monsignor which gave him more egotistic food for consumption I am afraid that I gave you too much assurance of your inevitable safety and you must remember that I did that through faith in your springs of effort not in the silly conviction that you will arrive without struggle Some nuances of character you will have to take for granted in yourself though you must be careful in confessing them to others You are unsentimental almost incapable of affection astute without being cunning and vain without being proud Don t let yourself feel worthless often through life you will really be at your worst when you seem to think best of yourself and don t worry about losing your personality as you persist in calling it at fifteen you had the radiance of early morning at twenty you will begin to have the melancholy brilliance of the moon and when you are my age you will give out as I do the genial golden warmth of four P M If you write me letters please let them be natural ones Your last that dissertation on architecture was perfectly awful so highbrow that I picture you living in an intellectual and emotional vacuum and beware of trying to classify people too definitely into types you will find that all through their youth they will persist annoyingly in jumping from class to class and by pasting a supercilious label on every one you meet you are merely packing a Jack in the box that will spring up and leer at you when you begin to come into really antagonistic contact with the world An idealization of some such a man as Leonardo da Vinci would be a more valuable beacon to you at present You are bound to go up and down just as I did in my youth but do keep your clarity of mind and if fools or sages dare to criticise don t blame yourself too much You say that convention is all that really keeps you straight in this woman proposition but it s more than that Amory it s the fear that what you begin you can t stop you would run amuck and I know whereof I speak it s that half miraculous sixth sense by which you detect evil it s the half realized fear of God in your heart Whatever your metier proves to be religion architecture literature I m sure you would be much safer anchored to the Church but I won t risk my influence by arguing with you even though I am secretly sure that the black chasm of Romanism yawns beneath you Do write me soon With affectionate regards THAYER DARCY Even Amory s reading paled during this period he delved further into the misty side streets of literature Huysmans Walter Pater Theophile Gautier and the racier sections of Rabelais Boccaccio Petronius and Suetonius One week through general curiosity he inspected the private libraries of his classmates and found Sloane s as typical as any sets of Kipling O Henry John Fox junior and Richard Harding Davis What Every Middle Aged Woman Ought to Know The Spell of the Yukon a gift copy of James Whitcomb Riley an assortment of battered annotated schoolbooks and finally to his surprise one of his own late discoveries the collected poems of Rupert Brooke Together with Tom D Invilliers he sought among the lights of Princeton for some one who might found the Great American Poetic Tradition The undergraduate body itself was rather more interesting that year than had been the entirely Philistine Princeton of two years before Things had livened surprisingly though at the sacrifice of much of the spontaneous charm of freshman year In the old Princeton they would never have discovered Tanaduke Wylie Tanaduke was a sophomore with tremendous ears and a way of saying The earth swirls down through the ominous moons of preconsidered generations that made them vaguely wonder why it did not sound quite clear but never question that it was the utterance of a supersoul At least so Tom and Amory took him They told him in all earnestness that he had a mind like Shelley s and featured his ultrafree free verse and prose poetry in the Nassau Literary Magazine But Tanaduke s genius absorbed the many colors of the age and he took to the Bohemian life to their great disappointment He talked of Greenwich Village now instead of noon swirled moons and met winter muses unacademic and cloistered by Forty second Street and Broadway instead of the Shelleyan dream children with whom he had regaled their expectant appreciation So they surrendered Tanaduke to the futurists deciding that he and his flaming ties would do better there Tom gave him the final advice that he should stop writing for two years and read the complete works of Alexander Pope four times but on Amory s suggestion that Pope for Tanaduke was like foot ease for stomach trouble they withdrew in laughter and called it a coin s toss whether this genius was too big or too petty for them Amory rather scornfully avoided the popular professors who dispensed easy epigrams and thimblefuls of Chartreuse to groups of admirers every night He was disappointed too at the air of general uncertainty on every subject that seemed linked with the pedantic temperament his opinions took shape in a miniature satire called In a Lecture Room which he persuaded Tom to print in the Nassau Lit Good morning Fool Three times a week You hold us helpless while you speak Teasing our thirsty souls with the Sleek yeas of your philosophy Well here we are your hundred sheep Tune up play on pour forth we sleep You are a student so they say You hammered out the other day A syllabus from what we know Of some forgotten folio You d sniffled through an era s must Filling your nostrils up with dust And then arising from your knees Published in one gigantic sneeze But here s a neighbor on my right An Eager Ass considered bright Asker of questions How he ll stand With earnest air and fidgy hand After this hour telling you He sat all night and burrowed through Your book Oh you ll be coy and he Will simulate precosity And pedants both you ll smile and smirk And leer and hasten back to work Twas this day week sir you returned A theme of mine from which I learned Through various comment on the side Which you had scrawled that I defied The highest rules of criticism For cheap and careless witticism Are you quite sure that this could be And Shaw is no authority But Eager Ass with what he s sent Plays havoc with your best per cent Still still I meet you here and there When Shakespeare s played you hold a chair And some defunct moth eaten star Enchants the mental prig you are A radical comes down and shocks The atheistic orthodox You re representing Common Sense Mouth open in the audience And sometimes even chapel lures That conscious tolerance of yours That broad and beaming view of truth Including Kant and General Booth And so from shock to shock you live A hollow pale affirmative The hour s up and roused from rest One hundred children of the blest Cheat you a word or two with feet That down the noisy aisle ways beat Forget on narrow minded earth The Mighty Yawn that gave you birth In April Kerry Holiday left college and sailed for France to enroll in the Lafayette Esquadrille Amory s envy and admiration of this step was drowned in an experience of his own to which he never succeeded in giving an appropriate value but which nevertheless haunted him for three years afterward THE DEVIL Healy s they left at twelve and taxied to Bistolary s There were Axia Marlowe and Phoebe Column from the Summer Garden show Fred Sloane and Amory The evening was so very young that they felt ridiculous with surplus energy and burst into the cafe like Dionysian revellers Table for four in the middle of the floor yelled Phoebe Hurry old dear tell em we re here Tell em to play Admiration shouted Sloane You two order Phoebe and I are going to shake a wicked calf and they sailed off in the muddled crowd Axia and Amory acquaintances of an hour jostled behind a waiter to a table at a point of vantage there they took seats and watched There s Findle Margotson from New Haven she cried above the uproar Lo Findle Whoo ee Oh Axia he shouted in salutation C mon over to our table No Amory whispered Can t do it Findle I m with somebody else Call me up to morrow about one o clock Findle a nondescript man about Bisty s answered incoherently and turned back to the brilliant blonde whom he was endeavoring to steer around the room There s a natural damn fool commented Amory Oh he s all right Here s the old jitney waiter If you ask me I want a double Daiquiri Make it four The crowd whirled and changed and shifted They were mostly from the colleges with a scattering of the male refuse of Broadway and women of two types the higher of which was the chorus girl On the whole it was a typical crowd and their party as typical as any About three fourths of the whole business was for effect and therefore harmless ended at the door of the cafe soon enough for the five o clock train back to Yale or Princeton about one fourth continued on into the dimmer hours and gathered strange dust from strange places Their party was scheduled to be one of the harmless kind Fred Sloane and Phoebe Column were old friends Axia and Amory new ones But strange things are prepared even in the dead of night and the unusual which lurks least in the cafe home of the prosaic and inevitable was preparing to spoil for him the waning romance of Broadway The way it took was so inexpressibly terrible so unbelievable that afterward he never thought of it as experience but it was a scene from a misty tragedy played far behind the veil and that it meant something definite he knew About one o clock they moved to Maxim s and two found them in Deviniere s Sloane had been drinking consecutively and was in a state of unsteady exhilaration but Amory was quite tiresomely sober they had run across none of those ancient corrupt buyers of champagne who usually assisted their New York parties They were just through dancing and were making their way back to their chairs when Amory became aware that some one at a near by table was looking at him He turned and glanced casually a middle aged man dressed in a brown sack suit it was sitting a little apart at a table by himself and watching their party intently At Amory s glance he smiled faintly Amory turned to Fred who was just sitting down Who s that pale fool watching us he complained indignantly Where cried Sloane We ll have him thrown out He rose to his feet and swayed back and forth clinging to his chair Where is he Axia and Phoebe suddenly leaned and whispered to each other across the table and before Amory realized it they found themselves on their way to the door Where now Up to the flat suggested Phoebe We ve got brandy and fizz and everything s slow down here to night Amory considered quickly He hadn t been drinking and decided that if he took no more it would be reasonably discreet for him to trot along in the party In fact it would be perhaps the thing to do in order to keep an eye on Sloane who was not in a state to do his own thinking So he took Axia s arm and piling intimately into a taxicab they drove out over the hundreds and drew up at a tall white stone apartment house Never would he forget that street It was a broad street lined on both sides with just such tall white stone buildings dotted with dark windows they stretched along as far as the eye could see flooded with a bright moonlight that gave them a calcium pallor He imagined each one to have an elevator and a colored hall boy and a key rack each one to be eight stories high and full of three and four room suites He was rather glad to walk into the cheeriness of Phoebe s living room and sink onto a sofa while the girls went rummaging for food Phoebe s great stuff confided Sloane sotto voce I m only going to stay half an hour Amory said sternly He wondered if it sounded priggish Hell y say protested Sloane We re here now don t le s rush I don t like this place Amory said sulkily and I don t want any food Phoebe reappeared with sandwiches brandy bottle siphon and four glasses Amory pour em out she said and we ll drink to Fred Sloane who has a rare distinguished edge Yes said Axia coming in and Amory I like Amory She sat down beside him and laid her yellow head on his shoulder I ll pour said Sloane you use siphon Phoebe They filled the tray with glasses Ready here she goes Amory hesitated glass in hand There was a minute while temptation crept over him like a warm wind and his imagination turned to fire and he took the glass from Phoebe s hand That was all for at the second that his decision came he looked up and saw ten yards from him the man who had been in the cafe and with his jump of astonishment the glass fell from his uplifted hand There the man half sat half leaned against a pile of pillows on the corner divan His face was cast in the same yellow wax as in the cafe neither the dull pasty color of a dead man rather a sort of virile pallor nor unhealthy you d have called it but like a strong man who d worked in a mine or done night shifts in a damp climate Amory looked him over carefully and later he could have drawn him after a fashion down to the merest details His mouth was the kind that is called frank and he had steady gray eyes that moved slowly from one to the other of their group with just the shade of a questioning expression Amory noticed his hands they weren t fine at all but they had versatility and a tenuous strength they were nervous hands that sat lightly along the cushions and moved constantly with little jerky openings and closings Then suddenly Amory perceived the feet and with a rush of blood to the head he realized he was afraid The feet were all wrong with a sort of wrongness that he felt rather than knew It was like weakness in a good woman or blood on satin one of those terrible incongruities that shake little things in the back of the brain He wore no shoes but instead a sort of half moccasin pointed though like the shoes they wore in the fourteenth century and with the little ends curling up They were a darkish brown and his toes seemed to fill them to the end They were unutterably terrible He must have said something or looked something for Axia s voice came out of the void with a strange goodness Well look at Amory Poor old Amory s sick old head going round Look at that man cried Amory pointing toward the corner divan You mean that purple zebra shrieked Axia facetiously Ooo ee Amory s got a purple zebra watching him Sloane laughed vacantly Ole zebra gotcha Amory There was a silence The man regarded Amory quizzically Then the human voices fell faintly on his ear Thought you weren t drinking remarked Axia sardonically but her voice was good to hear the whole divan that held the man was alive alive like heat waves over asphalt like wriggling worms Come back Come back Axia s arm fell on his Amory dear you aren t going Amory He was half way to the door Come on Amory stick th us Sick are you Sit down a second Take some water Take a little brandy The elevator was close and the colored boy was half asleep paled to a livid bronze Axia s beseeching voice floated down the shaft Those feet those feet As they settled to the lower floor the feet came into view in the sickly electric light of the paved hall IN THE ALLEY Down the long street came the moon and Amory turned his back on it and walked Ten fifteen steps away sounded the footsteps They were like a slow dripping with just the slightest insistence in their fall Amory s shadow lay perhaps ten feet ahead of him and soft shoes was presumably that far behind With the instinct of a child Amory edged in under the blue darkness of the white buildings cleaving the moonlight for haggard seconds once bursting into a slow run with clumsy stumblings After that he stopped suddenly he must keep hold he thought His lips were dry and he licked them If he met any one good were there any good people left in the world or did they all live in white apartment houses now Was every one followed in the moonlight But if he met some one good who d know what he meant and hear this damned scuffle then the scuffling grew suddenly nearer and a black cloud settled over the moon When again the pale sheen skimmed the cornices it was almost beside him and Amory thought he heard a quiet breathing Suddenly he realized that the footsteps were not behind had never been behind they were ahead and he was not eluding but following following He began to run blindly his heart knocking heavily his hands clinched Far ahead a black dot showed itself resolved slowly into a human shape But Amory was beyond that now he turned off the street and darted into an alley narrow and dark and smelling of old rottenness He twisted down a long sinuous blackness where the moonlight was shut away except for tiny glints and patches then suddenly sank panting into a corner by a fence exhausted The steps ahead stopped and he could hear them shift slightly with a continuous motion like waves around a dock He put his face in his hands and covered eyes and ears as well as he could During all this time it never occurred to him that he was delirious or drunk He had a sense of reality such as material things could never give him His intellectual content seemed to submit passively to it and it fitted like a glove everything that had ever preceded it in his life It did not muddle him It was like a problem whose answer he knew on paper yet whose solution he was unable to grasp He was far beyond horror He had sunk through the thin surface of that now moved in a region where the feet and the fear of white walls were real living things things he must accept Only far inside his soul a little fire leaped and cried that something was pulling him down trying to get him inside a door and slam it behind him After that door was slammed there would be only footfalls and white buildings in the moonlight and perhaps he would be one of the footfalls During the five or ten minutes he waited in the shadow of the fence there was somehow this fire that was as near as he could name it afterward He remembered calling aloud I want some one stupid Oh send some one stupid This to the black fence opposite him in whose shadows the footsteps shuffled shuffled He supposed stupid and good had become somehow intermingled through previous association When he called thus it was not an act of will at all will had turned him away from the moving figure in the street it was almost instinct that called just the pile on pile of inherent tradition or some wild prayer from way over the night Then something clanged like a low gong struck at a distance and before his eyes a face flashed over the two feet a face pale and distorted with a sort of infinite evil that twisted it like flame in the wind but he knew for the half instant that the gong tanged and hummed that it was the face of Dick Humbird Minutes later he sprang to his feet realizing dimly that there was no more sound and that he was alone in the graying alley It was cold and he started on a steady run for the light that showed the street at the other end AT THE WINDOW It was late morning when he woke and found the telephone beside his bed in the hotel tolling frantically and remembered that he had left word to be called at eleven Sloane was snoring heavily his clothes in a pile by his bed They dressed and ate breakfast in silence and then sauntered out to get some air Amory s mind was working slowly trying to assimilate what had happened and separate from the chaotic imagery that stacked his memory the bare shreds of truth If the morning had been cold and gray he could have grasped the reins of the past in an instant but it was one of those days that New York gets sometimes in May when the air on Fifth Avenue is a soft light wine How much or how little Sloane remembered Amory did not care to know he apparently had none of the nervous tension that was gripping Amory and forcing his mind back and forth like a shrieking saw Then Broadway broke upon them and with the babel of noise and the painted faces a sudden sickness rushed over Amory For God s sake let s go back Let s get off of this this place Sloane looked at him in amazement What do you mean This street it s ghastly Come on let s get back to the Avenue Do you mean to say said Sloane stolidly that cause you had some sort of indigestion that made you act like a maniac last night you re never coming on Broadway again Simultaneously Amory classed him with the crowd and he seemed no longer Sloane of the debonair humor and the happy personality but only one of the evil faces that whirled along the turbid stream Man he shouted so loud that the people on the corner turned and followed them with their eyes it s filthy and if you can t see it you re filthy too I can t help it said Sloane doggedly What s the matter with you Old remorse getting you You d be in a fine state if you d gone through with our little party I m going Fred said Amory slowly His knees were shaking under him and he knew that if he stayed another minute on this street he would keel over where he stood I ll be at the Vanderbilt for lunch And he strode rapidly off and turned over to Fifth Avenue Back at the hotel he felt better but as he walked into the barber shop intending to get a head massage the smell of the powders and tonics brought back Axia s sidelong suggestive smile and he left hurriedly In the doorway of his room a sudden blackness flowed around him like a divided river When he came to himself he knew that several hours had passed He pitched onto the bed and rolled over on his face with a deadly fear that he was going mad He wanted people people some one sane and stupid and good He lay for he knew not how long without moving He could feel the little hot veins on his forehead standing out and his terror had hardened on him like plaster He felt he was passing up again through the thin crust of horror and now only could he distinguish the shadowy twilight he was leaving He must have fallen asleep again for when he next recollected himself he had paid the hotel bill and was stepping into a taxi at the door It was raining torrents On the train for Princeton he saw no one he knew only a crowd of fagged looking Philadelphians The presence of a painted woman across the aisle filled him with a fresh burst of sickness and he changed to another car tried to concentrate on an article in a popular magazine He found himself reading the same paragraphs over and over so he abandoned this attempt and leaning over wearily pressed his hot forehead against the damp window pane The car a smoker was hot and stuffy with most of the smells of the state s alien population he opened a window and shivered against the cloud of fog that drifted in over him The two hours ride were like days and he nearly cried aloud with joy when the towers of Princeton loomed up beside him and the yellow squares of light filtered through the blue rain Tom was standing in the centre of the room pensively relighting a cigar stub Amory fancied he looked rather relieved on seeing him Had a hell of a dream about you last night came in the cracked voice through the cigar smoke I had an idea you were in some trouble Don t tell me about it Amory almost shrieked Don t say a word I m tired and pepped out Tom looked at him queerly and then sank into a chair and opened his Italian note book Amory threw his coat and hat on the floor loosened his collar and took a Wells novel at random from the shelf Wells is sane he thought and if he won t do I ll read Rupert Brooke Half an hour passed Outside the wind came up and Amory started as the wet branches moved and clawed with their finger nails at the window pane Tom was deep in his work and inside the room only the occasional scratch of a match or the rustle of leather as they shifted in their chairs broke the stillness Then like a zigzag of lightning came the change Amory sat bolt upright frozen cold in his chair Tom was looking at him with his mouth drooping eyes fixed God help us Amory cried Oh my heavens shouted Tom look behind Quick as a flash Amory whirled around He saw nothing but the dark window pane It s gone now came Tom s voice after a second in a still terror Something was looking at you Trembling violently Amory dropped into his chair again I ve got to tell you he said I ve had one hell of an experience I think I ve I ve seen the devil or something like him What face did you just see or no he added quickly don t tell me And he gave Tom the story It was midnight when he finished and after that with all lights burning two sleepy shivering boys read to each other from The New Machiavelli until dawn came up out of Witherspoon Hall and the Princetonian fell against the door and the May birds hailed the sun on last night s rain 
249_121331_000000_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER four 
none	none	Narcissus Off Duty During Princeton s transition period that is during Amory s last two years there while he saw it change and broaden and live up to its Gothic beauty by better means than night parades certain individuals arrived who stirred it to its plethoric depths Some of them had been freshmen and wild freshmen with Amory some were in the class below and it was in the beginning of his last year and around small tables at the Nassau Inn that they began questioning aloud the institutions that Amory and countless others before him had questioned so long in secret First and partly by accident they struck on certain books a definite type of biographical novel that Amory christened quest books In the quest book the hero set off in life armed with the best weapons and avowedly intending to use them as such weapons are usually used to push their possessors ahead as selfishly and blindly as possible but the heroes of the quest books discovered that there might be a more magnificent use for them None Other Gods Sinister Street and The Research Magnificent were examples of such books it was the latter of these three that gripped Burne Holiday and made him wonder in the beginning of senior year how much it was worth while being a diplomatic autocrat around his club on Prospect Avenue and basking in the high lights of class office It was distinctly through the channels of aristocracy that Burne found his way Amory through Kerry had had a vague drifting acquaintance with him but not until January of senior year did their friendship commence Heard the latest said Tom coming in late one drizzly evening with that triumphant air he always wore after a successful conversational bout No 
249_121331_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Somebody flunked out 
249_121331_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Or another ship sunk 
249_121331_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Worse than that 
249_121331_000004_000001	train-clean-360	About one third of the junior class are going to resign from their clubs 
none	none	What
249_121331_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Actual fact 
none	none	Why Spirit of reform and all that Burne Holiday is behind it The club presidents are holding a meeting to night to see if they can find a joint means of combating it
249_121331_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Well what s the idea of the thing 
249_121331_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh clubs injurious to Princeton democracy cost a lot draw social lines take time the regular line you get sometimes from disappointed sophomores 
249_121331_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Woodrow thought they should be abolished and all that 
249_121331_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 But this is the real thing 
none	none	Absolutely 
249_121331_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I think it ll go through 
249_121331_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 For Pete s sake tell me more about it 
none	none	Well began Tom it seems that the idea developed simultaneously in several heads 
249_121331_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I was talking to Burne awhile ago and he claims that it s a logical result if an intelligent person thinks long enough about the social system 
249_121331_000014_000002	train-clean-360	They had a discussion crowd and the point of abolishing the clubs was brought up by some one everybody there leaped at it it had been in each one s mind more or less and it just needed a spark to bring it out 
none	none	Fine I swear I think it ll be most entertaining How do they feel up at Cap and Gown
249_121331_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Wild of course 
none	none	Every one s been sitting and arguing and swearing and getting mad and getting sentimental and getting brutal 
249_121331_000016_000002	train-clean-360	It s the same at all the clubs I ve been the rounds 
249_121331_000016_000003	train-clean-360	They get one of the radicals in the corner and fire questions at him 
249_121331_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 How do the radicals stand up 
249_121331_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh moderately well 
249_121331_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Burne s a damn good talker and so obviously sincere that you can t get anywhere with him 
249_121331_000018_000002	train-clean-360	It s so evident that resigning from his club means so much more to him than preventing it does to us that I felt futile when I argued finally took a position that was brilliantly neutral 
249_121331_000018_000003	train-clean-360	In fact I believe Burne thought for a while that he d converted me 
none	none	And you say almost a third of the junior class are going to resign Call it a fourth and be safe
249_121331_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Lord who d have thought it possible 
none	none	There was a brisk knock at the door and Burne himself came in
249_121331_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 Hello Amory hello Tom 
none	none	Amory rose Evening Burne Don t mind if I seem to rush I m going to Renwick s 
249_121331_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Burne turned to him quickly 
249_121331_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 You probably know what I want to talk to Tom about and it isn t a bit private 
none	none	I wish you d stay I d be glad to Amory sat down again and as Burne perched on a table and launched into argument with Tom he looked at this revolutionary more carefully than he ever had before 
249_121331_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Broad browed and strong chinned with a fineness in the honest gray eyes that were like Kerry s Burne was a man who gave an immediate impression of bigness and security stubborn that was evident but his stubbornness wore no stolidity and when he had talked for five minutes Amory knew that this keen enthusiasm had in it no quality of dilettantism 
249_121331_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The intense power Amory felt later in Burne Holiday differed from the admiration he had had for Humbird 
none	none	This time it began as purely a mental interest With other men of whom he had thought as primarily first class he had been attracted first by their personalities and in Burne he missed that immediate magnetism to which he usually swore allegiance 
249_121331_000028_000003	train-clean-360	But that night Amory was struck by Burne s intense earnestness a quality he was accustomed to associate only with the dread stupidity and by the great enthusiasm that struck dead chords in his heart 
none	none	Burne stood vaguely for a land Amory hoped he was drifting toward and it was almost time that land was in sight Tom and Amory and Alec had reached an impasse never did they seem to have new experiences in common for Tom and Alec had been as blindly busy with their committees and boards as Amory had been blindly idling and the things they had for dissection college contemporary personality and the like they had hashed and rehashed for many a frugal conversational meal That night they discussed the clubs until twelve and in the main they agreed with Burne To the roommates it did not seem such a vital subject as it had in the two years before but the logic of Burne s objections to the social system dovetailed so completely with everything they had thought that they questioned rather than argued and envied the sanity that enabled this man to stand out so against all traditions 
249_121331_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Then Amory branched off and found that Burne was deep in other things as well 
none	none	Economics had interested him and he was turning socialist Pacifism played in the back of his mind and he read The Masses and Lyoff Tolstoi faithfully
249_121331_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 How about religion Amory asked him 
none	none	Don t know 
249_121331_000032_000001	train-clean-360	I m in a muddle about a lot of things I ve just discovered that I ve a mind and I m starting to read 
none	none	Read what Everything 
249_121331_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I have to pick and choose of course but mostly things to make me think 
249_121331_000034_000002	train-clean-360	I m reading the four gospels now and the Varieties of Religious Experience 
249_121331_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 What chiefly started you 
249_121331_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Wells I guess and Tolstoi and a man named Edward Carpenter 
none	none	I ve been reading for over a year now on a few lines on what I consider the essential lines Poetry Well frankly not what you call poetry or for your reasons you two write of course and look at things differently
249_121331_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Whitman 
none	none	is the man that attracts me Whitman
249_121331_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes he s a definite ethical force 
none	none	Well I m ashamed to say that I m a blank on the subject of Whitman How about you Tom 
249_121331_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Tom nodded sheepishly 
249_121331_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Well continued Burne you may strike a few poems that are tiresome but I mean the mass of his work 
none	none	He s tremendous like Tolstoi 
249_121331_000043_000002	train-clean-360	They both look things in the face and somehow different as they are stand for somewhat the same things 
249_121331_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 You have me stumped Burne Amory admitted 
249_121331_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve read Anna Karenina and the Kreutzer Sonata of course but Tolstoi is mostly in the original Russian as far as I m concerned 
none	none	He s the greatest man in hundreds of years cried Burne enthusiastically Did you ever see a picture of that shaggy old head of his They talked until three from biology to organized religion and when Amory crept shivering into bed it was with his mind aglow with ideas and a sense of shock that some one else had discovered the path he might have followed 
249_121331_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Burne Holiday was so evidently developing and Amory had considered that he was doing the same 
none	none	He had fallen into a deep cynicism over what had crossed his path plotted the imperfectability of man and read Shaw and Chesterton enough to keep his mind from the edges of decadence now suddenly all his mental processes of the last year and a half seemed stale and futile a petty consummation of himself and like a sombre background lay that incident of the spring before that filled half his nights with a dreary terror and made him unable to pray He was not even a Catholic yet that was the only ghost of a code that he had the gaudy ritualistic paradoxical Catholicism whose prophet was Chesterton whose claqueurs were such reformed rakes of literature as Huysmans and Bourget whose American sponsor was Ralph Adams Cram with his adulation of thirteenth century cathedrals a Catholicism which Amory found convenient and ready made without priest or sacraments or sacrifice He could not sleep so he turned on his reading lamp and taking down the Kreutzer Sonata searched it carefully for the germs of Burne s enthusiasm 
249_121331_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Being Burne was suddenly so much realler than being clever Yet he sighed here were other possible clay feet 
none	none	He thought back through two years of Burne as a hurried nervous freshman quite submerged in his brother s personality Then he remembered an incident of sophomore year in which Burne had been suspected of the leading role Dean Hollister had been heard by a large group arguing with a taxi driver who had driven him from the junction 
249_121331_000049_000001	train-clean-360	In the course of the altercation the dean remarked that he might as well buy the taxicab He paid and walked off but next morning he entered his private office to find the taxicab itself in the space usually occupied by his desk bearing a sign which read Property of Dean Hollister Bought and Paid for 
249_121331_000049_000002	train-clean-360	It took two expert mechanics half a day to dissemble it into its minutest parts and remove it which only goes to prove the rare energy of sophomore humor under efficient leadership 
none	none	Then again that very fall Burne had caused a sensation 
249_121331_000050_000001	train-clean-360	A certain Phyllis Styles an intercollegiate prom trotter had failed to get her yearly invitation to the Harvard Princeton game 
none	none	Jesse Ferrenby had brought her to a smaller game a few weeks before and had pressed Burne into service to the ruination of the latter s misogyny Are you coming to the Harvard game Burne had asked indiscreetly merely to make conversation
249_121331_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 If you ask me cried Phyllis quickly 
249_121331_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course I do said Burne feebly 
none	none	He was unversed in the arts of Phyllis and was sure that this was merely a vapid form of kidding Before an hour had passed he knew that he was indeed involved Phyllis had pinned him down and served him up informed him the train she was arriving by and depressed him thoroughly 
249_121331_000054_000003	train-clean-360	Aside from loathing Phyllis he had particularly wanted to stag that game and entertain some Harvard friends 
none	none	She ll see he informed a delegation who arrived in his room to josh him
249_121331_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 This will be the last game she ever persuades any young innocent to take her to 
none	none	But Burne why did you invite her if you didn t want her Burne you know you re secretly mad about her that s the real trouble What can you do Burne What can you do against Phyllis 
249_121331_000059_000000	train-clean-360	But Burne only shook his head and muttered threats which consisted largely of the phrase She ll see she ll see 
249_121331_000060_000000	train-clean-360	The blithesome Phyllis bore her twenty five summers gayly from the train but on the platform a ghastly sight met her eyes 
249_121331_000060_000001	train-clean-360	There were Burne and Fred Sloane arrayed to the last dot like the lurid figures on college posters 
249_121331_000060_000002	train-clean-360	They had bought flaring suits with huge peg top trousers and gigantic padded shoulders 
none	none	On their heads were rakish college hats pinned up in front and sporting bright orange and black bands while from their celluloid collars blossomed flaming orange ties They wore black arm bands with orange P s and carried canes flying Princeton pennants the effect completed by socks and peeping handkerchiefs in the same color motifs 
249_121331_000060_000004	train-clean-360	On a clanking chain they led a large angry tom cat painted to represent a tiger 
249_121331_000061_000000	train-clean-360	A good half of the station crowd was already staring at them torn between horrified pity and riotous mirth and as Phyllis with her svelte jaw dropping approached the pair bent over and emitted a college cheer in loud far carrying voices thoughtfully adding the name Phyllis to the end 
none	none	She was vociferously greeted and escorted enthusiastically across the campus followed by half a hundred village urchins to the stifled laughter of hundreds of alumni and visitors half of whom had no idea that this was a practical joke but thought that Burne and Fred were two varsity sports showing their girl a collegiate time Phyllis s feelings as she was paraded by the Harvard and Princeton stands where sat dozens of her former devotees can be imagined 
249_121331_000062_000001	train-clean-360	She tried to walk a little ahead she tried to walk a little behind but they stayed close that there should be no doubt whom she was with talking in loud voices of their friends on the football team until she could almost hear her acquaintances whispering 
none	none	Phyllis Styles must be awfully hard up to have to come with those two 
249_121331_000064_000000	train-clean-360	That had been Burne dynamically humorous fundamentally serious 
none	none	From that root had blossomed the energy that he was now trying to orient with progress So the weeks passed and March came and the clay feet that Amory looked for failed to appear 
249_121331_000065_000001	train-clean-360	About a hundred juniors and seniors resigned from their clubs in a final fury of righteousness and the clubs in helplessness turned upon Burne their finest weapon ridicule 
none	none	Every one who knew him liked him but what he stood for and he began to stand for more all the time came under the lash of many tongues until a frailer man than he would have been snowed under Don t you mind losing prestige asked Amory one night They had taken to exchanging calls several times a week
249_121331_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course I don t 
249_121331_000067_000001	train-clean-360	What s prestige at best 
none	none	Some people say that you re just a rather original politician He roared with laughter That s what Fred Sloane told me to day 
249_121331_000070_000001	train-clean-360	I suppose I have it coming 
none	none	One afternoon they dipped into a subject that had interested Amory for a long time the matter of the bearing of physical attributes on a man s make up Burne had gone into the biology of this and then
249_121331_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course health counts a healthy man has twice the chance of being good he said 
249_121331_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t agree with you I don t believe in muscular Christianity 
249_121331_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 I do I believe Christ had great physical vigor 
249_121331_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no Amory protested 
249_121331_000075_000001	train-clean-360	 He worked too hard for that 
249_121331_000075_000002	train-clean-360	I imagine that when he died he was a broken down man and the great saints haven t been strong 
none	none	Half of them have
249_121331_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Well even granting that I don t think health has anything to do with goodness of course it s valuable to a great saint to be able to stand enormous strains but this fad of popular preachers rising on their toes in simulated virility bellowing that calisthenics will save the world no Burne I can t go that 
249_121331_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Well let s waive it we won t get anywhere and besides I haven t quite made up my mind about it myself 
none	none	Now here s something I do know personal appearance has a lot to do with it Coloring Amory asked eagerly Yes
249_121331_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what Tom and I figured Amory agreed 
none	none	We took the year books for the last ten years and looked at the pictures of the senior council I know you don t think much of that august body but it does represent success here in a general way Well I suppose only about thirty five per cent of every class here are blonds are really light yet two thirds of every senior council are light We looked at pictures of ten years of them mind you that means that out of every fifteen light haired men in the senior class one is on the senior council and of the dark haired men it s only one in fifty It s true Burne agreed The light haired man is a higher type generally speaking I worked the thing out with the Presidents of the United States once and found that way over half of them were light haired yet think of the preponderant number of brunettes in the race
249_121331_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 People unconsciously admit it said Amory 
none	none	You ll notice a blond person is expected to talk 
249_121331_000083_000002	train-clean-360	If a blond girl doesn t talk we call her a doll if a light haired man is silent he s considered stupid 
none	none	Yet the world is full of dark silent men and languorous brunettes who haven t a brain in their heads but somehow are never accused of the dearth And the large mouth and broad chin and rather big nose undoubtedly make the superior face
249_121331_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 I m not so sure Amory was all for classical features 
249_121331_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes I ll show you and Burne pulled out of his desk a photographic collection of heavily bearded shaggy celebrities Tolstoi Whitman Carpenter and others 
249_121331_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Aren t they wonderful 
249_121331_000088_000000	train-clean-360	Amory tried politely to appreciate them and gave up laughingly 
none	none	Burne I think they re the ugliest looking crowd I ever came across They look like an old man s home Oh Amory look at that forehead on Emerson look at Tolstoi s eyes His tone was reproachful Amory shook his head
249_121331_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 No Call them remarkable looking or anything you want but ugly they certainly are 
249_121331_000093_000000	train-clean-360	Unabashed Burne ran his hand lovingly across the spacious foreheads and piling up the pictures put them back in his desk 
none	none	Walking at night was one of his favorite pursuits and one night he persuaded Amory to accompany him
249_121331_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 I hate the dark Amory objected 
249_121331_000095_000001	train-clean-360	 I didn t use to except when I was particularly imaginative but now I really do I m a regular fool about it 
none	none	That s useless you know Quite possibly
249_121331_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll go east Burne suggested and down that string of roads through the woods 
249_121331_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 Doesn t sound very appealing to me admitted Amory reluctantly but let s go 
none	none	They set off at a good gait and for an hour swung along in a brisk argument until the lights of Princeton were luminous white blots behind them Any person with any imagination is bound to be afraid said Burne earnestly
249_121331_000101_000001	train-clean-360	 And this very walking at night is one of the things I was afraid about 
249_121331_000101_000002	train-clean-360	I m going to tell you why I can walk anywhere now and not be afraid 
249_121331_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 Go on Amory urged eagerly 
none	none	They were striding toward the woods Burne s nervous enthusiastic voice warming to his subject
249_121331_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 I used to come out here alone at night oh three months ago and I always stopped at that cross road we just passed 
none	none	There were the woods looming up ahead just as they do now there were dogs howling and the shadows and no human sound 
249_121331_000103_000002	train-clean-360	Of course I peopled the woods with everything ghastly just like you do don t you 
none	none	I do Amory admitted Well I began analyzing it my imagination persisted in sticking horrors into the dark so I stuck my imagination into the dark instead and let it look out at me I let it play stray dog or escaped convict or ghost and then saw myself coming along the road 
249_121331_000105_000001	train-clean-360	That made it all right as it always makes everything all right to project yourself completely into another s place 
none	none	I knew that if I were the dog or the convict or the ghost I wouldn t be a menace to Burne Holiday any more than he was a menace to me 
249_121331_000105_000003	train-clean-360	Then I thought of my watch 
none	none	I d better go back and leave it and then essay the woods 
249_121331_000105_000005	train-clean-360	No I decided it s better on the whole that I should lose a watch than that I should turn back and I did go into them not only followed the road through them but walked into them until I wasn t frightened any more did it until one night I sat down and dozed off in there then I knew I was through being afraid of the dark 
249_121331_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 Lordy Amory breathed 
none	none	I couldn t have done that 
249_121331_000106_000002	train-clean-360	I d have come out half way and the first time an automobile passed and made the dark thicker when its lamps disappeared I d have come in 
249_121331_000107_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Burne said suddenly after a few moments silence we re half way through let s turn back 
249_121331_000108_000000	train-clean-360	On the return he launched into a discussion of will 
none	none	It s the whole thing he asserted It s the one dividing line between good and evil 
249_121331_000109_000002	train-clean-360	I ve never met a man who led a rotten life and didn t have a weak will 
249_121331_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 How about great criminals 
none	none	They re usually insane 
249_121331_000111_000001	train-clean-360	If not they re weak 
none	none	There is no such thing as a strong sane criminal
249_121331_000112_000000	train-clean-360	 Burne I disagree with you altogether how about the superman 
none	none	Well
249_121331_000114_000000	train-clean-360	 He s evil I think yet he s strong and sane 
249_121331_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve never met him 
none	none	I ll bet though that he s stupid or insane
249_121331_000116_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve met him over and over and he s neither 
none	none	That s why I think you re wrong
249_121331_000117_000000	train-clean-360	 I m sure I m not and so I don t believe in imprisonment except for the insane 
249_121331_000118_000000	train-clean-360	On this point Amory could not agree 
249_121331_000118_000001	train-clean-360	It seemed to him that life and history were rife with the strong criminal keen but often self deluding in politics and business one found him and among the old statesmen and kings and generals but Burne never agreed and their courses began to split on that point 
249_121331_000119_000000	train-clean-360	Burne was drawing farther and farther away from the world about him 
none	none	He resigned the vice presidency of the senior class and took to reading and walking as almost his only pursuits He voluntarily attended graduate lectures in philosophy and biology and sat in all of them with a rather pathetically intent look in his eyes as if waiting for something the lecturer would never quite come to 
249_121331_000119_000003	train-clean-360	Sometimes Amory would see him squirm in his seat and his face would light up he was on fire to debate a point 
none	none	He grew more abstracted on the street and was even accused of becoming a snob but Amory knew it was nothing of the sort and once when Burne passed him four feet off absolutely unseeingly his mind a thousand miles away Amory almost choked with the romantic joy of watching him Burne seemed to be climbing heights where others would be forever unable to get a foothold I tell you Amory declared to Tom he s the first contemporary I ve ever met whom I ll admit is my superior in mental capacity
249_121331_000122_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a bad time to admit it people are beginning to think he s odd 
none	none	He s way over their heads you know you think so yourself when you talk to him Good Lord Tom you used to stand out against people Success has completely conventionalized you 
249_121331_000124_000000	train-clean-360	Tom grew rather annoyed 
249_121331_000125_000000	train-clean-360	 What s he trying to do be excessively holy 
249_121331_000126_000000	train-clean-360	 No not like anybody you ve ever seen 
none	none	Never enters the Philadelphian Society 
249_121331_000126_000002	train-clean-360	He has no faith in that rot 
249_121331_000126_000003	train-clean-360	He doesn t believe that public swimming pools and a kind word in time will right the wrongs of the world moreover he takes a drink whenever he feels like it 
none	none	He certainly is getting in wrong
249_121331_000128_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you talked to him lately 
none	none	No Then you haven t any conception of him The argument ended nowhere but Amory noticed more than ever how the sentiment toward Burne had changed on the campus
249_121331_000132_000000	train-clean-360	 It s odd Amory said to Tom one night when they had grown more amicable on the subject that the people who violently disapprove of Burne s radicalism are distinctly the Pharisee class I mean they re the best educated men in college the editors of the papers like yourself and Ferrenby the younger professors 
249_121331_000132_000001	train-clean-360	The illiterate athletes like Langueduc think he s getting eccentric but they just say Good old Burne has got some queer ideas in his head and pass on the Pharisee class Gee they ridicule him unmercifully 
249_121331_000133_000000	train-clean-360	The next morning he met Burne hurrying along McCosh walk after a recitation 
249_121331_000134_000000	train-clean-360	 Whither bound Tsar 
249_121331_000135_000000	train-clean-360	 Over to the Prince office to see Ferrenby he waved a copy of the morning s Princetonian at Amory 
249_121331_000135_000001	train-clean-360	 He wrote this editorial 
249_121331_000136_000000	train-clean-360	 Going to flay him alive 
249_121331_000137_000000	train-clean-360	 No but he s got me all balled up 
249_121331_000137_000001	train-clean-360	Either I ve misjudged him or he s suddenly become the world s worst radical 
none	none	Burne hurried on and it was several days before Amory heard an account of the ensuing conversation 
249_121331_000138_000001	train-clean-360	Burne had come into the editor s sanctum displaying the paper cheerfully 
249_121331_000139_000000	train-clean-360	 Hello Jesse 
249_121331_000140_000000	train-clean-360	 Hello there Savonarola 
249_121331_000141_000000	train-clean-360	 I just read your editorial 
none	none	Good boy didn t know you stooped that low
249_121331_000143_000000	train-clean-360	 Jesse you startled me 
249_121331_000144_000000	train-clean-360	 How so 
none	none	Aren t you afraid the faculty ll get after you if you pull this irreligious stuff What
249_121331_000147_000000	train-clean-360	 Like this morning 
249_121331_000148_000000	train-clean-360	 What the devil that editorial was on the coaching system 
249_121331_000149_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but that quotation 
249_121331_000150_000000	train-clean-360	Jesse sat up 
249_121331_000151_000000	train-clean-360	 What quotation 
none	none	You know He who is not with me is against me
249_121331_000153_000000	train-clean-360	 Well what about it 
249_121331_000154_000000	train-clean-360	Jesse was puzzled but not alarmed 
none	none	Well you say here let me see Burne opened the paper and read He who is not with me is against me as that gentleman said who was notoriously capable of only coarse distinctions and puerile generalities What of it Ferrenby began to look alarmed Oliver Cromwell said it didn t he or was it Washington or one of the saints Good Lord I ve forgotten Burne roared with laughter Oh Jesse oh good kind Jesse Who said it for Pete s sake Well said Burne recovering his voice saint Matthew attributes it to Christ My God cried Jesse and collapsed backward into the waste basket 
264-121332-0000	train-other-500	AMORY WRITES A POEM The weeks tore by Amory wandered occasionally to New York on the chance of finding a new shining green auto bus that its stick of candy glamour might penetrate his disposition
264-121332-0001	train-other-500	One day he ventured into a stock company revival of a play whose name was faintly familiar The curtain rose he watched casually as a girl entered A few phrases rang in his ear and touched a faint chord of memory Where
264-121332-0002	train-other-500	When Then he seemed to hear a voice whispering beside him a very soft vibrant voice Oh I m such a poor little fool do tell me when I do wrong The solution came in a flash and he had a
264-121332-0003	train-other-500	quick glad memory of Isabelle He found a blank space on his programme and began to scribble rapidly Here in the figured dark I watch once more There with the curtain roll the years away
none	none	 Two years of years 
264-121332-0004	train-other-500	there was an idle day Of ours when happy endings didn t bore Our unfermented souls I could adore Your eager face beside me wide eyed gay
264-121332-0005	train-other-500	Smiling a repertoire while the poor play Reached me as a faint ripple reaches shore Yawning and wondering an evening through I watch alone and chatterings of course Spoil the one scene which
264-121332-0006	train-other-500	somehow did have charms You wept a bit and I grew sad for you Right here Where mister X defends divorce And What s Her Name falls fainting in his arms STILL CALM
264-121332-0007	train-other-500	Ghosts are such dumb things said Alec they re slow witted I can always outguess a ghost How asked Tom Well it depends where Take a bedroom for example If you use any discretion
264-121332-0008	train-other-500	a ghost can never get you in a bedroom Go on s pose you think there s maybe a ghost in your bedroom what measures do you take on getting home at night demanded Amory interested
264-121332-0009	train-other-500	Take a stick answered Alec with ponderous reverence one about the length of a broom handle
none	none	 Now the first thing to do is to get the room cleared 
264-121332-0010	train-other-500	to do this you rush with your eyes closed into your study and turn on the lights next approaching the closet carefully run the stick in the door three or four times Then if nothing happens you can look in
264-121332-0011	train-other-500	Always always run the stick in viciously first
none	none	 never look first Of course 
264-121332-0012	train-other-500	that s the ancient Celtic school said Tom gravely Yes but they usually pray first
none	none	 Anyway you use this method to clear the closets 
264-121332-0013	train-other-500	and also for behind all doors And the bed Amory suggested Oh Amory no cried Alec in horror That isn t the way
264-121332-0014	train-other-500	the bed requires different tactics let the bed alone as you value your reason if there is a ghost in the room and that s only about a third of the time it is almost always under the bed Well
264-121332-0015	train-other-500	Amory began Alec waved him into silence Of course you never look You stand in the middle of the floor and before he knows what you re going to do make a sudden leap for the bed never walk near the bed
none	none	 to a ghost your ankle is your most vulnerable part 
264-121332-0016	train-other-500	once in bed you re safe he may lie around under the bed all night but you re safe as daylight If you still have doubts pull the blanket over your head All that s very interesting Tom
264-121332-0017	train-other-500	Isn t it Alec beamed proudly All my own too the Sir Oliver Lodge of the new world Amory was enjoying college immensely again The sense of going forward in a direct determined line had come back
264-121332-0018	train-other-500	youth was stirring and shaking out a few new feathers He had even stored enough surplus energy to sally into a new pose What s the idea of all this distracted stuff Amory asked Alec one day
none	none	 and then as Amory pretended to be cramped over his book in a daze 
264-121332-0019	train-other-500	Oh don t try to act Burne the mystic to me Amory looked up innocently What What mimicked Alec Are you trying to read yourself into a rhapsody with let s see the book
264-121332-0020	train-other-500	He snatched it regarded it derisively Well said Amory a little stiffly The Life of saint Teresa read Alec aloud
none	none	 Oh my gosh 
264-121332-0021	train-other-500	Say Alec What Does it bother you Does what bother me My acting dazed and all that Why
none	none	 no of course it doesn t bother me 
264-121332-0022	train-other-500	Well then don t spoil it If I enjoy going around telling people guilelessly that I think I m a genius let me do it You re getting a reputation for being eccentric said Alec laughing if that s what you mean
264-121332-0023	train-other-500	Amory finally prevailed and Alec agreed to accept his face value in the presence of others if he was allowed rest periods when they were alone so Amory ran it out at a great rate bringing the most eccentric characters to dinner
264-121332-0024	train-other-500	wild eyed grad students preceptors with strange theories of God and government to the cynical amazement of the supercilious Cottage Club As February became slashed by sun and moved cheerfully into March
264-121332-0025	train-other-500	Amory went several times to spend week ends with Monsignor once he took Burne with great success for he took equal pride and delight in displaying them to each other Monsignor took him several times to see Thornton Hancock
264-121332-0026	train-other-500	and once or twice to the house of a missus Lawrence a type of Rome haunting American whom Amory liked immediately Then one day came a letter from Monsignor which appended an interesting P S
264-121332-0027	train-other-500	Do you know it ran that your third cousin Clara Page widowed six months and very poor is living in Philadelphia I don t think you ve ever met her but I wish as a favor to me you d go to see her
none	none	 To my mind she s rather a remarkable woman and just about your age 
264-121332-0028	train-other-500	Amory sighed and decided to go as a favor CLARA She was immemorial
none	none	 Amory wasn t good enough for Clara Clara of ripply golden hair but then no man was Her goodness was above the prosy morals of the husband seeker 
264-121332-0029	train-other-500	apart from the dull literature of female virtue Sorrow lay lightly around her and when Amory found her in Philadelphia he thought her steely blue eyes held only happiness a latent strength
264-121332-0030	train-other-500	a realism was brought to its fullest development by the facts that she was compelled to face She was alone in the world with two small children little money and worst of all a host of friends
264-121332-0031	train-other-500	He saw her that winter in Philadelphia entertaining a houseful of men for an evening when he knew she had not a servant in the house except the little colored girl guarding the babies overhead He saw one of the greatest libertines in that city
264-121332-0032	train-other-500	a man who was habitually drunk and notorious at home and abroad sitting opposite her for an evening discussing girls boarding schools with a sort of innocent excitement
264-121332-0033	train-other-500	What a twist Clara had to her mind She could make fascinating and almost brilliant conversation out of the thinnest air that ever floated through a drawing room
none	none	 The idea that the girl was poverty stricken had appealed to Amory s sense of situation 
264-121332-0034	train-other-500	He arrived in Philadelphia expecting to be told that
none	none	 nine hundred twenty one Ark Street 
264-121332-0035	train-other-500	was in a miserable lane of hovels
none	none	 He was even disappointed when it proved to be nothing of the sort It was an old house that had 
264-121332-0036	train-other-500	been in her husband s family for years An elderly aunt who objected to having it sold had put ten years taxes with a lawyer and pranced off to Honolulu leaving Clara to struggle with the heating problem as best she could
none	none	 So no wild haired woman with a hungry baby at her breast 
264-121332-0037	train-other-500	and a sad Amelia like look greeted him Instead Amory would have thought from his reception that she had not a care in the world A calm virility and a dreamy humor
none	none	 marked contrasts to her level headedness into these moods she slipped sometimes as a refuge She could do the most prosy things 
264-121332-0038	train-other-500	though she was wise enough never to stultify herself with such household arts as knitting and embroidery yet immediately afterward pick up a book and let her imagination rove as a formless cloud with the wind
264-121332-0039	train-other-500	Deepest of all in her personality was the golden radiance that she diffused around her
none	none	 As an open fire in a dark room throws romance and pathos 
264-121332-0040	train-other-500	into the quiet faces at its edge so she cast her lights and shadows around the rooms that held her
none	none	 until she made of her prosy old uncle a man of 
264-121332-0041	train-other-500	quaint and meditative charm metamorphosed the stray telegraph boy into a Puck like creature of delightful originality At first this quality of hers somehow irritated Amory He considered his own uniqueness sufficient and it
264-121332-0042	train-other-500	rather embarrassed him when she tried to read new interests into him for the benefit of what other adorers were present He felt as if a polite but insistent stage manager were attempting to make him give a new interpretation of a part he had conned for years
264-121332-0043	train-other-500	But Clara talking Clara telling a slender tale of a hatpin and an inebriated man and herself
none	none	 People tried afterward to repeat her anecdotes 
264-121332-0044	train-other-500	but for the life of them they could make them sound like nothing whatever They gave her a sort of innocent attention and the best smiles many of them had smiled for long there were few tears in Clara but people smiled misty eyed at her
264-121332-0045	train-other-500	Very occasionally Amory stayed for little half hours after the rest of the court had gone and they would have bread and jam and tea late in the afternoon or maple sugar lunches as she called them at night
264-121332-0046	train-other-500	You are remarkable aren t you
none	none	 Amory was becoming trite from where he perched in the centre of the dining room table 
264-121332-0047	train-other-500	one six o clock Not a bit she answered
none	none	 She was searching out napkins in the sideboard I m really most humdrum and commonplace One of those people who have no interest in anything but their children 
264-121332-0048	train-other-500	Tell that to somebody else scoffed Amory You know you re perfectly effulgent He asked her the one thing that he knew might embarrass her It was the remark
none	none	 that the first bore made to Adam 
264-121332-0049	train-other-500	Tell me about yourself And she gave the answer that Adam must have given There s nothing to tell But eventually
264-121332-0050	train-other-500	Adam probably told the bore all the things he thought about at night when the locusts sang in the sandy grass and he must have remarked patronizingly
none	none	 how different he was from Eve 
264-121332-0051	train-other-500	forgetting how different she was from him at any rate Clara told Amory much about herself that evening She had had a harried life from sixteen on and her education had stopped sharply with her leisure
264-121332-0052	train-other-500	Browsing in her library Amory found a tattered gray book out of which fell a yellow sheet
none	none	 that he impudently opened It was a poem that she had written at school about a 
264-121332-0053	train-other-500	gray convent wall on a gray day and a girl with her cloak blown by the wind sitting atop of it and thinking about the many colored world As a rule such sentiment bored him
none	none	 but this was done with so much simplicity and atmosphere 
264-121332-0054	train-other-500	that it brought a picture of Clara to his mind of Clara on such a cool gray day with her keen blue eyes staring out trying to see her tragedies come marching over the gardens outside He envied that poem
none	none	 How he would have loved to have come along and seen her on the wall 
264-121332-0055	train-other-500	and talked nonsense or romance to her
none	none	 perched above him in the air He began to be frightfully jealous of everything about Clara of her past of her babies of the men and women who flocked to drink deep of her cool kindness 
264-121332-0056	train-other-500	and rest their tired minds as at an absorbing play Nobody seems to bore you he objected About half the world do she admitted
none	none	 but I think that s a pretty good average don t you 
264-121332-0057	train-other-500	and she turned to find something in Browning that bore on the subject
none	none	 She was the only person he ever met who could look up passages and quotations to show him in the middle of the conversation 
264-121332-0058	train-other-500	and yet not be irritating to distraction She did it constantly with such a serious enthusiasm that he grew fond of watching her golden hair bent over a book brow wrinkled ever so little at hunting her sentence
264-121332-0059	train-other-500	Through early March he took to going to Philadelphia for week ends Almost always there was some one else there and she seemed not anxious to see him alone
none	none	 for many occasions presented themselves when a word from her would have given him 
264-121332-0060	train-other-500	another delicious half hour of adoration But he fell gradually in love and began to speculate wildly on marriage Though this design flowed through his brain even to his lips still he knew afterward that the desire had not been deeply rooted
none	none	 Once he dreamt that it had come true and woke up in a cold panic 
264-121332-0061	train-other-500	for in his dream she had been a silly flaxen Clara
none	none	 with the gold gone out of her hair and platitudes falling insipidly from her changeling tongue But she was the first fine woman he ever knew 
264-121332-0062	train-other-500	and one of the few good people who ever interested him She made her goodness such an asset Amory had decided that most good people either dragged theirs after them as a liability or else distorted it to
264-121332-0063	train-other-500	artificial geniality and of course there were the ever present prig and Pharisee but Amory never included them as being among the saved saint CECILIA
264-121332-0064	train-other-500	Over her gray and velvet dress Under her molten beaten hair Color of rose in mock distress Flushes and fades and makes her fair Fills the air from her to him
264-121332-0065	train-other-500	With light and languor and little sighs Just so subtly he scarcely knows Laughing lightning color of rose Do you like me
none	none	 Of course I do said Clara seriously 
264-121332-0066	train-other-500	Why Well we have some qualities in common Things that are spontaneous in each of us or were originally
264-121332-0067	train-other-500	You re implying that I haven t used myself very well Clara hesitated Well I can t judge A man of course has to go through a lot more and I ve been sheltered
264-121332-0068	train-other-500	Oh don t stall please Clara Amory interrupted but do talk about me a little won t you Surely I d adore to She didn t smile That s sweet of you
264-121332-0069	train-other-500	First answer some questions Am I painfully conceited Well no you have tremendous vanity but it ll amuse the people who notice its preponderance I see
264-121332-0070	train-other-500	You re really humble at heart You sink to the third hell of depression when you think you ve been slighted In fact you haven t much self respect Centre of target twice Clara How do you do it
264-121332-0071	train-other-500	You never let me say a word Of course not I can never judge a man while he s talking But I m not through the reason you have so little real self confidence even though you gravely announce to the occasional philistine
none	none	 that you think you re a genius is that you ve attributed all sorts of atrocious faults to yourself 
264-121332-0072	train-other-500	and are trying to live up to them For instance you re always saying that you are a slave to high balls But I am potentially
none	none	 And you say you re a weak character that you ve no will 
264-121332-0073	train-other-500	Not a bit of will I m a slave to my emotions to my likes to my hatred of boredom to most of my desires You are not She brought one little fist down onto the other
264-121332-0074	train-other-500	You re a slave a bound helpless slave to one thing in the world your imagination You certainly interest me If this isn t boring you go on
none	none	 I notice that when you want to stay over an extra day from college you go about it in a sure way 
264-121332-0075	train-other-500	You never decide at first while the merits of going or staying are fairly clear in your mind
none	none	 You let your imagination shinny on the side of your desires for a few hours and then you decide Naturally your imagination after a little freedom 
264-121332-0076	train-other-500	thinks up a million reasons why you should stay so your decision when it comes isn t true It s biassed Yes objected Amory but isn t it lack of will power to let my imagination shinny on the wrong side
264-121332-0077	train-other-500	My dear boy there s your big mistake This has nothing to do with will power
none	none	 that s a crazy useless word anyway 
264-121332-0078	train-other-500	you lack judgment the judgment to decide at once when you know your imagination will play you false given half a chance Well I ll be darned exclaimed Amory in surprise that s the last thing I expected
264-121332-0079	train-other-500	Clara didn t gloat She changed the subject immediately But she had started him thinking and he believed she was partly right He felt like a factory owner who after accusing a clerk of dishonesty
none	none	 finds that his own son in the office is changing the books once a week 
264-121332-0080	train-other-500	His poor mistreated will that he had been holding up to the scorn of himself and his friends stood before him innocent and his judgment walked off to prison with the unconfinable imp imagination
264-121332-0081	train-other-500	dancing in mocking glee beside him Clara s was the only advice he ever asked without dictating the answer himself except perhaps in his talks with Monsignor Darcy
264-121332-0082	train-other-500	How he loved to do any sort of thing with Clara Shopping with her was a rare epicurean dream In every store where she had ever traded she was whispered about as the beautiful missus Page
none	none	 I ll bet she won t stay single long Well don t scream it out She ain t lookin for no advice 
264-121332-0083	train-other-500	Ain t she beautiful Enter a floor walker silence till he moves forward smirking Society person ain t she Yeah but poor now I guess so they say
264-121332-0084	train-other-500	Gee girls ain t she some kid And Clara beamed on all alike Amory believed that tradespeople gave her discounts sometimes to her knowledge and sometimes without it He knew she dressed very well
264-121332-0085	train-other-500	had always the best of everything in the house and was inevitably waited upon by the head floor walker at the very least Sometimes they would go to church together on Sunday and he would walk beside her and revel in her cheeks moist from the soft water in the new air
264-121332-0086	train-other-500	She was very devout always had been and God knows what heights she attained and what strength she drew down to herself when she knelt and bent her golden hair into the stained glass light
none	none	 saint Cecelia he cried aloud one day 
264-121332-0087	train-other-500	quite involuntarily and the people turned and peered and the priest paused in his sermon and Clara and Amory turned to fiery red That was the last Sunday they had for he spoiled it all that night
none	none	 He couldn t help it They were walking through the March twilight where it was as warm as June 
264-121332-0088	train-other-500	and the joy of youth filled his soul so that he felt he must speak I think he said and his voice trembled that if I lost faith in you I d
none	none	 lose faith in God 
264-121332-0089	train-other-500	She looked at him with such a startled face that he asked her the matter Nothing she said slowly only this five men have said that to me before and it frightens me
264-121332-0090	train-other-500	Oh Clara is that your fate She did not answer I suppose love to you is he began She turned like a flash I have never been in love
264-121332-0091	train-other-500	They walked along and he realized slowly how much she had told him never in love She seemed suddenly a daughter of light alone
264-121332-0092	train-other-500	His entity dropped out of her plane and he longed only to touch her dress with almost the realization that Joseph must have had of Mary s eternal significance But quite mechanically he heard himself saying
264-121332-0093	train-other-500	And I love you any latent greatness that I ve got is oh I can t talk but Clara if I come back in two years in a position to marry you She shook her head No she said I d never marry again
264-121332-0094	train-other-500	I ve got my two children and I want myself for them I like you I like all clever men you more than any but you know me well enough to know that I d never marry a clever man She broke off suddenly Amory
264-121332-0095	train-other-500	What You re not in love with me You never wanted to marry me did you
none	none	 It was the twilight he said wonderingly 
264-121332-0096	train-other-500	I didn t feel as though I were speaking aloud But I love you or adore you or worship you There you go running through your catalogue of emotions in five seconds He smiled unwillingly
264-121332-0097	train-other-500	Don t make me out such a light weight Clara you are depressing sometimes You re not a light weight of all things she said intently taking his arm and opening wide her eyes
none	none	 he could see their kindliness in the fading dusk 
264-121332-0098	train-other-500	A light weight is an eternal nay There s so much spring in the air there s so much lazy sweetness in your heart She dropped his arm You re all fine now and I feel glorious
264-121332-0099	train-other-500	Give me a cigarette You ve never seen me smoke have you Well I do about once a month And then that wonderful girl and Amory raced to the corner like two mad children gone wild with pale blue twilight
264-121332-0100	train-other-500	I m going to the country for to morrow she announced as she stood panting safe beyond the flare of the corner lamp post
none	none	 These days are too magnificent to miss though perhaps I feel them more in the city 
264-121332-0101	train-other-500	Oh Clara Amory said
none	none	 what a devil you could have been if the Lord had just bent your soul a little the other way 
264-121332-0102	train-other-500	Maybe she answered but I think not I m never really wild and never have been That little outburst was pure spring And you are too said he
264-121332-0103	train-other-500	They were walking along now No you re wrong again how can a person of your own self reputed brains be so constantly wrong about me I m the opposite of everything spring ever stood for
264-121332-0104	train-other-500	It s unfortunate if I happen to look like what pleased some soppy old Greek sculptor but I assure you that if it weren t for my face I d be a quiet nun in the convent without
264-121332-0105	train-other-500	then she broke into a run and her raised voice floated back to him as he followed my precious babies which I must go back and see She was the only girl he ever knew with whom he could understand how another man might be preferred
264-121332-0106	train-other-500	Often Amory met wives whom he had known as debutantes and looking intently at them imagined that he found something in their faces which said Oh if I could only have gotten you Oh the enormous conceit of the man
264-121332-0107	train-other-500	But that night seemed a night of stars and singing and Clara s bright soul still gleamed on the ways they had trod Golden golden is the air he chanted to the little pools of water
264-121332-0108	train-other-500	Golden is the air golden notes from golden mandolins golden frets of golden violins fair oh wearily fair Skeins from braided basket mortals may not hold
264-121332-0109	train-other-500	oh what young extravagant God who would know or ask it
none	none	 who could give such gold AMORY IS RESENTFUL Slowly and inevitably yet with a sudden surge at the last while Amory talked and dreamed war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where Princeton played Every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basket ball markings When Amory went to Washington the next week end he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the Pullman car coming back for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens Greeks he guessed or Russians He thought how much easier patriotism had been to a homogeneous race how much easier it would have been to fight as the Colonies fought or as the Confederacy fought And he did no sleeping that night but listened to the aliens guffaw and snore while they filled the car with the heavy scent of latest America In Princeton every one bantered in public and told themselves privately that their deaths at least would be heroic The literary students read Rupert Brooke passionately the lounge lizards worried over whether the government would permit the English cut uniform for officers a few of the hopelessly lazy wrote to the obscure branches of the War Department seeking an easy commission and a soft berth Then after a week Amory saw Burne and knew at once that argument would be futile Burne had come out as a pacifist The socialist magazines a great smattering of Tolstoi and his own intense longing for a cause that would bring out whatever strength lay in him had finally decided him to preach peace as a subjective ideal When the German army entered Belgium he began if the inhabitants had gone peaceably about their business the German army would have been disorganized in I know Amory interrupted I ve heard it all But I m not going to talk propaganda with you There s a chance that you re right but even so we re hundreds of years before the time when non resistance can touch us as a reality But Amory listen Burne we d just argue Very well Just one thing I don t ask you to think of your family or friends because I know they don t count a picayune with you beside your sense of duty but Burne how do you know that the magazines you read and the societies you join and these idealists you meet aren t just plain German Some of them are of course How do you know they aren t all pro German just a lot of weak ones with German Jewish names That s the chance of course he said slowly How much or how little I m taking this stand because of propaganda I ve heard I don t know naturally I think that it s my most innermost conviction it seems a path spread before me just now Amory s heart sank But think of the cheapness of it no one s really going to martyr you for being a pacifist it s just going to throw you in with the worst I doubt it he interrupted Well it all smells of Bohemian New York to me I know what you mean and that s why I m not sure I ll agitate You re one man Burne going to talk to people who won t listen with all God s given you That s what Stephen must have thought many years ago But he preached his sermon and they killed him He probably thought as he was dying what a waste it all was But you see I ve always felt that Stephen s death was the thing that occurred to Paul on the road to Damascus and sent him to preach the word of Christ all over the world Go on That s all this is my particular duty Even if right now I m just a pawn just sacrificed God Amory you don t think I like the Germans Well I can t say anything else I get to the end of all the logic about non resistance and there like an excluded middle stands the huge spectre of man as he is and always will be And this spectre stands right beside the one logical necessity of Tolstoi s and the other logical necessity of Nietzsche s Amory broke off suddenly When are you going I m going next week I ll see you of course As he walked away it seemed to Amory that the look in his face bore a great resemblance to that in Kerry s when he had said good by under Blair Arch two years before Amory wondered unhappily why he could never go into anything with the primal honesty of those two Burne s a fanatic he said to Tom and he s dead wrong and I m inclined to think just an unconscious pawn in the hands of anarchistic publishers and German paid rag wavers but he haunts me just leaving everything worth while Burne left in a quietly dramatic manner a week later He sold all his possessions and came down to the room to say good by with a battered old bicycle on which he intended to ride to his home in Pennsylvania Peter the Hermit bidding farewell to Cardinal Richelieu suggested Alec who was lounging in the window seat as Burne and Amory shook hands But Amory was not in a mood for that and as he saw Burne s long legs propel his ridiculous bicycle out of sight beyond Alexander Hall he knew he was going to have a bad week Not that he doubted the war Germany stood for everything repugnant to him for materialism and the direction of tremendous licentious force it was just that Burne s face stayed in his memory and he was sick of the hysteria he was beginning to hear What on earth is the use of suddenly running down Goethe he declared to Alec and Tom Why write books to prove he started the war or that that stupid overestimated Schiller is a demon in disguise Have you ever read anything of theirs asked Tom shrewdly No Amory admitted Neither have I he said laughing People will shout said Alec quietly but Goethe s on his same old shelf in the library to bore any one that wants to read him Amory subsided and the subject dropped What are you going to do Amory Infantry or aviation I can t make up my mind I hate mechanics but then of course aviation s the thing for me I feel as Amory does said Tom Infantry or aviation aviation sounds like the romantic side of the war of course like cavalry used to be you know but like Amory I don t know a horse power from a piston rod Somehow Amory s dissatisfaction with his lack of enthusiasm culminated in an attempt to put the blame for the whole war on the ancestors of his generation all the people who cheered for Germany in eighteen seventy All the materialists rampant all the idolizers of German science and efficiency So he sat one day in an English lecture and heard Locksley Hall quoted and fell into a brown study with contempt for Tennyson and all he stood for for he took him as a representative of the Victorians Victorians Victorians who never learned to weep Who sowed the bitter harvest that your children go to reap scribbled Amory in his note book The lecturer was saying something about Tennyson s solidity and fifty heads were bent to take notes Amory turned over to a fresh page and began scrawling again They shuddered when they found what mister Darwin was about They shuddered when the waltz came in and Newman hurried out But the waltz came in much earlier he crossed that out And entitled A Song in the Time of Order came the professor s voice droning far away Time of Order Good Lord Everything crammed in the box and the Victorians sitting on the lid smiling serenely With Browning in his Italian villa crying bravely All s for the best Amory scribbled again You knelt up in the temple and he bent to hear you pray You thanked him for your glorious gains reproached him for Cathay Why could he never get more than a couplet at a time Now he needed something to rhyme with You would keep Him straight with science tho He had gone wrong before Well anyway You met your children in your home I ve fixed it up you cried Took your fifty years of Europe and then virtuously died That was to a great extent Tennyson s idea came the lecturer s voice Swinburne s Song in the Time of Order might well have been Tennyson s title He idealized order against chaos against waste At last Amory had it He turned over another page and scrawled vigorously for the twenty minutes that was left of the hour Then he walked up to the desk and deposited a page torn out of his note book Here s a poem to the Victorians sir he said coldly The professor picked it up curiously while Amory backed rapidly through the door Here is what he had written Songs in the time of order You left for us to sing Proofs with excluded middles Answers to life in rhyme Keys of the prison warder And ancient bells to ring Time was the end of riddles We were the end of time Here were domestic oceans And a sky that we might reach Guns and a guarded border Gantlets but not to fling Thousands of old emotions And a platitude for each Songs in the time of order And tongues that we might sing THE END OF MANY THINGS Early April slipped by in a haze a haze of long evenings on the club veranda with the graphophone playing Poor Butterfly inside for Poor Butterfly had been the song of that last year The war seemed scarcely to touch them and it might have been one of the senior springs of the past except for the drilling every other afternoon yet Amory realized poignantly that this was the last spring under the old regime This is the great protest against the superman said Amory I suppose so Alec agreed He s absolutely irreconcilable with any Utopia As long as he occurs there s trouble and all the latent evil that makes a crowd list and sway when he talks And of course all that he is is a gifted man without a moral sense That s all I think the worst thing to contemplate is this it s all happened before how soon will it happen again Fifty years after Waterloo Napoleon was as much a hero to English school children as Wellington How do we know our grandchildren won t idolize Von Hindenburg the same way What brings it about Time damn it and the historian If we could only learn to look on evil as evil whether it s clothed in filth or monotony or magnificence God Haven t we raked the universe over the coals for four years Then the night came that was to be the last Tom and Amory bound in the morning for different training camps paced the shadowy walks as usual and seemed still to see around them the faces of the men they knew The grass is full of ghosts to night The whole campus is alive with them They paused by Little and watched the moon rise to make silver of the slate roof of Dodd and blue the rustling trees You know whispered Tom what we feel now is the sense of all the gorgeous youth that has rioted through here in two hundred years A last burst of singing flooded up from Blair Arch broken voices for some long parting And what we leave here is more than this class it s the whole heritage of youth We re just one generation we re breaking all the links that seemed to bind us here to top booted and high stocked generations We ve walked arm and arm with Burr and Light Horse Harry Lee through half these deep blue nights That s what they are Tom tangented off deep blue a bit of color would spoil them make them exotic Spires against a sky that s a promise of dawn and blue light on the slate roofs it hurts rather Good by Aaron Burr Amory called toward deserted Nassau Hall you and I knew strange corners of life His voice echoed in the stillness The torches are out whispered Tom Ah Messalina the long shadows are building minarets on the stadium For an instant the voices of freshman year surged around them and then they looked at each other with faint tears in their eyes Damn Damn The last light fades and drifts across the land the low long land the sunny land of spires the ghosts of evening tune again their lyres and wander singing in a plaintive band down the long corridors of trees pale fires echo the night from tower top to tower Oh sleep that dreams and dream that never tires press from the petals of the lotus flower something of this to keep the essence of an hour No more to wait the twilight of the moon in this sequestered vale of star and spire for one eternal morning of desire passes to time and earthy afternoon Here Heraclitus did you find in fire and shifting things the prophecy you hurled down the dead years this midnight my desire will see shadowed among the embers furled in flame the splendor and the sadness of the world INTERLUDE May nineteen seventeen February nineteen nineteen A letter dated January nineteen eighteen written by Monsignor Darcy to Amory who is a second lieutenant in the one hundred and seventy first Infantry Port of Embarkation Camp Mills Long Island MY DEAR BOY All you need tell me of yourself is that you still are for the rest I merely search back in a restive memory a thermometer that records only fevers and match you with what I was at your age But men will chatter and you and I will still shout our futilities to each other across the stage until the last silly curtain falls plump upon our bobbing heads But you are starting the spluttering magic lantern show of life with much the same array of slides as I had so I need to write you if only to shriek the colossal stupidity of people This is the end of one thing for better or worse you will never again be quite the Amory Blaine that I knew never again will we meet as we have met because your generation is growing hard much harder than mine ever grew nourished as they were on the stuff of the nineties Amory lately I reread Aeschylus and there in the divine irony of the Agamemnon I find the only answer to this bitter age all the world tumbled about our ears and the closest parallel ages back in that hopeless resignation There are times when I think of the men out there as Roman legionaries miles from their corrupt city stemming back the hordes hordes a little more menacing after all than the corrupt city another blind blow at the race furies that we passed with ovations years ago over whose corpses we bleated triumphantly all through the Victorian era And afterward an out and out materialistic world and the Catholic Church I wonder where you ll fit in Of one thing I m sure Celtic you ll live and Celtic you ll die so if you don t use heaven as a continual referendum for your ideas you ll find earth a continual recall to your ambitions Amory I ve discovered suddenly that I m an old man Like all old men I ve had dreams sometimes and I m going to tell you of them I ve enjoyed imagining that you were my son that perhaps when I was young I went into a state of coma and begat you and when I came to had no recollection of it it s the paternal instinct Amory celibacy goes deeper than the flesh Sometimes I think that the explanation of our deep resemblance is some common ancestor and I find that the only blood that the Darcys and the O Haras have in common is that of the O Donahues Stephen was his name I think When the lightning strikes one of us it strikes both you had hardly arrived at the port of embarkation when I got my papers to start for Rome and I am waiting every moment to be told where to take ship Even before you get this letter I shall be on the ocean then will come your turn You went to war as a gentleman should just as you went to school and college because it was the thing to do It s better to leave the blustering and tremulo heroism to the middle classes they do it so much better Do you remember that week end last March when you brought Burne Holiday from Princeton to see me What a magnificent boy he is It gave me a frightful shock afterward when you wrote that he thought me splendid how could he be so deceived Splendid is the one thing that neither you nor I are We are many other things we re extraordinary we re clever we could be said I suppose to be brilliant We can attract people we can make atmosphere we can almost lose our Celtic souls in Celtic subtleties we can almost always have our own way but splendid rather not I am going to Rome with a wonderful dossier and letters of introduction that cover every capital in Europe and there will be no small stir when I get there How I wish you were with me This sounds like a rather cynical paragraph not at all the sort of thing that a middle aged clergyman should write to a youth about to depart for the war the only excuse is that the middle aged clergyman is talking to himself There are deep things in us and you know what they are as well as I do We have great faith though yours at present is uncrystallized we have a terrible honesty that all our sophistry cannot destroy and above all a childlike simplicity that keeps us from ever being really malicious I have written a keen for you which follows I am sorry your cheeks are not up to the description I have written of them but you will smoke and read all night At any rate here it is A Lament for a Foster Son and He going to the War Against the King of Foreign Ochone He is gone from me the son of my mind And he in his golden youth like Angus Oge Angus of the bright birds And his mind strong and subtle like the mind of Cuchulin on Muirtheme Awirra sthrue His brow is as white as the milk of the cows of Maeve And his cheeks like the cherries of the tree And it bending down to Mary and she feeding the Son of God Aveelia Vrone His hair is like the golden collar of the Kings at Tara And his eyes like the four gray seas of Erin And they swept with the mists of rain Mavrone go Gudyo He to be in the joyful and red battle Amongst the chieftains and they doing great deeds of valor His life to go from him It is the chords of my own soul would be loosed A Vich Deelish My heart is in the heart of my son And my life is in his life surely A man can be twice young In the life of his sons only Jia du Vaha Alanav May the Son of God be above him and beneath him before him and behind him May the King of the elements cast a mist over the eyes of the King of Foreign May the Queen of the Graces lead him by the hand the way he can go through the midst of his enemies and they not seeing him May Patrick of the Gael and Collumb of the Churches and the five thousand Saints of Erin be better than a shield to him And he got into the fight Och Ochone Amory Amory I feel somehow that this is all one or both of us is not going to last out this war I ve been trying to tell you how much this reincarnation of myself in you has meant in the last few years curiously alike we are curiously unlike Good by dear boy and God be with you THAYER DARCY EMBARKING AT NIGHT Amory moved forward on the deck until he found a stool under an electric light He searched in his pocket for note book and pencil and then began to write slowly laboriously We leave to night Silent we filled the still deserted street A column of dim gray And ghosts rose startled at the muffled beat Along the moonless way The shadowy shipyards echoed to the feet That turned from night and day And so we linger on the windless decks See on the spectre shore Shades of a thousand days poor gray ribbed wrecks Oh shall we then deplore Those futile years See how the sea is white The clouds have broken and the heavens burn To hollow highways paved with gravelled light The churning of the waves about the stern Rises to one voluminous nocturne We leave to night A letter from Amory headed Brest March eleventh nineteen nineteen to Lieutenant T P D Invilliers Camp Gordon Ga DEAR BAUDELAIRE We meet in Manhattan on the thirtieth of this very mo we then proceed to take a very sporty apartment you and I and Alec who is at me elbow as I write I don t know what I m going to do but I have a vague dream of going into politics Why is it that the pick of the young Englishmen from Oxford and Cambridge go into politics and in the U S A we leave it to the muckers raised in the ward educated in the assembly and sent to Congress fat paunched bundles of corruption devoid of both ideas and ideals as the debaters used to say Even forty years ago we had good men in politics but we we are brought up to pile up a million and show what we are made of Sometimes I wish I d been an Englishman American life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy Since poor Beatrice died I ll probably have a little money but very darn little I can forgive mother almost everything except the fact that in a sudden burst of religiosity toward the end she left half of what remained to be spent in stained glass windows and seminary endowments mister Barton my lawyer writes me that my thousands are mostly in street railways and that the said Street R R s are losing money because of the five cent fares Imagine a salary list that gives three hundred fifty dollars a month to a man that can t read and write yet I believe in it even though I ve seen what was once a sizable fortune melt away between speculation extravagance the democratic administration and the income tax modern that s me all over Mabel At any rate we ll have really knock out rooms you can get a job on some fashion magazine and Alec can go into the Zinc Company or whatever it is that his people own he s looking over my shoulder and he says it s a brass company but I don t think it matters much do you There s probably as much corruption in zinc made money as brass made money As for the well known Amory he would write immortal literature if he were sure enough about anything to risk telling any one else about it There is no more dangerous gift to posterity than a few cleverly turned platitudes Tom why don t you become a Catholic Of course to be a good one you d have to give up those violent intrigues you used to tell me about but you d write better poetry if you were linked up to tall golden candlesticks and long even chants and even if the American priests are rather burgeois as Beatrice used to say still you need only go to the sporty churches and I ll introduce you to Monsignor Darcy who really is a wonder Kerry s death was a blow so was Jesse s to a certain extent And I have a great curiosity to know what queer corner of the world has swallowed Burne Do you suppose he s in prison under some false name I confess that the war instead of making me orthodox which is the correct reaction has made me a passionate agnostic The Catholic Church has had its wings clipped so often lately that its part was timidly negligible and they haven t any good writers any more I m sick of Chesterton I ve only discovered one soldier who passed through the much advertised spiritual crisis like this fellow Donald Hankey and the one I knew was already studying for the ministry so he was ripe for it I honestly think that s all pretty much rot though it seemed to give sentimental comfort to those at home and may make fathers and mothers appreciate their children This crisis inspired religion is rather valueless and fleeting at best I think four men have discovered Paris to one that discovered God But us you and me and Alec oh we ll get a Jap butler and dress for dinner and have wine on the table and lead a contemplative emotionless life until we decide to use machine guns with the property owners or throw bombs with the Bolshevik God Tom I hope something happens I m restless as the devil and have a horror of getting fat or falling in love and growing domestic The place at Lake Geneva is now for rent but when I land I m going West to see mister Barton and get some details

Outside Yes CECELIA Very snappy ROSALIND Yes CECELIA I ve got it She sees herself in the mirror of the dressing table and commences to shimmy enthusiastically ROSALIND Outside What are you doing trying it on CECELIA ceases and goes out carrying the garment at the right shoulder From the other door enters ALEC CONNAGE He looks around quickly and in a huge voice shouts Mama There is a chorus of protest from next door and encouraged he starts toward it but is repelled by another chorus ALEC So that s where you all are Amory Blaine is here CECELIA Quickly Take him down stairs ALEC Oh he is down stairs missus CONNAGE Well you can show him where his room is Tell him I m sorry that I can t meet him now ALEC He s heard a lot about you all I wish you d hurry Father s telling him all about the war and he s restless He s sort of temperamental This last suffices to draw CECELIA into the room CECELIA Seating herself high upon lingerie How do you mean temperamental You used to say that about him in letters ALEC Oh he writes stuff CECELIA Does he play the piano ALEC Don t think so CECELIA Speculatively Drink ALEC Yes nothing queer about him CECELIA Money ALEC Good Lord ask him he used to have a lot and he s got some income now missus CONNAGE appears missus CONNAGE Alec of course we re glad to have any friend of yours ALEC You certainly ought to meet Amory missus CONNAGE Of course I want to But I think it s so childish of you to leave a perfectly good home to go and live with two other boys in some impossible apartment I hope it isn t in order that you can all drink as much as you want She pauses He ll be a little neglected to night This is Rosalind s week you see When a girl comes out she needs all the attention ROSALIND Outside Well then prove it by coming here and hooking me missus CONNAGE goes ALEC Rosalind hasn t changed a bit CECELIA In a lower tone She s awfully spoiled ALEC She ll meet her match to night CECELIA Who mister Amory Blaine ALEC nods CECELIA Well Rosalind has still to meet the man she can t outdistance Honestly Alec she treats men terribly She abuses them and cuts them and breaks dates with them and yawns in their faces and they come back for more ALEC They love it CECELIA They hate it She s a she s a sort of vampire I think and she can make girls do what she wants usually only she hates girls ALEC Personality runs in our family CECELIA Resignedly I guess it ran out before it got to me ALEC Does Rosalind behave herself CECELIA Not particularly well Oh she s average smokes sometimes drinks punch frequently kissed Oh yes common knowledge one of the effects of the war you know Emerges missus CONNAGE missus CONNAGE Rosalind s almost finished so I can go down and meet your friend ALEC and his mother go out ROSALIND Outside Oh mother CECELIA Mother s gone down And now ROSALIND enters ROSALIND is utterly ROSALIND She is one of those girls who need never make the slightest effort to have men fall in love with them Two types of men seldom do dull men are usually afraid of her cleverness and intellectual men are usually afraid of her beauty All others are hers by natural prerogative If ROSALIND could be spoiled the process would have been complete by this time and as a matter of fact her disposition is not all it should be she wants what she wants when she wants it and she is prone to make every one around her pretty miserable when she doesn t get it but in the true sense she is not spoiled Her fresh enthusiasm her will to grow and learn her endless faith in the inexhaustibility of romance her courage and fundamental honesty these things are not spoiled There are long periods when she cordially loathes her whole family She is quite unprincipled her philosophy is carpe diem for herself and laissez faire for others She loves shocking stories she has that coarse streak that usually goes with natures that are both fine and big She wants people to like her but if they do not it never worries her or changes her She is by no means a model character The education of all beautiful women is the knowledge of men ROSALIND had been disappointed in man after man as individuals but she had great faith in man as a sex Women she detested They represented qualities that she felt and despised in herself incipient meanness conceit cowardice and petty dishonesty She once told a roomful of her mother s friends that the only excuse for women was the necessity for a disturbing element among men She danced exceptionally well drew cleverly but hastily and had a startling facility with words which she used only in love letters But all criticism of ROSALIND ends in her beauty There was that shade of glorious yellow hair the desire to imitate which supports the dye industry There was the eternal kissable mouth small slightly sensual and utterly disturbing There were gray eyes and an unimpeachable skin with two spots of vanishing color She was slender and athletic without underdevelopment and it was a delight to watch her move about a room walk along a street swing a golf club or turn a cartwheel A last qualification her vivid instant personality escaped that conscious theatrical quality that AMORY had found in ISABELLE MONSIGNOR DARCY would have been quite up a tree whether to call her a personality or a personage She was perhaps the delicious inexpressible once in a century blend On the night of her debut she is for all her strange stray wisdom quite like a happy little girl Her mother s maid has just done her hair but she has decided impatiently that she can do a better job herself She is too nervous just now to stay in one place To that we owe her presence in this littered room She is going to speak ISABELLE S alto tones had been like a violin but if you could hear ROSALIND you would say her voice was musical as a waterfall ROSALIND Honestly there are only two costumes in the world that I really enjoy being in Combing her hair at the dressing table One s a hoop skirt with pantaloons the other s a one piece bathing suit I m quite charming in both of them CECELIA Glad you re coming out ROSALIND Yes aren t you CECELIA Cynically You re glad so you can get married and live on Long Island with the fast younger married set You want life to be a chain of flirtation with a man for every link ROSALIND Want it to be one You mean I ve found it one CECELIA Ha ROSALIND Cecelia darling you don t know what a trial it is to be like me I ve got to keep my face like steel in the street to keep men from winking at me If I laugh hard from a front row in the theatre the comedian plays to me for the rest of the evening If I drop my voice my eyes my handkerchief at a dance my partner calls me up on the phone every day for a week CECELIA It must be an awful strain ROSALIND The unfortunate part is that the only men who interest me at all are the totally ineligible ones Now if I were poor I d go on the stage CECELIA Yes you might as well get paid for the amount of acting you do ROSALIND Sometimes when I ve felt particularly radiant I ve thought why should this be wasted on one man CECELIA Often when you re particularly sulky I ve wondered why it should all be wasted on just one family Getting up I think I ll go down and meet mister Amory Blaine I like temperamental men ROSALIND There aren t any Men don t know how to be really angry or really happy and the ones that do go to pieces CECELIA Well I m glad I don t have all your worries I m engaged ROSALIND With a scornful smile Engaged Why you little lunatic If mother heard you talking like that she d send you off to boarding school where you belong CECELIA You won t tell her though because I know things I could tell and you re too selfish ROSALIND A little annoyed Run along little girl Who are you engaged to the iceman the man that keeps the candy store CECELIA Cheap wit good by darling I ll see you later ROSALIND Oh be sure and do that you re such a help Exit CECELIA ROSALIND finished her hair and rises humming She goes up to the mirror and starts to dance in front of it on the soft carpet She watches not her feet but her eyes never casually but always intently even when she smiles The door suddenly opens and then slams behind AMORY very cool and handsome as usual He melts into instant confusion HE Oh I m sorry I thought SHE Smiling radiantly Oh you re Amory Blaine aren t you HE Regarding her closely And you re Rosalind SHE I m going to call you Amory oh come in it s all right mother ll be right in under her breath unfortunately HE Gazing around This is sort of a new wrinkle for me SHE This is No Man s Land HE This is where you you pause SHE Yes all those things She crosses to the bureau See here s my rouge eye pencils HE I didn t know you were that way SHE What did you expect HE I thought you d be sort of sort of sexless you know swim and play golf SHE Oh I do but not in business hours HE Business SHE Six to two strictly HE I d like to have some stock in the corporation SHE Oh it s not a corporation it s just Rosalind Unlimited Fifty one shares name good will and everything goes at twenty five thousand dollars a year HE Disapprovingly Sort of a chilly proposition SHE Well Amory you don t mind do you When I meet a man that doesn t bore me to death after two weeks perhaps it ll be different HE Odd you have the same point of view on men that I have on women SHE I m not really feminine you know in my mind HE Interested Go on SHE No you you go on you ve made me talk about myself That s against the rules HE Rules SHE My own rules but you Oh Amory I hear you re brilliant The family expects so much of you HE How encouraging SHE Alec said you d taught him to think Did you I didn t believe any one could HE No I m really quite dull He evidently doesn t intend this to be taken seriously SHE Liar HE I m I m religious I m literary I ve I ve even written poems SHE Vers libre splendid She declaims The trees are green The birds are singing in the trees The girl sips her poison The bird flies away the girl dies HE Laughing No not that kind SHE Suddenly I like you HE Don t SHE Modest too HE I m afraid of you I m always afraid of a girl until I ve kissed her SHE Emphatically My dear boy the war is over HE So I ll always be afraid of you SHE Rather sadly I suppose you will A slight hesitation on both their parts HE After due consideration Listen This is a frightful thing to ask SHE Knowing what s coming After five minutes HE But will you kiss me Or are you afraid SHE I m never afraid but your reasons are so poor HE Rosalind I really want to kiss you SHE So do I They kiss definitely and thoroughly HE After a breathless second Well is your curiosity satisfied SHE Is yours HE No it s only aroused He looks it SHE Dreamily I ve kissed dozens of men I suppose I ll kiss dozens more HE Abstractedly Yes I suppose you could like that SHE Most people like the way I kiss HE Remembering himself Good Lord yes Kiss me once more Rosalind SHE No my curiosity is generally satisfied at one HE Discouraged Is that a rule SHE I make rules to fit the cases HE You and I are somewhat alike except that I m years older in experience SHE How old are you HE Almost twenty three You SHE Nineteen just HE I suppose you re the product of a fashionable school SHE No I m fairly raw material I was expelled from Spence I ve forgotten why HE What s your general trend SHE Oh I m bright quite selfish emotional when aroused fond of admiration HE Suddenly I don t want to fall in love with you SHE Raising her eyebrows Nobody asked you to HE Continuing coldly But I probably will I love your mouth SHE Hush Please don t fall in love with my mouth hair eyes shoulders slippers but not my mouth Everybody falls in love with my mouth HE It s quite beautiful SHE It s too small HE No it isn t let s see He kisses her again with the same thoroughness SHE Rather moved Say something sweet HE Frightened Lord help me SHE Drawing away Well don t if it s so hard HE Shall we pretend So soon SHE We haven t the same standards of time as other people HE Already it s other people SHE Let s pretend HE No I can t it s sentiment SHE You re not sentimental HE No I m romantic a sentimental person thinks things will last a romantic person hopes against hope that they won t Sentiment is emotional SHE And you re not With her eyes half closed You probably flatter yourself that that s a superior attitude HE Well Rosalind Rosalind don t argue kiss me again SHE Quite chilly now No I have no desire to kiss you HE Openly taken aback You wanted to kiss me a minute ago SHE This is now HE I d better go SHE I suppose so He goes toward the door SHE Oh He turns SHE Laughing Score Home Team One hundred Opponents Zero He starts back SHE Quickly Rain no game He goes out She goes quietly to the chiffonier takes out a cigarette case and hides it in the side drawer of a desk Her mother enters note book in hand missus CONNAGE Good I ve been wanting to speak to you alone before we go down stairs ROSALIND Heavens you frighten me missus CONNAGE Rosalind you ve been a very expensive proposition ROSALIND Resignedly Yes missus CONNAGE And you know your father hasn t what he once had ROSALIND Making a wry face Oh please don t talk about money missus CONNAGE You can t do anything without it This is our last year in this house and unless things change Cecelia won t have the advantages you ve had ROSALIND Impatiently Well what is it missus CONNAGE So I ask you to please mind me in several things I ve put down in my note book The first one is don t disappear with young men There may be a time when it s valuable but at present I want you on the dance floor where I can find you There are certain men I want to have you meet and I don t like finding you in some corner of the conservatory exchanging silliness with any one or listening to it ROSALIND Sarcastically Yes listening to it is better missus CONNAGE And don t waste a lot of time with the college set little boys nineteen and twenty years old I don t mind a prom or a football game but staying away from advantageous parties to eat in little cafes down town with Tom Dick and Harry ROSALIND Offering her code which is in its way quite as high as her mother s Mother it s done you can t run everything now the way you did in the early nineties missus CONNAGE Paying no attention There are several bachelor friends of your father s that I want you to meet to night youngish men ROSALIND Nodding wisely About forty five missus CONNAGE Sharply Why not ROSALIND Oh quite all right they know life and are so adorably tired looking shakes her head but they will dance missus CONNAGE I haven t met mister Blaine but I don t think you ll care for him He doesn t sound like a money maker ROSALIND Mother I never think about money missus CONNAGE You never keep it long enough to think about it ROSALIND Sighs Yes I suppose some day I ll marry a ton of it out of sheer boredom missus CONNAGE Referring to note book I had a wire from Hartford Dawson Ryder is coming up Now there s a young man I like and he s floating in money It seems to me that since you seem tired of Howard Gillespie you might give mister Ryder some encouragement This is the third time he s been up in a month ROSALIND How did you know I was tired of Howard Gillespie missus CONNAGE The poor boy looks so miserable every time he comes ROSALIND That was one of those romantic pre battle affairs They re all wrong missus CONNAGE Her say said At any rate make us proud of you to night ROSALIND Don t you think I m beautiful missus CONNAGE You know you are From down stairs is heard the moan of a violin being tuned the roll of a drum missus CONNAGE turns quickly to her daughter missus CONNAGE Come ROSALIND One minute Her mother leaves ROSALIND goes to the glass where she gazes at herself with great satisfaction She kisses her hand and touches her mirrored mouth with it Then she turns out the lights and leaves the room Silence for a moment A few chords from the piano the discreet patter of faint drums the rustle of new silk all blend on the staircase outside and drift in through the partly opened door Bundled figures pass in the lighted hall The laughter heard below becomes doubled and multiplied Then some one comes in closes the door and switches on the lights It is CECELIA She goes to the chiffonier looks in the drawers hesitates then to the desk whence she takes the cigarette case and extracts one She lights it and then puffing and blowing walks toward the mirror CECELIA In tremendously sophisticated accents Oh yes coming out is such a farce nowadays you know One really plays around so much before one is seventeen that it s positively anticlimax Shaking hands with a visionary middle aged nobleman Yes your grace I b lieve I ve heard my sister speak of you Have a puff they re very good They re they re Coronas You don t smoke What a pity The king doesn t allow it I suppose Yes I ll dance So she dances around the room to a tune from down stairs her arms outstretched to an imaginary partner the cigarette waving in her hand SEVERAL HOURS LATER The corner of a den down stairs filled by a very comfortable leather lounge A small light is on each side above and in the middle over the couch hangs a painting of a very old very dignified gentleman period eighteen sixty Outside the music is heard in a fox trot ROSALIND is seated on the lounge and on her left is HOWARD GILLESPIE a vapid youth of about twenty four He is obviously very unhappy and she is quite bored GILLESPIE Feebly What do you mean I ve changed I feel the same toward you ROSALIND But you don t look the same to me GILLESPIE Three weeks ago you used to say that you liked me because I was so blase so indifferent I still am ROSALIND But not about me I used to like you because you had brown eyes and thin legs GILLESPIE Helplessly They re still thin and brown You re a vampire that s all ROSALIND The only thing I know about vamping is what s on the piano score What confuses men is that I m perfectly natural I used to think you were never jealous Now you follow me with your eyes wherever I go GILLESPIE I love you ROSALIND Coldly I know it GILLESPIE And you haven t kissed me for two weeks I had an idea that after a girl was kissed she was was won ROSALIND Those days are over I have to be won all over again every time you see me GILLESPIE Are you serious ROSALIND About as usual There used to be two kinds of kisses First when girls were kissed and deserted second when they were engaged Now there s a third kind where the man is kissed and deserted If mister Jones of the nineties bragged he d kissed a girl every one knew he was through with her If mister Jones of nineteen nineteen brags the same every one knows it s because he can t kiss her any more Given a decent start any girl can beat a man nowadays GILLESPIE Then why do you play with men ROSALIND Leaning forward confidentially For that first moment when he s interested There is a moment Oh just before the first kiss a whispered word something that makes it worth while GILLESPIE And then ROSALIND Then after that you make him talk about himself Pretty soon he thinks of nothing but being alone with you he sulks he won t fight he doesn t want to play Victory Enter DAWSON RYDER twenty six handsome wealthy faithful to his own a bore perhaps but steady and sure of success RYDER I believe this is my dance Rosalind ROSALIND Well Dawson so you recognize me Now I know I haven t got too much paint on mister Ryder this is mister Gillespie They shake hands and GILLESPIE leaves tremendously downcast RYDER Your party is certainly a success ROSALIND Is it I haven t seen it lately I m weary Do you mind sitting out a minute RYDER Mind I m delighted You know I loathe this rushing idea See a girl yesterday to day to morrow ROSALIND Dawson RYDER What ROSALIND I wonder if you know you love me RYDER Startled What Oh you know you re remarkable ROSALIND Because you know I m an awful proposition Any one who marries me will have his hands full I m mean mighty mean RYDER Oh I wouldn t say that ROSALIND Oh yes I am especially to the people nearest to me She rises Come let s go I ve changed my mind and I want to dance Mother is probably having a fit Exeunt Enter ALEC and CECELIA CECELIA Just my luck to get my own

none	none	CECELIA Good heavens no with whom would I begin the next dance Sighs There s no color in a dance since the French officers went back ALEC Thoughtfully I don t want Amory to fall in love with Rosalind CECELIA Why I had an idea that that was just what you did want ALEC I did but since seeing these girls I don t know I m awfully attached to Amory He s sensitive and I don t want him to break his heart over somebody who doesn t care about him CECELIA He s very good looking ALEC Still thoughtfully She won t marry him but a girl doesn t have to marry a man to break his heart CECELIA What does it I wish I knew the secret ALEC Why you cold blooded little kitty It s lucky for some that the Lord gave you a pug nose Enter missus CONNAGE missus CONNAGE Where on earth is Rosalind ALEC Brilliantly Of course you ve come to the best people to find out She d naturally be with us missus CONNAGE Her father has marshalled eight bachelor millionaires to meet her ALEC You might form a squad and march through the halls missus CONNAGE I m perfectly serious for all I know she may be at the Cocoanut Grove with some football player on the night of her debut You look left and I ll ALEC Flippantly Hadn t you better send the butler through the cellar missus CONNAGE Perfectly serious Oh you don t think she d be there CECELIA He s only joking mother ALEC Mother had a picture of her tapping a keg of beer with some high hurdler missus CONNAGE Let s look right away They go out ROSALIND comes in with GILLESPIE GILLESPIE Rosalind Once more I ask you Don t you care a blessed thing about me AMORY walks in briskly AMORY My dance ROSALIND mister Gillespie this is mister Blaine GILLESPIE I ve met mister Blaine From Lake Geneva aren t you AMORY Yes GILLESPIE Desperately I ve been there It s in the the Middle West isn t it AMORY Spicily Approximately But I always felt that I d rather be provincial hot tamale than soup without seasoning GILLESPIE What AMORY Oh no offense GILLESPIE bows and leaves ROSALIND He s too much people AMORY I was in love with a people once ROSALIND So AMORY Oh yes her name was Isabelle nothing at all to her except what I read into her ROSALIND What happened AMORY Finally I convinced her that she was smarter than I was then she threw me over Said I was critical and impractical you know ROSALIND What do you mean impractical AMORY Oh drive a car but can t change a tire ROSALIND What are you going to do AMORY Can t say run for President write ROSALIND Greenwich Village AMORY Good heavens no I said write not drink ROSALIND I like business men Clever men are usually so homely AMORY I feel as if I d known you for ages ROSALIND Oh are you going to commence the pyramid story AMORY No I was going to make it French I was Louis XIV and you were one of my my Changing his tone Suppose we fell in love ROSALIND I ve suggested pretending AMORY If we did it would be very big ROSALIND Why AMORY Because selfish people are in a way terribly capable of great loves ROSALIND Turning her lips up Pretend Very deliberately they kiss AMORY I can t say sweet things But you are beautiful ROSALIND Not that AMORY What then ROSALIND Sadly Oh nothing only I want sentiment real sentiment and I never find it AMORY I never find anything else in the world and I loathe it ROSALIND It s so hard to find a male to gratify one s artistic taste Some one has opened a door and the music of a waltz surges into the room ROSALIND rises ROSALIND Listen they re playing Kiss Me Again He looks at her AMORY Well ROSALIND Well AMORY Softly the battle lost I love you ROSALIND I love you now They kiss AMORY Oh God what have I done ROSALIND Nothing Oh don t talk Kiss me again AMORY I don t know why or how but I love you from the moment I saw you ROSALIND Me too I I oh to night s to night Her brother strolls in starts and then in a loud voice says Oh excuse me and goes ROSALIND Her lips scarcely stirring Don t let me go I don t care who knows what I do AMORY Say it ROSALIND I love you now They part Oh I am very youthful thank God and rather beautiful thank God and happy thank God thank God She pauses and then in an odd burst of prophecy adds Poor Amory He kisses her again KISMET Within two weeks Amory and Rosalind were deeply and passionately in love The critical qualities which had spoiled for each of them a dozen romances were dulled by the great wave of emotion that washed over them It may be an insane love affair she told her anxious mother but it s not inane The wave swept Amory into an advertising agency early in March where he alternated between astonishing bursts of rather exceptional work and wild dreams of becoming suddenly rich and touring Italy with Rosalind They were together constantly for lunch for dinner and nearly every evening always in a sort of breathless hush as if they feared that any minute the spell would break and drop them out of this paradise of rose and flame But the spell became a trance seemed to increase from day to day they began to talk of marrying in July in June All life was transmitted into terms of their love all experience all desires all ambitions were nullified their senses of humor crawled into corners to sleep their former love affairs seemed faintly laughable and scarcely regretted juvenalia For the second time in his life Amory had had a complete bouleversement and was hurrying into line with his generation A LITTLE INTERLUDE Amory wandered slowly up the avenue and thought of the night as inevitably his the pageantry and carnival of rich dusk and dim streets it seemed that he had closed the book of fading harmonies at last and stepped into the sensuous vibrant walks of life Everywhere these countless lights this promise of a night of streets and singing he moved in a half dream through the crowd as if expecting to meet Rosalind hurrying toward him with eager feet from every corner How the unforgettable faces of dusk would blend to her the myriad footsteps a thousand overtures would blend to her footsteps and there would be more drunkenness than wine in the softness of her eyes on his Even his dreams now were faint violins drifting like summer sounds upon the summer air The room was in darkness except for the faint glow of Tom s cigarette where he lounged by the open window As the door shut behind him Amory stood a moment with his back against it Hello Benvenuto Blaine How went the advertising business to day Amory sprawled on a couch I loathed it as usual The momentary vision of the bustling agency was displaced quickly by another picture My God She s wonderful Tom sighed I can t tell you repeated Amory just how wonderful she is I don t want you to know I don t want any one to know Another sigh came from the window quite a resigned sigh She s life and hope and happiness my whole world now He felt the quiver of a tear on his eyelid Oh Golly Tom BITTER SWEET Sit like we do she whispered He sat in the big chair and held out his arms so that she could nestle inside them I knew you d come to night she said softly like summer just when I needed you most darling darling His lips moved lazily over her face You taste so good he sighed How do you mean lover Oh just sweet just sweet he held her closer Amory she whispered when you re ready for me I ll marry you We won t have much at first Don t she cried It hurts when you reproach yourself for what you can t give me I ve got your precious self and that s enough for me Tell me You know don t you Oh you know Yes but I want to hear you say it I love you Amory with all my heart Always will you All my life Oh Amory What I want to belong to you I want your people to be my people I want to have your babies But I haven t any people Don t laugh at me Amory Just kiss me I ll do what you want he said No I ll do what you want We re you not me Oh you re so much a part so much all of me He closed his eyes I m so happy that I m frightened Wouldn t it be awful if this was was the high point She looked at him dreamily Beauty and love pass I know Oh there s sadness too I suppose all great happiness is a little sad Beauty means the scent of roses and then the death of roses Beauty means the agony of sacrifice and the end of agony And Amory we re beautiful I know I m sure God loves us He loves you You re his most precious possession I m not his I m yours Amory I belong to you For the first time I regret all the other kisses now I know how much a kiss can mean Then they would smoke and he would tell her about his day at the office and where they might live Sometimes when he was particularly loquacious she went to sleep in his arms but he loved that Rosalind all Rosalinds as he had never in the world loved any one else Intangibly fleeting unrememberable hours AQUATIC INCIDENT One day Amory and Howard Gillespie meeting by accident down town took lunch together and Amory heard a story that delighted him Gillespie after several cocktails was in a talkative mood he began by telling Amory that he was sure Rosalind was slightly eccentric He had gone with her on a swimming party up in Westchester County and some one mentioned that Annette Kellerman had been there one day on a visit and had dived from the top of a rickety thirty foot summer house Immediately Rosalind insisted that Howard should climb up with her to see what it looked like A minute later as he sat and dangled his feet on the edge a form shot by him Rosalind her arms spread in a beautiful swan dive had sailed through the air into the clear water Of course I had to go after that and I nearly killed myself I thought I was pretty good to even try it Nobody else in the party tried it Well afterward Rosalind had the nerve to ask me why I stooped over when I dove It didn t make it any easier she said it just took all the courage out of it I ask you what can a man do with a girl like that Unnecessary I call it Gillespie failed to understand why Amory was smiling delightedly all through lunch He thought perhaps he was one of these hollow optimists FIVE WEEKS LATER Again the library of the Connage house ROSALIND is alone sitting on the lounge staring very moodily and unhappily at nothing She has changed perceptibly she is a trifle thinner for one thing the light in her eyes is not so bright she looks easily a year older Her mother comes in muffled in an opera cloak She takes in ROSALIND with a nervous glance missus CONNAGE Who is coming to night ROSALIND fails to hear her at least takes no notice missus CONNAGE Alec is coming up to take me to this Barrie play Et tu Brutus She perceives that she is talking to herself Rosalind I asked you who is coming to night ROSALIND Starting Oh what oh Amory missus CONNAGE Sarcastically You have so many admirers lately that I couldn t imagine which one ROSALIND doesn t answer Dawson Ryder is more patient than I thought he d be You haven t given him an evening this week ROSALIND With a very weary expression that is quite new to her face Mother please missus CONNAGE Oh I won t interfere You ve already wasted over two months on a theoretical genius who hasn t a penny to his name but go ahead waste your life on him I won t interfere ROSALIND As if repeating a tiresome lesson You know he has a little income and you know he s earning thirty five dollars a week in advertising missus CONNAGE And it wouldn t buy your clothes She pauses but ROSALIND makes no reply I have your best interests at heart when I tell you not to take a step you ll spend your days regretting It s not as if your father could help you Things have been hard for him lately and he s an old man You d be dependent absolutely on a dreamer a nice well born boy but a dreamer merely clever She implies that this quality in itself is rather vicious ROSALIND For heaven s sake mother A maid appears announces mister Blaine who follows immediately AMORY S friends have been telling him for ten days that he looks like the wrath of God and he does As a matter of fact he has not been able to eat a mouthful in the last thirty six hours AMORY Good evening missus Connage missus CONNAGE Not unkindly Good evening Amory AMORY and ROSALIND exchange glances and ALEC comes in ALEC S attitude throughout has been neutral He believes in his heart that the marriage would make AMORY mediocre and ROSALIND miserable but he feels a great sympathy for both of them ALEC Hi Amory AMORY Hi Alec Tom said he d meet you at the theatre ALEC Yeah just saw him How s the advertising to day Write some brilliant copy AMORY Oh it s about the same I got a raise Every one looks at him rather eagerly of two dollars a week General collapse missus CONNAGE Come Alec I hear the car A good night rather chilly in sections After missus CONNAGE and ALEC go out there is a pause ROSALIND still stares moodily at the fireplace AMORY goes to her and puts his arm around her AMORY Darling girl They kiss Another pause and then she seizes his hand covers it with kisses and holds it to her breast ROSALIND Sadly I love your hands more than anything I see them often when you re away from me so tired I know every line of them Dear hands Their eyes meet for a second and then she begins to cry a tearless sobbing AMORY Rosalind ROSALIND Oh we re so darned pitiful AMORY Rosalind ROSALIND Oh I want to die AMORY Rosalind another night of this and I ll go to pieces You ve been this way four days now You ve got to be more encouraging or I can t work or eat or sleep He looks around helplessly as if searching for new words to clothe an old shopworn phrase We ll have to make a start I like having to make a start together His forced hopefulness fades as he sees her unresponsive What s the matter He gets up suddenly and starts to pace the floor It s Dawson Ryder that s what it is He s been working on your nerves You ve been with him every afternoon for a week People come and tell me they ve seen you together and I have to smile and nod and pretend it hasn t the slightest significance for me And you won t tell me anything as it develops ROSALIND Amory if you don t sit down I ll scream AMORY Sitting down suddenly beside her Oh Lord ROSALIND Taking his hand gently You know I love you don t you AMORY Yes ROSALIND You know I ll always love you AMORY Don t talk that way you frighten me It sounds as if we weren t going to have each other She cries a little and rising from the couch goes to the armchair I ve felt all afternoon that things were worse I nearly went wild down at the office couldn t write a line Tell me everything ROSALIND There s nothing to tell I say I m just nervous AMORY Rosalind you re playing with the idea of marrying Dawson Ryder ROSALIND After a pause He s been asking me to all day AMORY Well he s got his nerve ROSALIND After another pause I like him AMORY Don t say that It hurts me ROSALIND Don t be a silly idiot You know you re the only man I ve ever loved ever will love AMORY Quickly Rosalind

ROSALIND I can t Amory I can t be shut away from the trees and flowers cooped up in a little flat waiting for you You d hate me in a narrow atmosphere I d make you hate me Again she is blinded by sudden uncontrolled tears AMORY Rosalind ROSALIND Oh darling go Don t make it harder I can t stand it AMORY His face drawn his voice strained Do you know what you re saying Do you mean forever There

girl I like sunshine and pretty things and cheerfulness and I dread responsibility I don t want to think about pots and kitchens and brooms I want to worry whether my legs will get slick and brown when I swim in the summer AMORY And you love me ROSALIND That s just why it has to end Drifting hurts too much We can t have any more scenes like this She draws his ring from her finger and hands it to him Their eyes blind again with tears AMORY His lips against her wet cheek Don t Keep it please oh don t break my heart She presses the ring softly into his hand ROSALIND Brokenly You d better go AMORY Good by She looks at him once more with infinite longing infinite sadness ROSALIND Don t ever forget me Amory AMORY Good by He goes to the door fumbles for the knob finds it she sees him throw back his head and he is gone Gone she half starts from the lounge and then sinks forward on her face into the pillows ROSALIND Oh God I want to die After a moment she rises and with her eyes closed feels her way to the door Then she turns and looks once more at the room Here they had sat and dreamed that tray she had so often filled with matches for him that shade that they had discreetly lowered one long Sunday afternoon Misty eyed she stands and remembers she speaks aloud Oh Amory what have I done to you And deep under the aching sadness that will pass in time Rosalind feels that she has lost something she knows not what she knows not why CHAPTER two Experiments in Convalescence The Knickerbocker Bar beamed upon by Maxfield Parrish s jovial colorful Old King Cole was well crowded Amory stopped in the entrance and looked at his wrist watch he wanted particularly to know the time for something in his mind that catalogued and classified liked to chip things off cleanly Later it would satisfy him in a vague way to be able to think that thing ended at exactly twenty minutes after eight on Thursday June ten nineteen nineteen This was allowing for the walk from her house a walk concerning which he had afterward not the faintest recollection He was in rather grotesque condition two days of worry and nervousness of sleepless nights of untouched meals culminating in the emotional crisis and Rosalind s abrupt decision the strain of it had drugged the foreground of his mind into a merciful coma As he fumbled clumsily with the olives at the free lunch table a man approached and spoke to him and the olives dropped from his nervous hands Well Amory It was some one he had known at Princeton he had no idea of the name Hello old boy he heard himself saying Name s Jim Wilson you ve forgotten Sure you bet Jim I remember Going to reunion You know Simultaneously he realized that he was not going to reunion Get overseas Amory nodded his eyes staring oddly Stepping back to let some one pass he knocked the dish of olives to a crash on the floor Too bad he muttered Have a drink Wilson ponderously diplomatic reached over and slapped him on the back You ve had plenty old boy Amory eyed him dumbly until Wilson grew embarrassed under the scrutiny Plenty hell said Amory finally I haven t had a drink to day Wilson looked incredulous Have a drink or not cried Amory rudely Together they sought the bar Rye high I ll just take a Bronx Wilson had another Amory had several more They decided to sit down At ten o clock Wilson was displaced by Carling class of fifteen Amory his head spinning gorgeously layer upon layer of soft satisfaction setting over the bruised spots of his spirit was discoursing volubly on the war S a mental was e he insisted with owl like wisdom Two years my life spent inalleshual vacuity Los idealism got be physcal anmal he shook his fist expressively at Old King Cole got be Prussian bout ev thing women specially Use be straight bout women college Now don givadam He expressed his lack of principle by sweeping a seltzer bottle with a broad gesture to noisy extinction on the floor but this did not interrupt his speech Seek pleasure where find it for to morrow die At s philos phy for me now on Carling yawned but Amory waxing brilliant continued Use wonder bout things people satisfied compromise fif y fif y att tude on life Now don wonder don wonder He became so emphatic in impressing on Carling the fact that he didn t wonder that he lost the thread of his discourse and concluded by announcing to the bar at large that he was a physcal anmal What are you celebrating Amory Amory leaned forward confidentially Cel brating blowmylife Great moment blow my life Can t tell you bout it He heard Carling addressing a remark to the bartender Give him a bromo seltzer Amory shook his head indignantly None that stuff But listen Amory you re making yourself sick You re white as a ghost Amory considered the question He tried to look at himself in the mirror but even by squinting up one eye could only see as far as the row of bottles behind the bar Like som n solid We go get some some salad He settled his coat with an attempt at nonchalance but letting go of the bar was too much for him and he slumped against a chair We ll go over to Shanley s suggested Carling offering an elbow With this assistance Amory managed to get his legs in motion enough to propel him across Forty second Street Shanley s was very dim He was conscious that he was talking in a loud voice very succinctly and convincingly he thought about a desire to crush people under his heel He consumed three club sandwiches devouring each as though it were no larger than a chocolate drop Then Rosalind began popping into his mind again and he found his lips forming her name over and over Next he was sleepy and he had a hazy listless sense of people in dress suits probably waiters gathering around the table He was in a room and Carling was saying something about a knot in his shoe lace Nemmine he managed to articulate drowsily Sleep in em STILL ALCOHOLIC He awoke laughing and his eyes lazily roamed his surroundings evidently a bedroom and bath in a good hotel His head was whirring and picture after picture was forming and blurring and melting before his eyes but beyond the desire to laugh he had no entirely conscious reaction He reached for the phone beside his bed Hello what hotel is this Knickerbocker All right send up two rye high balls He lay for a moment and wondered idly whether they d send up a bottle or just two of those little glass containers Then with an effort he struggled out of bed and ambled into the bathroom When he emerged rubbing himself lazily with a towel he found the bar boy with the drinks and had a sudden desire to kid him On reflection he decided that this would be undignified so he waved him away As the new alcohol tumbled into his stomach and warmed him the isolated pictures began slowly to form a cinema reel of the day before Again he saw Rosalind curled weeping among the pillows again he felt her tears against his cheek Her words began ringing in his ears Don t ever forget me Amory don t ever forget me Hell he faltered aloud and then he choked and collapsed on the bed in a shaken spasm of grief After a minute he opened his eyes and regarded the ceiling Damned fool he exclaimed in disgust and with a voluminous sigh rose and approached the bottle After another glass he gave way loosely to the luxury of tears Purposely he called up into his mind little incidents of the vanished spring phrased to himself emotions that would make him react even more strongly to sorrow We were so happy he intoned dramatically so very happy Then he gave way again and knelt beside the bed his head half buried in the pillow My own girl my own Oh He clinched his teeth so that the tears streamed in a flood from his eyes Oh my baby girl all I had all I wanted Oh my girl come back come back I need you need you we re so pitiful just misery we brought each other She ll be shut away from me I can t see her I can t be her friend It s got to be that way it s got to be And then again We ve been so happy so very happy He rose to his feet and threw himself on the bed in an ecstasy of sentiment and then lay exhausted while he realized slowly that he had been very drunk the night before and that his head was spinning again wildly He laughed rose and crossed again to Lethe At noon he ran into a crowd in the Biltmore bar and the riot began again He had a vague recollection afterward of discussing French poetry with a British officer who was introduced to him as Captain Corn of his Majesty s Foot and he remembered attempting to recite Clair de Lune at luncheon then he slept in a big soft chair until almost five o clock when another crowd found and woke him there followed an alcoholic dressing of several temperaments for the ordeal of dinner They selected theatre tickets at Tyson s for a play that had a four drink programme a play with two monotonous voices with turbid gloomy scenes and lighting effects that were hard to follow when his eyes behaved so amazingly He imagined afterward that it must have been The Jest Then the Cocoanut Grove where Amory slept again on a little balcony outside Out in Shanley s Yonkers he became almost logical and by a careful control of the number of high balls he drank grew quite lucid and garrulous He found that the party consisted of five men two of whom he knew slightly he became righteous about paying his share of the expense and insisted in a loud voice on arranging everything then and there to the amusement of the tables around him Some one mentioned that a famous cabaret star was at the next table so Amory rose and approaching gallantly introduced himself this involved him in an argument first with her escort and then with the headwaiter Amory s attitude being a lofty and exaggerated courtesy he consented after being confronted with irrefutable logic to being led back to his own table Decided to commit suicide he announced suddenly When Next year Now To morrow morning Going to take a room at the Commodore get into a hot bath and open a vein He s getting morbid You need another rye old boy We ll all talk it over to morrow But Amory was not to be dissuaded from argument at least Did you ever get that way he demanded confidentially fortaccio Sure Often My chronic state This provoked discussion One man said that he got so depressed sometimes that he seriously considered it Another agreed that there was nothing to live for Captain Corn who had somehow rejoined the party said that in his opinion it was when one s health was bad that one felt that way most Amory s suggestion was that they should each order a Bronx mix broken glass in it and drink it off To his relief no one applauded the idea so having finished his high ball he balanced his chin in his hand and his elbow on the table a most delicate scarcely noticeable sleeping position he assured himself and went into a deep stupor He was awakened by a woman clinging to him a pretty woman with brown disarranged hair and dark blue eyes Take me home she cried Hello said Amory blinking I like you she announced tenderly I like you too He noticed that there was a noisy man in the background and that one of his party was arguing with him Fella I was with s a damn fool confided the blue eyed woman I hate him I want to go home with you You drunk queried Amory with intense wisdom She nodded coyly Go home with him he advised gravely He brought you At this point the noisy man in the background broke away from his detainers and approached Say he said fiercely I brought this girl out here and you re butting in Amory regarded him coldly while the girl clung to him closer You let go that girl cried the noisy man Amory tried to make his eyes threatening You go to hell he directed finally and turned his attention to the girl Love first sight he suggested I love you she breathed and nestled close to him She did have beautiful eyes Some one leaned over and spoke in Amory s ear That s just Margaret Diamond She s drunk and this fellow here brought her Better let her go Let him take care of her then shouted Amory furiously I m no W Y C A worker am I am I Let her go It s her hanging on damn it Let her hang The crowd around the table thickened For an instant a brawl threatened but a sleek waiter bent back Margaret Diamond s fingers until she released her hold on Amory whereupon she slapped the waiter furiously in the face and flung her arms about her raging original escort Oh Lord cried Amory Let s go Come on the taxis are getting scarce Check waiter C mon Amory Your romance is over Amory laughed You don t know how true you spoke No idea At s the whole trouble AMORY ON THE LABOR QUESTION Two mornings later he knocked at the president s door at Bascome and Barlow s advertising agency Come in Amory entered unsteadily Morning mister Barlow mister Barlow brought his glasses to the inspection and set his mouth slightly ajar that he might better listen Well mister Blaine We haven t seen you for several days No said Amory I m quitting Well well this is I don t like it here I m sorry I thought our relations had been quite ah pleasant You seemed to be a hard worker a little inclined perhaps to write fancy copy I just got tired of it interrupted Amory rudely It didn t matter a damn to me whether Harebell s flour was any better than any one else s In fact I never ate any of it So I got tired of telling people about it oh I know I ve been drinking mister Barlow s face steeled by several ingots of expression You asked for a position Amory waved him to silence And I think I was rottenly underpaid Thirty five dollars a week less than a good carpenter You had just started You d never worked before said mister Barlow coolly But it took about ten thousand dollars to educate me where I could write your darned stuff for you Anyway as far as length of service goes you ve got stenographers here you ve paid fifteen a week for five years I m not going to argue with you sir said mister Barlow rising Neither am I I just wanted to tell you I m quitting They stood for a moment looking at each other impassively and then Amory turned and left the office A LITTLE LULL Four days after that he returned at last to the apartment Tom was engaged on a book review for The New Democracy on the staff of which he was employed They regarded each other for a moment in silence Well Well Good Lord Amory where d you get the black eye and the jaw Amory laughed That s a mere nothing He peeled off his coat and bared his shoulders Look here Tom emitted a low whistle What hit you Amory laughed again Oh a lot of people I got beaten up Fact He slowly replaced his shirt It was bound to come sooner or later and I wouldn t have missed it for anything Who was it Well there were some waiters and a couple of sailors and a few stray pedestrians I guess It s the strangest feeling You ought to get beaten up just for the experience of it You fall down after a while and everybody sort of slashes in at you before you hit the ground then they kick you Tom lighted a cigarette I spent a day chasing you all over town Amory But you always kept a little ahead of me I d say you ve been on some party Amory tumbled into a chair and asked for a cigarette You sober now asked Tom quizzically Pretty sober Why Well Alec has left His family had been after him to go home and live so he A spasm of pain shook Amory Too bad Yes it is too bad We ll have to get some one else if we re going to stay here The rent s going up Sure Get anybody I ll leave it to you Tom Amory walked into his bedroom The first thing that met his glance was a photograph of Rosalind that he had intended to have framed propped up against a mirror on his dresser He looked at it unmoved After the vivid mental pictures of her that were his portion at present the portrait was curiously unreal He went back into the study Got a cardboard box No answered Tom puzzled Why should I have Oh yes there may be one in Alec s room Eventually Amory found what he was looking for and returning to his dresser opened a drawer full of letters notes part of a chain two little handkerchiefs and some snap shots As he transferred them carefully to the box his mind wandered to some place in a book where the hero after preserving for a year a cake of his lost love s soap finally washed his hands with it He laughed and began to hum After you ve gone ceased abruptly The string broke twice and then he managed to secure it dropped the package into the bottom of his trunk and having slammed the lid returned to the study Going out Tom s voice held an undertone of anxiety Uh huh Where Couldn t say old keed Let s have dinner together Sorry I told Sukey Brett I d eat with him Oh By by Amory crossed the street and had a high ball then he walked to Washington Square and found a top seat on a bus He disembarked at Forty third Street and strolled to the Biltmore bar Hi Amory What ll you have Yo ho Waiter TEMPERATURE NORMAL The advent of prohibition with the thirsty first put a sudden stop to the submerging of Amory s sorrows and when he awoke one morning to find that the old bar to bar days were over he had neither remorse for the past three weeks nor regret that their repetition was impossible He had taken the most violent if the weakest method to shield himself from the stabs of memory and while it was not a course he would have prescribed for others he found in the end that it had done its business he was over the first flush of pain Don t misunderstand Amory had loved Rosalind as he would never love another living person She had taken the first flush of his youth and brought from his unplumbed depths tenderness that had surprised him gentleness and unselfishness that he had never given to another creature He had later love affairs but of a different sort in those he went back to that perhaps more typical frame of mind in which the girl became the mirror of a mood in him Rosalind had drawn out what was more than passionate admiration he had a deep undying affection for Rosalind But there had been near the end so much dramatic tragedy culminating in the arabesque nightmare of his three weeks spree that he was emotionally worn out The people and surroundings that he remembered as being cool or delicately artificial seemed to promise him a refuge He wrote a cynical story which featured his father s funeral and despatched it to a magazine receiving in return a check for sixty dollars and a request for more of the same tone This tickled his vanity but inspired him to no further effort He read enormously He was puzzled and depressed by A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man intensely interested by Joan and Peter and The Undying Fire and rather surprised by his discovery through a critic named Mencken of several excellent American novels Vandover and the Brute The Damnation of Theron Ware and Jennie Gerhardt Mackenzie Chesterton Galsworthy Bennett had sunk in his appreciation from sagacious life saturated geniuses to merely diverting contemporaries Shaw s aloof clarity and brilliant consistency and the gloriously intoxicated efforts of H G Wells to fit the key of romantic symmetry into the elusive lock of truth alone won his rapt attention He wanted to see Monsignor Darcy to whom he had written when he landed but he had not heard from him besides he knew that a visit to Monsignor would entail the story of Rosalind and the thought of repeating it turned him cold with horror In his search for cool people he remembered missus Lawrence a very intelligent very dignified lady a convert to the church and a great devotee of Monsignor s He called her on the phone one day Yes she remembered him perfectly no Monsignor wasn t in town was in Boston she thought he d promised to come to dinner when he returned Couldn t Amory take luncheon with her I thought I d better catch up missus Lawrence he said rather ambiguously when he arrived Monsignor was here just last week said missus Lawrence regretfully He was very anxious to see you but he d left your address at home Did he think I d plunged into Bolshevism asked Amory interested Oh he s having a frightful time Why About the Irish Republic He thinks it lacks dignity So He went to Boston when the Irish President arrived and he was greatly distressed because the receiving committee when they rode in an automobile would put their arms around the President I don t blame him Well what impressed you more than anything while you were in the army You look a great deal older That s from another more disastrous battle he answered smiling in spite of himself But the army let me see well I discovered that physical courage depends to a great extent on the physical shape a man is in I found that I was as brave as the next man it used to worry me before What else Well the idea that men can stand anything if they get used to it and the fact that I got a high mark in the psychological examination missus Lawrence laughed Amory was finding it a great relief to be in this cool house on Riverside Drive away from more condensed New York and the sense of people expelling great quantities of breath into a little space missus Lawrence reminded him vaguely of Beatrice not in temperament but in her perfect grace and dignity The house its furnishings the manner in which dinner was served were in immense contrast to what he had met in the great places on Long Island where the servants were so obtrusive that they had positively to be bumped out of the way or even in the houses of more conservative Union Club families He wondered if this air of symmetrical restraint this grace which he felt was continental was distilled through missus Lawrence s New England ancestry or acquired in long residence in Italy and Spain Two glasses of sauterne at luncheon loosened his tongue and he talked with what he felt was something of his old charm of religion and literature and the menacing phenomena of the social order missus Lawrence was ostensibly pleased with him and her interest was especially in his mind he wanted people to like his mind again after a while it might be such a nice place in which to live Monsignor Darcy still thinks that you re his reincarnation that your faith will eventually clarify Perhaps he assented I m rather pagan at present It s just that religion doesn t seem to have the slightest bearing on life at my age When he left her house he walked down Riverside Drive with a feeling of satisfaction It was amusing to discuss again such subjects as this young poet Stephen Vincent Benet or the Irish Republic Between the rancid accusations of Edward Carson and Justice Cohalan he had completely tired of the Irish question yet there had been a time when his own Celtic traits were pillars of his personal philosophy There seemed suddenly to be much left in life if only this revival of old interests did not mean that he was backing away from it again backing away from life itself RESTLESSNESS I m tres old and tres bored Tom said Amory one day stretching himself at ease in the comfortable window seat He always felt most natural in a recumbent position You used to be entertaining before you started to write he continued Now you save any idea that you think would do to print Existence had settled back to an ambitionless normality They had decided that with economy they could still afford the apartment which Tom with the domesticity of an elderly cat had grown fond of The old English hunting prints on the wall were Tom s and the large tapestry by courtesy a relic of decadent days in college and the great profusion of orphaned candlesticks and the carved Louis XV chair in which no one could sit more than a minute without acute spinal disorders Tom claimed that this was because one was sitting in the lap of Montespan s wraith at any rate it was Tom s furniture that decided them to stay They went out very little to an occasional play or to dinner at the Ritz or the Princeton Club With prohibition the great rendezvous had received their death wounds no longer could one wander to the Biltmore bar at twelve or five and find congenial spirits and both Tom and Amory had outgrown the passion for dancing with mid Western or New Jersey debbies at the Club de Vingt surnamed the Club de Gink or the Plaza Rose Room besides even that required several cocktails to come down to the intellectual level of the women present as Amory had once put it to a horrified matron Amory had lately received several alarming letters from mister Barton the Lake Geneva house was too large to be easily rented the best rent obtainable at present would serve this year to little more than pay for the taxes and necessary improvements in fact the lawyer suggested that the whole property was simply a white elephant on Amory s hands Nevertheless even though it might not yield a cent for the next three years Amory decided with a vague sentimentality that for the present at any rate he would not sell the house This particular day on which he announced his ennui to Tom had been quite typical He had risen at noon lunched with missus Lawrence and then ridden abstractedly homeward atop one of his beloved buses Why shouldn t you be bored yawned Tom Isn t that the conventional frame of mind for the young man of your age and condition Yes said Amory speculatively but I m more than bored I am restless Love and war did for you Well Amory considered I m not sure that the war itself had any great effect on either you or me but it certainly ruined the old backgrounds sort of killed individualism out of our generation Tom looked up in surprise Yes it did insisted Amory I m not sure it didn t kill it out of the whole world Oh Lord what a pleasure it used to be to dream I might be a really great dictator or writer or religious or political leader and now even a Leonardo da Vinci or Lorenzo de Medici couldn t be a real old fashioned bolt in the world Life is too huge and complex The world is so overgrown that it can t lift its own fingers and I was planning to be such an important finger I don t agree with you Tom interrupted There never were men placed in such egotistic positions since oh since the French Revolution Amory disagreed violently You re mistaking this period when every nut is an individualist for a period of individualism Wilson has only been powerful when he has represented he s had to compromise over and over again Just as soon as Trotsky and Lenin take a definite consistent stand they ll become merely two minute figures like Kerensky Even Foch hasn t half the significance of Stonewall Jackson War used to be the most individualistic pursuit of man and yet the popular heroes of the war had neither authority nor responsibility Guynemer and Sergeant York How could a schoolboy make a hero of Pershing A big man has no time really to do anything but just sit and be big Then you don t think there will be any more permanent world heroes Yes in history not in life Carlyle would have difficulty getting material for a new chapter on The Hero as a Big Man Go on I m a good listener to day People try so hard to believe in leaders now pitifully hard But we no sooner get a popular reformer or politician or soldier or writer or philosopher a Roosevelt a Tolstoi a Wood a Shaw a Nietzsche than the cross currents of criticism wash him away My Lord no man can stand prominence these days It s the surest path to obscurity People get sick of hearing the same name over and over Then you blame it on the press Absolutely Look at you you re on The New Democracy considered the most brilliant weekly in the country read by the men who do things and all that What s your business Why to be as clever as interesting and as brilliantly cynical as possible about every man doctrine book or policy that is assigned you to deal with The more strong lights the more spiritual scandal you can throw on the matter the more money they pay you the more the people buy the issue You Tom d Invilliers a blighted Shelley changing shifting clever unscrupulous represent the critical consciousness of the race Oh don t protest I know the stuff I used to write book reviews in college I considered it rare sport to refer to the latest honest conscientious effort to propound a theory or a remedy as a welcome addition to our light summer reading Come on now admit it Tom laughed and Amory continued triumphantly We want to believe Young students try to believe in older authors constituents try to believe in their Congressmen countries try to believe in their statesmen but they can t Too many voices too much scattered illogical ill considered criticism It s worse in the case of newspapers Any rich unprogressive old party with that particularly grasping acquisitive form of mentality known as financial genius can own a paper that is the intellectual meat and drink of thousands of tired hurried men men too involved in the business of modern living to swallow anything but predigested food For two cents the voter buys his politics prejudices and philosophy A year later there is a new political ring or a change in the paper s ownership consequence more confusion more contradiction a sudden inrush of new ideas their tempering their distillation the reaction against them He paused only to get his breath And that is why I have sworn not to put pen to paper until my ideas either clarify or depart entirely I have quite enough sins on my soul without putting dangerous shallow epigrams into people s heads I might cause a poor inoffensive capitalist to have a vulgar liaison with a bomb or get some innocent little Bolshevik tangled up with a machine gun bullet Tom was growing restless under this lampooning of his connection with The New Democracy What s all this got to do with your being bored Amory considered that it had much to do with it How ll I fit in he demanded What am I for To propagate the race According to the American novels we are led to believe that the healthy American boy from nineteen to twenty five is an entirely sexless animal As a matter of fact the healthier he is the less that s true The only alternative to letting it get you is some violent interest Well the war is over I believe too much in the responsibilities of authorship to write just now and business well business speaks for itself It has no connection with anything in the world that I ve ever been interested in except a slim utilitarian connection with economics What I d see of it lost in a clerkship for the next and best ten years of my life would have the intellectual content of an industrial movie Try fiction suggested Tom Trouble is I get distracted when I start to write stories get afraid I m doing it instead of living get thinking maybe life is waiting for me in the Japanese gardens at the Ritz or at Atlantic City or on the lower East Side Anyway he continued I haven t the vital urge I wanted to be a regular human being but the girl couldn t see it that way You ll find another God Banish the thought Why don t you tell me that if the girl had been worth having she d have waited for you No sir the girl really worth having won t wait for anybody If I thought there d be another I d lose my remaining faith in human nature Maybe I ll play but Rosalind was the only girl in the wide world that could have held me Well yawned Tom I ve played confidant a good hour by the clock Still I m glad to see you re beginning to have violent views again on something I am agreed Amory reluctantly Yet when I see a happy family it makes me sick at my stomach Happy families try to make people feel that way said Tom cynically TOM THE CENSOR There were days when Amory listened These were when Tom wreathed in smoke indulged in the slaughter of American literature Words failed him Fifty thousand dollars a year he would cry My God Look at them look at them Edna Ferber Gouverneur Morris Fanny Hurst Mary Roberts Rinehart not producing among em one story or novel that will last ten years This man Cobb I don t tink he s either clever or amusing and what s more I don t think very many people do except the editors He s just groggy with advertising And oh Harold Bell Wright oh Zane Grey They try No they don t even try Some of them can write but they won t sit down and do one honest novel Most of them can t write I ll admit I believe Rupert Hughes tries to give a real comprehensive picture of American life but his style and perspective are barbarous Ernest Poole and Dorothy Canfield try but they re hindered by their absolute lack of any sense of humor but at least they crowd their work instead of spreading it thin Every author ought to write every book as if he were going to be beheaded the day he finished it Is that double entente Don t slow me up Now there s a few of em that seem to have some cultural background some intelligence and a good deal of literary felicity but they just simply won t write honestly they d all claim there was no public for good stuff Then why the devil is it that Wells Conrad Galsworthy Shaw Bennett and the rest depend on America for over half their sales How does little Tommy like the poets Tom was overcome He dropped his arms until they swung loosely beside the chair and emitted faint grunts I m writing a satire on em now calling it Boston Bards and Hearst Reviewers Let s hear it said Amory eagerly I ve only got the last few lines done That s very modern Let s hear em if they re funny Tom produced a folded paper from his pocket and read aloud pausing at intervals so that Amory could see that it was free verse So Walter Arensberg Alfred Kreymborg Carl Sandburg Louis Untermeyer Eunice Tietjens Clara Shanafelt James Oppenheim Maxwell Bodenheim Richard Glaenzer Scharmel Iris Conrad Aiken I place your names here So that you may live If only as names Sinuous mauve colored names In the Juvenalia Of my collected editions Amory roared You win the iron pansy I ll buy you a meal on the arrogance of the last two lines Amory did not entirely agree with Tom s sweeping damnation of American novelists and poets He enjoyed both Vachel Lindsay and Booth Tarkington and admired the conscientious if slender artistry of Edgar Lee Masters What I hate is this idiotic drivel about I am God I am man I ride the winds I look through the smoke I am the life sense It s ghastly And I wish American novelists would give up trying to make business romantically interesting Nobody wants to read about it unless it s crooked business If it was an entertaining subject they d buy the life of James J Hill and not one of these long office tragedies that harp along on the significance of smoke And gloom said Tom That s another favorite though I ll admit the Russians have the monopoly Our specialty is stories about little girls who break their spines and get adopted by grouchy old men because they smile so much You d think we were a race of cheerful cripples and that the common end of the Russian peasant was suicide Six o clock said Amory glancing at his wrist watch I ll buy you a grea big dinner on the strength of the Juvenalia of your collected editions LOOKING BACKWARD July sweltered out with a last hot week and Amory in another surge of unrest realized that it was just five months since he and Rosalind had met Yet it was already hard for him to visualize the heart whole boy who had stepped off the transport passionately desiring the adventure of life One night while the heat overpowering and enervating poured into the windows of his room he struggled for several hours in a vague effort to immortalize the poignancy of that time The February streets wind washed by night blow full of strange half intermittent damps bearing on wasted walks in shining sight wet snow plashed into gleams under the lamps like golden oil from some divine machine in an hour of thaw and stars Strange damps full of the eyes of many men crowded with life borne in upon a lull Oh I was young for I could turn again to you most finite and most beautiful and taste the stuff of half remembered dreams sweet and new on your mouth There was a tanging in the midnight air silence was dead and sound not yet awoken Life cracked like ice one brilliant note and there radiant and pale you stood and spring had broken The icicles were short upon the roofs and the changeling city swooned Our thoughts were frosty mist along the eaves our two ghosts kissed high on the long mazed wires eerie half laughter echoes here and leaves only a fatuous sigh for young desires regret has followed after things she loved leaving the great husk ANOTHER ENDING In mid August came a letter from Monsignor Darcy who had evidently just stumbled on his address MY DEAR BOY Your last letter was quite enough to make me worry about you It was not a bit like yourself Reading between the lines I should imagine that your engagement to this girl is making you rather unhappy and I see you have lost all the feeling of romance that you had before the war You make a great mistake if you think you can be romantic without religion Sometimes I think that with both of us the secret of success when we find it is the mystical element in us something flows into us that enlarges our personalities and when it ebbs out our personalities shrink I should call your last two letters rather shrivelled Beware of losing yourself in the personality of another being man or woman His Eminence Cardinal O Neill and the Bishop of Boston are staying with me at present so it is hard for me to get a moment to write but I wish you would come up here later if only for a week end I go to Washington this week What I shall do in the future is hanging in the balance Absolutely between ourselves I should not be surprised to see the red hat of a cardinal descend upon my unworthy head within the next eight months In any event I should like to have a house in New York or Washington where you could drop in for week ends Amory I m very glad we re both alive this war could easily have been the end of a brilliant family But in regard to matrimony you are now at the most dangerous period of your life You might marry in haste and repent at leisure but I think you won t From what you write me about the present calamitous state of your finances what you want is naturally impossible However if I judge you by the means I usually choose I should say that there will be something of an emotional crisis within the next year Do write me I feel annoyingly out of date on you With greatest affection THAYER DARCY Within a week after the receipt of this letter their little household fell precipitously to pieces The immediate cause was the serious and probably chronic illness of Tom s mother So they stored the furniture gave instructions to sublet and shook hands gloomily in the Pennsylvania Station Amory and Tom seemed always to be saying good by Feeling very much alone Amory yielded to an impulse and set off southward intending to join Monsignor in Washington They missed connections by two hours and deciding to spend a few days with an ancient remembered uncle Amory journeyed up through the luxuriant fields of Maryland into Ramilly County But instead of two days his stay lasted from mid August nearly through September for in Maryland he met Eleanor CHAPTER three Young Irony For years afterward when Amory thought of Eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart The night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore and when he lost it he lost also the power of regretting it Eleanor was say the last time that evil crept close to Amory under the mask of beauty the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes With her his imagination ran riot and that is why they rode to the highest hill and watched an evil moon ride high for they knew then that they could see the devil in each other But Eleanor did Amory dream her Afterward their ghosts played yet both of them hoped from their souls never to meet Was it the infinite sadness of her eyes that drew him or the mirror of himself that he found in the gorgeous clarity of her mind She will have no other adventure like Amory and if she reads this she will say And Amory will have no other adventure like me Nor will she sigh any more than he would sigh Eleanor tried to put it on paper once The fading things we only know We ll have forgotten Put away Desires that melted with the snow And dreams begotten This to day The sudden dawns we laughed to greet That all could see that none could share Will be but dawns and if we meet We shall not care Dear not one tear will rise for this A little while hence No regret Will stir for a remembered kiss Not even silence When we ve met Will give old ghosts a waste to roam Or stir the surface of the sea If gray shapes drift beneath the foam We shall not see They quarrelled dangerously because Amory maintained that sea and see couldn t possibly be used as a rhyme And then Eleanor had part of another verse that she couldn t find a beginning for But wisdom passes still the years Will feed us wisdom Age will go Back to the old For all our tears We shall not know Eleanor hated Maryland passionately She belonged to the oldest of the old families of Ramilly County and lived in a big gloomy house with her grandfather She had been born and brought up in France I see I am starting wrong Let me begin again Amory was bored as he usually was in the country He used to go for far walks by himself and wander along reciting Ulalume to the corn fields and congratulating Poe for drinking himself to death in that atmosphere of smiling complacency One afternoon he had strolled for several miles along a road that was new to him and then through a wood on bad advice from a colored woman losing himself entirely A passing storm decided to break out and to his great impatience the sky grew black as pitch and the rain began to splatter down through the trees become suddenly furtive and ghostly Thunder rolled with menacing crashes up the valley and scattered through the woods in intermittent batteries He stumbled blindly on hunting for a way out and finally through webs of twisted branches caught sight of a rift in the trees where the unbroken lightning showed open country He rushed to the edge of the woods and then hesitated whether or not to cross the fields and try to reach the shelter of the little house marked by a light far down the valley It was only half past five but he could see scarcely ten steps before him except when the lightning made everything vivid and grotesque for great sweeps around Suddenly a strange sound fell on his ears It was a song in a low husky voice a girl s voice and whoever was singing was very close to him A year before he might have laughed or trembled but in his restless mood he only stood and listened while the words sank into his consciousness Les sanglots longs Des violons De l automne Blessent mon coeur D une langueur Monotone The lightning split the sky but the song went on without a quaver The girl was evidently in the field and the voice seemed to come vaguely from a haystack about twenty feet in front of him Then it ceased ceased and began again in a weird chant that soared and hung and fell and blended with the rain Tout suffocant Et bleme quand Sonne l heure Je me souviens Des jours anciens Et je pleure Who the devil is there in Ramilly County muttered Amory aloud who would deliver Verlaine in an extemporaneous tune to a soaking haystack Somebody s there cried the voice unalarmed Who are you Manfred saint Christopher or Queen Victoria I m Don Juan Amory shouted on impulse raising his voice above the noise of the rain and the wind A delighted shriek came from the haystack I know who you are you re the blond boy that likes Ulalume I recognize your voice How do I get up he cried from the foot of the haystack whither he had arrived dripping wet A head appeared over the edge it was so dark that Amory could just make out a patch of damp hair and two eyes that gleamed like a cat s Run back came the voice and jump and I ll catch your hand no not there on the other side He followed directions and as he sprawled up the side knee deep in hay a small white hand reached out gripped his and helped him onto the top Here you are Juan cried she of the damp hair Do you mind if I drop the Don You ve got a thumb like mine he exclaimed And you re holding my hand which is dangerous without seeing my face He dropped it quickly As if in answer to his prayers came a flash of lightning and he looked eagerly at her who stood beside him on the soggy haystack ten feet above the ground But she had covered her face and he saw nothing but a slender figure dark damp bobbed hair and the small white hands with the thumbs that bent back like his Sit down she suggested politely as the dark closed in on them If you ll sit opposite me in this hollow you can have half of the raincoat which I was using as a water proof tent until you so rudely interrupted me I was asked Amory said joyfully you asked me you know you did Don Juan always manages that she said laughing but I shan t call you that any more because you ve got reddish hair Instead you can recite Ulalume and I ll be Psyche your soul Amory flushed happily invisible under the curtain of wind and rain They were sitting opposite each other in a slight hollow in the hay with the raincoat spread over most of them and the rain doing for the rest Amory was trying desperately to see Psyche but the lightning refused to flash again and he waited impatiently Good Lord supposing she wasn t beautiful supposing she was forty and pedantic heavens Suppose only suppose she was mad But he knew the last was unworthy Here had Providence sent a girl to amuse him just as it sent Benvenuto Cellini men to murder and he was wondering if she was mad just because she exactly filled his mood I m not she said Not what Not mad I didn t think you were mad when I first saw you so it isn t fair that you should think so of me How on earth As long as they knew each other Eleanor and Amory could be on a subject and stop talking with the definite thought of it in their heads yet ten minutes later speak aloud and find that their minds had followed the same channels and led them each to a parallel idea an idea that others would have found absolutely unconnected with the first Tell me he demanded leaning forward eagerly how do you know about Ulalume how did you know the color of my hair What s your name What were you doing here Tell me all at once Suddenly the lightning flashed in with a leap of overreaching light and he saw Eleanor and looked for the first time into those eyes of hers Oh she was magnificent pale skin the color of marble in starlight slender brows and eyes that glittered green as emeralds in the blinding glare She was a witch of perhaps nineteen he judged alert and dreamy and with the tell tale white line over her upper lip that was a weakness and a delight He sank back with a gasp against the wall of hay Now you ve seen me she said calmly and I suppose you re about to say that my green eyes are burning into your brain What color is your hair he asked intently It s bobbed isn t it Yes it s bobbed I don t know what color it is she answered musing so many men have asked me It s medium I suppose No one ever looks long at my hair I ve got beautiful eyes though haven t I I don t care what you say I have beautiful eyes Answer my question Madeline Don t remember them all besides my name isn t Madeline it s Eleanor I might have guessed it You look like Eleanor you have that Eleanor look You know what I mean There was a silence as they listened to the rain It s going down my neck fellow lunatic she offered finally Answer my questions Well name of Savage Eleanor live in big old house mile down road nearest living relation to be notified grandfather Ramilly Savage height five feet four inches number on watch case three thousand seventy seven W nose delicate aquiline temperament uncanny And me Amory interrupted where did you see me Oh you re one of those men she answered haughtily must lug old self into conversation Well my boy I was behind a hedge sunning myself one day last week and along comes a man saying in a pleasant conceited way of talking And now when the night was senescent says he And the star dials pointed to morn At the end of the path a liquescent says he And nebulous lustre was born So I poked my eyes up over the hedge but you had started to run for some unknown reason and so I saw but the back of your beautiful head Oh says I there s a man for whom many of us might sigh and I continued in my best Irish All right Amory interrupted Now go back to yourself Well I will I m one of those people who go through the world giving other people thrills but getting few myself except those I read into men on such nights as these I have the social courage to go on the stage but not the energy I haven t the patience to write books and I never met a man I d marry However I m only eighteen The storm was dying down softly and only the wind kept up its ghostly surge and made the stack lean and gravely settle from side to side Amory was in a trance He felt that every moment was precious He had never met a girl like this before she would never seem quite the same again He didn t at all feel like a character in a play the appropriate feeling in an unconventional situation instead he had a sense of coming home I have just made a great decision said Eleanor after another pause and that is why I m here to answer another of your questions I have just decided that I don t believe in immortality Really how banal Frightfully so she answered but depressing with a stale sickly depression nevertheless I came out here to get wet like a wet hen wet hens always have great clarity of mind she concluded Go on Amory said politely Well I m not afraid of the dark so I put on my slicker and rubber boots and came out You see I was always afraid before to say I didn t believe in God because the lightning might strike me but here I am and it hasn t of course but the main point is that this time I wasn t any more afraid of it than I had been when I was a Christian Scientist like I was last year So now I know I m a materialist and I was fraternizing with the hay when you came out and stood by the woods scared to death Why you little wretch cried Amory indignantly Scared of what Yourself she shouted and he jumped She clapped her hands and laughed See see Conscience kill it like me Eleanor Savage materiologist no jumping no starting come early But I have to have a soul he objected I can t be rational and I won t be molecular She leaned toward him her burning eyes never leaving his own and whispered with a sort of romantic finality I thought so Juan I feared so you re sentimental You re not like me I m a romantic little materialist I m not sentimental I m as romantic as you are The idea you know is that the sentimental person thinks things will last the romantic person has a desperate confidence that they won t This was an ancient distinction of Amory s Epigrams I m going home she said sadly Let s get off the haystack and walk to the cross roads They slowly descended from their perch She would not let him help her down and motioning him away arrived in a graceful lump in the soft mud where she sat for an instant laughing at herself Then she jumped to her feet and slipped her hand into his and they tiptoed across the fields jumping and swinging from dry spot to dry spot A transcendent delight seemed to sparkle in every pool of water for the moon had risen and the storm had scurried away into western Maryland When Eleanor s arm touched his he felt his hands grow cold with deadly fear lest he should lose the shadow brush with which his imagination was painting wonders of her He watched her from the corners of his eyes as ever he did when he walked with her she was a feast and a folly and he wished it had been his destiny to sit forever on a haystack and see life through her green eyes His paganism soared that night and when she faded out like a gray ghost down the road a deep singing came out of the fields and filled his way homeward All night the summer moths flitted in and out of Amory s window all night large looming sounds swayed in mystic revery through the silver grain and he lay awake in the clear darkness SEPTEMBER Amory selected a blade of grass and nibbled at it scientifically I never fall in love in August or September he proffered When then Christmas or Easter I m a liturgist Easter She turned up her nose Huh Spring in corsets Easter would bore spring wouldn t she Easter has her hair braided wears a tailored suit Bind on thy sandals oh thou most fleet Over the splendor and speed of thy feet quoted Eleanor softly and then added I suppose Hallowe en is a better day for autumn than Thanksgiving Much better and Christmas eve does very well for winter but summer Summer has no day she said We can t possibly have a summer love So many people have tried that the name s become proverbial Summer is only the unfulfilled promise of spring a charlatan in place of the warm balmy nights I dream of in April It s a sad season of life without growth It has no day Fourth of July Amory suggested facetiously Don t be funny she said raking him with her eyes Well what could fulfil the promise of spring She thought a moment Oh I suppose heaven would if there was one she said finally a sort of pagan heaven you ought to be a materialist she continued irrelevantly Why Because you look a good deal like the pictures of Rupert Brooke To some extent Amory tried to play Rupert Brooke as long as he knew Eleanor What he said his attitude toward life toward her toward himself were all reflexes of the dead Englishman s literary moods Often she sat in the grass a lazy wind playing with her short hair her voice husky as she ran up and down the scale from Grantchester to Waikiki There was something most passionate in Eleanor s reading aloud They seemed nearer not only mentally but physically when they read than when she was in his arms and this was often for they fell half into love almost from the first Yet was Amory capable of love now He could as always run through the emotions in a half hour but even while they revelled in their imaginations he knew that neither of them could care as he had cared once before I suppose that was why they turned to Brooke and Swinburne and Shelley Their chance was to make everything fine and finished and rich and imaginative they must bend tiny golden tentacles from his imagination to hers that would take the place of the great deep love that was never so near yet never so much of a dream One poem they read over and over Swinburne s Triumph of Time and four lines of it rang in his memory afterward on warm nights when he saw the fireflies among dusky tree trunks and heard the low drone of many frogs Then Eleanor seemed to come out of the night and stand by him and he heard her throaty voice with its tone of a fleecy headed drum repeating Is it worth a tear is it worth an hour To think of things that are well outworn Of fruitless husk and fugitive flower The dream foregone and the deed foreborne They were formally introduced two days later and his aunt told him her history The Ramillys were two old mister Ramilly and his granddaughter Eleanor She had lived in France with a restless mother whom Amory imagined to have been very like his own on whose death she had come to America to live in Maryland She had gone to Baltimore first to stay with a bachelor uncle and there she insisted on being a debutante at the age of seventeen She had a wild winter and arrived in the country in March having quarrelled frantically with all her Baltimore relatives and shocked them into fiery protest A rather fast crowd had come out who drank cocktails in limousines and were promiscuously condescending and patronizing toward older people and Eleanor with an esprit that hinted strongly of the boulevards led many innocents still redolent of saint Timothy s and Farmington into paths of Bohemian naughtiness When the story came to her uncle a forgetful cavalier of a more hypocritical era there was a scene from which Eleanor emerged subdued but rebellious and indignant to seek haven with her grandfather who hovered in the country on the near side of senility That s as far as her story went she told him the rest herself but that was later Often they swam and as Amory floated lazily in the water he shut his mind to all thoughts except those of hazy soap bubble lands where the sun splattered through wind drunk trees How could any one possibly think or worry or do anything except splash and dive and loll there on the edge of time while the flower months failed Let the days move over sadness and memory and pain recurred outside and here once more before he went on to meet them he wanted to drift and be young There were days when Amory resented that life had changed from an even progress along a road stretching ever in sight with the scenery merging and blending into a succession of quick unrelated scenes two years of sweat and blood that sudden absurd instinct for paternity that Rosalind had stirred the half sensual half neurotic quality of this autumn with Eleanor He felt that it would take all time more than he could ever spare to glue these strange cumbersome pictures into the scrap book of his life It was all like a banquet where he sat for this half hour of his youth and tried to enjoy brilliant epicurean courses Dimly he promised himself a time where all should be welded together For months it seemed that he had alternated between being borne along a stream of love or fascination or left in an eddy and in the eddies he had not desired to think rather to be picked up on a wave s top and swept along again The despairing dying autumn and our love how well they harmonize said Eleanor sadly one day as they lay dripping by the water The Indian summer of our hearts he ceased Tell me she said finally was she light or dark Light Was she more beautiful than I am I don t know said Amory shortly One night they walked while the moon rose and poured a great burden of glory over the garden until it seemed fairyland with Amory and Eleanor dim phantasmal shapes expressing eternal beauty in curious elfin love moods Then they turned out of the moonlight into the trellised darkness of a vine hung pagoda where there were scents so plaintive as to be nearly musical Light a match she whispered I want to see you Scratch Flare The night and the scarred trees were like scenery in a play and to be there with Eleanor shadowy and unreal seemed somehow oddly familiar Amory thought how it was only the past that ever seemed strange and unbelievable The match went out It s black as pitch We re just voices now murmured Eleanor little lonesome voices Light another That was my last match Suddenly he caught her in his arms You are mine you know you re mine he cried wildly the moonlight twisted in through the vines and listened the fireflies hung upon their whispers as if to win his glance from the glory of their eyes THE END OF SUMMER No wind is stirring in the grass not one wind stirs the water in the hidden pools as glass fronts the full moon and so inters the golden token in its icy mass chanted Eleanor to the trees that skeletoned the body of the night Isn t it ghostly here If you can hold your horse s feet up let s cut through the woods and find the hidden pools It s after one and you ll get the devil he objected and I don t know enough about horses to put one away in the pitch dark Shut up you old fool she whispered irrelevantly and leaning over she patted him lazily with her riding crop You can leave your old plug in our stable and I ll send him over to morrow But my uncle has got to drive me to the station with this old plug at seven o clock Don t be a spoil sport remember you have a tendency toward wavering that prevents you from being the entire light of my life Amory drew his horse up close beside and leaning toward her grasped her hand Say I am quick or I ll pull you over and make you ride behind me She looked up and smiled and shook her head excitedly Oh do or rather don t Why are all the exciting things so uncomfortable like fighting and exploring and ski ing in Canada By the way we re going to ride up Harper s Hill I think that comes in our programme about five o clock You little devil Amory growled You re going to make me stay up all night and sleep in the train like an immigrant all day to morrow going back to New York Hush some one s coming along the road let s go Whoo ee oop And with a shout that probably gave the belated traveller a series of shivers she turned her horse into the woods and Amory followed slowly as he had followed her all day for three weeks The summer was over but he had spent the days in watching Eleanor a graceful facile Manfred build herself intellectual and imaginative pyramids while she revelled in the artificialities of the temperamental teens and they wrote poetry at the dinner table When Vanity kissed Vanity a hundred happy Junes ago he pondered o er her breathlessly and that all men might ever know he rhymed her eyes with life and death Thru Time I ll save my love he said yet Beauty vanished with his breath and with her lovers she was dead Ever his wit and not her eyes ever his art and not her hair Who d learn a trick in rhyme be wise and pause before his sonnet there So all my words however true might sing you to a thousandth June and no one ever know that you were Beauty for an afternoon So he wrote one day when he pondered how coldly we thought of the Dark Lady of the Sonnets and how little we remembered her as the great man wanted her remembered For what Shakespeare must have desired to have been able to write with such divine despair was that the lady should live and now we have no real interest in her The irony of it is that if he had cared more for the poem than for the lady the sonnet would be only obvious imitative rhetoric and no one would ever have read it after twenty years This was the last night Amory ever saw Eleanor He was leaving in the morning and they had agreed to take a long farewell trot by the cold moonlight She wanted to talk she said perhaps the last time in her life that she could be rational she meant pose with comfort So they had turned into the woods and rode for half an hour with scarcely a word except when she whispered Damn at a bothersome branch whispered it as no other girl was ever able to whisper it Then they started up Harper s Hill walking their tired horses Good Lord It s quiet here whispered Eleanor much more lonesome than the woods I hate woods Amory said shuddering Any kind of foliage or underbrush at night Out here it s so broad and easy on the spirit The long slope of a long hill And the cold moon rolling moonlight down it And thee and me last and most important It was quiet that night the straight road they followed up to the edge of the cliff knew few footsteps at any time Only an occasional negro cabin silver gray in the rock ribbed moonlight broke the long line of bare ground behind lay the black edge of the woods like a dark frosting on white cake and ahead the sharp high horizon It was much colder so cold that it settled on them and drove all the warm nights from their minds The end of summer said Eleanor softly Listen to the beat of our horses hoofs tump tump tump a tump Have you ever been feverish and had all noises divide into tump tump tump until you could swear eternity was divisible into so many tumps That s the way I feel old horses go tump tump I guess that s the only thing that separates horses and clocks from us Human beings can t go tump tump tump without going crazy The breeze freshened and Eleanor pulled her cape around her and shivered Are you very cold asked Amory No I m thinking about myself my black old inside self the real one with the fundamental honesty that keeps me from being absolutely wicked by making me realize my own sins They were riding up close by the cliff and Amory gazed over Where the fall met the ground a hundred feet below a black stream made a sharp line broken by tiny glints in the swift water Rotten rotten old world broke out Eleanor suddenly and the wretchedest thing of all is me oh why am I a girl Why am I not a stupid Look at you you re stupider than I am not much but some and you can lope about and get bored and then lope somewhere else and you can play around with girls without being involved in meshes of sentiment and you can do anything and be justified and here am I with the brains to do everything yet tied to the sinking ship of future matrimony If I were born a hundred years from now well and good but now what s in store for me I have to marry that goes without saying Who I m too bright for most men and yet I have to descend to their level and let them patronize my intellect in order to get their attention Every year that I don t marry I ve got less chance for a first class man At the best I can have my choice from one or two cities and of course I have to marry into a dinner coat Listen she leaned close again I like clever men and good looking men and of course no one cares more for personality than I do Oh just one person in fifty has any glimmer of what sex is I m hipped on Freud and all that but it s rotten that every bit of real love in the world is ninety nine per cent passion and one little soupcon of jealousy She finished as suddenly as she began Of course you re right Amory agreed It s a rather unpleasant overpowering force that s part of the machinery under everything It s like an actor that lets you see his mechanics Wait a minute till I think this out He paused and tried to get a metaphor They had turned the cliff and were riding along the road about fifty feet to the left You see every one s got to have some cloak to throw around it The mediocre intellects Plato s second class use the remnants of romantic chivalry diluted with Victorian sentiment and we who consider ourselves the intellectuals cover it up by pretending that it s another side of us has nothing to do with our shining brains we pretend that the fact that we realize it is really absolving us from being a prey to it But the truth is that sex is right in the middle of our purest abstractions so close that it obscures vision I can kiss you now and will He leaned toward her in his saddle but she drew away I can t I can t kiss you now I m more sensitive You re more stupid then he declared rather impatiently Intellect is no protection from sex any more than convention is What is she fired up The Catholic Church or the maxims of Confucius Amory looked up rather taken aback That s your panacea isn t it she cried Oh you re just an old hypocrite too Thousands of scowling priests keeping the degenerate Italians and illiterate Irish repentant with gabble gabble about the sixth and ninth commandments It s just all cloaks sentiment and spiritual rouge and panaceas I ll tell you there is no God not even a definite abstract goodness so it s all got to be worked out for the individual by the individual here in high white foreheads like mine and you re too much the prig to admit it She let go her reins and shook her little fists at the stars If there s a God let him strike me strike me Talking about God again after the manner of atheists Amory said sharply His materialism always a thin cloak was torn to shreds by Eleanor s blasphemy She knew it and it angered him that she knew it And like most intellectuals who don t find faith convenient he continued coldly like Napoleon and Oscar Wilde and the rest of your type you ll yell loudly for a priest on your death bed Eleanor drew her horse up sharply and he reined in beside her Will I she said in a queer voice that scared him Will I Watch I m going over the cliff And before he could interfere she had turned and was riding breakneck for the end of the plateau He wheeled and started after her his body like ice his nerves in a vast clangor There was no chance of stopping her The moon was under a cloud and her horse would step blindly over Then some ten feet from the edge of the cliff she gave a sudden shriek and flung herself sideways plunged from her horse and rolling over twice landed in a pile of brush five feet from the edge The horse went over with a frantic whinny In a minute he was by Eleanor s side and saw that her eyes were open Eleanor he cried She did not answer but her lips moved and her eyes filled with sudden tears Eleanor are you hurt No I don t think so she said faintly and then began weeping My horse dead Good God Yes Oh she wailed I thought I was going over I didn t know He helped her gently to her feet and boosted her onto his saddle So they started homeward Amory walking and she bent forward on the pommel sobbing bitterly I ve got a crazy streak she faltered twice before I ve done things like that When I was eleven mother went went mad stark raving crazy We were in Vienna All the way back she talked haltingly about herself and Amory s love waned slowly with the moon At her door they started from habit to kiss good night but she could not run into his arms nor were they stretched to meet her as in the week before For a minute they stood there hating each other with a bitter sadness But as Amory had loved himself in Eleanor so now what he hated was only a mirror Their poses were strewn about the pale dawn like broken glass The stars were long gone and there were left only the little sighing gusts of wind and the silences between but naked souls are poor things ever and soon he turned homeward and let new lights come in with the sun A POEM THAT ELEANOR SENT AMORY SEVERAL YEARS LATER Here Earth born over the lilt of the water Lisping its music and bearing a burden of light Bosoming day as a laughing and radiant daughter Here we may whisper unheard unafraid of the night Walking alone was it splendor or what we were bound with Deep in the time when summer lets down her hair Shadows we loved and the patterns they covered the ground with Tapestries mystical faint in the breathless air That was the day and the night for another story Pale as a dream and shadowed with pencilled trees Ghosts of the stars came by who had sought for glory Whispered to us of peace in the plaintive breeze Whispered of old dead faiths that the day had shattered Youth the penny that bought delight of the moon That was the urge that we knew and the language that mattered That was the debt that we paid to the usurer June Here deepest of dreams by the waters that bring not Anything back of the past that we need not know What if the light is but sun and the little streams sing not We are together it seems I have loved you so What did the last night hold with the summer over Drawing us back to the home in the changing glade What leered out of the dark in the ghostly clover God till you stirred in your sleep and were wild afraid Well we have passed we are chronicle now to the eerie Curious metal from meteors that failed in the sky Earth born the tireless is stretched by the water quite weary Close to this ununderstandable changeling that s I Fear is an echo we traced to Security s daughter Now we are faces and voices and less too soon Whispering half love over the lilt of the water Youth the penny that bought delight of the moon A POEM AMORY SENT TO ELEANOR AND WHICH HE CALLED SUMMER STORM Faint winds and a song fading and leaves falling Faint winds and far away a fading laughter And the rain and over the fields a voice calling Our gray blown cloud scurries and lifts above Slides on the sun and flutters there to waft her Sisters on The shadow of a dove Falls on the cote the trees are filled with wings And down the valley through the crying trees The body of the darker storm flies brings With its new air the breath of sunken seas And slender tenuous thunder But I wait Wait for the mists and for the blacker rain Heavier winds that stir the veil of fate Happier winds that pile her hair Again They tear me teach me strew the heavy air Upon me winds that I know and storm There was a summer every rain was rare There was a season every wind was warm And now you pass me in the mist your hair Rain blown about you damp lips curved once more In that wild irony that gay despair That made you old when we have met before Wraith like you drift on out before the rain Across the fields blown with the stemless flowers With your old hopes dead leaves and loves again Dim as a dream and wan with all old hours Whispers will creep into the growing dark Tumult will die over the trees Now night Tears from her wetted breast the splattered blouse Of day glides down the dreaming hills tear bright To cover with her hair the eerie green Love for the dusk Love for the glistening after Quiet the trees to their last tops serene Faint winds and far away a fading laughter CHAPTER four The Supercilious Sacrifice Atlantic City Amory paced the board walk at day s end lulled by the everlasting surge of changing waves smelling the half mournful odor of the salt breeze The sea he thought had treasured its memories deeper than the faithless land It seemed still to whisper of Norse galleys ploughing the water world under raven figured flags of the British dreadnoughts gray bulwarks of civilization steaming up through the fog of one dark July into the North Sea Well Amory Blaine Amory looked down into the street below A low racing car had drawn to a stop and a familiar cheerful face protruded from the driver s seat Come on down goopher cried Alec Amory called a greeting and descending a flight of wooden steps approached the car He and Alec had been meeting intermittently but the barrier of Rosalind lay always between them He was sorry for this he hated to lose Alec mister Blaine this is Miss Waterson Miss Wayne and mister Tully How d y do Amory said Alec exuberantly if you ll jump in we ll take you to some secluded nook and give you a wee jolt of Bourbon Amory considered That s an idea Step in move over Jill and Amory will smile very handsomely at you Amory squeezed into the back seat beside a gaudy vermilion lipped blonde Hello Doug Fairbanks she said flippantly Walking for exercise or hunting for company I was counting the waves replied Amory gravely I m going in for statistics Don t kid me Doug When they reached an unfrequented side street Alec stopped the car among deep shadows What you doing down here these cold days Amory he demanded as he produced a quart of Bourbon from under the fur rug Amory avoided the question Indeed he had had no definite reason for coming to the coast Do you remember that party of ours sophomore year he asked instead Do I When we slept in the pavilions up in Asbury Park Lord Alec It s hard to think that Jesse and Dick and Kerry are all three dead Alec shivered Don t talk about it These dreary fall days depress me enough Jill seemed to agree Doug here is sorta gloomy anyways she commented Tell him to drink deep it s good and scarce these days What I really want to ask you Amory is where you are Why New York I suppose I mean to night because if you haven t got a room yet you d better help me out Glad to You see Tully and I have two rooms with bath between at the Ranier and he s got to go back to New York I don t want to have to move Question is will you occupy one of the rooms Amory was willing if he could get in right away You ll find the key in the office the rooms are in my name Declining further locomotion or further stimulation Amory left the car and sauntered back along the board walk to the hotel He was in an eddy again a deep lethargic gulf without desire to work or write love or dissipate For the first time in his life he rather longed for death to roll over his generation obliterating their petty fevers and struggles and exultations His youth seemed never so vanished as now in the contrast between the utter loneliness of this visit and that riotous joyful party of four years before Things that had been the merest commonplaces of his life then deep sleep the sense of beauty around him all desire had flown away and the gaps they left were filled only with the great listlessness of his disillusion To hold a man a woman has to appeal to the worst in him This sentence was the thesis of most of his bad nights of which he felt this was to be one His mind had already started to play variations on the subject Tireless passion fierce jealousy longing to possess and crush these alone were left of all his love for Rosalind these remained to him as payment for the loss of his youth bitter calomel under the thin sugar of love s exaltation In his room he undressed and wrapping himself in blankets to keep out the chill October air drowsed in an armchair by the open window He remembered a poem he had read months before Oh staunch old heart who toiled so long for me I waste my years sailing along the sea Yet he had no sense of waste no sense of the present hope that waste implied He felt that life had rejected him Rosalind Rosalind He poured the words softly into the half darkness until she seemed to permeate the room the wet salt breeze filled his hair with moisture the rim of a moon seared the sky and made the curtains dim and ghostly He fell asleep When he awoke it was very late and quiet The blanket had slipped partly off his shoulders and he touched his skin to find it damp and cold Then he became aware of a tense whispering not ten feet away He became rigid Don t make a sound It was Alec s voice Jill do you hear me Yes breathed very low very frightened They were in the bathroom Then his ears caught a louder sound from somewhere along the corridor outside It was a mumbling of men s voices and a repeated muffled rapping Amory threw off the blankets and moved close to the bathroom door My God came the girl s voice again You ll have to let them in Sh Suddenly a steady insistent knocking began at Amory s hall door and simultaneously out of the bathroom came Alec followed by the vermilion lipped girl They were both clad in pajamas Amory an anxious whisper What s the trouble It s house detectives My God Amory they re just looking for a test case Well better let them in You don t understand They can get me under the Mann Act The girl followed him slowly a rather miserable pathetic figure in the darkness Amory tried to plan quickly You make a racket and let them in your room he suggested anxiously and I ll get her out by this door They re here too though They ll watch this door Can t you give a wrong name No chance I registered under my own name besides they d trail the auto license number Say you re married Jill says one of the house detectives knows her The girl had stolen to the bed and tumbled upon it lay there listening wretchedly to the knocking which had grown gradually to a pounding Then came a man s voice angry and imperative Open up or we ll break the door in In the silence when this voice ceased Amory realized that there were other things in the room besides people over and around the figure crouched on the bed there hung an aura gossamer as a moonbeam tainted as stale weak wine yet a horror diffusively brooding already over the three of them and over by the window among the stirring curtains stood something else featureless and indistinguishable yet strangely familiar Simultaneously two great cases presented themselves side by side to Amory all that took place in his mind then occupied in actual time less than ten seconds The first fact that flashed radiantly on his comprehension was the great impersonality of sacrifice he perceived that what we call love and hate reward and punishment had no more to do with it than the date of the month He quickly recapitulated the story of a sacrifice he had heard of in college a man had cheated in an examination his roommate in a gust of sentiment had taken the entire blame due to the shame of it the innocent one s entire future seemed shrouded in regret and failure capped by the ingratitude of the real culprit He had finally taken his own life years afterward the facts had come out At the time the story had both puzzled and worried Amory Now he realized the truth that sacrifice was no purchase of freedom It was like a great elective office it was like an inheritance of power to certain people at certain times an essential luxury carrying with it not a guarantee but a responsibility not a security but an infinite risk Its very momentum might drag him down to ruin the passing of the emotional wave that made it possible might leave the one who made it high and dry forever on an island of despair Amory knew that afterward Alec would secretly hate him for having done so much for him All this was flung before Amory like an opened scroll while ulterior to him and speculating upon him were those two breathless listening forces the gossamer aura that hung over and about the girl and that familiar thing by the window Sacrifice by its very nature was arrogant and impersonal sacrifice should be eternally supercilious Weep not for me but for thy children That thought Amory would be somehow the way God would talk to me Amory felt a sudden surge of joy and then like a face in a motion picture the aura over the bed faded out the dynamic shadow by the window that was as near as he could name it remained for the fraction of a moment and then the breeze seemed to lift it swiftly out of the room He clinched his hands in quick ecstatic excitement the ten seconds were up Do what I say Alec do what I say Do you understand Alec looked at him dumbly his face a tableau of anguish You have a family continued Amory slowly You have a family and it s important that you should get out of this Do you hear me He repeated clearly what he had said Do you hear me I hear you The voice was curiously strained the eyes never for a second left Amory s Alec you re going to lie down here If any one comes in you act drunk You do what I say if you don t I ll probably kill you There was another moment while they stared at each other Then Amory went briskly to the bureau and taking his pocket book beckoned peremptorily to the girl He heard one word from Alec that sounded like penitentiary then he and Jill were in the bathroom with the door bolted behind them You re here with me he said sternly You ve been with me all evening She nodded gave a little half cry In a second he had the door of the other room open and three men entered There was an immediate flood of electric light and he stood there blinking You ve been playing a little too dangerous a game young man Amory laughed Well The leader of the trio nodded authoritatively at a burly man in a check suit All right Olson I got you mister O May said Olson nodding The other two took a curious glance at their quarry and then withdrew closing the door angrily behind them The burly man regarded Amory contemptuously Didn t you ever hear of the Mann Act Coming down here with her he indicated the girl with his thumb with a New York license on your car to a hotel like this He shook his head implying that he had struggled over Amory but now gave him up Well said Amory rather impatiently what do you want us to do Get dressed quick and tell your friend not to make such a racket Jill was sobbing noisily on the bed but at these words she subsided sulkily and gathering up her clothes retired to the bathroom As Amory slipped into Alec s B V D s he found that his attitude toward the situation was agreeably humorous The aggrieved virtue of the burly man made him want to laugh Anybody else here demanded Olson trying to look keen and ferret like Fellow who had the rooms said Amory carelessly He s drunk as an owl though Been in there asleep since six o clock I ll take a look at him presently How did you find out asked Amory curiously Night clerk saw you go up stairs with this woman Amory nodded Jill reappeared from the bathroom completely if rather untidily arrayed Now then began Olson producing a note book I want your real names no damn John Smith or Mary Brown Wait a minute said Amory quietly Just drop that big bully stuff We merely got caught that s all Olson glared at him Name he snapped Amory gave his name and New York address And the lady Miss Jill Say cried Olson indignantly just ease up on the nursery rhymes What s your name Sarah Murphy Minnie Jackson Oh my God cried the girl cupping her tear stained face in her hands I don t want my mother to know I don t want my mother to know Come on now Shut up cried Amory at Olson An instant s pause Stella Robbins she faltered finally General Delivery Rugway New Hampshire Olson snapped his note book shut and looked at them very ponderously By rights the hotel could turn the evidence over to the police and you d go to penitentiary you would for bringin a girl from one State to nother f r immoral purp ses He paused to let the majesty of his words sink in But the hotel is going to let you off It doesn t want to get in the papers cried Jill fiercely Let us off Huh A great lightness surrounded Amory He realized that he was safe and only then did he appreciate the full enormity of what he might have incurred However continued Olson there s a protective association among the hotels There s been too much of this stuff and we got a rangement with the newspapers so that you get a little free publicity Not the name of the hotel but just a line sayin that you had a little trouble in lantic City See I see You re gettin off light damn light but Come on said Amory briskly Let s get out of here We don t need a valedictory Olson walked through the bathroom and took a cursory glance at Alec s still form Then he extinguished the lights and motioned them to follow him As they walked into the elevator Amory considered a piece of bravado yielded finally He reached out and tapped Olson on the arm Would you mind taking off your hat There s a lady in the elevator Olson s hat came off slowly There was a rather embarrassing two minutes under the lights of the lobby while the night clerk and a few belated guests stared at them curiously the loudly dressed girl with bent head the handsome young man with his chin several points aloft the inference was quite obvious Then the chill outdoors where the salt air was fresher and keener still with the first hints of morning You can get one of those taxis and beat it said Olson pointing to the blurred outline of two machines whose drivers were presumably asleep inside Good by said Olson He reached in his pocket suggestively but Amory snorted and taking the girl s arm turned away Where did you tell the driver to go she asked as they whirled along the dim street The station If that guy writes my mother He won t Nobody ll ever know about this except our friends and enemies Dawn was breaking over the sea It s getting blue she said It does very well agreed Amory critically and then as an after thought It s almost breakfast time do you want something to eat Food she said with a cheerful laugh Food is what queered the party We ordered a big supper to be sent up to the room about two o clock Alec didn t give the waiter a tip so I guess the little bastard snitched Jill s low spirits seemed to have gone faster than the scattering night Let me tell you she said emphatically when you want to stage that sorta party stay away from liquor and when you want to get tight stay away from bedrooms I ll remember He tapped suddenly at the glass and they drew up at the door of an all night restaurant Is Alec a great friend of yours asked Jill as they perched themselves on high stools inside and set their elbows on the dingy counter He used to be He probably won t want to be any more and never understand why It was sorta crazy you takin all that blame Is he pretty important Kinda more important than you are Amory laughed That remains to be seen he answered That s the question THE COLLAPSE OF SEVERAL PILLARS Two days later back in New York Amory found in a newspaper what he had been searching for a dozen lines which announced to whom it might concern that mister Amory Blaine who gave his address as et cetera had been requested to leave his hotel in Atlantic City because of entertaining in his room a lady not his wife Then he started and his fingers trembled for directly above was a longer paragraph of which the first words were mister and missus Leland R Connage are announcing the engagement of their daughter Rosalind to mister J Dawson Ryder of Hartford Connecticut He dropped the paper and lay down on his bed with a frightened sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach She was gone definitely finally gone Until now he had half unconsciously cherished the hope deep in his heart that some day she would need him and send for him cry that it had been a mistake that her heart ached only for the pain she had caused him Never again could he find even the sombre luxury of wanting her not this Rosalind harder older nor any beaten broken woman that his imagination brought to the door of his forties Amory had wanted her youth the fresh radiance of her mind and body the stuff that she was selling now once and for all So far as he was concerned young Rosalind was dead A day later came a crisp terse letter from mister Barton in Chicago which informed him that as three more street car companies had gone into the hands of receivers he could expect for the present no further remittances Last of all on a dazed Sunday night a telegram told him of Monsignor Darcy s sudden death in Philadelphia five days before He knew then what it was that he had perceived among the curtains of the room in Atlantic City CHAPTER five The Egotist Becomes a Personage A fathom deep in sleep I lie With old desires restrained before To clamor lifeward with a cry As dark flies out the greying door And so in quest of creeds to share I seek assertive day again But old monotony is there Endless avenues of rain Oh might I rise again Might I Throw off the heat of that old wine See the new morning mass the sky With fairy towers line on line Find each mirage in the high air A symbol not a dream again But old monotony is there Endless avenues of rain Under the glass portcullis of a theatre Amory stood watching the first great drops of rain splatter down and flatten to dark stains on the sidewalk The air became gray and opalescent a solitary light suddenly outlined a window over the way then another light then a hundred more danced and glimmered into vision Under his feet a thick iron studded skylight turned yellow in the street the lamps of the taxi cabs sent out glistening sheens along the already black pavement The unwelcome November rain had perversely stolen the day s last hour and pawned it with that ancient fence the night The silence of the theatre behind him ended with a curious snapping sound followed by the heavy roaring of a rising crowd and the interlaced clatter of many voices The matinee was over He stood aside edged a little into the rain to let the throng pass A small boy rushed out sniffed in the damp fresh air and turned up the collar of his coat came three or four couples in a great hurry came a further scattering of people whose eyes as they emerged glanced invariably first at the wet street then at the rain filled air finally at the dismal sky last a dense strolling mass that depressed him with its heavy odor compounded of the tobacco smell of the men and the fetid sensuousness of stale powder on women After the thick crowd came another scattering a stray half dozen a man on crutches finally the rattling bang of folding seats inside announced that the ushers were at work New York seemed not so much awakening as turning over in its bed Pallid men rushed by pinching together their coat collars a great swarm of tired magpie girls from a department store crowded along with shrieks of strident laughter three to an umbrella a squad of marching policemen passed already miraculously protected by oilskin capes The rain gave Amory a feeling of detachment and the numerous unpleasant aspects of city life without money occurred to him in threatening procession There was the ghastly stinking crush of the subway the car cards thrusting themselves at one leering out like dull bores who grab your arm with another story the querulous worry as to whether some one isn t leaning on you a man deciding not to give his seat to a woman hating her for it the woman hating him for not doing it at worst a squalid phantasmagoria of breath and old cloth on human bodies and the smells of the food men ate at best just people too hot or too cold tired worried He pictured the rooms where these people lived where the patterns of the blistered wall papers were heavy reiterated sunflowers on green and yellow backgrounds where there were tin bathtubs and gloomy hallways and verdureless unnamable spaces in back of the buildings where even love dressed as seduction a sordid murder around the corner illicit motherhood in the flat above And always there was the economical stuffiness of indoor winter and the long summers nightmares of perspiration between sticky enveloping walls dirty restaurants where careless tired people helped themselves to sugar with their own used coffee spoons leaving hard brown deposits in the bowl It was not so bad where there were only men or else only women it was when they were vilely herded that it all seemed so rotten It was some shame that women gave off at having men see them tired and poor it was some disgust that men had for women who were tired and poor It was dirtier than any battle field he had seen harder to contemplate than any actual hardship moulded of mire and sweat and danger it was an atmosphere wherein birth and marriage and death were loathsome secret things He remembered one day in the subway when a delivery boy had brought in a great funeral wreath of fresh flowers how the smell of it had suddenly cleared the air and given every one in the car a momentary glow I detest poor people thought Amory suddenly
125_121342_000010_000001	train-clean-100	 I hate them for being poor 
none	none	Poverty may have been beautiful once but it s rotten now 
125_121342_000010_000003	train-clean-100	It s the ugliest thing in the world 
none	none	It s essentially cleaner to be corrupt and rich than it is to be innocent and poor He seemed to see again a figure whose significance had once impressed him a well dressed young man gazing from a club window on Fifth Avenue and saying something to his companion with a look of utter disgust Probably thought Amory what he said was My God 
125_121342_000010_000006	train-clean-100	Aren t people horrible 
125_121342_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Never before in his life had Amory considered poor people 
none	none	He thought cynically how completely he was lacking in all human sympathy O Henry had found in these people romance pathos love hate Amory saw only coarseness physical filth and stupidity He made no self accusations never any more did he reproach himself for feelings that were natural and sincere He accepted all his reactions as a part of him unchangeable unmoral This problem of poverty transformed magnified attached to some grander more dignified attitude might some day even be his problem at present it roused only his profound distaste He walked over to Fifth Avenue dodging the blind black menace of umbrellas and standing in front of Delmonico s hailed an auto bus Buttoning his coat closely around him he climbed to the roof where he rode in solitary state through the thin persistent rain stung into alertness by the cool moisture perpetually reborn on his cheek Somewhere in his mind a conversation began rather resumed its place in his attention It was composed not of two voices but of one which acted alike as questioner and answerer 
125_121342_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Question Well what s the situation

none	none	Q Have you no interests left A None I ve no more virtue to lose Just as a cooling pot gives off heat so all through youth and adolescence we give off calories of virtue That s what s called ingenuousness Q An interesting idea A That s why a good man going wrong attracts people They stand around and literally warm themselves at the calories of virtue he gives off Sarah makes an unsophisticated remark and the faces simper in delight How innocent the poor child is They re warming themselves at her virtue But Sarah sees the simper and never makes that remark again Only she feels a little colder after that Q All your calories gone A All of them I m beginning to warm myself at other people s virtue Q Are you corrupt A I think so I m not sure I m not sure about good and evil at all any more Q Is that a bad sign in itself A Not necessarily Q What would be the test of corruption A Becoming really insincere calling myself not such a bad fellow thinking I regretted my lost youth when I only envy the delights of losing it 
125_121342_000040_000001	train-clean-100	Youth is like having a big plate of candy

none	none	The street numbers of Riverside Drive were obscured by the mist and dripping trees from anything but the swiftest scrutiny but Amory had finally caught sight of one One Hundred and Twenty seventh Street He got off and with no distinct destination followed a winding descending sidewalk and came out facing the river in particular a long pier and a partitioned litter of shipyards for miniature craft small launches canoes rowboats and catboats He turned northward and followed the shore jumped a small wire fence and found himself in a great disorderly yard adjoining a dock The hulls of many boats in various stages of repair were around him he smelled sawdust and paint and the scarcely distinguishable fiat odor of the Hudson 
125_121342_000044_000004	train-clean-100	A man approached through the heavy gloom 
none	none	Hello said Amory
125_121342_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Got a pass 
none	none	No 
125_121342_000047_000001	train-clean-100	Is this private 
125_121342_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 This is the Hudson River Sporting and Yacht Club

125_121342_000049_000002	train-clean-100	I m just resting 
125_121342_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 Well began the man dubiously 
none	none	I ll go if you want me to The man made non committal noises in his throat and passed on Amory seated himself on an overturned boat and leaned forward thoughtfully until his chin rested in his hand Misfortune is liable to make me a damn bad man he said slowly IN THE DROOPING HOURS While the rain drizzled on Amory looked futilely back at the stream of his life all its glitterings and dirty shallows To begin with he was still afraid not physically afraid any more but afraid of people and prejudice and misery and monotony Yet deep in his bitter heart he wondered if he was after all worse than this man or the next 
125_121342_000056_000003	train-clean-100	He knew that he could sophisticate himself finally into saying that his own weakness was just the result of circumstances and environment that often when he raged at himself as an egotist something would whisper ingratiatingly No 
none	none	Genius That was one manifestation of fear that voice which whispered that he could not be both great and good that genius was the exact combination of those inexplicable grooves and twists in his mind that any discipline would curb it to mediocrity Probably more than any concrete vice or failing Amory despised his own personality he loathed knowing that to morrow and the thousand days after he would swell pompously at a compliment and sulk at an ill word like a third rate musician or a first class actor He was ashamed of the fact that very simple and honest people usually distrusted him that he had been cruel often to those who had sunk their personalities in him several girls and a man here and there through college that he had been an evil influence on people who had followed him here and there into mental adventures from which he alone rebounded unscathed Usually on nights like this for there had been many lately he could escape from this consuming introspection by thinking of children and the infinite possibilities of children he leaned and listened and he heard a startled baby awake in a house across the street and lend a tiny whimper to the still night Quick as a flash he turned away wondering with a touch of panic whether something in the brooding despair of his mood had made a darkness in its tiny soul 
125_121342_000057_000002	train-clean-100	He shivered 
none	none	What if some day the balance was overturned and he became a thing that frightened children and crept into rooms in the dark approached dim communion with those phantoms who whispered shadowy secrets to the mad of that dark continent upon the moon 
125_121342_000059_000000	train-clean-100	Amory smiled a bit 
none	none	You re too much wrapped up in yourself he heard some one say And again Get out and do some real work
125_121342_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 Stop worrying 
125_121342_000063_000000	train-clean-100	He fancied a possible future comment of his own 
none	none	Yes I was perhaps an egotist in youth but I soon found it made me morbid to think too much about myself Suddenly he felt an overwhelming desire to let himself go to the devil not to go violently as a gentleman should but to sink safely and sensuously out of sight He pictured himself in an adobe house in Mexico half reclining on a rug covered couch his slender artistic fingers closed on a cigarette while he listened to guitars strumming melancholy undertones to an age old dirge of Castile and an olive skinned carmine lipped girl caressed his hair Here he might live a strange litany delivered from right and wrong and from the hound of heaven and from every God except the exotic Mexican one who was pretty slack himself and rather addicted to Oriental scents delivered from success and hope and poverty into that long chute of indulgence which led after all only to the artificial lake of death There were so many places where one might deteriorate pleasantly Port Said Shanghai parts of Turkestan Constantinople the South Seas all lands of sad haunting music and many odors where lust could be a mode and expression of life where the shades of night skies and sunsets would seem to reflect only moods of passion the colors of lips and poppies STILL WEEDING Once he had been miraculously able to scent evil as a horse detects a broken bridge at night but the man with the queer feet in Phoebe s room had diminished to the aura over Jill His instinct perceived the fetidness of poverty but no longer ferreted out the deeper evils in pride and sensuality There were no more wise men there were no more heroes Burne Holiday was sunk from sight as though he had never lived Monsignor was dead Amory had grown up to a thousand books a thousand lies he had listened eagerly to people who pretended to know who knew nothing The mystical reveries of saints that had once filled him with awe in the still hours of night now vaguely repelled him The Byrons and Brookes who had defied life from mountain tops were in the end but flaneurs and poseurs at best mistaking the shadow of courage for the substance of wisdom The pageantry of his disillusion took shape in a world old procession of Prophets Athenians Martyrs Saints Scientists Don Juans Jesuits Puritans Fausts Poets Pacifists like costumed alumni at a college reunion they streamed before him as their dreams personalities and creeds had in turn thrown colored lights on his soul each had tried to express the glory of life and the tremendous significance of man each had boasted of synchronizing what had gone before into his own rickety generalities each had depended after all on the set stage and the convention of the theatre which is that man in his hunger for faith will feed his mind with the nearest and most convenient food Women of whom he had expected so much whose beauty he had hoped to transmute into modes of art whose unfathomable instincts marvellously incoherent and inarticulate he had thought to perpetuate in terms of experience had become merely consecrations to their own posterity Isabelle Clara Rosalind Eleanor were all removed by their very beauty around which men had swarmed from the possibility of contributing anything but a sick heart and a page of puzzled words to write Amory based his loss of faith in help from others on several sweeping syllogisms Granted that his generation however bruised and decimated from this Victorian war were the heirs of progress Waving aside petty differences of conclusions which although they might occasionally cause the deaths of several millions of young men might be explained away supposing that after all Bernard Shaw and Bernhardi Bonar Law and Bethmann Hollweg were mutual heirs of progress if only in agreeing against the ducking of witches waiving the antitheses and approaching individually these men who seemed to be the leaders he was repelled by the discrepancies and contradictions in the men themselves There was for example Thornton Hancock respected by half the intellectual world as an authority on life a man who had verified and believed the code he lived by an educator of educators an adviser to Presidents yet Amory knew that this man had in his heart leaned on the priest of another religion And Monsignor upon whom a cardinal rested had moments of strange and horrible insecurity inexplicable in a religion that explained even disbelief in terms of its own faith if you doubted the devil it was the devil that made you doubt him Amory had seen Monsignor go to the houses of stolid philistines read popular novels furiously saturate himself in routine to escape from that horror And this priest a little wiser somewhat purer had been Amory knew not essentially older than he Amory was alone he had escaped from a small enclosure into a great labyrinth He was where Goethe was when he began Faust he was where Conrad was when he wrote Almayer s Folly Amory said to himself that there were essentially two sorts of people who through natural clarity or disillusion left the enclosure and sought the labyrinth There were men like Wells and Plato who had half unconsciously a strange hidden orthodoxy who would accept for themselves only what could be accepted for all men incurable romanticists who never for all their efforts could enter the labyrinth as stark souls there were on the other hand sword like pioneering personalities Samuel Butler Renan Voltaire who progressed much slower yet eventually much further not in the direct pessimistic line of speculative philosophy but concerned in the eternal attempt to attach a positive value to life Amory stopped He began for the first time in his life to have a strong distrust of all generalities and epigrams

none	none	Yet all thought usually reached the public after thirty years in some such form Benson and Chesterton had popularized Huysmans and Newman Shaw had sugar coated Nietzsche and Ibsen and Schopenhauer The man in the street heard the conclusions of dead genius through some one else s clever paradoxes and didactic epigrams Life was a damned muddle a football game with every one off side and the referee gotten rid of every one claiming the referee would have been on his side Progress was a labyrinth people plunging blindly in and then rushing wildly back shouting that they had found it the invisible king the elan vital the principle of evolution writing a book starting a war founding a school Amory even had he not been a selfish man would have started all inquiries with himself He was his own best example sitting in the rain a human creature of sex and pride foiled by chance and his own temperament of the balm of love and children preserved to help in building up the living consciousness of the race In self reproach and loneliness and disillusion he came to the entrance of the labyrinth Another dawn flung itself across the river a belated taxi hurried along the street its lamps still shining like burning eyes in a face white from a night s carouse A melancholy siren sounded far down the river MONSIGNOR Amory kept thinking how Monsignor would have enjoyed his own funeral It was magnificently Catholic and liturgical Bishop O Neill sang solemn high mass and the cardinal gave the final absolutions Thornton Hancock missus Lawrence the British and Italian ambassadors the papal delegate and a host of friends and priests were there yet the inexorable shears had cut through all these threads that Monsignor had gathered into his hands To Amory it was a haunting grief to see him lying in his coffin with closed hands upon his purple vestments His face had not changed and as he never knew he was dying it showed no pain or fear It was Amory s dear old friend his and the others for the church was full of people with daft staring faces the most exalted seeming the most stricken The cardinal like an archangel in cope and mitre sprinkled the holy water the organ broke into sound the choir began to sing the Requiem Eternam All these people grieved because they had to some extent depended upon Monsignor Their grief was more than sentiment for the crack in his voice or a certain break in his walk as Wells put it These people had leaned on Monsignor s faith his way of finding cheer of making religion a thing of lights and shadows making all light and shadow merely aspects of God People felt safe when he was near Of Amory s attempted sacrifice had been born merely the full realization of his disillusion but of Monsignor s funeral was born the romantic elf who was to enter the labyrinth with him 
125_121342_000091_000001	train-clean-100	He found something that he wanted had always wanted and always would want not to be admired as he had feared not to be loved as he had made himself believe but to be necessary to people to be indispensable he remembered the sense of security he had found in Burne 
none	none	Life opened up in one of its amazing bursts of radiance and Amory suddenly and permanently rejected an old epigram that had been playing listlessly in his mind Very few things matter and nothing matters very much On the contrary Amory felt an immense desire to give people a sense of security THE BIG MAN WITH GOGGLES On the day that Amory started on his walk to Princeton the sky was a colorless vault cool high and barren of the threat of rain It was a gray day that least fleshly of all weathers a day of dreams and far hopes and clear visions It was a day easily associated with those abstract truths and purities that dissolve in the sunshine or fade out in mocking laughter by the light of the moon The trees and clouds were carved in classical severity the sounds of the countryside had harmonized to a monotone metallic as a trumpet breathless as the Grecian urn The day had put Amory in such a contemplative mood that he caused much annoyance to several motorists who were forced to slow up considerably or else run him down So engrossed in his thoughts was he that he was scarcely surprised at that strange phenomenon cordiality manifested within fifty miles of Manhattan when a passing car slowed down beside him and a voice hailed him He looked up and saw a magnificent Locomobile in which sat two middle aged men one of them small and anxious looking apparently an artificial growth on the other who was large and begoggled and imposing Do you want a lift asked the apparently artificial growth glancing from the corner of his eye at the imposing man as if for some habitual silent corroboration You bet I do Thanks The chauffeur swung open the door and climbing in Amory settled himself in the middle of the back seat He took in his companions curiously The chief characteristic of the big man seemed to be a great confidence in himself set off against a tremendous boredom with everything around him That part of his face which protruded under the goggles was what is generally termed strong rolls of not undignified fat had collected near his chin somewhere above was a wide thin mouth and the rough model for a Roman nose and below his shoulders collapsed without a struggle into the powerful bulk of his chest and belly He was excellently and quietly dressed Amory noticed that he was inclined to stare straight at the back of the chauffeur s head as if speculating steadily but hopelessly some baffling hirsute problem The smaller man was remarkable only for his complete submersion in the personality of the other He was of that lower secretarial type who at forty have engraved upon their business cards Assistant to the President and without a sigh consecrate the rest of their lives to second hand mannerisms Going far asked the smaller man in a pleasant disinterested way Quite a stretch Hiking for exercise No responded Amory succinctly I m walking because I can t afford to ride Oh Then again Are you looking for work Because there s lots of work he continued rather testily All this talk of lack of work The West is especially short of labor He expressed the West with a sweeping lateral gesture Amory nodded politely Have you a trade No Amory had no trade Clerk eh No Amory was not a clerk Whatever your line is said the little man seeming to agree wisely with something Amory had said now is the time of opportunity and business openings He glanced again toward the big man as a lawyer grilling a witness glances involuntarily at the jury Amory decided that he must say something and for the life of him could think of only one thing to say Of course I want a great lot of money The little man laughed mirthlessly but conscientiously That s what every one wants nowadays but they don t want to work for it A very natural healthy desire Almost all normal people want to be rich without great effort except the financiers in problem plays who want to crash their way through Don t you want easy money Of course not said the secretary indignantly But continued Amory disregarding him being very poor at present I am contemplating socialism as possibly my forte Both men glanced at him curiously These bomb throwers The little man ceased as words lurched ponderously from the big man s chest If I thought you were a bomb thrower I d run you over to the Newark jail That s what I think of Socialists Amory laughed What are you asked the big man one of these parlor Bolsheviks one of these idealists I must say I fail to see the difference The idealists loaf around and write the stuff that stirs up the poor immigrants Well said Amory if being an idealist is both safe and lucrative I might try it What s your difficulty Lost your job Not exactly but well call it that What was it Writing copy for an advertising agency Lots of money in advertising Amory smiled discreetly Oh I ll admit there s money in it eventually Talent doesn t starve any more Even art gets enough to eat these days Artists draw your magazine covers write your advertisements hash out rag time for your theatres By the great commercializing of printing you ve found a harmless polite occupation for every genius who might have carved his own niche But beware the artist who s an intellectual also The artist who doesn t fit the Rousseau the Tolstoi the Samuel Butler the Amory Blaine Who s he demanded the little man suspiciously Well said Amory he s a he s an intellectual personage not very well known at present The little man laughed his conscientious laugh and stopped rather suddenly as Amory s burning eyes turned on him What are you laughing at These intellectual people Do you know what it means The little man s eyes twitched nervously Why it usually means It always means brainy and well educated interrupted Amory It means having an active knowledge of the race s experience Amory decided to be very rude He turned to the big man The young man he indicated the secretary with his thumb and said young man as one says bell boy with no implication of youth has the usual muddled connotation of all popular words You object to the fact that capital controls printing said the big man fixing him with his goggles Yes and I object to doing their mental work for them It seemed to me that the root of all the business I saw around me consisted in overworking and underpaying a bunch of dubs who submitted to it Here now said the big man you ll have to admit that the laboring man is certainly highly paid five and six hour days it s ridiculous You can t buy an honest day s work from a man in the trades unions You ve brought it on yourselves insisted Amory You people never make concessions until they re wrung out of you What people Your class the class I belonged to until recently those who by inheritance or industry or brains or dishonesty have become the moneyed class Do you imagine that if that road mender over there had the money he d be any more willing to give it up No but what s that got to do with it The older man considered No I ll admit it hasn t It rather sounds as if it had though In fact continued Amory he d be worse The lower classes are narrower less pleasant and personally more selfish certainly more stupid But all that has nothing to do with the question Just exactly what is the question Here Amory had to pause to consider exactly what the question was AMORY COINS A PHRASE When life gets hold of a brainy man of fair education began Amory slowly that is when he marries he becomes nine times out of ten a conservative as far as existing social conditions are concerned He may be unselfish kind hearted even just in his own way but his first job is to provide and to hold fast His wife shoos him on from ten thousand a year to twenty thousand a year on and on in an enclosed treadmill that hasn t any windows He s done Life s got him He s no help He s a spiritually married man Amory paused and decided that it wasn t such a bad phrase Some men he continued escape the grip Maybe their wives have no social ambitions maybe they ve hit a sentence or two in a dangerous book that pleased them maybe they started on the treadmill as I did and were knocked off Anyway they re the congressmen you can t bribe the Presidents who aren t politicians the writers speakers scientists statesmen who aren t just popular grab bags for a half dozen women and children He s the natural radical Yes said Amory He may vary from the disillusioned critic like old Thornton Hancock all the way to Trotsky Now this spiritually unmarried man hasn t direct power for unfortunately the spiritually married man as a by product of his money chase has garnered in the great newspaper the popular magazine the influential weekly so that missus Newspaper missus Magazine missus Weekly can have a better limousine than those oil people across the street or those cement people round the corner Why not It makes wealthy men the keepers of the world s intellectual conscience and of course a man who has money under one set of social institutions quite naturally can t risk his family s happiness by letting the clamor for another appear in his newspaper But it appears said the big man Where in the discredited mediums Rotten cheap papered weeklies All right go on Well my first point is that through a mixture of conditions of which the family is the first there are these two sorts of brains One sort takes human nature as it finds it uses its timidity its weakness and its strength for its own ends Opposed is the man who being spiritually unmarried continually seeks for new systems that will control or counteract human nature His problem is harder It is not life that s complicated it s the struggle to guide and control life That is his struggle He is a part of progress the spiritually married man is not The big man produced three big cigars and proffered them on his huge palm The little man took one Amory shook his head and reached for a cigarette Go on talking said the big man I ve been wanting to hear one of you fellows GOING FASTER Modern life began Amory again changes no longer century by century but year by year ten times faster than it ever has before populations doubling civilizations unified more closely with other civilizations economic interdependence racial questions and we re dawdling along My idea is that we ve got to go very much faster He slightly emphasized the last words and the chauffeur unconsciously increased the speed of the car Amory and the big man laughed the little man laughed too after a pause Every child said Amory should have an equal start If his father can endow him with a good physique and his mother with some common sense in his early education that should be his heritage If the father can t give him a good physique if the mother has spent in chasing men the years in which she should have been preparing herself to educate her children so much the worse for the child He shouldn t be artificially bolstered up with money sent to these horrible tutoring schools dragged through college Every boy ought to have an equal start All right said the big man his goggles indicating neither approval nor objection Next I d have a fair trial of government ownership of all industries That s been proven a failure No it merely failed If we had government ownership we d have the best analytical business minds in the government working for something besides themselves We d have Mackays instead of Burlesons we d have Morgans in the Treasury Department we d have Hills running interstate commerce We d have the best lawyers in the Senate They wouldn t give their best efforts for nothing McAdoo No said Amory shaking his head Money isn t the only stimulus that brings out the best that s in a man even in America You said a while ago that it was It is right now But if it were made illegal to have more than a certain amount the best men would all flock for the one other reward which attracts humanity honor The big man made a sound that was very like boo That s the silliest thing you ve said yet No it isn t silly It s quite plausible If you d gone to college you d have been struck by the fact that the men there would work twice as hard for any one of a hundred petty honors as those other men did who were earning their way through Kids child s play scoffed his antagonist Not by a darned sight unless we re all children Did you ever see a grown man when he s trying for a secret society or a rising family whose name is up at some club They ll jump when they hear the sound of the word The idea that to make a man work you ve got to hold gold in front of his eyes is a growth not an axiom We ve done that for so long that we ve forgotten there s any other way We ve made a world where that s necessary Let me tell you Amory became emphatic if there were ten men insured against either wealth or starvation and offered a green ribbon for five hours work a day and a blue ribbon for ten hours work a day nine out of ten of them would be trying for the blue ribbon That competitive instinct only wants a badge If the size of their house is the badge they ll sweat their heads off for that If it s only a blue ribbon I damn near believe they ll work just as hard They have in other ages I don t agree with you I know it said Amory nodding sadly It doesn t matter any more though I think these people are going to come and take what they want pretty soon A fierce hiss came from the little man Machine guns Ah but you ve taught them their use The big man shook his head In this country there are enough property owners not to permit that sort of thing Amory wished he knew the statistics of property owners and non property owners he decided to change the subject But the big man was aroused When you talk of taking things away you re on dangerous ground How can they get it without taking it For years people have been stalled off with promises Socialism may not be progress but the threat of the red flag is certainly the inspiring force of all reform You ve got to be sensational to get attention Russia is your example of a beneficent violence I suppose Quite possibly admitted Amory Of course it s overflowing just as the French Revolution did but I ve no doubt that it s really a great experiment and well worth while Don t you believe in moderation You won t listen to the moderates and it s almost too late The truth is that the public has done one of those startling and amazing things that they do about once in a hundred years They ve seized an idea What is it That however the brains and abilities of men may differ their stomachs are essentially the same THE LITTLE MAN GETS HIS If you took all the money in the world said the little man with much profundity and divided it up in equ Oh shut up said Amory briskly and paying no attention to the little man s enraged stare he went on with his argument The human stomach he began but the big man interrupted rather impatiently I m letting you talk you know he said but please avoid stomachs I ve been feeling mine all day Anyway I don t agree with one half you ve said Government ownership is the basis of your whole argument and it s invariably a beehive of corruption Men won t work for blue ribbons that s all rot When he ceased the little man spoke up with a determined nod as if resolved this time to have his say out There are certain things which are human nature he asserted with an owl like look which always have been and always will be which can t be changed Amory looked from the small man to the big man helplessly Listen to that That s what makes me discouraged with progress Listen to that I can name offhand over one hundred natural phenomena that have been changed by the will of man a hundred instincts in man that have been wiped out or are now held in check by civilization What this man here just said has been for thousands of years the last refuge of the associated mutton heads of the world It negates the efforts of every scientist statesman moralist reformer doctor and philosopher that ever gave his life to humanity s service It s a flat impeachment of all that s worth while in human nature Every person over twenty five years old who makes that statement in cold blood ought to be deprived of the franchise The little man leaned back against the seat his face purple with rage Amory continued addressing his remarks to the big man These quarter educated stale minded men such as your friend here who think they think every question that comes up you ll find his type in the usual ghastly muddle One minute it s the brutality and inhumanity of these Prussians the next it s we ought to exterminate the whole German people They always believe that things are in a bad way now but they haven t any faith in these idealists One minute they call Wilson just a dreamer not practical a year later they rail at him for making his dreams realities They haven t clear logical ideas on one single subject except a sturdy stolid opposition to all change They don t think uneducated people should be highly paid but they won t see that if they don t pay the uneducated people their children are going to be uneducated too and we re going round and round in a circle That is the great middle class The big man with a broad grin on his face leaned over and smiled at the little man You re catching it pretty heavy Garvin how do you feel The little man made an attempt to smile and act as if the whole matter were so ridiculous as to be beneath notice But Amory was not through The theory that people are fit to govern themselves rests on this man If he can be educated to think clearly concisely and logically freed of his habit of taking refuge in platitudes and prejudices and sentimentalisms then I m a militant Socialist If he can t then I don t think it matters much what happens to man or his systems now or hereafter I am both interested and amused said the big man You are very young Which may only mean that I have neither been corrupted nor made timid by contemporary experience I possess the most valuable experience the experience of the race for in spite of going to college I ve managed to pick up a good education You talk glibly It s not all rubbish cried Amory passionately This is the first time in my life I ve argued Socialism It s the only panacea I know I m restless My whole generation is restless I m sick of a system where the richest man gets the most beautiful girl if he wants her where the artist without an income has to sell his talents to a button manufacturer Even if I had no talents I d not be content to work ten years condemned either to celibacy or a furtive indulgence to give some man s son an automobile But if you re not sure That doesn t matter exclaimed Amory My position couldn t be worse A social revolution might land me on top Of course I m selfish It seems to me I ve been a fish out of water in too many outworn systems I was probably one of the two dozen men in my class at college who got a decent education still they d let any well tutored flathead play football and I was ineligible because some silly old men thought we should all profit by conic sections I loathed the army I loathed business I m in love with change and I ve killed my conscience So you ll go along crying that we must go faster That at least is true Amory insisted Reform won t catch up to the needs of civilization unless it s made to A laissez faire policy is like spoiling a child by saying he ll turn out all right in the end He will if he s made to But you don t believe all this Socialist patter you talk I don t know Until I talked to you I hadn t thought seriously about it I wasn t sure of half of what I said You puzzle me said the big man but you re all alike They say Bernard Shaw in spite of his doctrines is the most exacting of all dramatists about his royalties To the last farthing Well said Amory I simply state that I m a product of a versatile mind in a restless generation with every reason to throw my mind and pen in with the radicals Even if deep in my heart I thought we were all blind atoms in a world as limited as a stroke of a pendulum I and my sort would struggle against tradition try at least to displace old cants with new ones I ve thought I was right about life at various times but faith is difficult One thing I know If living isn t a seeking for the grail it may be a damned amusing game For a minute neither spoke and then the big man asked What was your university Princeton The big man became suddenly interested the expression of his goggles altered slightly I sent my son to Princeton Did you Perhaps you knew him His name was Jesse Ferrenby He was killed last year in France I knew him very well In fact he was one of my particular friends He was a quite a fine boy We were very close Amory began to perceive a resemblance between the father and the dead son and he told himself that there had been all along a sense of familiarity Jesse Ferrenby the man who in college had borne off the crown that he had aspired to It was all so far away What little boys they had been working for blue ribbons The car slowed up at the entrance to a great estate ringed around by a huge hedge and a tall iron fence Won t you come in for lunch Amory shook his head Thank you mister Ferrenby but I ve got to get on The big man held out his hand Amory saw that the fact that he had known Jesse more than outweighed any disfavor he had created by his opinions What ghosts were people with which to work Even the little man insisted on shaking hands Good by shouted mister Ferrenby as the car turned the corner and started up the drive Good luck to you and bad luck to your theories Same to you sir cried Amory smiling and waving his hand OUT OF THE FIRE OUT OF THE LITTLE ROOM Eight hours from Princeton Amory sat down by the Jersey roadside and looked at the frost bitten country Nature as a rather coarse phenomenon composed largely of flowers that when closely inspected appeared moth eaten and of ants that endlessly traversed blades of grass was always disillusioning nature represented by skies and waters and far horizons was more likable Frost and the promise of winter thrilled him now made him think of a wild battle between saint Regis and Groton ages ago seven years ago and of an autumn day in France twelve months before when he had lain in tall grass his platoon flattened down close around him waiting to tap the shoulders of a Lewis gunner He saw the two pictures together with somewhat the same primitive exaltation two games he had played differing in quality of acerbity linked in a way that differed them from Rosalind or the subject of labyrinths which were after all the business of life I am selfish he thought This is not a quality that will change when I see human suffering or lose my parents or help others This selfishness is not only part of me It is the most living part It is by somehow transcending rather than by avoiding that selfishness that I can bring poise and balance into my life There is no virtue of unselfishness that I cannot use I can make sacrifices be charitable give to a friend endure for a friend lay down my life for a friend all because these things may be the best possible expression of myself yet I have not one drop of the milk of human kindness The problem of evil had solidified for Amory into the problem of sex He was beginning to identify evil with the strong phallic worship in Brooke and the early Wells Inseparably linked with evil was beauty beauty still a constant rising tumult soft in Eleanor s voice in an old song at night rioting deliriously through life like superimposed waterfalls half rhythm half darkness Amory knew that every time he had reached toward it longingly it had leered out at him with the grotesque face of evil Beauty of great art beauty of all joy most of all the beauty of women After all it had too many associations with license and indulgence Weak things were often beautiful weak things were never good And in this new loneness of his that had been selected for what greatness he might achieve beauty must be relative or itself a harmony it would make only a discord In a sense this gradual renunciation of beauty was the second step after his disillusion had been made complete He felt that he was leaving behind him his chance of being a certain type of artist It seemed so much more important to be a certain sort of man His mind turned a corner suddenly and he found himself thinking of the Catholic Church The idea was strong in him that there was a certain intrinsic lack in those to whom orthodox religion was necessary and religion to Amory meant the Church of Rome Quite conceivably it was an empty ritual but it was seemingly the only assimilative traditionary bulwark against the decay of morals Until the great mobs could be educated into a moral sense some one must cry Thou shalt not Yet any acceptance was for the present impossible He wanted time and the absence of ulterior pressure He wanted to keep the tree without ornaments realize fully the direction and momentum of this new start The afternoon waned from the purging good of three o clock to the golden beauty of four Afterward he walked through the dull ache of a setting sun when even the clouds seemed bleeding and at twilight he came to a graveyard There was a dusky dreamy smell of flowers and the ghost of a new moon in the sky and shadows everywhere On an impulse he considered trying to open the door of a rusty iron vault built into the side of a hill a vault washed clean and covered with late blooming weepy watery blue flowers that might have grown from dead eyes sticky to the touch with a sickening odor Amory wanted to feel William Dayfield eighteen sixty four He wondered that graves ever made people consider life in vain Somehow he could find nothing hopeless in having lived All the broken columns and clasped hands and doves and angels meant romances He fancied that in a hundred years he would like having young people speculate as to whether his eyes were brown or blue and he hoped quite passionately that his grave would have about it an air of many many years ago It seemed strange that out of a row of Union soldiers two or three made him think of dead loves and dead lovers when they were exactly like the rest even to the yellowish moss Long after midnight the towers and spires of Princeton were visible with here and there a late burning light and suddenly out of the clear darkness the sound of bells As an endless dream it went on the spirit of the past brooding over a new generation the chosen youth from the muddled unchastened world still fed romantically on the mistakes and half forgotten dreams of dead statesmen and poets Here was a new generation shouting the old cries learning the old creeds through a revery of long days and nights destined finally to go out into that dirty gray turmoil to follow love and pride a new generation dedicated more than the last to the fear of poverty and the worship of success grown up to find all Gods dead all wars fought all faiths in man shaken Amory sorry for them was still not sorry for himself art politics religion whatever his medium should be he knew he was safe now free from all hysteria he could accept what was acceptable roam grow rebel sleep deep through many nights There was no God in his heart he knew his ideas were still in riot there was ever the pain of memory the regret for his lost youth yet the waters of disillusion had left a deposit on his soul responsibility and a love of life the faint stirring of old ambitions and unrealized dreams But oh Rosalind Rosalind It s all a poor substitute at best he said sadly And he could not tell why the struggle was worth while why he had determined to use to the utmost himself and his heritage from the personalities he had passed He stretched out his arms to the crystalline radiant sky I know myself he cried but that is all Appendix Production notes for eBook edition eleven The primary feature of edition eleven is restoration of em dashes which are missing from edition ten My favorite instance is I won t belong rather than I won t be long Characters which are eight bit in the printed text were misrepresented in edition ten Edition ten had some end of paragraph problems A handful of other minor errors are corrected Two volumes served as reference for edition eleven a nineteen sixty reprint and an undated reprint produced sometime after nineteen forty eight There are a number of differences between the volumes Evidence suggests that the nineteen sixty reprint has been somewhat modernized and that the undated reprint is a better match for the original nineteen twenty printing Therefore when the volumes differ edition eleven more closely follows the undated reprint In edition eleven underscores are used to denote words and phrases italicized for emphasis There is a section of text in book two chapter three beginning with When Vanity kissed Vanity which is referred to as poetry but is formatted as prose I considered but decided against introducing an eight bit version of edition eleven in large part because the bulk of the eight bit usage as found in the nineteen sixty reprint consists of words commonly used in their seven bit form Aeschylus blase cafe debut debutante elan elite Encyclopaedia matinee minutiae paean regime soupcon unaesthetic Less commonly used eight bit word forms in this book include anaemic bleme coeur manoeuvered mediaevalist tete a tete and the name Borge End of Project Gutenberg s This Side of Paradise by F Scott Fitzgerald END OF THIS
