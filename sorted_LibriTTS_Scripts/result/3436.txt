b Tale of the Second Eunuch Kafur nine Tale of King Omar Bin Al Nu uman and His Sons Sharrkan and Zau Al Makan a Tale of Taj Al Muluk and the Princess Dunya aa Tale of Aziz and Azizah The Book Of The THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT Nur Al Din Ali and the Damsel Anis Al Jalis Quoth Shahrazad FN one It hath reached me O auspicious King of intelligence penetrating that there was amongst the Kings of Bassorah FN two a King who loved the poor and needy and cherished his lieges and gave of his wealth to all who believed in Mohammed whom Allah bless and assain and he was even as one of the poets described him A King who when hosts of the foe invade Receives them with lance lunge and sabre sway Writes his name on bosoms in thin red lines And scatters the horsemen in wild dismay FN three His name was King Mohammed bin Sulayman al Zayni and he had two Wazirs one called Al Mu in son of Sawi and the other Al Fazl son of Khakan Now Al Fazl was the most generous of the people of his age upright of life so that all hearts united in loving him and the wise flocked to him for counsel whilst the subjects used to pray for his long life because he was a compendium of the best qualities encouraging the good and lief and preventing evil and mischief But the Wazir Mu in bin Sawi on the contrary hated folk FN four and loved not the good and was a mere compound of ill even as was said of him Hold to nobles sons of nobles tis ever Nature s test That nobles born of nobles shall excel in noble deed And shun the mean of soul meanly bred for tis the law Mean deeds come of men who are mean of blood and breed And as much as the people loved and fondly loved Al Fazl bin Khakan so they hated and thoroughly hated the mean and miserly Mu in bin Sawi It befel one day by the decree of the Decreer that King Mohammed bin Sulayman al Zayni being seated on his throne with his officers of state about him summoned his Wazir Al Fazl and said to him I wish to have a slave girl of passing beauty perfect in loveliness exquisite in symmetry and endowed with all praiseworthy gifts Said the courtiers Such a girl is not to be bought for less than ten thousand gold pieces whereupon the Sultan called out to his treasurer and said Carry ten thousand dinars to the house of Al Fazl bin Khakan The treasurer did the King s bidding and the Minister went away after receiving the royal charge to repair to the slave bazar every day and entrust to brokers the matter aforesaid Moreover the King issued orders that girls worth above a thousand gold pieces should not be bought or sold without being first displayed to the Wazir Accordingly no broker purchased a slave girl ere she had been paraded before the minister but none pleased him till one day a dealer came to the house and found him taking horse and intending for the palace So he caught hold of his stirrup saying O thou who givest to royal state sweet savour Thou rt a Wazir shalt never fail of favour Dead Bounty thou hast raised to life for men Ne er fail of Allah s grace such high endeavour Then quoth he O my lord that surpassing object for whom the gracious mandate was issued is at last found FN five and quoth the Wazir Here with her to me So he went away and returned after a little bringing a damsel in richest raiment robed a maid spear straight of stature and five feet tall budding of bosom with eyes large and black as by Kohl traced and dewy lips sweeter than syrup or the sherbet one sips a virginette smooth cheeked and shapely faced whose slender waist with massive hips was engraced a form more pleasing than branchlet waving upon the top most trees and a voice softer and gentler than the morning breeze even as saith one of those who have described her Strange is the charm which dights her brows like Luna s disk that shine O sweeter taste than sweetest Robb FN six or raisins of the vine A throne th Empyrean keeps for her in high and glorious state For wit and wisdom wandlike form and graceful bending line She in the Heaven of her face FN seven the seven fold stars displays That guard her cheeks as satellites against the spy s design If man should cast a furtive glance or steal far look at her His heart is burnt by devil bolts shot by those piercing eyne When the Wazir saw her she made him marvel with excess of admiration so he turned perfectly pleased to the broker and asked What is the price of this girl whereto he answered Her market value stands at ten thousand dinars but her owner swears that this sum will not cover the cost of the chickens she hath eaten the wine she hath drunken and the dresses of honour bestowed upon her instructor for she hath learned calligraphy and syntax and etymology the commentaries of the Koran the principles of law and religion the canons of medicine and the calendar and the art of playing on musical instruments FN eight Said the Wazir Bring me her master So the broker brought him at once and behold he was a Persian of whom there was left only what the days had left for he was as a vulture bald and scald and a wall trembling to its fall Time had buffetted him with sore smart yet was he not willing this world to depart even as said the poet Time hath shattered all my frame Oh how time hath shattered me Time with lordly might can tame Manly strength and vigour free Time was in my youth that none Sped their way more fleet and fast Time is and my strength is gone Youth is sped and speed is past FN nine The Wazir asked him Art thou content to sell this slave girl to the Sultan for ten thousand dinars and the Persian answered By Allah if I offer her to the King for naught it were but my devoir FN ten So the Minister bade bring the monies and saw them weighed out to the Persian who stood up before him and said By the leave of our lord the Wazir I have somewhat to say and the Wazir replied Out with all thou hast It is my opinion continued the slave dealer that thou shouldst not carry the maid to the King this day for she is newly off a journey the change of air FN eleven hath affected her and the toils of trouble have fretted her But keep her quiet in thy palace some ten days that she may recover her looks and become again as she was Then send her to the Hammam and clothe her in the richest of clothes and go up with her to the Sultan this will be more to thy profit The Wazir pondered the Persian s words and approved of their wisdom so he carried her to his palace where he appointed her private rooms and allowed her every day whatever she wanted of meat and drink and so forth And on this wise she abode a while Now the Wazir Al Fazl had a son like the full moon when sheeniest dight with face radiant in light cheeks ruddy bright and a mole like a dot of ambergris on a downy site as said of him the poet and said full right A moon which blights you FN twelve if you dare behold A branch which folds you in its waving fold Locks of the Zanj FN thirteen and golden glint of hair Sweet gait and form a spear to have and hold Ah hard of heart with softest slenderest waist That evil to this weal why not remould FN fourteen Were thy form s softness placed in thy heart Ne er would thy lover find thee harsh and cold Oh thou accuser be my love s excuser Nor chide if love pangs deal me woes untold I bear no blame tis all my hear and eyne So leave thy blaming let me yearn and pine Now the handsome youth knew not the affair of the damsel and his father had enjoined her closely saying Know O my daughter that I have bought thee as a bedfellow for our King Mohammed bin Sulayman al Zayni and I have a son who is a Satan for girls and leaves no maid in the neighbourhood without taking her maidenhead so be on thy guard against him and beware of letting him see thy face or hear they voice Hearkening and obedience said the girl and he left her and fared forth Some days after this it happened by decree of Destiny that the damsel repaired to the baths in the house where some of the slave women bathed her after which she arrayed herself in sumptuous raiment and her beauty and loveliness were thereby redoubled Then she went in to the Wazir s wife and kissed her hand and the dame said to her Naiman May it benefit thee FN fifteen O Anis al Jalis FN sixteen Are not our baths handsome O my mistress she replied I lacked naught there save thy gracious presence Thereupon the lady said to her slave women Come with us to the Hammam for it is some days since we went there they answered To hear is to obey and rose and all accompanied her Now she had set two little slave girls to keep the door of the private chamber wherein was Anis al Jalis and had said to them Suffer none go in to the damsel Presently as the beautiful maiden sat resting in her rooms suddenly came in the Wazir s son whose name was Nur al Din Ali FN seventeen and asked after his mother and her women to which the two little slave girls replied They are in the Hammam But the damsel Anis al Jalis had heard from within Nur al Din Ali s voice and had said to herself O would Heaven I saw what like is this youth against whom the Wazir warned me saying that he hath not left a virgin in the neighbourhood without taking her virginity by Allah I do long to have sight of him So she sprang to her feet with the freshness of the bath on her and stepping to the door looked at Nur al Din Ali and saw a youth like the moon in its full and the sight bequeathed her a thousand sighs The young man also glanced at her and the look make him heir to a thousand thoughts of care and each fell into Love s ready snare Then he stepped up to the two little slave girls and cried aloud at them whereupon both fled before him and stood afar off to see what he would do And behold he walked to the door of the damsel s chamber and opening it went in and asked her Art thou she my father bought for me and she answered Yes Thereupon the youth who was warm with wine came up to her and embraced her then he took her legs and passed them round his waist and she wound her arms about his neck and met him with kisses and murmurs of pleasure and amorous toyings Next he sucked her tongue and she sucked his and lastly he loosed the strings of her petticoat trousers and abated her maidenhead When the two little slave girls saw their young master get in unto the damsel Anis al Jalis they cried out and shrieked so as soon as the youth had had his wicked will of her he rose and fled forth fearing the consequences of his ill doing When the Wazir s wife heard the slave girls cries she sprang up and came out of the baths with the perspiration pouring from her face saying What is this unseemly clamour in the house FN eighteen Then she came up to the two little slave girls and asked them saying Fie upon you what is the matter and both answered Verily our lord Nur al Din came in and beat us so we fled then he went up to Anis al Jalis and threw his arms round her and we know not what he did after that but when we cried out to thee he ran away Upon this the lady went to Anis al Jalis and said to her What tidings O my lady she answered as I was sitting here lo a handsome young man came in and said to me Art thou she my father bought for me and I answered Yes for by Allah O mistress mine I believed that his words were true and he instantly came in and embraced me Did he nought else with thee but this quoth the lady and quoth she Indeed he did But he did it only three times He did not leave thee without dishonouring thee cried the Wazir s wife and fell to weeping and buffetting her face she and the girl and all the handmaidens fearing lest Nur al Din s father should kill him FN nineteen Whilst they were thus in came the Wazir and asked what was the matter and his wife said to him Swear that whatso I tell thee thou wilt attend to it I will answered he So she related to him what his son had done whereat he was much concerned and rent his raiment and smote his face till his nose bled and plucked out his beard by the handful Do not kill thyself said his wife I will give thee ten thousand dinars her price of my own money But he raised his head and cried Out upon thee I have no need of her purchase money my fear is lest life as well as money go O my lord and how is that Wottest thou not that yonder standeth our enemy Al Mu in bin Sawi who as soon as he shall hear of this matter will go up to the Sultan And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Thirty fifth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir said to his wife Wottest thou not that yonder standeth our enemy Al Mu in bin Sawi who as soon as he hears of this matter will go up to the Sultan and say to him Thy Wazir who thou wilt have it loveth thee took from thee ten thousand ducats and bought therewith a slave girl whose like none ever beheld but when he saw her she pleased him and he said to his son Take her thou art worthier of her than the Sultan So he took her and did away with her virginity and she is now in his house The King will say Thou liest to which he will reply With thy leave I will fall upon him unawares and bring her to thee The King will give him warranty for this and he will come down upon the house and will take the girl and present her to the Sultan who will question her and she will not be able to deny the past Then mine enemy will say O my lord thou wottest that I give thee the best of counsel but I have not found favour in thine eyes Thereupon the Sultan will make an example of me and I shall be a gazing stock to all the people and my life will be lost Quoth his wife Let none know of this thing which hath happened privily and commit thy case to Allah and trust in Him to save thee from such strait for He who knoweth the future shall provide for the future With this she brought the Wazir a cup of wine and his heart was quieted and he ceased to feel wrath and fear Thus far concerning him but as regards his son Nur al Din Ali fearing the consequence of his misdeed he abode his day long in the flower garden and came back only at night to his mother s apartment where he slept and rising before dawn returned to the gardens He ceased not to do thus for two whole months without showing his face to his parent till at last his mother said to his father O my lord shall we lose our boy as well as the girl If matters continue long in this way he will flee from us And what to do asked he and she answered Do thou watch this night and when he cometh seize on him and frighten him I will rescue him from thee and do thou make peace with him and give him the damsel to wife for she loveth him as he loveth her And I will pay thee her price So the Minister say up that night and when his son came he seized him and throwing him down knelt on his breast and showed as thou he would cut his throat but his mother ran to the youth s succour and asked her husband What wouldest thou do with him He answered her I will split his weasand Said the son to the father Is my death then so light a matter to thee and his father s eyes welled with tears for natural affection moved him and he rejoined O my son how light was to thee the loss of my good and my life Quoth Nur al Din Hear O my father what the poet hath said Forgive me thee ward sinned I but the wise Ne er to the sinner shall deny his grace Thy foe may pardon sue when lieth he In lowest and thou holdest highest place Thereupon the Wazir rose from off his son s breast saying I forgive thee for his heart yearned to him and the youth kissed the hand of his sire who said O my son were I sure that thou wouldest deal justly by Anis al Jalis I would give her to thee O my father what justice am I to do to her I enjoin thee O my son not to take another wife or concubine to share with her nor sell her O my father I swear to thee that verily I will not do her injustice in either way Having sworn to that effect Nur al Din went in to the damsel and abode with her a whole year whilst Allah Almighty caused the King to forget the matter of the maiden and Al Mu in though the affair came to his ears dared not divulge it by reason of the high favour in which his rival stood with the Sultan At the end of the year Al Fazl went one day to the public baths and as he came out whilst he was still sweating the air struck him FN twenty and he caught a cold which turned to a fever then he took to his bed His malady gained ground and restlessness was longsome upon him and weakness bound him like a chain so he called out Hither with my son and when Nur al Din Ali came he said to him O my son know that man s lot and means are distributed and decreed and the end of days by all must be dree d and that every soul drain the cup of death is nature s need The he repeated these lines I die my death but He alone is great who dieth not And well I wot soon shall I die for death was made my lot A King there s not that dies and holds his kingdom in his hand For Sovranty the Kingdom is of Him who dieth not Then he continued O my son I have no charge to leave thee save that thou fear Allah and look to the issues of thine acts and bear in mind my injunctions anent Anis al Jalis O my father said Nur al Din who is like unto thee Indeed thou art famed for well doing and preachers offer prayers for thee in their pulpits Quoth Al Fazl O my son I hope that Allah Almighty may grant me acceptance Then he pronounced the Two Testimonies FN twenty one or Professions of the Faith and was recorded among the blessed The palace was filled with crying and lamentation and the news of his death reached the King and the city people wept even those at their prayers and women at household cares and the school children shed tears for Bin Khakan Then his son Nur al Din Ali arose and made ready his funeral and the Emirs and Wazirs and high Officers of State and city notables were present amongst them the Wazir al Mu in bin Sawi And as the bier went forth from the house some one in the crowd of mourners began to chant these lines On the fifth day I quitted al my friends for evermore And they laid me out and washed me on a slab without my door FN twenty two They stripped me of the clothes I was ever wont to wear And they clothed me in the clothes which till then I never wore On four men s necks they bore me and carried me from home To chapel and some prayed for him on neck they bore They prayed for me a prayer that no prostration knows FN twenty three They prayed for me who praised me and were my friends of yore And they laid me in a house with a ceiling vaulted o er And Time shall be no more ere it ope to me its door When they had shovelled in the dust over him and the crowd had dispersed Nur al Din returned home and he lamented with sobs and tears and the tongue of the case repeated these couplets On the fifth day at even tide they went away from me farewelled them as faring they made farewell my lot But my spirit as they went with them went and so I cried Ah return ye but replied she Alas return is not To a framework lere and lorn that lacketh blood and life A frame whereof remaineth naught but bones that rattle and rot Mine eyes are blind and cannot see quencht by the flowing tear Mine ears are dull and lost to sense they have no power to hear He abode a long time sorrowing for his father till one day as he was sitting at home there came a knocking at the door so he rose in haste and opening let in a man one of his father s intimates and who had been the Wazir s boon companion The visitor kissed Nur al Din s hand and said to him O my lord he who hath left the like of thee is not dead and this way went also the Chief of the Ancients and the Moderns FN twenty four O my lord Ali be comforted and leave sorrowing Thereupon Nur al Din rose and going to the guest saloon transported thither all he needed Then he assembled his companions and took his handmaid again and collecting round him ten of the sons of the merchants began to eat meat and drink wine giving entertainment after entertainment and lavishing his presents and his favours One day his Steward came to him and said O my lord Nur al Din hast thou not heard the saying Whoso spendeth and reckoneth not to poverty wendeth and recketh not And he repeated what the poet wrote I look to my money and keep it with care For right well I wot tis my buckler and brand Did I lavish my dirhams on hostilest foes FN twenty five I should truck my good luck by mine ill luck trepanned So I ll eat it and drink it and joy in my wealth And no spending my pennies on others I ll stand I will keep my purse close gainst whoever he be And a niggard in grain a true friend ne er I fand Far better deny him than come to say Lend And five fold the loan shall return to thy hand And he turns face aside and he sidles away While I stand like a dog disappointed unmanned Oh the sorry lot his who hath yellow boys none Though his genius and virtues shine bright as the sun O my master continued the Steward this lavish outlay and these magnificent gifts waste away wealth When Nur al Din Ali heard these words he looked at his servant and cried Of all thou hast spoken I will not heed one single word for I have heard the saying of the poet who saith An my palm be full of wealth and my wealth I ne er bestow A palsy take my hand and my foot ne er rise again Show my niggard who by niggardise e er rose to high degree Or the generous gifts generally hath slain And he pursued Know O Steward it is my desire that so long as thou hast money enough for my breakfast thou trouble me not with taking thought about my supper Thereupon the Steward asked Must it be so and he answered It must So the honest man went his way and Nur al Din Ali devoted himself to extravagance and if any of his cup companions chanced to say This is a pretty thing he would reply Tis a gift to thee or if another said O my lord such a house is handsome he would answer Take it it is thine After this reckless fashion he continued to live for a whole year giving his friends a banquet in the morning and a banquet in the evening and a banquet at midnight till one day as the company was sitting together the damsel Anis al Jalis repeated these lines Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well And feardest not what ills might deal thee Fate Thy nights so fair and restful cozened thee For peaceful nights bring woes of heavy weight When she had ended her verse behold somebody knocked at the door So Nur al Din rose to open it and one of his boon companions followed him without being perceived At the door he found his Steward and asked him What is the matter and he answered O my lord what I dreaded for thee hath come to pass How so Know that there remains not a dirham s worth less or more in my hands Here are my Daftars and account books showing both income and outlay and the registers of thine original property When Nur al Din heard these words he bowed his head and said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah When the man who had followed him privily to spy on him heard the Steward s words he returned to his friends and warned them saying Look ye well to what ye do Nur al Din is penniless and as the young host came back to his guests vexation showed itself in his face Thereupon one of the intimates rose and looking at the entertainer said to him O my lord may be thou wilt give me leave to retire And why so early retirement this day asked he and the other answered him My wife is in childbirth and I may not be absent from her indeed I must return and see how she does So he gave him leave whereupon another rose and said O my lord Nur al Din I wish now to go to my brother s for he circumciseth his son to day FN twenty six In short each and every asked permission to retire on some pretence or other till all the ten were gone leaving Nur al Din alone Then he called his slave girl and said to her O Anis al Jalis hast thou seen what case is mine And he related to her what the Steward had told him Then quoth she O my lord for many nights I had it in my mind to speak with thee of this matter but I heard thee repeating When the World heaps favours on thee pass on Thy favours to friends ere her hand she stay Largesse never let her when fain she comes Nor niggardise kept her from turning away When I heard these verses I held my peace and cared not to exchange a word with thee O Anis al Jalis said Nur al Din thou knowest that I have not wasted my wealth save on my friends especially these ten who have now left me a pauper and I think they will not abandon and desert me without relief By Allah replied she they will not profit thee with aught of aid Said he I will rise at once and go to them and knock at their doors it may be I shall get from them somewhat wherewith I may trade and leave pastime and pleasuring So he rose without stay or delay and repaired to a street wherein all his ten friends lived He went up to the nearest door and knocked whereupon a handmaid came out and asked him Who art thou and he answered Tell thy master that Nur al Din Ali standeth at the door and saith to him Thy slave kisseth thy hand and awaiteth thy bounty The girl went in and told her master who cried at her Go back and say My master is not at home So she returned to Nur al Din and said to him O my lord my master is out Thereupon he turned away and said to himself If this one be a whoreson knave and deny himself another may not prove himself such knave and whoreson Then he went up to the next door and sent in a like message to the house master who denied himself as the first had done whereupon he began repeating He is gone who when to his gate thou go saint Fed thy famisht maw with his boiled and roast When he had ended his verse he said By Allah there is no help but that I make trial of them all perchance there be one amongst them who will stand me in the stead of all the rest So he went the round of the ten but not one of them would open his door to him or show himself or even break a bit of bread before him whereupon he recited Like a tree is he who in wealth doth wone And while fruits he the folk to his fruit shall run But when bared the tree of what fruit it bare They leave it to suffer from dust and sun Perdition to all of this age I find Ten rogues for every righteous one Then he returned to his slave girl and his grief had grown more grievous and she said to him O my lord did I not tell thee none would profit thee with aught of aid And he replied By Allah not one of them would show me his face or know me O my lord quoth she sell some of the moveables and household stuff such as pots and pans little by little and expend the proceeds until Allah Almighty shall provide So he sold all of that was in the house till nothing remained when he turned to Anis al Jalis and asked her What shall we do now and she answered O my lord it is my advice that thou rise forthwith and take me down to the bazar and sell me Thou knowest that they father bought me for ten thousand dinars haply Allah may open thee a way to get the same price and if it be His will to bring us once more together we shall meet again O Anis al Jalis cried he by Allah it is no light matter for me to be parted from thee for a single hour By Allah O my lord she replied nor is it easy to me either but Need hath its own law as the poet said Need drives a man into devious roads And pathways doubtful of trend and scope No man to a rope FN twenty seven will entrust his weight Save for cause that calleth for case of rope Thereupon he rose to his feet and took her FN twenty eight whilst the tears rolled down his cheek like rain and he recited with the tongue of the case these lines Stay grant one parting look before we part Nerving my heart this severance to sustain But an this parting deal thee pain and bane Leave me to die of love and spare thee pain Then he went down with her to the bazar and delivered her to the broker and said to him O Hajj Hasan FN twenty nine I pray thee note the value of her thou hast to cry for sale O my lord Nur al Din quoth the broker the fundamentals are remembered FN thirty adding Is not this the Anis al Jalis whom thy father bought of me for ten thousand dinars Yes said Nur al Din Thereupon the broker went round to the merchants but found that all had not yet assembled So he waited till the rest had arrived and the market was crowded with slave girls of all nations Turks Franks and Circassians Abyssinians Nubians and Takruris FN thirty one Tartars Georgians and others when he came forward and standing cried aloud O merchants O men of money every round thing is not a walnut and every long thing a banana is not all reds are not meat nor all whites fat nor is every brown thing a date FN thirty two O merchants I have here this union pearl that hath no price at what sum shall I cry her Cry her at four thousand five hundred dinars quoth one of the traders The broker opened the door of sale at the sum named and as he was yet calling lo the Wazir Al Mu in bin Sawi passed through the bazar and seeing Nur al Din Ali waiting at one side said to himself Why is Khakan s son FN thirty three standing about here Hath this gallows bird aught remaining wherewith to buy slave girls Then he looked round and seeing the broker calling out in the market with all the merchants around him said to himself I am sure that he is penniless and hath brought hither the damsel Anis al Jalis for sale adding O how cooling and grateful is this to my heart Then he called the crier who came up and kissed the ground before him and he said to him I want this slave girl whom thou art calling for sale The broker dared not cross him so he answered O my lord Bismillah in Allah s name so be it and led forward the damsel and showed her to him She pleased him much whereat he asked O Hasan what is bidden for this girl and he answered Four thousand five hundred dinars to open the door of sale Quoth Al Mu in Four thousand five hundred is MY bid When the merchants heard this they held back and dared not bid another dirham wotting what they did of the Wazir s tyranny violence and treachery So Al Mu in looked at the broker and said to him Why stand still Go and offer four thousand dinars for me and the five hundred shall be for thyself Thereupon the broker went to Nur al Din and said O my lord thy slave is going for nothing And how so asked he The broker answered We had opened the biddings for her at four thousand five hundred dinars when that tyrant Al Mu in bin Sawi passed through the bazar and as he saw the damsel she pleased him so he cried to me Call me the buyer at four thousand dinars and thou shalt have five hundred for thyself I doubt not but that he knoweth that the damsel if thine and if he would pay thee down her price at once it were well but I know his injustice and violence he will give thee a written order upon some of his agents and will send after thee to say to them Pay him nothing So as often as though shalt go in quest of the coin they will say We ll pay thee presently and they will put thee off day after day and thou art proud of spirit till at last when they are wearied with thine importunity they will say Show us the cheque Then as soon as they have got hold of it they will tear it up and so thou wilt lose the girl s price When Nur al Din heard this he looked at the broker and asked him How shall this matter be managed and he answered I will give thee a counsel which if thou follow it shall bring thee complete satisfaction And what is that quoth Nur al Din Quoth the broker Come thou to me anon when I am standing in the middle of the market and taking the girl from my hand give her a sound cuffing and say to her Thou baggage I have kept my vow and brought thee down to the slave market because I swore an oath that I would carry thee from home to the bazar and make brokers cry thee for sale If thou do this perhaps the device will impose upon the Wazir and the people and they will believe that thou broughtest her not to the bazar but for the quittance of thine oath He replied Such were the best way Then the broker left him and returning into the midst of the market took the damsel by the hand and signed to the Wazir and said O my lord here is her owner With this up came Nur al Din Ali and snatching the girl from the broker s hand cuffed her soundly and said to her Shame on thee O thou baggage I have brought thee to the bazar for quittance of mine oath now get thee home and thwart me no more as is thy wont Woe to thee do I need thy price that I should sell thee The furniture of my house would fetch thy value many times over When Al Mu in saw this he said to Nur al Din Out on thee Hast thou anything left for selling or buying And he would have laid violent hands upon him but the merchants interposed for they all loved Nur al Din and the young man said to them Here am I in your hands and ye all know his tyranny By Allah cried the Wazir but for you I had slain him Then all signed with significant eyes to Nur al Din as much as to say Take thy wreak of him not one of us will come between thee and him Thereupon Nur al Din who was stout of heart as he was stalwart of limb went up to the Wazir and dragging him over the pommel of his saddle threw him to the ground Now there was in that place a puddling pit for brick clay FN thirty four into the midst of which he fell and Nur al Din kept pummelling and fisti cuffing him and one of the blows fell full on his teeth and his beard was dyed with his blood Also there were with the minister ten armed slaves who seeing their master entreated after this fashion laid hand on sword hilt and would have bared blades and fallen on Nur al Din to cut him down but the merchants and bystanders said to them This is a Wazir and that is the son of a Wazir haply they will make friends some time or other in which case you will forfeit the favour of both Or perchance a blow may befal your lord and you will all die the vilest of deaths so it were better for you not to interfere Accordingly they held aloof and when Nur al Din had made an end of thrashing the Wazir he took his handmaid and fared homewards Al Mu in also went his ways at once with his raiment dyed of three colours black with mud red with blood and ash coloured with brick clay When he saw himself in this state he bound a bit of matting FN thirty five round his neck and taking in hand two bundles of coarse Halfah grass FN thirty six went up to the palace and standing under the Sultan s windows cried aloud O King of the age I am a wronged man I am foully wronged So they brought him before the King who looked at him and behold it was the chief Minister whereupon he said O Wazir who did this deed by thee Al Mu in wept and sobbed and repeated these lines Shall the World oppress me when thou art in t In the lion s presence shall wolves devour Shall the dry all drink of thy tanks and I Under rain cloud thirst for the cooling shower O my lord cried he the like will befal every one who loveth and serveth thee well Be quick with thee quoth the Sultan and tell me how this came to pass and who did this deed by one whose honour is part of my honour Quoth the Wazir Know O my lord that I went out this day to the slave market to buy me a cookmaid when I saw there a damsel never in my life long saw I a fairer and I designed to buy her for our lord the Sultan so I asked the broker of her and of her owner and he answered She belongeth to Ali son of Al Fazl bin Khakan Some time ago our lord the Sultan gave his father ten thousand dinars wherewith to buy him a handsome slave girl and he bought this maiden who pleased him so he grudged her to our lord the Sultan and gave her to his own son When the father died the son sold all he had of houses and gardens and household gear and squandered the price till he was penniless Then he brought the girl to the market that he might sell her and he handed her over to the broker to cry and the merchants bid higher and higher on her until the price reached four thousand dinars whereupon quoth I to myself I will buy this damsel for our lord the Sultan whose money was paid for her So I said to Nur al Din O my son sell her to me for four thousand dinars When he heard my words he looked at me and cried O ill omened oldster I will sell her to a Jew or to a Nazarene but I will not sell her to thee I do not buy her for myself said I I buy her for our lord and benefactor the Sultan Hearing my words he was filled with rage and dragging me off my horse and I a very old man beat me unmercifully with his fists and buffeted me with his palms till he left me as thou seest and all this hath befallen me only because I thought to buy this damsel for thee Then the Wazir threw himself on the ground and lay there weeping and shivering When the Sultan saw his condition and heard his story the vein of rage started out between his eyes FN thirty seven and he turned to his body guard who stood before him forty white slaves smiters with the sword and said to them Go down forthright to the house built by the son of Khakan and sack it and raze it and bring to me his son Nur al Din with the damsel and drag them both on their faces with their arms pinioned behind them They replied To hear is to obey and arming themselves they set out for the house of Nur al Din Ali Now about the Sultan was a Chamerlain Alam FN thirty eight al Din Sanjar hight who had aforetime been Mameluke to Al Fazl but he had risen in the world and the Sultan had advanced him to be one of his Chamberlains When he heard the King s command and saw the enemies make them ready to slay his old master s son it was grievous to him so he went out from before the Sultan and mounting his beast rode to Nur al Din s house and knocked at the door Nur al Din came out and knowing him would have saluted him but he said O my master this is no time for greeting or treating Listen to what the poet said Fly fly with thy life if by ill overtaken Let thy house speak thy death by its builder forsaken For a land else than this land thou may saint reach my brother But thy life tho lieutenant ne er find in this world another FN thirty nine O Alam al Din what cheer asked Nur al Din and he answered Rise quickly and fly for thy life thou and the damsel for Al Mu in hath set a snare for you both and if you fall into his hands he will slay you The Sultan hath despatched forty sworders against you and I counsel you to flee ere harm can hurt you Then Sanjar put his hand to his purse and finding there forty gold pieces took them and gave them to Nur al Din saying O my lord receive these and journey with them Had I more I would give them to thee but this is not the time to take exception Thereupon Nur al Din went in to the damsel and told her what had happened at which she wrung her hands Then they fared forth at once from the city and Allah spread over them His veil of protection so that they reached the river bank where they found a vessel ready for sea Her skipper was standing amidships and crying Whoso hath aught to do whether in the way of provisioning or taking leave of his people or whoso hath forgotten any needful thing let him do it at once and return for we are about to sail and all of them saying There is naught left to be done by us O captain he cried to his crew Hallo there cast off the cable and pull up the mooring pole FN forty Quoth Nur al Din Whither bound O captain and quoth he To the House of Peace Baghdad And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Thirty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the skipper answered To the House of Peace Baghdad Nur al Din Ali and the damsel went on board and they launched the craft and shook out the sails and the ship sped forth as though she were a bird on wing even as said one of them and said right well Watch some tall ship she ll joy the sight of thee The breeze outstripping in her haste to flee As when a bird with widely spreading wings Leaveth the sky to settle on the sea So the vessel sailed on her fastest and the wind to her was fairest Thus far concerning them but as regards the Mamelukes they went to Nur al Din s mansion and breaking open the doors entered and searched the whole place but could find no trace of him and the damsel so they demolished the house and returning to the Sultan reported their proceedings whereupon quoth he Make search for them both wherever they may be and they answered Hearing is obeying The Wazir Al Mu in had also gone home after the Sultan had bestowed upon him a robe of honour and had set his heart at rest by saying None shall take blood wreak for thee save I and he had blessed the King and prayed for his long life and prosperity Then the Sultan bade proclaim about the city Oyez O ye lieges one and all It is the will of our lord the Sultan that whoso happeneth on Nur al Din Ali son of Al Fazl bin Khakan and bringeth him to the Sultan shall receive a robe of honour and one thousand gold pieces and he who hideth him or knoweth his abiding place and informeth not deserveth whatsoever pains and penalties shall befal him So all began to search for Nur al Din Ali but they could find neither trace nor tidings of him Meanwhile he and his handmaid sailed on with the wind right aft till they arrived in safety at Baghdad and the captain said to them This is Baghdad and tis the city where security is to be had Winter with his frosts hath turned away and Prime hath come his roses to display and the flowers are a glowing and the trees are blowing and the streams are flowing So Nur al Din landed he and his handmaid and giving the captain five dinars walked on a little way till the decrees of Destiny brought them among the gardens and they came to a place swept and sprinkled with benches along the walls and hanging jars filled with water FN forty one Overhead was a trellis of reed work and canes shading the whole length of the avenue and at the upper end was a garden gate but this was locked By Allah quoth Nur al Din to the damsel right pleasant is this place and she replied O my lord sit with me a while on this bench and let us take our ease So they mounted and sat them down on the bench after which they washed their faces and hands and the breeze blew cool on them and they fell asleep and glory be to Him who never sleepeth Not this garden was named the Garden of Gladness FN forty two and therein stood a belvedere hight the Palace of Pleasure and the Pavilion of Pictures the whole belonging to the Caliph Harun al Rashid who was wont when his breast was straitened with care to frequent garden and palace and there to sit The palace had eighty latticed windows and fourscore lamps hanging round a great candelabrum of gold furnished with wax candles and when the Caliph used to enter he would order the handmaids to throw open the lattices and light up the rooms and he would bid Ishak bin Ibrahim the cup companion and the slave girls to sing till his breast was broadened and his ailments were allayed Now the keeper of the garden Shaykh Ibrahim was a very old man and he had found from time to time when he went out on any business people pleasuring about the garden gate with their bona robas at which he was angered with exceeding anger FN forty three But he took patience till one day when the Caliph came to his garden and he complained of this to Harun al Rashid who said Whomsoever thou surprisest about the door of the garden deal with him as thou wilt Now on this day the Gardener chanced to be abroad on some occasion and returning found these two sleeping at the gate covered with a single mantilla whereupon said he By Allah good These twain know not that the Caliph hath given me leave to slay anyone I may catch at the door but I will give this couple a shrewd whipping that none may come near the gate in future So he cut a green palm frond FN forty four and went up to them and raising his arm till the white of his arm pit appeared was about to strike them when he bethought himself and said O Ibrahim wilt thou beat them unknowing their case Haply they are strangers or of the Sons of the Road FN forty five and the decrees of Destiny have thrown them here I will uncover their faces and look at them So he lifted up the mantilla from their heads and said They are a handsome couple it were not fitting that I should beat them Then he covered their faces again and going to Nur al Din s feet began to rub and shampoo them FN forty six whereupon the youth opened his eyes and seeing an old man of grave and reverend aspect rubbing his feet he was ashamed and drawing them in sat up Then he took Shaykh Ibrahim s hand and kissed it Quoth the old man O my son whence art thou and quoth he O my lord we two are strangers and the tears started from his eyes O my son said Shaykh Ibrahim know that the Prophet whom Allah bless and preserve hath enjoined honour to the stranger and added Wilt not thou arise O my son and pass into the garden and solace thyself by looking at it and gladden thy heart O my lord said Nur al Din to whom doth this garden belong and the other replied O my son I have inherited it from my folk Now his object in saying this was to set them at their ease and induce them to enter the garden So Nur al Din thanked him and rose he and the damsel and followed him into the garden and lo it was a garden and what a garden The gate was arched like a great hall and over walls and roof ramped vines with grapes of many colours the red like rubies and the black like ebonies and beyond it lay a bower of trelliced boughs growing fruits single and composite and small birds on branches sang with melodious recite and the thousand noted nightingale shrilled with her varied shright the turtle with her cooing filled the site the blackbird whistled like human wight FN forty seven and the ring dove moaned like a drinker in grievous plight The trees grew in perfection all edible growths and fruited all manner fruits which in pairs were bipartite with the camphor apricot the almond apricot and the apricot Khorasani hight the plum like the face of beauty smooth and bright the cherry that makes teeth shine clear by her sleight and the fig of three colours green purple and white There also blossomed the violet as it were sulphur on fire by night the orange with buds like pink coral and marguerite the rose whose redness gars the loveliest cheeks blush with despight and myrtle and gilliflower and lavender with the blood red anemone from Nu uman hight The leaves were all gemmed with tears the clouds had dight the chamomile smiled showing teeth that bite and Narcissus with his negro FN forty eight eyes fixed on Rose his sight the citrons shone with fruits embowled and the lemons like balls of gold earth was carpeted with flowers tinctured infinite for Spring was come brightening the place with joy and delight and the streams ran ringing to the birds gay singing while the rustling breeze upspringing attempered the air to temperance exquisite Shaykh Ibrahim carried them up into the pavilion and they gazed on its beauty and on the lamps aforementioned in the latticed windows and Nur al Din remembering his entertainments of time past cried By Allah this is a pleasant place it hath quenched in me anguish which burned as a fire of Ghaza wood FN forty nine Then they sat down and Shaykh Ibrahim set food before them and they ate till they were satisfied and washed their hands after which Nur al Din went up to one of the latticed windows and calling to his handmaid fell to gazing on the trees laden with all manner fruits Presently he turned to the Gardener and said to him O Shaykh Ibrahim hast thou no drink here for folk are wont to drink after eating The Shaykh brought him sweet water cool and pleasant but he said This is not the kind of drink I wanted Perchance thou wishest for wine Indeed I do O Shaykh I seek refuge from it with Allah it is thirteen years since I did this thing for the Prophet Abhak FN fifty cursed its drinker presser seller and carrier Hear two words of me Say on If yon cursed ass FN fifty one which standeth there be cursed will aught of his curse alight upon thee By no means Then take this dinar and these two dirhams and mount yonder ass and halting afar from the wine shop call the first man thou seest buying liquor and say to him Take these two dirhams for thyself and with this dinar buy me some wine and set it on the ass So shalt thou be neither the presser nor the buyer nor the carrier and no part of the curse will fall upon thee At this Shaykh Ibrahim laughed and said By Allah O my son I never saw one wilier of wit than thou art nor heard aught sweeter than thy speech So he did as he was bidden by Nur al Din who thanked him and said We two are now dependent on thee and it is only meet that thou comply with our wishes so bring us here what we require O my son replied he this is my buttery before thee and it was the store room provided for the Commander of the Faithful so go in and take whatso thou wilt for there is over and above what thou wantest Nur al Din then entered the pantry and found therein vessels of gold and silver and crystal set with all kinds of gems and was amazed and delighted with what he saw Then he took out what he needed and set it on and poured the wine into flagons and glass ewers whilst Shaykh Ibrahim brought them fruit and flowers and aromatic herbs Then the old man withdrew and sat down at a distance from them whilst they drank and made merry till the wine got the better of them so that their cheeks reddened and their eyes wantoned like the gazelle s and their locks became dishevelled and their brightness became yet more beautiful Then said Shaykh Ibrahim to himself What aileth me to sit apart from them Why should I not sit with them When shall I ever find myself in company with the like of these two that favour two moons So he stepped forward and sat down on the edge of the dais and Nur al Din said to him O my lord my life on thee come nearer to us He came and sat by them when Nur al Din filled a cup and looked towards the Shaykh and said to him Drink that thou mayest try the taste of it I take refuge from it with Allah replied he for thirteen years I have not done a thing of the kind Nur al Din feigned to forget he was there and drinking off the cup threw himself on the ground as if the drink had overcome him whereupon Anis al Jalis glanced at him and said O Shaykh Ibrahim see how this husband of mine treateth me and he answered O my lady what aileth him This is how he always serveth me cried she he drinketh awhile then falleth asleep and leaveth me alone with none to bear me company over my cup nor any to whom I may sing when the bowl goeth round Quoth the Shaykh and his mien unstiffened for that his soul inclined towards her By Allah this is not well Then she crowned a cup and looking towards him said By my life thou must take and drink it and not refuse to heal my sick heart So he put forth his hand and took it and drank it off and she filled a second and set it on the chandelier and said O master mine there is still this one left for thee By Allah I cannot drink it cried he what I have already drunk is enough for me but she rejoined By Allah there is no help for it So he took the cup and drank and she filled him a third which he took and was about to drink when behold Nur al Din rolled round and sat upright And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Thirty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Nur al Din sat upright and said Ho Shaykh Ibrahim what is this Did I not adjure thee a while ago and thou refusedst saying What I tis thirteen years ago since I have done such a thing By Allah quoth the Shaykh and indeed he was abashed no sin of mine this she forced me to do it Nur al Din laughed and they sat down again to wine and wassail but the damsel turned to her master and said in a whisper O my lord drink and do not press him that I may show thee some sport with him Then she began to fill her master s cup and he hers and so they did time after time till at last Shaykh Ibrahim looked at them and said What fashion of good fellowship is this Allah curse the glutton who keepeth the cup to himself Why dost thou not give me to drink O my brother What manners are these O blessed one At this the two laughed until they fell on their backs then they drank and gave him to drink and ceased not their carousal till a third part of the night was past Then said the damsel O Shaykh Ibrahim with thy leave I will get up and light one of these candles Do so he replied but light no more than one So she sprang to her feet and beginning with one candle lighted all the eighty and sat down again Presently Nur al Din said O Shaykh Ibrahim in what favour am I with thee May I not light one of these lamps Light one replied he and bother me no more in thy turn So he rose and lighted one lamp after another till he had lighted the whole eight and the palace seemed to dance with brilliancy Quoth the Shaykh and indeed intoxication had overcome him Ye two are bolder than I am Then he rose to his feet and opened all the lattices and sat down again and they fell to carousing and reciting verses till the place rang with their noisy mirth Now Allah the Decreer who decreeth all things and who for every effect appointeth a cause had so disposed that the Caliph was at that moment sitting in the light of the moon at one of the windows of his palace overlooking the Tigris He saw the blaze of the lamps and wax candles reflected in the river and lifting his eyes perceived that it came from the Garden Palace which was all ablaze with brilliancy So he cried Here to me with Ja afar the Barmaki and the last word was hardly spoken ere the Wazir was present before the Commander of the Faithful who cried at him O dog of a Minister hast thou taken from me this city of Baghdad without saying aught to me What words are these words asked Ja afar and the Caliph answered If Baghdad city were not taken from me the Palace of Pictures would not be illuminated with lamps and candles nor would its windows be thrown open Woe to thee who durst do a deed like this except the Caliphate had been taken from me Quoth Ja afar and indeed his side muscles trembled as he spoke Who told thee that the Palace of Pictures was illuminated and the windows thrown open Come hither and see replied the Caliph Then Ja afar came close to the Caliph and looking towards the garden saw the palace blazing with illumination that rayed through the gloom of the night and thinking that this might have been permitted by the keeper for some reason of his own he wished to make an excuse for him so quoth he O Commander of the Faithful Shaykh Ibrahim said to me last week O my lord Ja afar I much wish to circumcise my sons during the life of the Commander of the Faithful and thy life I asked What dost thou want and he answered Get me leave from the Caliph to hold the festival in the Garden Palace So said I to him Go circumcise them and I will see the Caliph and tell him Thereupon he went away and I forgot to let thee know O Ja afar said the Caliph thou hast committed two offences against me first in that thou didst no report to me secondly thou didst not give him what he sought for he came and told thee this only as excuse to ask for some small matter of money to help him with the outlay and thou gavest him nothing nor toldest me O Commander of the Faithful said Ja afar I forgot Now by the rights of my forefathers and the tombs of my forbears quoth the Caliph I will not pass the rest of this night save in company with him for truly he is a pious man who frequenteth the Elders of the Faith and the Fakirs and other religious mendicants and entertaineth them doubtless they are not assembled together and it may be that the prayer of one of them will work us weal both in this world and in the next Besides my presence may profit and at any rate be pleasing to Shaykh Ibrahim O Commander of the Faithful quoth Ja afar the greater part of the night is passed and at this time they will be breaking up Quoth the Caliph It matters not I needs must go to them So Ja afar held his peace being bewildered and knowing not what to do Then the Caliph rose to his feet and taking with him Ja afar and Masrur the eunuch sworder the three disguised themselves in merchants gear and leaving the City palace kept threading the streets till they reached the garden The Caliph went up to the gate and finding it wide open was surprised and said See O Ja afar how Shaykh Ibrahim hath left the gate open at this hour contrary to his custom They went in and walked on till they came under the pavilion when the Caliph said O Ja afar I wish to look in upon them unawares before I show myself that I may see what they are about and get sight of the elders for hitherto I have heard no sound from them nor even a Fakir calling upon the name of Allah FN fifty two Then he looked about and seeing a tall walnut tree said to Ja afar I will climb this tree for its branches are near the lattices and so look in upon them Thereupon he mounted the tree and ceased not climbing from branch to branch till he reached a bough which was right opposite one of the windows and here he took seat and looked inside the palace He saw a damsel and a youth as they were two moons glory be to Him who created them and fashioned them and by them Shaykh Ibrahim seated cup in hand and saying O Princess of fair ones drinking without music is nothing worth indeed I have heard a poet say Round with bit and little the bowl and cup Take either than moon FN fifty three in his sheen hath crowned Nor drink without music for oft I ve seen The horse drink best to the whistle s sound When the Caliph saw this the vein of wrath started up between his eyes and he came down and said to the Wazir O Ja afar never beheld I yet men of piety in such case so do thou mount this tree and look upon them lest the blessings of the blest be lost to thee Ja afar hearing the words of the Commander of the Faithful and being confounded by them climbed to the tree top and looking in saw Nur al Din and the damsel and Shaykh Ibrahim holding in his hand a brimming bowl At this sight he made sure of death and descending stood before the Commander of the Faithful who said to him O Ja afar praise be to Allah who hath made us of those that observe external ordinances of Holy Law and hath averted from us the sin of disguising ourselves after the manner of hypocrites FN fifty four But Ja afar could not speak a word for excess of confusion so the Caliph looked at him and said I wonder how they came hither and who admitted them into my pavilion But aught like the beauty of this youth and this damsel my eyes never yet saw Thou sayest sooth O our Lord the Sultan replied Ja afar and he hoped to propitiate the Caliph Harun al Rashid Then quoth the Caliph O Ja afar let us both mount the branch opposite the window that we may amuse ourselves with looking at them So the two climbed the tree and peering in heard Shaykh Ibrahim say O my lady I have cast away all gravity mine by the drinking of wine but tis not sweet save with the soft sounds of the lute strings it combine By Allah replied Anis al Jalis O Shaykh Ibrahim an we had but some instrument of music our joyance were complete Hearing this he rose to his feet and the Caliph said to Ja afar I wonder what he is about to do and Ja afar answered I know not The Shaykh disappeared and presently reappeared bringing a lute and the Caliph took not of it and knew it for that of Abu Ishak the Cup companion FN fifty five By Allah said the Caliph if this damsel sing ill I will crucify all of you but if she sing well I will forgive them and only gibbet thee O Allah cause her to sing vilely quoth Ja afar Asked the Caliph Why so and he answered If thou crucify us all together we shall keep one another company The Caliph laughed at his speech Presently the damsel took the lute and after looking at it and tuning it she played a measure which made all hearts yearn to her then she sang these lines O ye that can aid me a wretched lover Whom longing burns nor can rest restore me Though all you have done I have well deserved I take refuge with you so exult not o er me True I am weak and low and vile But I ll bear your will and whatso you bore me My death at your hands what brings it of glory I fear but your sin which of life forlore me Quoth the Caliph By Allah good O Ja afar never in my life have I heard a voice so enchanting as this Then haply the Caliph s wrath hath passed away said Ja afar and he replied Yes tis gone Thereupon they descended from the tree and the Caliph said to Ja afar I wish to go in and sit with them and hear the damsel sing before me O Commander of the Faithful replied Ja afar if thou go in to them they will be terribly troubled and Shaykh Ibrahim will assuredly die of fright But the Caliph answered O Ja afar thou must teach me some device wherewith to delude them and whereby I can foregather with them without their knowing me So they walked towards the Tigris pondering the matter and presently came upon a fisherman who stood fishing under the pavilion windows Now some time before this the Caliph being in the pavilion had called to Shaykh Ibrahim and asked him What noise is this I hear under the windows and he had answered It is voices of fisher folk catching fish so quoth the Caliph Go down and forbid them this place and he forbade them accordingly However that night a fisherman named Karim happening to pass by and seeing the garden gate open said to himself This is a time of negligence and I will take advantage of it to do a bit of fishing So he took his net and cast it but he had hardly done so when behold the Caliph come up single handed and standing hard by knew him and called aloud to him Ho Karim The fisherman hearing himself named turned round and seeing the Caliph trembled and his side muscles quivered as he cried By Allah O Commander of the Faithful I did it not in mockery of the mandate but poverty and a large family drove me to what thou seest Quoth the Caliph Make a cast in my name At this the fisherman was glad and going to the bank threw his net then waiting till it had spread out at full stretch and settled down hauled it up and found in it various kinds of fish The Caliph was pleased and said O Karim doff thy habit So he put off a gaberdine of coarse woollen stuff patched in an hundred places whereon the lice were rampant and a turband which had never been untwisted for three years but to which he had sown every rag he came upon The Caliph also pulled off his person two vests of Alexandrian and Ba lbak silk a loose inner robe and a long sleeved outer coat and said to the fisherman Take them and put them on while he assumed the foul gaberdine and filthy turband and drew a corner of the head cloth as a mouth veil FN fifty six before his face Then said he to the fisherman Get thee about thy business and the man kissed the Caliph s feet and thanked him and improvised the following couplets Thou hast granted more favours than ever I craved Thou hast satisfied needs which my heart enslaved I will thank thee and thank whileas life shall last And my bones will praise thee in grave engraved Hardly had the fisherman ended his verse when the lice began to crawl over the Caliph s skin and he fell to catching them on his neck with his right and left and throwing them from him while he cried O fisherman woe to thee what be this abundance of lice on thy gaberdine O my lord replied he they may annoy thee just at first but before a week is past thou wilt not feel them nor think of them The Caliph laughed and said to him Out on thee Shall I leave this gaberdine of thine so long on my body Quoth the fisherman I would say a word to thee but I am ashamed in presence of the Caliph and quoth he Say what thou hast to say It passed through my thought O Commander of the Faithful said the fisherman that since thou wishest to learn fishing so thou mayest have in hand an honest trade whereby to gain thy livelihood this my gaberdine besitteth thee right well FN fifty seven The Commander of the Faithful laughed at this speech and the fisherman went his way Then the Caliph took up the basket of fish and strewing a little green grass over it carried it to Ja afar and stood before him Ja afar thinking him to be Karim the fisherman feared for him and said O Karim what brought thee hither Flee for thy life for the Caliph is in the garden to night and if he see thee thy neck is gone At this the Caliph laughed and Ja afar recognized him and asked Can it be thou our lord the Sultan and he answered Yes O Ja afar and thou art my Wazir and I and thou came hither together yet thou knowest me not so how should Shaykh Ibrahim know me and he drunk Stay here till I came back to thee To hear is to obey said Ja afar Then the Caliph went up to the door of the pavilion and knocked a gentle knock whereupon said Nur al Din O Shaykh Ibrahim some one taps at the door Who goes there cried the Shaykh and the Caliph replied It is I O Shaykh Ibrahim Who art thou quoth he and quoth the other I am Karim the fisherman I hear thou hast a feast so I have brought thee some fish and of a truth tis good fish When Nur al Din heard the mention of fish he was glad he and the damsel and they both said to the Shaykh O our lord open the door and let him bring us his fish So Shaykh Ibrahim opened and the Caliph came in and he in fisherman guise and began by saluting them Said Shaykh Ibrahim Welcome to the blackguard the robber the dicer Let us see thy fish So the Caliph showed them his catch and behold the fishes were still alive and jumping whereupon the damsel exclaimed By Allah O my lord these are indeed fine fish would they were fried and Shaykh Ibrahim rejoined By Allah O my lady thou art right Then said he to the Caliph O fisherman why didst thou not bring us the fish ready fried Up now and cook them and bring them back to us On my head be thy commands said the Caliph I will fry thee a dish and bring it Said they Look sharp Thereupon he went and ran till he came up to Ja afar when he called to him Hallo Ja afar and he replied Here am I O Commander of the Faithful is all well They want the fish fried said the Caliph and Ja afar answered O Commander of the Faithful give it to me and I ll fry it for them By the tombs of my forbears quoth the Caliph none shall fry it but I with mine own hand So he went to the gardener s hut where he searched and found all that he required even to salt and saffron and wild marjoram and else besides Then he turned to the brasier and setting on the frying pan fried a right good fry When it was done he laid it on a banana leaf and gathering from the garden wind fallen fruits limes and lemons carried the fish to the pavilion and set the dish before them So the youth and the damsel and Shaykh Ibrahim came forward and ate after which they washed their hands and Nur al Din said to the Caliph By Allah O fisherman thou hast done us a right good deed this night Then he put hand in pouch and taking out three of the dinars which Sanjar had given him said O fisherman excuse me By Allah had I known thee before that which hath lately befallen me I had done away the bitterness of poverty from thy heart but take thou this as the best I can do for thee Then he threw the gold pieces to the Caliph who took them and kissed them and put them in pouch Now his sole object in doing all this was to hear the damsel sing so he said to Nur al Din Thou hast rewarded me most liberally but I beg of thy boundless bounty that thou let this damsel sing an air that I may hear her FN fifty eight So Nur al Din said O Anis al Jalis and she answered Yes and he continued By my life sing us something for the sake of this fisherman who wisheth so much to hear thee Thereupon she took the lute and struck the strings after she had screwed them tight and tuned them and sang these improvised verses The fawn of a maid hent her lute in hand And her music made us right mettlesome For her song gave hearing to ears stone deaf While Brava Brava exclaimed the dumb Then she played again and played so ravishingly that she charmed their wits and burst out improvising and singing these couplets You have honoured us visiting this our land And your splendour illumined the glooms that blent So tis due that for you I perfume my place With rose water musk and the camphor scent Hereupon the Caliph was agitated and emotion so overpowered him that he could not command himself for excess of pleasure and he exclaimed By Allah good by Allah good by Allah good FN fifty nine Asked Nur al Din O fisherman doth this damsel please thee and the Caliph answered Ay by Allah Whereupon said Nur al Din She is a gift to thee a gift of the generous who repenteth him not of his givings and who will never revoke his gift Then he sprang to his feet and taking a loose robe threw it over the fisherman and bade him receive the damsel and be gone But she looked at him and said O my lord art thou faring forth without farewell If it must be so at least stay till I bid thee good bye and make known my case And she began versifying in these verses When love and longing and regret are mine Must not this body show of ills a sign My love say not Thou soon shalt be consoled When state speaks state none shall allay my pine If living man could swim upon his tears I first should float on waters of these eyne O thou who in my heart infusedst thy love As water mingles in the cup with wine This was the fear I feared this parting blow O thou whose love my heart core ne er shall tyne O Bin Khakan my sought my hope my will O thou whose love this breast make wholly thine Against thy lord the King thou sinn dst for me And winnedst exile in lands peregrine Allah ne er make my lord repent my loss To cream FN sixty o men thou gavest me one right digne When she had ended her verses Nur al Din answered her with these lines She bade me farewell on our parting day And she wept in the fire of our bane and pains What wilt thou do when fro thee I m gone Quoth I say this to whom life remains When the Caliph heard her saying in her verse To Karim the cream of men thou gavest me his inclination for her redoubled and it seemed a hard matter and a grievous to part them so quoth he to the youth O my lord truly the damsel said in her verses that thou didst transgress against her master and him who owned her so tell me against whom didst thou transgress and who is it hath a claim on thee By Allah O fisherman replied Nur al Din there befel me and this damsel a wondrous tale and a marvellous matter an t were graven with needle gravers on the eye corners it would be a warner to whoso would be warned Cried the Caliph Wilt thou not tell me thy story and acquaint me with thy case Haply it may bring thee relief for Allah s aid is ever nearhand O fisherman said Nur al Din Wilt thou hear our history in verse or in prose Prose is a wordy thing but verses rejoined the Caliph are pearls on string Then Nur al Din bowed his head and made these couplets O my friend reft of rest no repose I command And my grief is redoubled in this far land Erst I had a father a kinder ne er was But he died and to Death paid the deodand When he went from me every matter went wrong Till my heart was nigh broken my nature unmanned He bought me a handmaid a sweeting who shamed A wand of the willow by Zephyr befanned I lavisht upon her mine heritage And spent like a nobleman puissant and grand Then to sell her compelled my sorrow increased The parting was sore but I mote not gainstand Now as soon as the crier had called her there bid A wicked old fellow a fiery brand So I raged with a rage that I could not restrain And snatched her from out of his hireling s hand When the angry curmudgeon made ready for blows And the fire of a fight kindled he and his band I smote him in fury with right and with left And his hide till well satisfied curried and tanned Then in fear I fled forth and lay hid in my house To escape from the snares which my foeman had spanned So the King of the country proclaimed my arrest When access to me a good Chamberlain fand And warned me to flee from the city afar Disappear disappoint what my enemies planned Then we fled from our home neath the wing of the night And sought us a refuge by Baghdad strand Of my riches I ve nothing on thee to bestow O Fisher except the fair gift thou hast scanned The loved of my soul and when I from her part Know for sure that I give thee the blood of my heart FN sixty one When he had ended his verse the Caliph said to him O my lord Nur al Din explain to me thy case more fully So he told him the whole story from beginning to end and the Caliph said to him Whither dost thou now intend Allah s world is wide replied he Quoth the Caliph I will write thee a letter to carry to the Sultan Mohammed bin Sulayman al Zayni which when he readeth he will not hurt nor harm thee in aught And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Thirty eighth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Caliph said to Nur al Din Ali I will write thee a letter to carry to the Sultan Mohammed bin Sulayman al Zayni which when he readeth he will not hurt nor harm thee in aught Nur al Din asked What is there in the world a fisherman who writeth to Kings Such a thing can never be and the Caliph answered Thou sayest sooth but I will tell thee the reason Know that I and he learnt in the same school under one schoolmaster and that I was his monitor Since that time Fortune befriended him and he is become a Sultan while Allah hath abased me and made me a fisherman yet I never send to him to ask aught but he doeth my desire nay though I should ask of him a thousand favours every day he would comply When Nur al Din heard this he said Good write that I may see So the Caliph took ink case and reed pen and wrote as follows In the name of Allah the Compassionating the Compassionate But after FN sixty two This letter is written by Harun al Rashid son of Al Mahdi to his highness Mohammed bin Sulayman al Zayni whom I have encompassed about with my favour and made my viceroy in certain of my dominions The bearer of these presents is Nur al Din Ali son of Fazl bin Khakan the Wazir As soon as they come to thy hand divest thyself forthright of the kingly dignity and invest him therewith so oppose not my commandment and peace be with thee He gave the letter to Nur al Din who took it and kissed it then put it in his turband and set out at once on his journey So far concerning him but as regards the Caliph Shaykh Ibrahim stared to him and he still in fisher garb and said O vilest of fishermen thou hast brought us a couple of fish worth a score of half dirhams FN sixty three and hast gotten three dinars for them and thinkest thou to take the damsel to boot When the Caliph heard this he cried out at him and signed to Masrur who discovered himself and rushed in upon him Now Ja afar had sent one of the gardener lads to the doorkeeper of the palace to fetch a suit of royal raiment for the Prince of the Faithful so the man went and returning with the suit kissed the ground before the Caliph and gave it him Then he threw of the clothes he had on FN sixty four and donned kingly apparel Shaykh Ibrahim was still sitting upon his chair and the Caliph tarried to behold what would come next But seeing the Fisherman become the Caliph Shaykh Ibrahim was utterly confounded and he could do nothing but bite his finger ends FN sixty five and say Would I knew whether am I asleep or am I awake At last the Caliph looked at him and cried O Shaykh Ibrahim what state is this in which I see thee Thereupon he recovered from his drunkenness and throwing himself upon the ground repeated these verses Pardon the sinful ways I did pursue Ruth from his lord to every slave is due Confession pays the fine that sin demands Where then is that which grace and mercy sue FN sixty six The Caliph forgave him and bade carry the damsel to the city palace where he set apart for her an apartment and appointed slaves to serve her saying to her Know that we have sent thy lord to be Sultan in Bassorah and Almighty Allah willing we will dispatch him the dress of investiture and thee with it Meanwhile Nur al Din Ali ceased not travelling till he reached Bassorah where he repaired to the Sultan s palace and he shouted a long shout FN sixty seven The Sultan heard him and sent for him and when he came into his presence he kissed the ground between his hands and producing the letter presented it to him Seeing the superscription in the writing of the Commander of the Faithful the Sultan rose to his feet and kissed it three times and after reading it said I hear and I obey Allah Almighty and the Commander of the Faithful Then he summoned the four Kazis FN sixty eight and the Emirs and was about to divest himself of the rule royal when behold in came Al Mu in bin Sawi The Sultan gave him the Caliph s letter and he read it then tore it to pieces and putting it into his mouth chewed it FN sixty nine and spat it out Woe to thee quoth the Sultan and indeed he was sore angered what induced thee to do this deed Now by thy life O our lord the Sultan replied Mu in this man hath never foregathered with the Caliph nor with his Wazir but he is a gallows bird a limb of Satan a knave who having come upon a written paper in the Caliph s hand some idle scroll hath made it serve his own end The Caliph would surely not send him to take the Sultanate from thee without the imperial autograph FN seventy and the diploma of investiture and he certainly would have despatched with him a Chamberlain or a Minister But he hath come alone and he never came from the Caliph no never never never What is to be done asked the Sultan and the Minister answered Leave him to me and I will take him and keep him away from thee and send him in charge of a Chamberlain to Baghdad city Then if what he says be sooth they will bring us back autograph and investiture and if not I will take my due out of this debtor When the Sultan heard the Minister s words he said Hence with thee and him too Al Mu in took trust of him from the King and carrying him to his own house cried out to his pages who laid him flat and beat him till he fainted Then he let put upon his feet heavy shackles and carried him to the jail where he called the jailor one Kutayt FN seventy one who came and kissed the ground before him Quoth the Wazir O Kutayt I wish thee to take this fellow and throw him into one of the underground cells FN seventy two in the prison and torture him night and day To hear is to obey replied the jailor and taking Nur al Din into the prison locked the door upon him Then he gave orders to sweep a bench behind the door and spreading on it a sitting rug and a leather cloth seated Nur al Din thereon and loosed his shackles and entreated him kindly The Wazir sent every day enjoining the jailor to beat him but he abstained from this and so continued to do for forty days On the forty first day there came a present from the Caliph which when the Sultan saw it pleased him and he consulted his Ministers on the matter when one of them said Perchance this present was for the new Sultan Cried Al Mu in We should have done well had we put him to death at his first coming and the Sultan cried By Allah thou hast reminded me of him Go down to the prison and fetch him and I will strike off his head To hear is to obey replied Al Mu in then he stood up and said I will make proclamation in the city Whoso would solace himself with seeing the beheading of Nur al Din bin al Fazl bin Khakan let him repair to the palace So follower and followed great and small will flock to the spectacle and I shall heal my heart and harm my foe Do as thou wilt said the Sultan The Wazir went off and he was glad and gay and ordered the Chief of Police to make the afore mentioned proclamation When the people heard the crier they all sorrowed and wept even the little ones at school and the traders in their shops and some strove to get places for seeing the sight whilst others went to the prison with the object of escorting him thence Presently the Wazir came with ten Mamelukes to the jail and Kutayt the jailor asked him Whom seekest thou O our lord the Wazir whereto he answered Bring me out that gallows bird But the jailor said He is in the sorriest of plights for the much beating I have given him Then he went into the prison and found Nur al Din repeating these verses Who shall support me in calamities When fail all cures and greater cares arise Exile hath worm my heart my vitals torn The World to foes hath turned my firm allies O folk will not one friend amidst you all Wail o er my woes and cry to hear my cries Death and it agonies seem light to me Since life has lost all joys and jollities O Lord of Mustafa FN seventy three that Science sea Sole Intercessor Guide all ware all wise I pray thee free me and my fault forego And from me drive mine evil and my woe The jailor stripped off his clean clothes and dressing him in two filthy vests carried him to the Wazir Nur al Din looked at him and saw it was his foe that sought to compass his death so he wept and said Art thou then so secure against the World Hast thou not heard the saying of the poet Kisras and Caesars in a bygone day Stored wealth where it is and ah where are they O Wazir he continued know that Allah be He extolled and exalted will do whatso He will O Ali replied he thinkest thou to frighten me with such talk I mean this very day to smite thy neck despite the noses of the Bassorah folk and I care not let the days do as they please nor will I turn me to thy counsel but rather to what the poet saith Leave thou the days to breed their ban and bate And make thee strong t upbear the weight of Fate And also how excellently saith another Whoso shall see the death day of his foe One day surviving wins his bestest wish Then he ordered his attendants to mount Nur al Din upon the bare back of a mule and they said to the youth for truly it was irksome to them Let us stone him and cut him down thou our lives go for it But Nur al Din said to them Do not so have ye not heard the saying of the poet Needs must I bear the term by Fate decreed And when that day be dead needs must I die If lions dragged me to their forest lair Safe should I live till draw my death day nigh Then they proceeded to proclaim before Nur al Din This is the least of the retribution for him who imposeth upon Kings with forgeries And they ceased not parading him round about Bassorah till they made him stand beneath the palace windows and set him upon the leather of blood FN seventy four and the sworder came up to him and said O my lord I am but a slave commanded in this matter an thou have any desire tell it me that I may fulfil it for now there remaineth of they life only so much as may be till the Sultan shall put his face out of the lattice Thereupon Nur al Din looked to the right and to the left and before him and behind him and began improvising The sword the sworder and the blood skin waiting me I sight And cry Alack mine evil fate ah my calamity How is t I see no loving friend with eye of sense or soul What no one here I cry to all will none reply to me The time is past that formed my life my death term draweth nigh Will no man win the grace of God showing me clemency And look with pity on my state and clear my dark despair E en with a draught of water dealt to cool death s agony The people fell to weeping over him and the headsman rose and brought him a draught of water but the Wazir sprang up from his place and smote the gugglet with his hand and broke it then he cried out at the executioner and bade him strike off Nur al Din s head So he bound the eyes of the doomed man and folk clamoured at the Wazir and loud wailings were heard and much questioning of man and man At this moment behold rose a dense dust cloud filling sky and wold and when the Sultan who was sitting in the palace descried this he said to his suite Go and see what yon cloud bringeth Replied Al Mu in Not till we have smitten this fellow s neck but the Sultan said Wait ye till we see what this meaneth Now the dust cloud was the dust of J afar the Barmecide Wazir to the Caliph and his host and the cause of his coming was as follows The Caliph passed thirty days without calling to mind the matter of Nur al Din Ali FN seventy five and none reminded him of it till one night as he passed by the chamber of Anis al Jalis he heard her weeping and singing with a soft sweet voice these lines of the poet In thought I see thy form when farthest far or nearest near And on my tongue there dwells a name which man shall ne er unhear Then her weeping redoubled when lo the Caliph opened the door and entering the chamber found Anis al Jalis in tears When she saw him she fell to the ground and kissing his feet three times repeated these lines O fertile root and noble growth of trunk Ripe fruitful branch of never sullied race I mind thee of what pact thy bounty made Far be t from thee thou should saint forget my case Quoth the Caliph Who art thou and she replied I am she whom Ali bin Khakan gave thee in gift and I wish the fulfilment of thy promise to send me to him with the robe of honour for I have now been thirty days without tasting the food of sleep Thereupon the Caliph sent for Ja afar and said to him O Ja afar tis thirty days since we have had news of Nur al Din bin Khakan and I cannot suppose that the Sultan hath slain him but by the life of my head and by the sepulchres of my forefathers if aught of foul play hath befallen him I will surely make an end of him who was the cause of it though he be the dearest of all men to myself So I desire that thou set out for Bassorah within this hour and bring me tidings of my cousin King Mohammed bin Sulayman al Zayni and how he had dealt with Nur al Din Ali bin Khakan adding If thou tarry longer on the road than shall suffice for the journey I will strike off they head Furthermore do thou tell the son of my uncle the whole story of Nur al Din and how I sent him with my written orders and if thou find O my cousin FN seventy six that the King hath done otherwise than as I commanded bring him and the Wazir Al Mu in bin Sawi to us in whatsoever guise thou shalt find them FN seventy seven Hearing and obedience replied Ja afar and making ready on the instant he set out for Bassorah where the news of his coming had foregone him and had reached to the ears of King Mohammed When Ja afar arrived and saw the crushing and crowding of the lieges he asked What means all this gathering so they told him what was doing in the matter of Nur al Din whereupon he hastened to go to the Sultan and saluting him acquainted him with the cause why he came and the Caliph s resolve in case of any foul play having befallen the youth to put to death whoso should have brought it about Then he took into custody the King and the Wazir and laid them in ward and giving order for the release of Nur al Din Ali enthroned him as Sultan in the stead of Mohammed bin Sulayman After this Ja afar abode three days in Bassorah the usual guest time and on the morning of the fourth day Nur al Din Ali turned to him and said I long for the sight of the Commander of the Faithful Then said Ja afar to Mohammed bin Sulayman Make ready to travel for we will say the dawn prayer and mount Baghdad wards and he replied To hear is to obey Then they prayed and they took horse and set out all of them carrying with them the Wazir Al Mu in bin Sawi who began to repent him of what he had done Nur al Din rode by Ja afar s side and they stinted not faring on till they arrived at Baghdad the House of Peace and going in to the Caliph told him how they had found Nur al Din nigh upon death Thereupon the Caliph said to the youth Take this sword and smite with it the neck of thine enemy So he took the sword from his hand and stepped up to Al Mu in who looked at him and said I did according to my mother s milk do thou according to thine FN seventy eight Upon this Nur al Din cast the sword from his hand and said to the Caliph O Commander of the Faithful he hath beguiled me with his words and he repeated this couplet By craft and sleight I snared him when he came A few fair words aye trap the noble game Leave him then cried the Caliph and turning to Masrur said Rise thou and smite his neck So Masrur drew his sword and struck off his head Then quoth the Caliph to Nur al Din Ali Ask a boon of me O my lord answered he I have no need of the Kingship of Bassorah my sole desire is to be honoured by serving thee and by seeing the countenance With love and gladness said the Caliph Then he sent for the damsel Anis al Jalis and bestowed plentiful favours upon them both and gave them one of his palaces in Baghdad and assigned stipends and allowances and made Nur al Din Ali bin Fazl bin Khakan one of his cup companions and he abode with the Commander of the Faithful enjoying the pleasantest of lives till death overtook him Yet continued Shahrazad is not his story in any wise more wondrous than the history of the merchant and his children The King asked And what was that and Shahrazad began to relate the Tale of Ghanim bin Ayyub FN seventy nine the Distraught the Thrall o Love It hath reached me O auspicious King that in times of yore and in years and ages long gone before there lived in Damascus a merchant among the merchants a wealthy man who had a son like the moon on the night of his fulness FN eighty and withal sweet of speech who was named Ghanim bin Ayyub surnamed the Distraught the Thrall o Love He had also a daughter own sister to Ghanim who was called Fitnah a damsel unique in beauty and loveliness Their father died and left them abundant wealth And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Thirty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the merchant left his two children abundant wealth and amongst other things an hundred loads FN eighty one of silks and brocades musk pods and mother o pearl and there was written on every bale This is of the packages intended for Baghdad it having been his purpose to make the journey thither when Almighty Allah took him to Himself which was in the time of the Caliph Harun al Rashid After a while his son took the loads and bidding farewell to his mother and kindred and townsfolk went forth with a company of merchants putting his trust in Allah Almighty who decreed him safety so that he arrived without let or stay at Baghdad There he hired for himself a fair dwelling house which he furnished with carpets and cushions curtains and hangings and therein stored his bales and stabled his mules and camels after which he abode a while resting Presently the merchants and notables of Baghdad came and saluted him after which he took a bundle containing ten pieces of costly stuffs with the prices written on them and carried it to the merchants bazar where they welcomed and saluted him and showed him all honour and making him dismount from his beast seated him in the shop of the Syndic of the market to whom he delivered the package He opened it and drawing out the pieces of stuff sold them for him at a profit of two diners on every diner of prime cost At this Ghanim rejoiced and kept selling his silks and stuffs one after another and ceased not to do on this wise for a full year On the first day of the following year he went as was his wont to the Exchange which was in the bazar but found the gate shut and enquiring the reason was told One of the merchants is dead and all the others have gone to follow his bier FN eighty two and why shouldst thou not win the meed of good deeds by walking with them FN eighty three He replied Yes and asked for the quarter where the funeral was taking place and one directed him thereto So he purified himself by the Wuzu ablution FN eighty four and repaired with the other merchants to the oratory where they prayed over the dead then walked before the bier to the burial place and Ghanim who was a bashful man followed them being ashamed to leave them They presently issued from the city and passed through the tombs until they reached the grave where they found that the deceased s kith and kin had pitched a tent over the tomb and had brought thither lamps and wax candles So they buried the body and sat down while the readers read out and recited the Koran over the grave and Ghanim sat with them being overcome with bashfulness and saying to himself I cannot well go away till they do They tarried listening to the Koranic perfection till nightfall when the servants set supper and sweetmeats FN eighty five before them and they ate till they were satisfied then they washed their hands and again took their places But Ghanim s mind was preoccupied with his house and goods being in fear of robbers and he said to himself I am a stranger here and supposed to have money if I pass the night abroad the thieves will steal my money bags and my bales to boot So when he could no longer control his fear he arose and left the assembly having first asked leave to go about some urgent business and following the signs of the road he soon came to the city gate But it was midnight and he found the doors locked and saw none going or coming nor heard aught but the hounds baying and the wolves howling At this he exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah I was in fear for my property and came back on its account but now I find the gate shut and I am in mortal fear for my life Then he turned back and looking out for a place where he could sleep till morning presently found a Santon s tomb a square of four walls with a date tree in the central court and a granite gateway The door was wide open so he entered and would fain have slept but sleep came not to him and terror and a sense of desolation oppressed him for that he was alone amidst the tombs So he rose to his feet and opening the door looked out and lo he was ware of a light afar off in the direction of the city gate then walking a little way towards it he saw that it was on the road whereby he had reached the tomb This made him fear for his life so he hastily shut the door and climbed to the top of the dale tree where he hid himself in the heart of the fronds The light came nearer and nearer till it was close to the tomb then it stopped and he saw three slaves two bearing a chest and one with a lanthorn an adze and a basket containing some mortar When they reached the tomb one of those who were carrying the case said What aileth thee O Sawab and said the other What is the matter O Kafur FN eighty six Quoth he Were we not here at supper tide and did we not leave the door open Yes replied the other that is true See said Kafur now it is shut and barred How weak are your wits cried the third who bore the adze and his name was Bukhayt FN eighty seven know ye not that the owners of the gardens use to come out from Baghdad and tend them and when evening closes upon them they enter this place and shut the door for fear lest the wicked blackmen like ourselves should catch them and roast em and eat em FN eighty eight Thou sayest sooth said the two others but by Allah however that may be none amongst us is weaker of wits than thou If ye do not believe me said Bukhayt let us enter the tomb and I will rouse the rat for you for I doubt not but that when he saw the light and us making for the place he ran up the date tree and hid there for fear of us When Ghanim heard this he said in himself O curstest of slaves May Allah not have thee in His holy keeping for this thy craft and keenness of wit There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great How shall I win free of these blackamoors Then said the two who bore the box to him of the adze Swarm up the wall and open the gate for us O Bukhayt for we are tired of carrying the chest on our necks and when thou hast opened the gate thou shalt have one of those we catch inside a fine fat rat which we will fry for thee after such excellent fashion that not a speck of his fat shall be lost But Bukhayt answered I am afraid of somewhat which my weak wits have suggested to me we should do better to throw the chest over the gateway for it is our treasure If we throw it twill break replied they and he said I fear lest there be robbers within who murder folk and plunder their goods for evening is their time of entering such places and dividing their spoil O thou weak o wits said both the bearers of the box how could they ever get in here FN eighty nine Then they set down the chest and climbing over the wall dropped inside and opened the gate whilst the third slave he that was called Bukhayt stood by them holding the adze the lanthorn and the hand basket containing the mortar After this they locked the gate and sat down and presently one of them said O my brethren we are wearied with walking and with lifting up and setting down the chest and with unlocking and locking the gate and now tis midnight and we have no breath left to open a tomb and bury the box so let us rest here two or three hours then rise and do the job Meanwhile each of us shall tell how he came to be castrated and all that befel him from first to last the better to pass away our time while we take our rest Thereupon the first he of the lanthorn and whose name was Bukhayt said I ll tell you my tale Say on replied they so he began as follows the Tale of the First Eunuch Bukhayt Know O my brothers that when I was a little one some five years old I was taken home from my native country by a slave driver who sold me to a certain Apparitor FN ninety My purchaser had a daughter three years old with whom I was brought up and they used to make mock of me letting me play with her and dance for her FN ninety one and sing to her till I reached the age of twelve and she that of ten and even then they did not forbid me seeing her One day I went in to her and found her sitting in an inner room and she looked as if she had just come out of the bath which was in the house for she was scented with essences and reek of aromatic woods and her face shone like a circle of the moon on the fourteenth night She began to sport with me and I with her Now I had just reached the age of puberty so my prickle stood at point as it were a huge key Then she threw me on my back and mounting astraddle on my breast fell a wriggling and a bucking upon me till she had uncovered my yard When she saw it standing with head erect she hent it in hand and began rubbing it upon the lips of her little slit FN ninety two outside her petticoat trousers Thereat hot lust stirred in me and I threw my arms round her while she wound hers about my neck and hugged me to her with all her might till before I knew what I did my pizzle split up her trousers and entered her slit and did away her maiden head When I saw this I ran off and took refuge with one of my comrades Presently her mother came in to her and seeing her in this case fainted clean away However she managed the matter advisedly and hid it from the girl s father out of good will to me nor did they cease to call to me and coax me till they took me from where I was After two months had passed by her mother married her to a young man a barber who used to shave her papa and portioned and fitted her out of her own monies whilst the father knew nothing of what had passed On the night of consummation they cut the throat of a pigeon poult and sprinkled the blood on her shift FN ninety three After a while they seized me unawares and gelded me and when they brought her to her bridegroom they made me her Agha FN ninety four her eunuch to walk before her wheresoever she went whether to the bath or to her father s house I abode with her a long time enjoying her beauty and loveliness by way of kissing and clipping and coupling with her FN ninety five till she died and her husband and mother and father died also when they seized me for the Royal Treasury as being the property of an intestate and I found my way hither where I became your comrade This then O my brethren is the cause of my cullions being cut off and peace be with you He ceased and his fellow began in these words the Tale of the Second Eunuch Kafur Know O my brothers that when beginning service as a boy of eight I used to tell the slave dealers regularly and exactly one lie every year so that they fell out with one another till at last my master lost patience with me and carrying me down to the market ordered the brokers to cry Who will buy this slave knowing his blemish and making allowance for it He did so and they asked him Pray what may be his blemish and he answered He telleth me one single lie every year Now a man that was a merchant came up and said to the broker How much do they allow for him with his blemish They allow six hundred dirhams he replied and said the other Thou shalt have twenty dirhams for thyself So he arranged between him and the slave dealer who took the coin from him and the broker carried me to the merchant s house and departed after receiving his brokerage The trader clothed me with suitable dress and I stayed in his service the rest of my twelvemonth until the new year began happily It was a blessed season plenteous in the produce of the earth and the merchants used to feast every day at the house of some one among them till it was my master s turn to entertain them in a flower garden without the city So he and the other merchants went to the garden taking with them all that they required of provaunt and else beside and sat eating and carousing and drinking till mid day when my master having need of some matter from his home said to me O slave mount the she mule and hie thee to the house and bring from thy mistress such and such a thing and return quickly I obeyed his bidding and started for the house but as I drew near it I began to cry out and shed tears whereupon all the people of the quarter collected great and small and my master s wife and daughters hearing the noise I was making opened the door and asked me what was the matter Said I My master was sitting with his friends beneath an old wall and it fell on one and all of them and when I saw what had happened to them I mounted the mule and came hither in haste to tell you When my master s daughters and wife heard this they screamed and rent their raiment and beat their faces whilst the neighbours came around them Then the wife over turned the furniture of the house one thing upon another and tore down the shelves and broke the windows and the lattices and smeared the walls with mud and indigo saying to me Woe to thee O Kafur come help me to tear down these cupboards and break up these vessels and this china ware FN ninety six and the rest of it So I went to her and aided her to smash all the shelves in the house with whatever stood upon them after which I went round about the terrace roofs and every part of the place spoiling all I could and leaving no china in the house unbroken till I had laid waste the whole crying out the while Well away my master Then my mistress fared forth bare faced wearing a head kerchief and naught else and her daughters and the children sallied out with her and said to me O Kafur go thou before us and show us the place where thy master lieth dead that we may take him from under the fallen wall and lay him on a bier and bear him to the house and give him a fine funeral So I went forth before them crying out Slack my master and they after me with faces and heads bare and all shrieking Alas Alas for the man Now there remained none in the quarter neither man nor woman nor epicene nor youth nor maid nor child nor old trot but went with us smiting their faces and weeping bitterly and I led them leisurely through the whole city The folk asked them what was the matter whereupon they told them what they had heard from me and all exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah Then said one of them He was a personage of consequence so let us go to the Governor and tell him what hath befallen him When they told the Governor And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Fortieth Night FN ninety seven She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when they told the Governor he rose and mounted and taking with him labourers with spades and baskets went on my track with many people behind him and I ran on before them howling and casting dust on my head and beating my face followed by my mistress and her children keening for the dead But I got ahead of them and entered the garden before them and when my master saw me in this state I smiting my face and saying Well away my mistress Alas Alas Alas who is left to take pity on me now that my mistress is gone Would I had been a sacrifice for her he stood aghast and his colour waxed yellow and he said to me What aileth thee O Kafur What is the matter O my lord I replied when thou sentest me to the house I found that the saloon wall had given way and had fallen like a layer upon my mistress and her children And did not thy mistress escape No by Allah O my master not one of them was saved the first to die was my mistress thine elder daughter And did not my younger daughter escape No she did not And what became of the mare mule I use to ride is she safe No by Allah O my master the house walls and the stable walls buried every living thing that was within doors even to the sheep and geese and poultry so that they all became a heap of flesh and the dogs and cats are eating them and not one of them is left alive And hath not thy master my elder son escaped No by Allah not one of them was saved and now there is naught left of house or household nor even a sign of them and as for the sheep and geese and hens the cats and dogs have devoured them When my master heard this the light became night before his sight his wits were dazed and he so lost command of his senses that he could not stand firm on his feet he was as one struck with a sudden palsy and his back was like to break Then he rent his raiment and plucked out his beard and casting his turband from off his head buffeted his face till the blood ran down and he cried aloud Alas my children Alas my wife Alas my calamity To whom ever befel that which hath befallen me The merchants his friends also cried aloud at his crying and wept for his weeping and tore their clothes being moved to pity of his case and so my master went out of the garden smiting his face with such violence that from excess of pain he staggered like one drunken with wine As he and the merchants came forth from the garden gate behold they saw a great cloud of dust and heard a loud noise of crying and lamentation so they looked and lo it was the Governor with his attendants and the townsfolk a world of people who had come out to look on and my master s family following them all screaming and crying aloud and weeping exceeding sore weeping The first to address my owner were his wife and children and when he saw them he was confounded and laughed FN ninety eight and said to them How is it with all of you and what befel you in the house and what hath come to pass to you When they saw him they exclaimed Praise be to Allah for thy preservation and threw themselves upon him and his children hung about him crying Slack our father Thanks to Allah for thy safety O our father And his wife said to him Art thou indeed well Laud to Allah who hath shown us thy face in safety And indeed she was confounded and her reason fled when she saw him and she asked O my lord how didst thou escape thou and thy friends the merchants and he answered her And how fared it with thee in the house Quoth they We were all well whole and healthy nor hath aught of evil befallen us in the house save that thy slave Kafur came to us bareheaded with torn garments and howling Alas the master Alas the master So we asked him What tidings O Kafur and he answered A wall of the garden hath fallen on my master and his friends the merchants and they are all crushed and dead By Allah said my master he came to me but now howling Alas my mistress Alas the children of the mistress and said My mistress and her children are all dead every one of them Then he looked round and seeing me with my turband rent in rags round my neck howling and weeping with exceeding weeping and throwing dust upon my head he cried out at me So I came to him and he said Woe to thee O ill omened slave O whoreson knave O thou damned breed What mischief thou hast wrought By Allah I will flog thy skin from thy flesh and cut thy flesh from thy bones I rejoined By Allah thou canst do nothing of the kind with me O my lord for thou boughtest me with my blemish and there are honest men to bear witness against thee that thou didst so accepting the condition and that thou knewest of my fault which is to tell one lie every year Now this is only a half lie but by the end of the year I will tell the other half then will the lie stand whole and complete O dog son of a dog cried my master O most accursed of slaves is this all of it but a half lie Verily if it be a half lie tis a whole calamity Get thee from me thou art free in the face of Allah By Allah rejoined I if thou free me I will not free thee till my year is completed and I have told thee the half lie which is left When this is done go down with me to the slave market and sell me as thou boughtest me to whoso will buy me with my blemish but thou shalt not manumit me for I have no handicraft whereby to gain my living FN ninety nine and this my demand is a matter of law which the doctors have laid down in the Chapter of Emancipation FN one hundred While we were at these words up came the crowd of people and the neighbours of the quarter men women and children together with the Governor and his suite offering condolence So my master and the other merchants went up to him and informed him of the adventure and how this was but a half lie at which all wondered deeming it a whole lie and a big one And they cursed me and reviled me while I stood laughing and grinning at them till at last I asked How shall my master slay me when he bought me with this my blemish Then my master returned home and found his house in ruins and it was I who had laid waste the greater part of it FN one hundred one having broken things which were worth much money as also had done his wife who said to him Twas Kafur who broke the vessels and chinaware Thereupon his rage redoubled and he struck hand upon hand exclaiming By Allah in my life never saw I a whoreson like this slave and he saith this is but a half lie How then if he had told me a whole lie He would ruin a city aye or even two Then in his fury he went to the Governor and they gave me a neat thing in the bastinado line and made me eat stick till I was lost to the world and a fainting fit came on me and whilst I was yet senseless they brought the barber who docked me and gelded me FN one hundred two and cauterised the wound When I revived I found myself a clean eunuch with nothing left and my master said to me Even as thou hast burned my heart for the things I held dearest so have I burnt thy heart for that of thy members whereby thou settest most store Then he took me and sold me at a profit for that I was become an eunuch And I ceased not bringing trouble upon all wherever I was sold and was shifted from lord to lord and from notable to notable being sold and being bought till I entered the palace of the Commander of the Faithful But now my spirit is broken and my tricks are gone from me so alas are my ballocks When the two slaves heard his history they laughed at him and chaffed him and said Truly thou art skite FN one hundred three and skite son Thou liedest an odious lie Then quoth they to the third slave Tell us thy tale O sons of my uncle quoth he all that ye have said is idle I will tell you the cause of my losing my testicles and indeed I deserved to lose even more for I futtered both my mistress and my master s eldest son and heir but my story is a long one and this is not the time to tell it for the dawn O my cousins draweth near and if morning come upon us with this chest still unburied we shall get into sore disgrace and our lives will pay for it So up with you and open the door and when we get back to the palace I will tell you my story and the cause of my losing my precious stones Then he swarmed up and dropped down from the wall inside and opened the door so they entered and setting down the lantern dug between four tombs a hole as long as the chest and of the same breadth Kafur plied the spade and Sawab removed the earth by baskets full till they reached the depth of the stature of a man FN one hundred four when they laid the chest in the hole and threw back the earth over it then they went forth and shutting the door disappeared from Ghanim s eyes When all was quiet and he felt sure that he was left alone in the place his thought was busied about what the chest contained and he said to himself Would that I knew the contents of that box However he waited till day broke when morning shone and showed her sheen whereupon he came down from the date tree and scooped away the earth with his hands till the box was laid bare and disengaged from the ground Then he took a large stone and hammered at the lock till he broke it and opening the lid behold a young lady a model of beauty and loveliness clad in the richest of garments and jewels of gold and such necklaces of precious stones that were the Sultan s country evened with them it would not pay their price She had been drugged with Bhang but her bosom rising and falling showed that her breath had not departed When Ghanim saw her he knew that some one had played her false and hocussed her so he pulled her out of the chest and laid her on the ground with her face upwards As soon as she smelt the breeze and the air entered her nostrils mouth and lungs she sneezed and choked and coughed when there fell from out her throat a pill of Cretan Bhang had an elephant smelt it he would have slept from night to night Then she opened her eyes and glancing around said in sweet voice and gracious words Woe to thee O wind there is naught in thee to satisfy the thirsty nor aught to gratify one whose thirst is satisfied Where is Zhar al Bostan But no one answered her so she turned her and cried out Ho Sabihah Shajarat al Durr Nur al Huda Najmat al Subh be ye awake Shahwah Nuzhab Halwa Zarifah out on you speak FN one hundred five But no one answered so she looked all around and said Woe s me have they entombed me in the tombs O Thou who knowest what man s thought enwombs and who givest compensation on the Day of Doom who can have brought me from amid hanging screens and curtains veiling the Harim rooms and set me down between four tombs All this while Ghanim was standing by then he said to her O my lady here are neither screened rooms nor palace Harims nor yet tombs only the slave henceforth devoted to thy love Ghanim bin Ayyub sent to thee by the Omniscient One above that all thy troubles He may remove and win for thee every wish that cloth behove Then he held his peace She was reassured by his words and cried I testify that there is no god but the God and I testify that Mohammed is the Apostle of God then she turned to Ghanim and placing her hands before her face said to him in the sweetest speech O blessed youth who brought me hither See I am now come to myself O my lady he replied three slave eunuchs came here bearing this chest and related to her the whole of what had befallen him and how evening having closed upon him had proved the cause of her preservation otherwise she had died smothered FN one hundred six Then he asked her who she was and what was her story and she answered O youth thanks be to Allah who hath cast me into the hands of the like of thee But now rise and put me back into the box then fare forth upon the road and hire the first camel driver or muleteer thou findest to carry it to thy house When I am there all will be well and I will tell thee my tale and acquaint thee with my adventures and great shall be thy gain by means of me At this he rejoiced and went outside the tomb The day was now dazzling bright and the firmament shone with light and the folk had begun to circulate so he hired a man with a mule and bringing him to the tomb lifted the chest wherein he had put the damsel and set it on the mule Her love now engrossed his heart and he fared homeward with her rejoicing for that she was a girl worth ten thousand gold pieces and her raiment and ornaments would fetch a mint of money As soon as he arrived at his house he carried in the chest and opening it And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Forty first night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ghanim son of Ayyub arrived with the chest at his house he opened it and took out the young lady who looked about her and seeing that the place was handsome spread with carpets and dight with cheerful colours and other deckings and noting the stuffs up piled and packed bales and other else than that knew that he was a substantial merchant and a man of much money There upon she uncovered her face and looked at him and lo he was a fair youth so when she saw him she loved him and said O my lord bring us something to eat On my head and mine eyes replied he and going down to the bazar bought a roasted lamb and a dish of sweetmeats and with these dry fruits and wax candles besides wine and whatsoever was required of drinking materials not forgetting perfumes With all this gear he returned to the house and when the damsel saw him she laughed and kissed him and clasped his neck Then she began caressing him which made his love wax hotter till it got the mastery of his heart They ate and drank and each had conceived the fondest affection for indeed the two were one in age and one in loveliness and when night came on Ghanim bin Ayyub the Distraught the Thrall o Love rose and lit the wax candles and lamps till the place blazed with light FN one hundred seven after which he produced the wine service and spread the table Then both sat down again he and she and he kept filling and giving her to drink and she kept filling and giving him to drink and they played and toyed and laughed and recited verses whilst their joy increased and they dove in closer love each to each glory be to the Uniter of Hearts They ceased not to carouse after this fashion till near upon dawn when drowsiness overcame them and they slept where they were apart each from other till the morning FN one hundred eight Then Ghanim arose and going to the market bought all they required of meat and vegetables and wine and what not and brought them to the house whereupon both sat down to eat and ate their sufficiency when he set on wine They drank and each played with each till their cheeks flushed red and their eyes took a darker hue and Ghanim s soul longed to kiss the girl and to lie with her and he said O my lady grant me one kiss of that dear mouth per chance t will quench the fire of my heart O Ghanim replied she wait till I am drunk and dead to the world then steal a kiss of me secretly and on such wise that I may not know thou hast kissed me Then she rose and taking off her upper dress sat in a thin shift of fine linen and a silken head kerchief FN one hundred nine At this passion inflamed Ghanim and he said to her O my lady wilt thou not vouchsafe me what I asked of thee By Allah she replied that may not be thine for there is written upon my trouser string FN one hundred ten a hard word Thereupon Ghanim s heart sank and desire grew on him as its object offered difficulties and he improvised these verses I asked the author of mine ills To heal the wound with one sweet kiss No No she cried FN one hundred eleven for ever no But I soft whispering urged yes Quoth she Then take it by my leave When smiles shall pardon thine amiss By force cried I Nay she replied With love and gladness eke I wis Now ask me not what next occurred Seek grace of God and whist of this Deem what thou wilt of us for love By calumnies the sweeter is Nor after this care I one jot Whether my foe be known or not Then his affection increased and love fires rose hotter in his heart while she refused herself to him saying Thou canst not possess me They ceased not to make love and enjoy their wine and wassail whilst Ghanim was drowned in the sea of love and longing but she redoubled in coyness and cruelty till the night brought on the darkness and let fall on them the skirts of sleep Thereupon Ghanim rose and lit the lamps and wax candles and refreshed the room and removed the table then he took her feet and kissed them and finding them like fresh cream pressed his face FN one hundred twelve on them and said to her O my lady take pity on one thy love hath ta en and thine eyes hath slain for indeed I were heart whole but for thy bane And he wept somewhat O my lord and light of my eyes quoth she by Allah I love thee in very sooth and I trust to thy truth but I know that I may not be thine And what is the obstacle asked he when she answered Tonight I will tell thee my tale that thou mayst accept my excuse Then she threw herself upon him and winding her arms like a necklace about his neck kissed him and caressed him and promised him her favours and they ceased not playing and laughing till love get the firmest hold upon both their hearts And so it continued a whole month both passing the night on a single carpet bed but whenever he would enjoy her she put him off whilst mutual love increased upon them and each could hardly abstain from other One night as he lay by her side and both were warm with wine Ghanim passed his hand over her breasts and stroked them then he slipped it down to her waist as far as her navel She awoke and sitting up put her hand to her trousers and finding them fast tied once more fell asleep Presently he again felt her and sliding his hand down to her trouser string began pulling at it whereupon she awoke and sat upright Ghanim also sat up by her side and she asked him What dost thou want I want to lie with thee he answered and that we may deal openly and frankly with each other Quoth she I must now declare to thee my case that thou mayst know my quality then will my secret be disclosed to thee and my excuse become manifest to thee Quoth he So be it Thereat she opened the skirt of her shift and taking up her trouser string said to him O my lord read what is worked on the flat of this string so he took it in hand and saw these words broidered on it in gold I AM THINE AND THOU ART MINE O COUSIN OF THE APOSTLE FN one hundred thirteen When he read this he withdrew his hand and said to her Tell me who thou art So be it answered she know that I am one of the concubines of the Commander of the Faithful and my name is Kut al Kulub the Food of Hearts I was brought up in his palace and when I grew to woman s estate he looked on me and noting what share of beauty and loveliness the Creator had given me loved me with exceeding love and assigned me a separate apartment and gave me ten slave girls to wait on me and all these ornaments thou seest me wearing On a certain day he set out for one of his provinces and the Lady Zubaydah came to one of the slave girls in my service and said to her I have something to require of thee What is it O my lady asked she and the Caliph s wife answered When thy mistress Kut al Kulub is asleep put this piece of Bhang into her nostrils or drop it into her drink and thou shalt have of me as much money as will satisfy thee With love and gladness replied the girl and took the Bhang from her being a glad woman because of the money and because aforetime she had been one of Zubaydah s slaves So she put the Bhang in my drink and when it was night drank and the drug had no sooner settled in my stomach than I fell to the ground my head touching my feet and knew naught of my life but that I was in another world When her device succeeded she bade put me in this chest and secretly brought in the slaves and the doorkeepers and bribed them and on the night when thou wast perched upon the date tree she sent the blacks to do with me as thou sawest So my delivery was at thy hands and thou broughtest me to this house and hast entreated me honourably and with thy kindest This is my story and I wot not what is become of the Caliph during my absence Know then my condition and divulge not my case When Ghanim heard her words and knew that she was a concubine of the Caliph he drew back for awe of the Caliphate beset him and sat apart from her in one of the corners of the place blaming himself and brooding over his affair and patiencing his heart bewildered for love of one he could not possess Then he wept for excess of longing and plained him of Fortune and her injuries and the world and its enmities and praise be to Him who causeth generous hearts to be troubled with love and the beloved and who endoweth not the minds of the mean and miserly with so much of it as eveneth a grain weight So he began repeating The lover s heart for his beloved must meet Sad pain and from her charms bear sore defeat What is Love s taste They asked and answered I Sweet is the taste but ah tis bitter sweet Thereupon Kut al Kulub arose and took him to her bosom and kissed him for the love of him was firm fixed in her heart so that she disclosed to him her secret and all the affection she felt and throwing her arms round Ghanim s neck like a collar of pearls kissed him again and yet again But he held off from her in awe of the Caliph Then they talked together a long while and indeed both were drowned in the sea of their mutual love and as the day broke Ghanim rose and donned his clothes and going to the bazar as was his wont took what the occasion required and returned home He found her weeping but when she saw him she checked herself and smiling through her tears said Thou hast desolated me O beloved of my heart By Allah this hour of absence hath been to me like a year FN one hundred fourteen I have explained to thee my condition in the excess of my eager love for thee so come now near me and forget the past and have thy will of me But he interrupted her crying I seek refuge with Allah This thing may never be How shall the dog sit in the lion s stead What is the lord s is unlawful to the slave So he with drew from her and sat down on a corner of the mat Her passion for him increased with his forbearance so she seated herself by his side and caroused and played with him till the two were flushed with wine and she was mad for her own dishonour Then she sang these verses The lover s heart is like to break in twain Till when these coy denials ah till when O thou who fliest me sans fault of mine Gazelles are wont at times prove tame to men Absence aversion distance and disdain How shall young lover all these ills sustain Thereupon Ghanim wept and she wept at his weeping and they ceased not drinking till nightfall when he rose and spread two beds each in its place For whom is this second bed asked she and he answered her One is for me and the other is for thee from this night forth we must not sleep save thus for that which is the lord s is unlawful to the thrall O my master cried she let us have done with this for all things come to pass by Fate and Fortune But he refused and the fire was lighted in her heart and as her longing waxed fiercer she clung to him and cried By Allah we will not sleep save side by side Allah forefend he replied and prevailed against her and lay apart till the morning when love and longing redoubled on her and distraction and eager thirst of passion They abode after this fashion three full told months which were long and longsome indeed and every time she made advances to him he would refuse himself and say Whatever belongeth to the master is unlawful to the man Now when time waxed tiresome and tedious to her and anguish and distress grew on her she burst out from her oppressed heart with these verses How long rare beauty wilt do wrong to me Who was it bade thee not belong to me With outer charms thou weddest inner grace Comprising every point of piquancy Passion thou hast infused in every heart From eyelids driven sleep by deputy Erst was I wet the spray made thin of leaf O Cassia spray Unlief thy sin I see FN one hundred fifteen The hart erst hunted I how is t I spy The hunter hunted fair my hart by thee Wondrouser still I tell thee aye that I Am trapped while never up to trap thou be Ne er grant my prayer For if I grudge thyself To thee I grudge my me more jealously And cry so long as life belong to me Rare beauty how how long this wrong to me They abode in this state a long time and fear kept Ghanim aloof from her So far concerning these two but as regards the Lady Zubaydah when in the Caliph s absence she had done this deed by Kut al Kulub she became perplexed saying to herself What shall I tell my cousin when he comes back and asks for her What possible answer can I make to him Then she called an old woman who was about her and discovered her secret to her saying How shall I act seeing that Kut al Kulub died by such untimely death O my lady quoth the old crone the time of the Caliph s return is near so do thou send for a carpenter and bid him make thee a figure of wood in the form of a corpse We will dig a grave for it midmost the palace and there bury it then do thou build an oratory over it and set therein lighted candles and lamps and order each and every in the palace to be clad in black FN one hundred sixteen Furthermore command thy handmaids and eunuchs as soon as they know of the Caliph s returning from his journey to spread straw over the vestibule floors and when the Commander of the Faithful enters and asks what is the matter let them say Kut al Kulub is dead and may Allah abundantly compensate thee for the loss of her FN one hundred seventeen and for the high esteem in which she was held of our mistress she hath buried her in her own palace When he hears this he will weep and it shall be grievous to him then will he cause perfections of the Koran to be made for her and he will watch by night at her tomb Should he say to himself Verily Zubaydah the daughter of my uncle hath compassed in her jealousy the death of Kut al Kulub or if love longing overcome him and he bid her be taken out of her tomb fear thou not for when they dig down and come to the image in human shape he will see it shrouded in costly grave clothes and if he wish to take off the winding sheet that he may look upon her do thou forbid him or let some other forbid him saying The sight of her nakedness is unlawful The fear of the world to come will restrain him and he will believe that she is dead and will restore the figure to its place and thank thee for thy doings and thus thou shalt escape please Almighty Allah from this slough of despond When the Lady Zubaydah heard her words she commended the counsel and gave her a dress of honour and a large sum of money ordering her to do all she had said So the old woman set about the business forthright and bade the carpenter make her the afore said image and as soon as it was finished she brought it to the Lady Zubaydah who shrouded it and buried it and built a sepulchre over it wherein they lighted candles and lamps and laid down carpets about the tomb Moreover she put on black and she spread abroad in the Harim that Kut al Kulub was dead After a time the Caliph returned from his journey and went up to the palace thinking only of Kut al Kulub He saw all the pages and eunuchs and handmaids habited in black at which his heart fluttered with extreme fear and when he went in to the Lady Zubaydah he found her also garbed in black So he asked the cause of this and they gave him tidings of the death of Kut al Kulub whereon he fell a swooning As soon as he came to himself he asked for her tomb and the Lady Zubaydah said to him Know O Prince of the Faithful that for especial honour I have buried her in my own palace Then he repaired in his travelling garb FN one hundred eighteen to the tomb that he might wail over her and found the carpets spread and the candles and lamps lighted When he saw this he thanked Zubaydah for her good deed and abode perplexed halting between belief and unbelief till at last suspicion overcame him and he gave order to open the grave and take out the body When he saw the shroud and would have removed it to look upon her the fear of Allah Almighty restrained him and the old woman taking advantage of the delay said Restore her to her place Then he sent at once for Fakirs and Koran readers and caused perfections to be made over her tomb and sat by the side of the grave weeping till he fainted and he continued to frequent the tomb and sit there for a whole month And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Forty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph ceased not to frequent the tomb for the period of a whole month at the end of which time it so happened one day that he entered the Serraglio after dismissing the Emirs and Wazirs and lay down and slept awhile and there sat at his head a slave girl fanning him and at his feet a second rubbing and shampooing them Presently he awoke and opening his eyes shut them again and heard the handmaid at his head saying to her who was at his feet A nice business this O Khayzaran and the other answered her Well O Kazib al Ban FN one hundred nineteen Verily said the first our lord knoweth naught of what hath happened and sitteth waking and watching by a tomb wherein is only a log of wood carved by the carpenter s art And Kut al Kulub quoth the other what hath befallen her She replied Know that the Lady Zubaydah sent a pellet of Bhang by one of the slave women who was bribed to drug her and when sleep overpowered her she let put her in a chest and ordered Sawab and Kafur and Bukhayt to throw her amongst the tombs What dost thou say O Kazib al Ban asked Khayzaran is not the lady Kut al Kulub dead Nay by Allah she answered and long may her youth be saved from death but I have heard the Lady Zubaydah say that she is in the house of a young merchant named Ghanim bin Ayyub of Damascus highs the Distraught the Thrall o Love and she hath been with him these four months whilst our lord is weeping and watching by night at a tomb wherein is no corpse They kept on talking this sort of talk and the Caliph gave ear to their words and by the time they had ceased speaking he knew right well that the tomb was a feint and a fraud and that Kut al Kulub had been in Ghanim s house for four months Whereupon he was angered with exceeding anger and rising up he summoned the Emirs of his state and his Wazir Ja afar the Barmaki came also and kissed the ground between his hands The Caliph said to him in fury Go down O Ja afar with a party of armed men and ask for the house of Ghanim son of Ayyub fall upon it and spoil it and bring him to me with my slave girl Kut al Kulub for there is no help but that I punish him To hear is to obey said Ja afar and setting out with the Governor and the guards and a world of people repaired to Ghanim s house Now about that time the youth happened to have brought back a pot of dressed meat and was about to put forth his hand to eat of it he and Kut al Kulub when the lady happening to look out saw calamity surrounding the house on every side for the Wazir and the Governor the night guard and the Mamelukes with swords drawn had girt it as the white of the eye girdeth the black At this she knew that tidings of her had reached the Caliph her lord and she made sure of ruin and her colour paled and her fair features changed and her favour faded Then she turned to Ghanim and said to him O my love fly for thy life What shall I do asked he and whither shall I go seeing that my money and means of maintenance are all in this house and she answered Delay not lest thou be slain and lose life as well as wealth O my loved one and light of mine eyes he cried how shall I do to get away when they have surrounded the house Quoth she Fear not and stripping off his fine clothes dressed him in ragged old garments after which she took the pot and putting in it bits of broken bread and a saucer of meat FN one hundred twenty placed the whole in a basket and setting it upon his head said Go out in this guise and fear not for me who wotteth right well what thing is in my hand for the Caliph FN one hundred twenty one So he went out amongst them bearing the basket with its contents and the Protector vouchsafed him His protection and he escaped the snares and perils that beset him by the blessing of his good conscience and pure conduct Meanwhile Ja afar dismounted and entering the house saw Kut al Kulub who had dressed and decked herself in splendid raiments and ornaments and filled a chest with gold and jewellery and precious stones and rarities and what else was light to bear and of value rare When she saw Ja afar come in she rose and kissing the ground before him said O my lord the Reed hath written of old the rede which Allah decreed FN one hundred twenty two By Allah O my lady answered Ja afar he gave me an order to seize Ghanim son of Ayyub and she rejoined O my lord he made ready his goods and set out therewith for Damascus and I know nothing more of him but I desire thee take charge of this chest and deliver it to me in the Harim of the Prince of the Faithful Hearing and obedience said Ja afar and bade his men bear it away to the head quarters of the Caliphate together with Kut al Kulub commanding them to entreat her with honour as one in high esteem They did his bidding after they had wrecked and plundered Ghanim s house Then Ja afar went in to the Caliph and told him all that had happened and he ordered Kut al Kulub to be lodged in a dark chamber and appointed an old women to serve her feeling convinced that Ghanim had debauched her and slept with her Then he wrote a mandate to the Emir Mohammed bin Sulayman al Zayni his viceroy in Damascus to this effect The instant thou shalt receive this our letter seize upon Ghanim bin Ayyub and send him to us When the missive came to the viceroy he kissed it and laid it on his head then he let proclaim in the bazars Whoso is desirous to plunder away with him to the house of Ghanim son of Ayyub FN one hundred twenty three So they flocked thither when they found that Ghanim s mother and sister had built him a tomb FN one hundred twenty four in the midst of the house and sat by it weeping for him whereupon they seized the two without telling them the cause and after spoiling the house carried them before the viceroy He questioned them concerning Ghanim and both replied For a year or more we have had no news of him So they restored them to their place Thus far concerning them but as regards Ghanim when he saw his wealth spoiled and his ruin utterest he wept over himself till his heart well nigh brake Then he fared on at random till the last of the day and hunger grew hard on him and walking wearied him So coming to a village he entered a mosque FN one hundred twenty five where he sat down upon a mat and propped his back against the wall but presently he sank to the ground in his extremity of famine and fatigue There he lay till dawn his heart fluttering for want of food and owing to his sweating the lice FN one hundred twenty six coursed over his skin his breath waxed fetid and his whole condition was changed When the villagers came to pray the dawn prayer they found him prostrate ailing hunger lean yet showing evident signs of former affluence As soon as prayers were over they drew near him and understanding that he was starved with hunger and cold they gave him an old robe with ragged sleeves and said to him O stranger whence art thou and what sickness is upon thee He opened his eyes and wept but returned no answer whereupon one of them who saw that he was starving brought him a saucer of honey and two barley scones He ate a little and they sat with him till sun rise when they went to their work He abode with them in this state for a month whilst sickness and weakliness grew upon him and they wept for him and pitying his condition took counsel with one another upon his case and agreed to forward him to the hospital in Baghdad FN one hundred twenty seven Meanwhile behold two beggar women who were none other than Ghanim s mother and sister FN one hundred twenty eight came into the mosque and when he saw them he gave them the bread that was at his head and they slept by his side that night but he knew them not Next day the villagers brought a camel and said to the cameleer Set this sick man on thy beast and carry him to Baghdad and put him down at the Spital door so haply he may be medicined and be healed and thou shalt have thy hire FN one hundred twenty nine To hear is to comply said the man So they brought Ghanim who was asleep out of the mosque and set him mat and all on the camel and his mother and sister came out among the crowd to gaze upon him but they knew him not However after looking at him and considering him carefully they said Of a truth he favours our Ghanim poor boy can this sick man be he Presently he woke and finding himself bound with ropes on a camel s back he began to weep and complain FN one hundred thirty and the village people saw his mother and sister weeping over him albeit they knew him not Then they fared forth for Baghdad but the camel man forewent them and setting Ghanim down at the Spital gate went away with his beast The sick man lay there till dawn and when the folk began to go about the streets they saw him and stood gazing on him for he had become as thin as a toothpick till the Syndic of the bazar came up and drove them away from him saying I will gain Paradise through this poor creature for if they take him into the Hospital they will kill him in a single day FN one hundred thirty one Then he made his young men carry him to his house where they spread him a new bed with a new pillow FN one hundred thirty two and he said to his wife Tend him carefully and she replied Good on my head be it Thereupon she tucked up her sleeves and warming some water washed his hands feet and body after which she clothed him in a robe belonging to one of her slave girls and made him drink a cup of wine and sprinkled rose wafer over him So he revived and complained and the thought of his beloved Kut al Kulub made his grief redouble Thus far concerning him but as regards Kut al Kulub when the Caliph was angered against her And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Forty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Caliph was angered against Kut al Kulub he ordered her to a dark chamber where she abode eighty days at the end of which the Caliph happening to pass on a certain day the place where she was heard her repeating poetry and after she ceased reciting her verse saying O my darling O my Ghanim how great is thy goodness and how chaste is thy nature thou didst well by one who did ill by thee and thou guardedst his honour who garred thine become dishonour and his Harim thou didst protect who to enslave thee and shine did elect But thou shalt surely stand thou and the Commander of the Faithful before the Just Judge and thou shalt be justified of him on the Day when the Lord to whom be honour and glory shall be Kazi and the Angels of Heaven shall be witnesses When the Caliph heard her com plaint he knew that she had been wronged and returning to the palace sent Masrur the Eunuch for her She came before him with bowed head and eyes tearful and heart sorrowful and he said to her O Kut al Kulub I find thou accuses me of tyranny and oppression and thou avouches that I have done ill by one who did well by me Who is this who hath guarded my honour while I garred his become dishonour Who protected my Harim and whose Harim I wrecked He is Ghanim son of Ayyub replied she for he never approached me in wantonness or with lewd intent I swear by thy munificence O Commander of the Faithful Then said the Caliph There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah Ask what thou wilt of me O Kut al Kulub O Prince of the Faithful answered she I require of thee only my beloved Ghanim son of Ayyub He did as she desired whereupon she said O Lord of the Moslems if I bring him to thy presence wilt thou bestow me on him and he replied If he come into my presence I will give thee to him as the gift of the generous who revoketh not his largesse O Prince of True Believers quoth she suffer me to go and seek him haply Allah may unite me with him and quoth he Do even as thou wilt So she rejoiced and taking with her a thousand diners in gold went out and visited the elders of the various faiths and gave alms in Ghanim s name FN one hundred thirty three Next day she walked to the merchants bazar and disclosed her object to the Syndic and gave him money saying Bestow this in charity to the stranger On the following Friday she fared to the bazar with other thousand diners and entering the goldsmiths and jewellers market street called the Chief and presented to him a thousand diners with these words Bestow this in charity to the stranger The Chief looked at her and he was the Syndic who had taken in Ghanim and said O my lady wilt thou come to my house and look upon a youth a stranger I have there and see how goodly and graceful he is Now the stranger was Ghanim son of Ayyub but the Chief had no knowledge of him and thought him to be some wandering pauper some debtor whose wealth had been taken from him or some lover parted from his beloved When she heard his words her heart fluttered FN one hundred thirty four and her vitals yearned and she said to him Send with me one who shall guide me to thy house So he sent a little lad who brought her to the house wherein was the head man s stranger guest and she thanked him for this When she reached the house she went in and saluted the Syndic s wife who rose and kissed the ground between her hands for she knew her Then quoth Kut al Kulub Where is the sick man who is with thee She wept and replied Here is he O my lady by Allah he is come of good folk and he beareth the signs of gentle breeding you see him lying on yonder bed So she turned and looked at him and she saw something like him but he was worn and wasted till he had become lean as a toothpick so his identity was doubtful to her and she could not be certain that it was he Yet pity for him possessed her and she wept saying Verily the stranger is unhappy even though he be a prince in his own land and his case was grievous to her and her heart ached for him yet she knew him not to be Ghanim Then she furnished him with wine and medicines and she sat awhile by his head after which she mounted and returned to her palace and continued to visit every bazar in quest of her lover Meanwhile Ghanim s mother and sister Fitnah arrived at Baghdad and met the Syndic who carried them to Kut al Kulub and said to her O Princess of beneficent ladies there came to our city this day a woman and her daughter who are fair of favour and signs of good breeding and dignity are apparent in them though they be dressed in hair cloth and have each one a wallet hanging to her neck and their eyes are tearful and their hearts are sorrowful So I have brought them to thee that thou mayst give them refuge and rescue them from beggary for they are not of asker folk and if it please Allah we shall enter Paradise through them By Allah O my master cried she thou makest me long to see them Where are they adding Here with them to me So he bade the eunuch bring them in and when she looked on them and saw that they were both of distinguished beauty she wept for them and said By Allah these are people of condition and show plain signs of former opulence O my lady said the Syndic s wife we love the poor and the destitute more especially as reward in Heaven will recompense our love and as for these persons haply the oppressor hath dealt hardly with them and hath plundered their property and harried their houses Then Ghanim s mother and sister wept with sore weeping remembering their former prosperity and contrasting it with their present poverty and miserable condition and their thoughts dwelt upon son and brother whilst Kut al Kulub wept for their weeping and they said We beseech Allah to reunite us with him whom we desire and he is none other but my son named Ghanim bin Ayyud When Kut al Kulub heard this she knew them to be the mother and sister of her lover and wept till a swoon came over her When she revived she turned to them and said Have no fear and sorrow not for this day is the first of your prosperity and the last of your adversity And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Forty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Kut al Kulub had consoled them she bade the Syndic lead them to his house and let his wife carry them to the Hammam and dress them in handsome clothes and take care of them and honour them with all honour and she gave him a sufficient sum of money Next day she mounted and riding to his house went in to his wife who rose up and kissed her hands and thanked her for her kindness There she saw Ghanim s mother and sister whom the Syndic s wife had taken to the Hammam and clothed afresh so that the traces of their former condition became manifest upon them She sat talking with them awhile after which she asked the wife about the sick youth who was in her house and she replied He is in the same state Then said Kut al Kulub Come let us go and visit him So she arose she and the Chief s wife and Ghanim s mother and sister and went in to the room where he lay and sat down near him Presently Ghanim bin Ayyub the Distraught the Thrall o Love heard them mention the name of Kut al Kulub whereupon life returned to him emaciated and withered as he was and he raised his head from the pillow and cried aloud O Kut al Kulub She looked at him and made certain it was he and shrieked rather than said Yes O my beloved Draw near to me said he and she replied Surely thou art Ghanim bin Ayyub and he rejoined I am indeed Hereupon a swoon came upon her and as soon as Ghanim s mother and his sister Fitnah heard these words both cried out O our joy and fainted clean away When they all recovered Kut al Kulub exclaimed Praise be to Allah who hath brought us together again and who hath reunited thee with thy mother and thy sister And she related to him all that had befallen her with the Caliph and said I have made known the truth to the Commander of the Faithful who believed my words and was pleased with thee and now he desireth to see thee adding He hath given me to thee Thereat he rejoiced with extreme joy when she said Quit not this place till I come back and rising forthwith betook herself to her palace There she opened the chest which she had brought from Ghanim s house and taking out some of the diners gave them to the Syndic saying Buy with this money for each of them four complete suits of the finest stuffs and twenty kerchiefs and else beside of whatsoever they require after which she carried all three to the baths and had them washed and bathed and made ready for them consommes and galangale water and cider against their coming out When they left the Hammam they put on the new clothes and she abode with them three days feeding them with chicken meats and bouillis and making them drink sherbert of sugar candy After three days their spirits returned and she carried them again to the baths and when they came out and had changed their raiment she led them back to the Syndic s house and left them there whilst she returned to the palace and craved permission to see the Caliph When he ordered her to come in she entered and kissing the ground between his hands told him the whole story and how her lord Ghanim bin Ayyub yclept the Distraught the Thrall o Love and his mother and sister were now in Baghdad When the Caliph heard this he turned to the eunuchs and said Here with Ghanim to me So Ja afar went to fetch him but Kut al Kulub forewent him and told Ghanim The Caliph hath sent to fetch thee before him and charged him to show readiness of tongue and firmness of heart and sweetness of speech Then she robed him in a sumptuous dress and gave him diners in plenty saying Be lavish of largesse to the Caliph s household as thou goest in to him Presently Ja afar mounted on his Nubian mule came to fetch him and Ghanim advanced to welcome the Wazir and wishing him long life kissed the ground before him Now the star of his good fortune had risen and shone brightly and Ja afar took him and they ceased not faring together he and the Minister till they went in to the Commander of the Faithful When he stood in the presence he looked at the Wazirs and Emirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and Grandees and Captains and then at the Caliph Hereupon he sweetened his speech and his eloquence and bowing his head to the ground broke out in these extempore couplets May that Monarch s life span a mighty span Whose lavish of largesse all Empyrean lieges scan None other but he shall be Kaysar highs Lord of lordly hall and of haught Divan Kings lay their gems on his threshold dust As they bow and salam to the mighty man And his glances foil them and all recoil Bowing beards aground and with faces wan Yet they gain the profit of royal grace The rank and station of high Earth s plain is scant for thy world of men Camp there in Kay wan s FN one hundred thirty five Empyrean May the King of Kings ever hold thee dear Be counsel shine and right steadfast plan Till thy justice spread o er the wide spread earth And the near and the far be of equal worth When he ended his improvisation the Caliph was pleased by it and marvelled at the eloquence of his tongue and the sweetness of his speech And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Forty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph after marvelling at his eloquence of tongue and sweetness of speech said to him Draw near to me So he drew near and quoth the King Tell me thy tale and declare to me thy case So Ghanim sat down and related to him what had befallen him in Baghdad of his sleeping in the tomb and of his opening the chest after the three slaves had departed and informed him in short of everything that had happened to him from commencement to conclusion none of which we will repeat for interest fails in twice told tales The Caliph was convinced that he was a true man so he invested him with a dress of honour and placed him near himself in token of favour and said to him Acquit me of the responsibility I have incurred FN one hundred thirty six And Ghanim so did saying O our lord the Sultan of a truth thy slave and all things his two hands own are his master s The Caliph was pleased at this and gave orders to set apart a palace for him and assigned to him pay and allowances rations and donations which amounted to something immense So he removed thither with sister and mother after which the Caliph hearing that his sister Fitnah was in beauty a very fitnah FN one hundred thirty seven a mere seduction demanded her in marriage of Ghanim who replied She is thy handmaid as I am thy slave The Caliph thanked him and gave him an hundred thousand diners then summoned the witnesses and the Kazi and on one and the same day they wrote out the two contracts of marriage between the Caliph and Fitnah and between Ghanim bin Ayyub and Kut al Kulub and the two marriages were consummated on one and the same night When it was morning the Caliph gave orders to record the history of what had befallen Ghanim from first to last and to deposit it in the royal muniment rooms that those who came after him might read it and marvel at the dealings of Destiny and put their trust in Him who created the night and the day Yet O auspicious King this story to which thou hast deigned give ear is on no wise more wondrous than the Tale Of King Omar Bin Al Nu uman And His Sons Sharrkan And Zau Al Makan And What Befel Them of Things Seld Seen and Peregrine FN one hundred thirty eight The King asked her And what was their story and she answered It hath reached me O auspicious King that there was in the City of Safety Baghdad before the Caliphate of Abd al Malik bin Marwan FN one hundred thirty nine a King Omar bin al Nu uman highs who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the Chosroes of Persia and the Kaysars of Eastern Rome for none could warm himself at his fire FN one hundred forty nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray and when he was angered there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame He had made himself King over all quarters and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them Hind and Sind and Sin FN one hundred forty one the Holy Land Al Hijaz the rich mountains of Al Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China Moreover he reigned supreme over the north country and Diyar Bakr or Mesopotamia and over Sudan the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean and all the far famed rivers of the earth Sayhun and Jayhun FN one hundred forty two Nile and Euphrates He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote to provide him with true report and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al Nu uman for he was O Ruler of the Age a right noble King and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan FN one hundred forty three who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater and made him heir to the kingdom after himself This Prince grew up till he reached man s estate and was twenty years old and Allah subjected His servants to him by reason of his great might and prowess in battle Now his father King Omar had four wives legally married but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them save Sharrkan whom he had begotten upon one of them and the rest were barren Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines after the number of days in the Coptic year who were of all nations and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace For he had built twelve pavilions after the number of the months each containing thirty private chambers which thus numbered three hundred and three score wherein he lodged his handmaids and he appointed according to law for each one her night when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year FN one hundred forty four and on this wise he abode for a length of time Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities Presently by decree of the Decreer a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu uman became pregnant and her pregnancy being announced to the Harim the King was informed thereof whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said Haply it will be a son and so all my offspring will be males Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness But when the tidings came to Sharrkan he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous and he said Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty so quoth he to himself If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it but he kept that intention hidden in his heart Such was the case with Sharrkan but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows She was a Roumiyah a Greek girl by name Sofiyah or Sophia FN one hundred forty five whom the King of Roum and Lord of Caesarea had sent to King Omar as a present together with great store of gifts and of rarities she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her saying to him O King I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me so I may bring him up with the best of rearing and enable him to reach man s estate perfect in intelligence good manners and prudent bearing FN one hundred forty six a speech which much pleased the King During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool FN one hundred forty seven Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same In due time Sophia was delivered of a child which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon So they announced this to all present in the room whereupon the King s messenger carried the news to him and Sharrkan s eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy But after the two had departed quoth Sophia to the midwives Wait with me awhile for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon with forehead flower white and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light whereupon the mother rejoiced as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy FN one hundred forty eight The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot and the tidings reached Omar son of Al Nu uman who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head after which he looked at the boy and bending over him kissed him whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al Makan and his sister Nuzhat al Zaman FN one hundred forty nine They answered Hearing and obedience and did his bidding so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside beyond the power of tongue to rehearse Moreover the people of Baghdad hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al Nu uman joy of his son Zau al Makan and of his daughter Nuzhat al Zaman wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts and dealt largesse to all gentle and simple who were present After this fashion he did for four days full told and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth and every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new borns And when four years had gone by he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father Omar son of Al Nu uman having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al Zaman and they hid the intelligence from him until days and years had sped by whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights One day as King Omar was sitting in his palace his Chamberlains came in to him and kissing the ground before him said O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum Lord of Constantinople the Great and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do and if not there is no disputing his behest He bade them enter and when they came in he turned to them and courteously receiving them asked them of their case and what was the cause of their coming They kissed the ground before him and said O King glorious and strong O lord of the arm that is long know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afridun FN one hundred fifty Lord of Ionia land FN one hundred fifty one and of the Nazarene armies the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel the Prince of Casarea and the cause of this war is as follows One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time during certain of his conquests chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander FN one hundred fifty two whence he removed wealth past compute and amongst other things three round jewels big as ostrich eggs from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters and they have many virtues and properties amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new born child no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail FN one hundred fifty three When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned and he equipped for the mission two ships one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels for that he was King of the Arabs and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King Afridun The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships together with the three jewels and slew the crews When our King heard of this he sent an army against them but they routed it then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight whereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth FN one hundred fifty four against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea of Armenia FN one hundred fifty five in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time Sultan Omar bin al Nu uman King of Baghdad and of Khorasan desiring that he aid us with an army so may honour and glory accrue to him and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents and of the King s grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Forty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage they brought out the presents which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia land and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade belted with girdles of gold and silver each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money When the King saw them he rejoiced in them and accepted them then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and summoning his Wazirs took counsel with them of what he should do Herewith rose up among them a Wazir an ancient man Dandan FN one hundred fifty six highs who kissed the ground before Omar and said O King there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts first because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted and secondly because while no enemy dareth attack our country thine army may go forth safely and should it succour the King of Graecia land and defeat his foe the glory will be thine Moreover the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money The King pleased by the Wazir s words and approving his rede gave him a dress of honour and said to him Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down and he expounded to him the matter telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do Moreover he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen armed cap a pie and inured to onset and stress of war Accordingly Sharrkan arose on the instant and chose out a myriad of horsemen after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them saying Ye have delay of three days They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions and provide provisions for the occasion whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others When the appointed three days were ended the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city FN one hundred fifty seven and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money FN one hundred fifty eight Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered I hear and I obey and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions which he promised to do After this the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen besides footmen and camp followers Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled whilst Sharrkan mounted horse with the Wazir Dandan by his side and the colours fluttering over their heads So the host fared forth and stinted not faring with the ambassadors preceding them till day departed and night drew nigh when they alighted and encamped for the night And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow they mounted and tried on guided by the Ambassadors for a space of twenty days and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days halt so they dismounted and pitched their tents spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady FN one hundred fifty nine As for Sharrkan he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides he then slacked the reins of his steed being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person because of his father s charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy s country So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him so that he could no longer urge horse with heel Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback so when slumber overpowered him he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets FN one hundred sixty which was dense with growth but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons Eastern and Western He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne er yet shamed its sayer There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great But as he rode on in fear of wild beasts behold the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men So King Sharrkan alighted and tying his steed to one of the trees went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying Now by the crush of the Messiah this is not well of you but whose utters a word I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle FN one hundred sixty one He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold a stream was gushing and flowing and antelopes at large were frisking and roving and wild cattle amid the pasture moving and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs even as a poet described it in these couplets Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom When lucid waters course through plain and wood No work but His th All great th All glorious Giver of all gifts Giver of all good And as Sharrkan considered the place he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon FN one hundred sixty two Through the midst of the convent passed a stream the water flowing amongst its gardens and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder high bosomed virgins as saith of them the poet in these couplets The mead is bright with what is on t Of merry maidens debonnair Double its beauty and its grace Those trooping damsels slender fair Virgins of graceful swimming gait Ready with eye and lip to ensnare And like the tendril d vine they loose The rich profusion of their hair Shooting their shafts and arrows from Beautiful eyes beyond compare Overpowering and transpiercing Every froward adversaire Sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright and temple locks like the scorpion s tail and she was perfect in essence and attributes as the poet said of her in these couplets She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance And her straight slender stature enshamed the lance She burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red Where all manner of beauties have habitance And the locks on her forehead were lowering as night Whence issues a dawn tide of happiest chance Then Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids Come ye on that I may wrestle with you and gravel you ere the moon set and the dawn break So each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright and pinioned them with their girdles and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her and the beldam said as in wrath O strumpet cost thou glory in grounding these girls Behold I am an old woman yet have I thrown them forty times So what hast thou to boast of But if thou have the strength to wrestle with me stand up that I may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels The young lady smiled at her words but she was filled with inward wrath and she jumped up and asked O my lady Zat al Dawahi FN one hundred sixty three by the truth of the Messiah wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed or dost thou jest with me and she answered Yea And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Forty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the young lady asked Zat al Dawahi By the truth of the Messiah wilt wrestle with me or dost jest and she answered Yea I will wrestle with thee in very deed Sharrkan looking on the while the damsel cried Rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do When the old woman heard this she raged with exceeding rage and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog FN one hundred sixty four Then she sprang to her feet whilst the damsel stood up to her and said Now by the truth of the Messiah I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked Mistress whore FN one hundred sixty five So she loosed her petticoat trousers and putting her hand under her clothes tore them off her body then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or a spotted snake With this she inclined towards the damsel and said Do thou as I have done All this time Sharrkan was gazing at the twain and laughing at the beldam s loathly semblance So the damsel leisurely rose and taking a sash of Yamani stuff passed it twice round her waist then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal smooth and rounded and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples as it were a bed of Nu uman s anemones and breasts like double pomegranates Then the old woman leant towards her and the two laid hold either of each while Sharrkan raised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle might beat the beldam Presently the young woman get beneath the old woman and gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand hoisted her off the ground with both whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and in so doing fell on her back arsiversy with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine furthermore she let fly two great farts FN one hundred sixty six one of which blew up the dust from the earth s face and the other steamed up to the gate of Heaven Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground Then he arose and baring his brand looked right and left but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back and said to himself He lied not who named thee Lady of Calamities Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others So he drew near them to hear what should pass between them Then the young lady went up to the old one and throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying O my lady Zat al Dawahi I intended only to throw thee and not all this but thou triedst to twist out of my hands so laud to Allah for safety She returned her no answer but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned with the fair damsel standing amongst them Quoth Sharrkan to himself Every luck hath its cause Sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled FN one hundred sixty seven him on when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath which he brandished shouting the while his war cry Allah is All mighty FN one hundred sixty eight When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and taking firm stand on the bank of the stream whose breadth was six ells the normal cubits made one bound and landed clear on the farther side FN one hundred sixty nine where she turned and cried out with a loud voice Who art thou O thou fellow that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host Whence camest thou and whither art thou going Speak sooth for truth will stand thee in good stead and lie not for lies come of villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies for thou art now in an open plain and did we shout but a single shout would come to our rescue four thousand knights FN one hundred seventy So tell me what thou wantest and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road we will do so When Sharrkan heard her words he replied I am a stranger of the Moslems who fared forth this night single handed seeking for spoil nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them Quoth she I would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it and as for the handmaids by Allah they shall never be thy spoil Have I not told thee that to lie is villein vile Quoth he The wise man is he who taketh warning by others Thereupon quoth she By the truth of the Messiah did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands I would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might but I take pity upon the stranger So if thou seek booty I require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me by thy faith that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand and we will wrestle I and thou If thou throw me set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty but if I throw thee thou shalt become under my command Swear this to me for I fear thy treachery indeed it hath become a common saw Where Perfidy is innate there Trust is a weakly mate Now an thou wilt swear I will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee Answered Sharrkan and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul Truly she knoweth not that I am a champion of champions Swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding and I will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest Draw near that I wrestle with thee If thou throw me I have money where withal to ransom myself and if I throw thee twill be booty and booty enough for me Rejoined the damsel I am content herewith and Sharrkan was astounded at her words and said And by the truth of the Apostle whom Allah bless and keep I too am content on the other part Then said she Swear to me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling else mayst thou die without the pale of Al Islam Sharrkan replied By Allah were a Kazi to swear me even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis FN one hundred seventy one he would not impose upon me such an oath as this Then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree but he was drowned in the sea of thought saying in himself Praise be to Him who fashioned her from dirty water FN one hundred seventy two Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling and said to her Cross the stream to me but she replied It is not for me to come over to thee if thou wilt pass thou over here to me I cannot do that quoth he and quoth she O boy I will come across to thee So she tucked up her skirts and leaping landed on the other side of the stream by his side whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms FN one hundred seventy three But he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness for he saw a shape which the Hand of Power had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann which had been fostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted Then she called out to him O Moslem come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd which illumined the whole place with its whiteness and Sharrkan was dazzled by it Then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge she doing the like and caught hold of her and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms Presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle breeding languishment and he fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the roaring gale So she lifted him up and throwing him to the ground sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand for his soul had lost mastery over his senses Then she asked him O Moslem the slaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself and he answered O my lady thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful for our prophet Mohammed whom Allah bless and preserve prohibited the slaying of women and children old men and monks As it was thus revealed to your Prophet she replied it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy so rise I give thee thy life for generosity is never lost upon the generous Then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib even women and she said to him Be not ashamed but verily one who entereth the land of Roum in quest of booty and cometh to assist Kings against Kings how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib Twas not for lack of strength in me he answered nor didst thou throw me by thy force it was thy loveliness overthrew me so if thou wilt grant me another bout it will be of thy courtesy She laughed and said I grant thee thy request but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary and it were only right I should loose them for haply this next wrestling bout will be long Then she went to the slave girls and unbinding them said to them in the tongue of Greece Get ye to some safe place till I foil this Moslem s lust and longing for you So they went away whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two Then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers but when he felt waist touch waist his strength failed him and she waxing ware of this lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven flash and threw him to the ground He fell on his back FN one hundred seventy four and then she said to him Rise I give thee thy life a second time I spared thee in the first count because of thy Prophet for that he made unlawful the slaying of women and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood but I charge thee if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al Nu uman to succour the King of Constantinople a stronger than thou send him hither and tell him of me for in wrestling there are shifts and trips catches and holds such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip the hug the feet catch the thigh Lite FN one hundred seventy five the jostle and the leg lock By Allah O my lady quoth Sharrkan and indeed he was highly incensed against her had I been Master al Safdi Master Mohammed Kimal or Ibn al Saddi FN one hundred seventy six as they were in their prime I had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest for O my mistress by Allah thou hast not grassed me by thy strength but by the blandishments of thy back parts for we men of Mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight But now an thou wish thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three moreover I have regained my presence of mind When she heard his words she said to him Hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling O vanquished one However come on an thou wilt but know that this must be the last round Then she bent forward and challenged him and Sharrkan did likewise setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him O Moslem thou art now on thy mettle Yes he replied thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round after which each of us will wend a different way She laughed and he laughed too FN one hundred seventy seven then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back She laughed at him and said Art thou an eater of bran Thou are like a Badawi s bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the Father of Winds FN one hundred seventy eight that droppeth before a puff of air Fie upon thee O thou poor thing adding Get thee back to the Moslem army and send us other than thyself for thou fairest of thews and proclaim for us among the Arabs and Persians the Turks and Daylamites FN one hundred seventy nine whoso hath might in him let him come to us Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to Sharrkan laughing Parting with thee is right grievous to me O my lord but get thee to thy mates before dawn lest the Knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points Thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and Knights Sharrkan was confounded and called to her as she turned from him making towards the convent O my lady wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger the broken hearted slave of love So she turned to him laughing and said What is thy want I will grant thee thy prayer Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy replied he and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality I who have become one of thy servitors None baulk kindliness save the base she rejoined honour us in Allah s name on my head and eyes be it Mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me for now thou art my guest At this Sharrkan was glad and hastening back to his horse mounted and walked him abreast of her and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge FN one hundred eighty built of beams of the white poplar hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks When Sharrkan looked he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts and as she came up to them she said to one in the Greek tongue Arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent So she went up to Sharrkan and led him over much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw and saying to himself O would that the Wazir Dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours Then he turned to the young lady and said to her O marvel of loveliness now I have two claims upon thee first the claim of good fellowship and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality I am now under thy commandance and thy guidance so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of Al Islam where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who I am When she heard this she was angered and said to him By the truth of the Messiah thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit but now I see what mischief there is in thy heart and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent How should I do as thou sayest when I wot that if I came to that King of yours Omar bin al Nu uman I should never get free from him For truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls Lord of Baghdad and of Khorasan though he be who hath built for himself twelve pavilions in number as the months of the year and in each a concubine after the number of the days and if I come to him he would not prove shy of me for your folk believe I am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ Or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves FN one hundred eighty one So how canst thou speak thus to me As for thy saying Thou shalt look upon the braves of the Moslems by the truth of the Messiah thou sayest that which is not true for I saw your army when it reached our land these two days ago and I did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of Kings but I beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together And as to thy words Thou shalt know who I am I did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me even wert thou Sharrkan Omar bin al Nu uman s son the prowess name in these days Knowest thou Sharrkan asked he and she answered Yes and I know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the King of Constantinople O my lady said Sharrkan I adjure thee by thy religion tell me the cause of all this that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth and with whom the fault lies Now by the virtue of thy faith she replied did I not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that I am of the daughters of Roum I would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader the Wazir Dandan and vanquish their champion Sharrkan FN one hundred eighty two Nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby for I have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the Arabs But I have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women Nor indeed had Sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him Clear this stream could he have done it and I only long and lust that the Messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent that I might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Forty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Nazarene damsel said to Sharrkan and he listening impatiently enow Verily if Sharrkan fell into my hands I would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating An faulty of one fault the Beauty prove Her charms a thousand advocates shall move So she went up and Sharrkan after her and when he saw the maiden s back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other like rollers in the rolling sea he extemporised these couplets For her sins is a pleader that brow And all hearts its fair pleading must bow When I saw it I cried To night The moon at its fullest doth show Tho Balkis own Ifrit FN one hundred eighty three try a bout Spite his force she would deal him a throw The two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway This she opened and ushered Sharrkan into a long vestibule vaulted with ten connected arches from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire The handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems FN one hundred eighty four and went on before her Sharrkan still following till they reached the inner convent There the Moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold The monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold whence the water ran like molten silver whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for Kings Then said the damsel Ascend O my lord this throne So he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time Sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him She hath gone to her dormitory but we will serve thee even as she ordered So they set before him viands of rare varieties and he ate his sufficiency when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver and he washed his hands Then his thoughts reverted to his army knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father s injunctions so he was troubled about his case repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated I am not lost to prudence but indeed Here I m bewildered what shall be my rede Would any aid me in mine ails of love By my own might and sleight would I be free d But ah my heart is lost and passion shent To none save Allah can I trust my need When he ended his verse behold there came up to him a rare show and a fair more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her She was clad in brocades befitting Kings her breasts were like twin pomegranates a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal FN one hundred eighty five supporting a silvern shaft When Sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight and he forgot army and Wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems Handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead He sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness and cried aloud Beware and beware of that zone rarely fair and broke out into these couplets With heavy back parts high breasts delicate And lissome form that sways with swimming gait She deftly hides love longing in her breast But I may never hide its ban and bate While hosts of followers her steps precede FN one hundred eighty six Like pearls now necklaced and now separate She gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him when she came up to him and said In very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee O Sharrkan How sped thy night O hero after we went away and left thee adding Verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful especially in great Kings and thou art Crown Prince Sharrkan son and heir of King Omar bin al Nu uman so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite And as thou art pierced by the shaft of Fate be resignation thine and abide content to wait When he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth saying I am Sharrkan bin Omar bin al Nu uman whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place so whatso thou willest do it in my case She hung her head groundwards a long while then turned to him and said Be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear FN one hundred eighty seven for thou art the guest of my hospitality and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard Have no fear for by the truth of the Messiah if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee till life had left my body for thy sake indeed thou art now under the charge of the Messiah and of me Hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him she would have done so during the past night Presently she bespoke in the Grecian tongue one of her slave girls who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food but Sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself Haply she hath put somewhat in this meat She knew what was in his thought so she turned to him and said By the truth of the Messiah the case is not on such wise nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest Had my mind been set on slaying thee I had slain thee ere now Then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful where upon Sharrkan came forward and ate too She was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied They washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour wines of all colours and kinds and a wine service with vessels of gold silver and crystal She filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him even as she had done with the food then she crowned a second and handed it to him He drank and she said to him O Moslem see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life And she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink till he took leave of his wits And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Forty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply Sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her Presently she said to the slave girl O Marjanah FN one hundred eighty eight bring us some instruments of music To hear is to obey said the hand maid and going out returned in the twinkling of an eye with a Damascus lute FN one hundred eighty nine a Persian harp a Tartar pipe and an Egyptian dulcimer The young lady took the lute and after tuning each several string began in gentle undersong to sing softer than zephyr s wing and sweeter than Tasmin FN one hundred ninety spring with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following Allah assain those eyne What streams of blood they shed How many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped I love all lovers who to lovers show them cure Twere wrong to rue the love in wrong head born and bred Haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens Heaven help the hapless heart by force of thee misled Thou doomest me to death who art my king and I Ransom with life the deemster who would doom me dead Thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument played and recited couplets in the Roumi tongue then their mistress sang also and seeing Sharrkan in ecstasies asked him O Moslem dost thou understand what I say and he answered Nay my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips She laughed and continued If I sing to thee in Arabic what wouldst thou do I should no longer quoth he be master of my senses Then she took an instrument and changing the measure began singing these verses The smack of parting s myrrh to me How then bear patience aloe I m girt by ills in trinity Severance distance cruelty My freedom stole that fairest she And parting irks me bitterly When she ended her verse she looked at Sharrkan and found him lost to existence and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens FN one hundred ninety one Then he revived and remembering the songs again inclined to mirth and merriment and the twain returned to their wine and wassail and continued their playing and toying their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing Then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when Sharrkan asked after her they answered She is gone to her sleeping chamber whereto he rejoined Under Allah s ward and His good guard As soon as it was morning a handmaid came to him and said to him My mistress biddeth thee to her So he rose and followed her and as he drew near her lodging the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels Thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams About the saloon were figures carved in human form and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within so that the beholder would fancy they spoke FN one hundred ninety two Here sat the young lady looking at the figures but when she saw Sharrkan she sprang to her feet and taking him by the hand made him sit down by her side and asked him how he had passed the night He blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him Knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love and he answered Yes I wot somewhat in verse on that matter Let me hear it quoth she so he began quoting Pleasure and health good cheer good appetite To Azzah freest with our name and fame By Allah would I near her off she flies At tangent granting less the more I claim I dote on Azzah but when clear I off My rivals clears me too that dearest dame Like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud Which ere siesta done thin air became When she heard this she said Verily Al Kuthayyir FN one hundred ninety three was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste and he was superlative in his praise of Azzah when he sang and she began to recite Did Azzah deal behest to Sun o noon The judge had judged her beauty s bestest boon And girls who come to me and carp at her God make their rosy cheeks her sandal shoon And indeed quoth she twas said that Azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness Then she asked Sharrkan saying O Prince cost thou know aught of Jamil s FN one hundred ninety four verses to Buthaynah if so repeat to us somewhat of them and he answered Yes I know them better than any whereupon he began repeating these couplets Jamil in Holy war go fight to me they say What war save fight for fair ones would I e er essay To me their every word and work are mere delight And martyrs crepe I all they slay in fight and fray An ask I O Buthaynah what s this love I pray Which eats my heart quoth she Twill stay for ever and aye And when I cry Of wits return some small display For daily use quoth she Far far tis fled away Thou seekst my death naught else thy will can satisfy While I no goal espy save thee and thee alway Thou hast spoken right well said she O King s son and Jamil also spoke excellently well But what would Buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich Thou seekst my death naught else thy will can satisfy O my lady quoth Sharrkan she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me and even that will not satisfy thee She laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till Day put out her light and Night came in darkness dight Then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept while Sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned As soon as he awoke the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment as wont and kissing the ground between his hands said to him Bismillah in Allah s name be so kind as to come FN one hundred ninety five our mistress biddeth thee to her presence So he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him playing on tabrets and other instruments of music till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts passing all description Sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting He plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry And her breast pearls that bedded in gold mine lie Pure water on silvern bars is her brow And her cheeks show roses with rubies vie Meseems in her eyne that the violet s hue Lies purpling set in the Ithmid s FN one hundred ninety six dye When the lady saw Sharrkan she stood up to him in honour and taking his hand seated him by her side and asked O son of King Omar bin al Nu uman hast thou any cunning in the game of chess Yes he answered but do not thou with me as said the poet I speak and longing love upties me and unties me Till with her honey dew of inner lip she plies me I brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me With white and black FN one hundred ninety seven but black cum white ne er satisfies me Twas as if King for Castle I were fain to place me Till wilful loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me And if I seek to read intent in eyes that eye me Oh man that glance askance with hint of wish defies me Then she brought the chessboard and played with him but Sharrkan instead of looking at her moves kept gazing at her fair mouth and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant FN one hundred ninety eight instead of knight She laughed and said to him If thy play be after this fashion thou knowest naught of the game This is only our first replied he judge not by this bout When she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her but she beat him a second time a third a fourth and a fifth So she turned to him and said Thou art beaten in everything and he replied O my lady how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten Then she bade bring food and they ate and washed their hands after which the wine was set before them and they drank Presently she took the dulcimer for her hand was cunning in smiting it and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets Twixt the close tied and open wide no medium Fortune knoweth Now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness showeth Then drink her wine the syne she s thine and smiling thou dost find her Anon she ll fall and fare away when all thy good forth goeth They ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first When darkness set in the lady betook her to her dormitory leaving him alone with the hand maids so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom Seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up and they carried him to their mistress who came to meet him and taking him by the hand seated him by her side Then she asked him how he had passed his night whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised Ne er incline thee to part Which embitters the heart E en the sun when he sets Shall in pallor depart While they were solacing themselves after this fashion behold there arose a great and sudden clamour and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands and cried aloud in the Grecian tongue Thou hast fallen into our hands O Sharrkan so make thee sure of death When he heard this he said to himself By Allah she hath entrapped me and held me in play till her men should come These are the Knights with whom she threatened me but tis I who have thrown myself into this strait Then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd Who are ye O most gracious Princess and peerless onion pearl answered the leading Knight dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side Not I she replied who may he be Quoth the Patrician This is of towns the highwayman This is he who rideth in the horseman s van This is Sharrkan son of King Omar bin al Nu uman This is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place The news of him reached King Hardub thy father by report of the ancient dame Zat al Dawahi and thy sire our sovereign hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the Greeks by taking captive this ominous lion When she heard this she looked at the Knight and asked him What be thy name and he answered I am Masurah son of thy slave Mausurah bin Kashardah Knight of Knights And how quoth she durst thou enter my presence without leave Quoth he O my lady when I came to the gate none forbade me neither chamberlain nor porter but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont although when others come they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them But this is not a time for long talking when the King is expecting our return with this Prince the scorpion sting FN one hundred ninety nine of the Islamitic host that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came without the bane of battling with them These words be ill words rejoined the Princess and Dame Zat al Dawahi lied avouching an idle thing and a vain whereof she weeteth not the truth for by the virtue of the Messiah this man who is with me is not Sharrkan nor is he a captive but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality and I made him my guest So even were we assured that this be Sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt I say it would ill befit mine honour that I should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection So make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men but return to the King my father and kiss the ground before him and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the Lady Zat al Dawahi O Abrizah replied Masurah the Knight I cannot return to the King s majesty without his debtor and enemy Quoth she and indeed she had waxed very wroth Out on thee Return to him with my answer and no blame shall befal thee Quoth Masurah I will not return without him Thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed Exceed not in talk and vain words for verily this man had not come in to us were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders and if I said to him Thou art Sharrkan son of King Omar bin al Nu uman he would answer Yes But tis not of your competence to let or hinder him for if you do so he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place Behold here he is by my side and I will bring him before you sword and targe in hand Albeit I were safe from thy wrath answered Masurah the Knight I am not safe from that of thy father and when I see him I shall sign to the Knights to take him captive and we will carry him to the King bound and in abject sort When she heard this she said The matter shall not pass thus for twould be blazoning mere folly This man is but one and ye are an hundred Knights so if you would attack him come out against him one after one that it may appear to the King which is the valiant amongst you And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Fiftieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Princess Abrizah said to the Knight This man is but one and ye are an hundred so if ye would attack him come out against him one after one that it may appear to the King which is the valiant Quoth Masurah the Knight By the truth of the Messiah thou sayest sooth and none but I shall sally out against him first Quoth she Wait till I go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make If he consent tis well but if he refuse ye shall on no wise come to him for I and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom So she went to Sharrkan and told him the news whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the Emirs but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad till the report reached the King against her wish and intent So he again began reproaching himself and said How came I to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the Greeks But hearing the young lady s proposal he said to her Indeed their onset one after one would be overburdensome to them Will they not come out against me ten by ten That would be villainy said she Let one have at one When he heard this he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear and Masurah the Knight also sprang up and bore down upon him Sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut FN two hundred which clove him to the middle and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels When the lady beheld that swashingblow Sharrkan s might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness So she turned to the Knights and said Take wreak for your chief Thereupon out came the slain man s brother a fierce and furious Knight and rushed upon Sharrkan who delayed not but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals Then cried the Princess O ye servants of the Messiah avenge your comrade So they ceased not charging down upon him one after one and Sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade till he had slain fifty Knights the lady looking on the while And Allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello but fell upon him in a body and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled FN two hundred one till he had driven sense and soul out of them Then the Princess called aloud to her damsels saying Who is left in the convent and they replied None but the gate keepers whereupon she went up to Sharrkan and took him to her bosom he doing the same and they returned to the palace after he had made an end of the melee Now there remained a few of the Knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery and when the Princess saw this she rose from Sharrkan s side and left him for a while but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine Indian scymitar And she said Now by the truth of the Messiah I will not be a niggard of myself for my guest nor will I abandon him though for this I abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the Greeks Then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the Knights and other twenty had taken to flight FN two hundred two When she saw what work he had made with them she said to him Allah bless thee O Sharrkan The Cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee Then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets How oft in the mellay I ve cleft the array And given their bravest to lions a prey Ask of me and of them when I proved me prow O er creation on days of the foray and fray When I left in the onslaught their lions to lie On the sands of the low lands FN two hundred three in fieriest day When he ended his verse the Princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her O lady mine wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand To guard thee against these caitiffs FN two hundred four she replied Then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them How came ye to admit the King s Knights into my dwelling without leave of me and they answered O Princess it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the King s messengers and especially for the chief of his Knights Quoth she I think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest and bade Sharrkan smite their necks He did so and she cried to the rest of her servants Of a truth they deserved even more than that Then turning to Sharrkan she said to him Now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed thou shalt be made acquainted with my history Know then that I am the daughter of King Hardub of Roum my name is Abrizah and the ancient dame yclept Zat al Dawahi is my grandmother by the sword side She it certainly is who told my father of thee and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me more by token as thou hast slain my father s chivalry and it is noised abroad that I have separated myself from the Nazarenes and have become no better than I should be with the Moslems Wherefore it were wiser that I leave this dwelling while Zat al Dawahi is on my track but I require of thee the like kindness and courtesy I have shown thee for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account So do not thou neglect to do aught that I shall say to thee remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee Hearing her words Sharrkan joyed greatly his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight and he said By Allah none shall come at thee while life is in my bosom But hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people Even so she answered and Sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth Then said she Now is my heart at ease but there remaineth one other condition for thee What is it asked he and she answered It is that thou return with thy host to thine own country Quoth he O lady mine my father King Omar bin al Nu uman sent me to wage war upon thy sire on account of the treasure he plundered from the King of Constantinople and amongst the rest three great jewels noted givers of good fortune Quoth she Cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes I will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the King of Constantinople Know that we have a yearly festival highs the Convent Feast whereat Kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families and the visitors abide there seven days I was wont to be one of them but when there befel enmity between us my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years One year it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron as was their custom came a daughter of the King of Constantinople a beautiful girl called Sophia They tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways FN two hundred five but Sophia said I will not return to Constantinople save by water So they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite and making sail they put out to sea but as they were voyaging behold a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till as Fate and Fortune would have it she fell in with a Nazarene craft from the Camphor Island FN two hundred six carrying a crew of five hundred armed Franks who had been cruising about a long time When they sighted the sails of the ship wherein Sophia and her women were they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her Then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and splitting their sails drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast Thereupon we sallied forth and looking on them as spoil driven to us by Fate FN two hundred seven boarded and took them and slaying the men made prize of the wreck wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens amongst whom was the King s daughter Sophia After the capture we carried the Princess and her women to my father not knowing her to be a daughter of King Afridun of Constantinople and he chose out for himself ten including her and divided the rest among his dependents Presently he set apart five damsels amongst whom was the King s daughter and sent them to thy father King Omar bin al Nu uman together with other gifts such as broadcloth FN two hundred eight and woollen stuffs and Grecian silks Thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls Sophia daughter of King Afridun nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat rebuking him with menaces and saying to him Two years ago you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of Frankish pirates in which was my daughter Sophia attended by her maidens numbering some threescore Yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise nor could I make the matter public lest reproach befal me amongst the Kings by reason of my daughter s honour So I concealed my case till this year when I wrote to certain Frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the Kings of the Isles They replied By Allah we carried her not forth of thy realm but we have heard that King Hardub rescued her from certain pirates And they told me the whole tale Then he added in the writing which he writ to my father Except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter you will the instant my letter reacheth you send my daughter back to me But if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment I will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices FN two hundred nine When my father read this letter and understood the contents FN two hundred ten it vexed him and he regretted not having known that Sophia King Afridun s daughter was among the captured damsels that he might have sent her back to her sire and he was perplexed about the case because after so long a time he could not send to King Omar bin al Nu uman and demand her back from him especially as he had lately heard that Heaven had granted him boon of babe by this Sophia So when we pondered that truth we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to King Afridun making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to King Omar bin al Nu uman who had gotten the blessing of issue by her When my father s reply reached King Afridun he rose up and sat down FN two hundred eleven and roared and foamed at the mouth crying What shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to Kings and they lie with her without marriage contract By the Messiah and the true Faith said he I will not desist till I have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame and indeed I will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me So he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares when he sent an embassy to thy father King Omar to tell him that which thou hast heard accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to King Afridun whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot As for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid there was not one soothfast word in that matter for they were with Sophia his daughter and my father took them from her when he got possession of her and of her maidens and gave them to me in free gift and they are now with me So go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into and shut in by the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the Franks and the country of the Greeks for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the Day of retribution and retaliation I know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them because thou didst order a three days rest withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do When Sharrkan heard her words he was absent awhile in thought then he kissed Princess Abrizah s hand and said Praise be to Allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me But tis grievous to me to part from thee and I know not what will become of thee after my departure Go now to thine army she replied and turn them back while ye are yet near your own country If the envoys be still with them lay hands on them and keep them that the case may be made manifest to you and after three days I will be with you all and we will enter Baghdad together As he turned to depart she said Forget not the compact which is between me and thee then she rose to bid FN two hundred twelve him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire so she took leave of him and throwing her arms round his neck wept with exceeding weeping and repeated these verses I bade adieu my right hand wiped my tears away The while my left hand held her in a close embrace Fearest thou naught quoth she of shame I answered Nay The lover s parting day is lover s worst disgrace Then Sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent They brought his steed so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow As soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert and he bared his brand and rode cautiously but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold it was the Wazir Dandan and two of his Emirs When they saw him and knew him they dismounted and saluting him asked the reason of his absence whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and Princess Abrizah from first to last The Wazir returned thanks to Almighty Allah for his safety and said FN two hundred thirteen Let us at once leave these lands for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the King of our approach and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners So Sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount which they did and setting out at once they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay The Ambassadors meanwhile had reported Sharrkan s approach to their King who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him But Sharrkan escorted by the Wazir Dandan and the two Emirs had no sooner sighted the army than he raised the cry March March They took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day nor did they cease faring for five days at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley where they rested awhile Then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country Here deeming themselves safe they halted to rest and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts They tarried there two days after which as all would be making for their homes Sharrkan put the Wazir Dandan in command bidding him lead the host back to Baghdad But he himself remained behind with an hundred riders till the rest of the army had made one day s march then he called To horse and mounted with his hundred men They rode on two parasangs FN two hundred fourteen space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust So they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers lion faced and in mail coats cased As soon as they drew within earshot of Sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them saying By the virtue of John and Mary we have won to our wish We have been following you by forced marches night and day till we forewent you to this place So dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves that we may grant you your lives When Sharrkan heard this his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said How is it O Nazarene dogs ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land And doth not this suffice you but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech Do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country Then he shouted to his hundred horsemen Up and at these hounds for they even you in number So saying he bared his sabre and bore down on them he and his but the Franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks and wight dashed against wight and knight dashed upon knight and hot waxed the fight and sore was the affright and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight and they stinted not to charge and to smite right hand meeting right nor to hack and hew with blades bright white till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight Then they drew apart and Sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only who showed hurts but not death hurts Said he to them By Allah my life long have I waded in the clashing sea of fight and I have met many a gallant sprite but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant Knights Know O King said they that there is among them a Frankish cavalier who is their leader and indeed he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust but by Allah he spares us great and small for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him By Allah had he willed he had killed us all Sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the Knight had done and such high report of him so he said When the morn shall morrow we will draw out and defy them for we are an hundred to their hundred and we will seek aid against them from the Lord of the Heavens So they rested that night in such intent whilst the Franks gathered round their Captain and said Verily this day we did not win our will of these and he replied At early dawn when the morrow shall morn we will draw out and challenge them one after one They also rested in that mind and both camps kept guard until Almighty Allah sent the light of day dawn Thereupon King Sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain where they found the Franks ranged in line of battle and Sharrkan said to his followers Our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir so up and at them and lay on load Then came forth an Herald of the Franks and cried out saying Let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day save by the duello a champion of yours against a champion of ours Whereupon one of Sharrkan s riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying Ho who is for smiting Let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling Hardly had he made an end of his vaunt when there sallied forth to him a Frankish cavalier armed cap a pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff riding on a grey white steed FN two hundred fifteen and he had no hair on his cheeks He urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust but it was not long before the Frank foined the Moslem with the lance point and toppling him from his steed took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen His folk rejoiced in their comrade and forbidding him to go out again to the field sent forth another to whom sallied out another Moslem brother to the captive and offered him battle The two fell to either against other and fought for a little while till the Frank bore down upon the Moslem and falsing him with a feint tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner After this fashion the Moslems ceased not dashing forwards one after one and the Franks to unhorse them and take them captive till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted Now they had captured of the Moslems twenty cavaliers and when Sharrken saw this it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them What is this thing that hath befallen us To morrow I myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band If he persist we will punish him with death and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him They righted on this wise till Allah Almighty caused the morn to dawn when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain and Sharrkan was going forth to the plain but behold more than one half of the Franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted till they reached the midst of the battle plain Sharrken looked at that horseman and lo he was their chief He was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks He hent in hand an Indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow like a dirham and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when signing to the Moslems he cried out in fluent Arab speech Ho Sharrkan Ho son of Omar bin al Nu uman Ho thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries up and out to battle bout and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field Thou art Prince of thy people and I am Prince of mine and whoso overcometh his adversary him let the other s men obey and come under his sway Hardly had he ended his speech when out came Sharrkan with a heart full of fury and urging his steed into the midst of the field closed like a raging lion with the Frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors Then they fell to foining and hewing and they stinted not of onset and offset and give and take as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened Then they drew apart and each returned to his own party but as soon as Sharrkan foregathered with his comrades he said Never looked I on the like of this cavalier he hath one quality I have not yet seen in any and this it is that when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance heel In very deed I know not what will be the issue twixt him and me but tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men Then he went to his rest for the night and when morning dawned the Frank came forth and rode down to the mid field where Sharrkan met him and they fell to fighting and to wheeling left and right and necks were stretched out to see the sight nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light Then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello and at last the Frank said to his men Tomorrow shall decide the matter So they both passed that night restfully till dawn and as soon as it was day they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done Then the Frank bethought him of a ruse first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein so that he stumbled and fell with his rider thereupon Sharrkan threw himself on the foe and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged when the Frank cried out to him O Sharrkan champions are not wont to do thus This is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman FN two hundred sixteen When Sharrkan heard this he raised his eyes to the Frank s face and gazing steadfastly at him recognized in him Princess Abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent whereupon he cast brand from hand and kissing the earth before her asked her What moved thee to a deed like this and she answered I desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting These that are with me are my handmaids and they are all clean maids yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain and had not my steed stumbled with me thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat Sharrkan smiled at her speech and said Praise be to Allah for safety and for my reunion with thee O Queen of the age Then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of Sharrkan s troop and dismount They did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and Sharrkan who said to them It is the like of you that Kings keep in store for the need hour Then he signed to his comrades to salute the Princess so all alighted and kissed the earth before her for they knew the story After this the whole two hundred took horse and fared on night and day for six days space till they drew near to Baghdad when they halted and Sharrkan bade Abrizah and her handmaids doff the Frankish garb that was on them And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Fifty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Sharrkan bade Princess Abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of Greece and thus did they Then he despatched a company of his companions to Baghdad to acquaint his father Omar bin al Nu uman with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by Princess Abrizah daughter of King Hardub Lord of Graecia land They halted forthright in the place they had reached and Sharrkan also halted and all righted there and when Almighty Allah made morning dawn Sharrkan and his company and Abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city when lo on the way they met the Wazir Dandan who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour Abrizah and Sharrkan by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al Nu uman When the two drew near they turned towards them and kissed ground before them then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace Sharrkan walked in to his father who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case So he told him all that Abrizah had told him and what had passed between them and said She hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us and indeed he said to his father the King of Constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief because of his daughter Sophia for that the King of Greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee and he the Grecian King not knowing her to be daughter of King Afridun Lord of Constantinople and had he known that he would not have bestowed her upon thee but he would have restored her to her parent And of a verity he continued we were saved from these perils only by the Lady Abrizah and never saw we a more valiant than she And he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting When King Omar heard the story of Sharrkan Abrizah was exalted in his eyes and he longed to see her and question her Thereupon Sharrkan went out to her and said The King calleth for thee she replied I hear and I obey and he took her and brought her in to his father who was seated on his throne and who having dismissed his high officers was attended only by his eunuchs The Princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands saluted him in choice terms He was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son Sharrkan and bade her be seated So she sat down and unveiled her face FN two hundred seventeen and when the King saw her beauty his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels and assigning them solde and allowances Then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid and she answered Here be they with me O King of the age So saying she rose and going to her lodging unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold She opened the casket and taking out those three jewels kissed them and gave them to the King Then she went away bearing his heart with her After her going the King sent for his son Sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three and when he enquired of the other two replied O my son I mean to give one to thy brother Zau al Makan and the other to thy sister Nuzhat al Zaman But when Sharrkan heard that he had a brother for to that time he knew only of his sister he turned to his sire and said to him O King hast thou a son other than myself He answered Yes and he is now six years old adding that his name was Zau al Makan and that he and Nuzhat al Zaman were twins born at a birth This news was grievous to Sharrkan but he kept his secret and said The bless ing of Allah Most High be upon them and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes Quoth the King How do I see thee change thy manner when hearing of this considering that after me thou becomes heir of the kingdom Of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the Emirs and Grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee and this one of the three jewels is thine Sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath and stayed not walking till he had entered Abrizah s palace As he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire Then she sat down and seated him by her side but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him whereupon he told her that Allah had blessed his father with two children by Sophia a boy and a girl and that he had named the boy Zau al Makan and the girl Nuzhat al Zaman adding He hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine so I left it behind I knew naught of Zau al Makan s birth till this day and the twain are now six years old So when I learnt this wrath possessed me and I tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee But now I fear lest my father take thee to wife for he loveth thee and I saw in him signs of desire for thee so what wilt thou say if he wish this Quoth she Know O Sharrkan that thy father hath no dominion over me nor can he have me without my consent and if he prevail over me by force I will take my own life As for the three jewels it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and I had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price but now I desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee if thou have accepted it Hearkening and obedience replied Sharrkan and gave it to her Then said she Fear nothing and talked with him awhile and continued I fear lest my father hear that I am with you and sit not patiently under my loss but do his endeavours to find me and to that end he may ally himself with King Afridun on account of his daughter Sophia and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil When Sharrken heard these words he said to her O my lady if it please thee to sojourn with us take no thought of them though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea Tis well rejoined she if ye entreat me fair I will tarry with you and if ye deal evilly by me I will depart from you Then she bade her slave maidens bring food so they set the tables and Sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house disturbed and perturbed Such was his case but regarding the affairs of his father Omar bin al Nu uman after dismissing his son Sharrkan he arose and taking the other two jewels betook himself to the Lady Sophia who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated Presently his two children Zau al Makan and Nuzhat al Zaman came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one s neck at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands Then went they to their mother who joyed in their joy and wished the King long life so he asked her Why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of King Afridun Lord of Constantinople that I might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank O King answered Sophia and what could I desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee overwhelmed as I am with thy favours and thy benefits And furthermore Allah hath blessed me with two children by thee a son and a daughter Her reply pleased the King and after leaving her he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace Moreover he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment And presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his Court where he distributed justice among the lieges So far concerning him and Sophia and her children but in the matter of Abrizah the King was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day and every night he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her but she gave him no answer only saying O King of the age I have no desire for men at this present When he saw her withdraw from him his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until when weary of this he summoned his Wazir Dandan and opening his very heart to him told him of his love for Princess Abrizah daughter of Hardub and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die for that he could get no grace of her The Wazir hearing these words said to the King As soon as it is dark night take thou a piece of Bhang the measure of a miskal about an ounce and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her When the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near fill her a last cup and dropping therein the Bhang give it to her to drink and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her Then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her and such is my advice FN two hundred eighteen Thy rede is aright quoth the King and seeking his treasury he took thence a piece of concentrated Bhang if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year This he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by when he betook himself to the palace of Princess Abrizah who seeing him stood up to receive him but he bade her sit down So she sat down and he sat by her and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail whereupon she furnished the carousing table FN two hundred nineteen and placed it before him Then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking So they fell to tippling and the King ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head and seeing this he took out the bit of Bhang from his pocket and holding it between his fingers filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off Then filling a second he said To thy companionship and dropped the drug into her cup she knowing naught of it She took it and drank it off then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber He waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs When the King saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and Satan seduced him and he could not master himself but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head Then he rose off her and went to one of her women by name Marjanah and said Go in to thy lady and speak with her So she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible with the blood running down to the calves of her legs whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night As soon as Almighty Allah brought the dawn the handmaid Marjanah washed her mistress s hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of Bhang like a bolus FN two hundred twenty Then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to Marjanah Tell me what hath befallen me So she told her what had passed and how she had found her lying on her back with the blood running down wherefore she knew that King Omar bin al Nu uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her At this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy saying to her damsels Deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that I am ill till I see what Allah will do with me Presently the news of her sickness came to the King so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries Some months she thus passed in solitude during which time the King s flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched so that he abstained from her Now she had conceived by him and when the months of child breeding had gone by her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled and the world was straitened upon her so she said to her handmaid Marjanah Know that it is not the folk who have wronged me but I who sinned against my own self FN two hundred twenty one in that I left my father and mother and country Indeed I abhor life for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me I used when I mounted my steed to have the mastery of him but now I am unable to ride If I be brought to bed among them I shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame and if I return to my father with what face shall I meet him or with what face shall I have recourse to him How well quoth the poet Say what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead Nor cup companion nor a cup nor place to house his head Marjanah answered her It is thine to command I will obey and Abrizah said I desire at once to leave this place secretly so that none shall know of me but thou and return to my father and my mother for when flesh stinketh there is naught for it but its own folk and Allah shall do with me e en as He will O Princess Marjanah replied what thou wouldest do is well Then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the King went out to chase and hunt and his son Sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile Then said she to Marjanah I wish to set out this night but how shall I do against my destiny For already I feel the pangs of labour and child birth and if I abide other four or five days I shall be brought to bed here and I shall be unable to travel to my country But this is what was written on my forehead Then she considered awhile and said to Marjanah Look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way for I have no strength to bear arms By Allah O my lady replied Marjanah I know none but a black slave called Al Ghazban FN two hundred twenty two who is one of the slaves of King Omar bin al Nu uman he is a valiant wight and he keepeth guard at our palace gate The King appointed him to attend us and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours so lookye I will go out and speak with him of this matter and promise him some monies and tell him that if he have a mind to tarry with us I will marry him to whom he will He told me before to day that he had been a highwayman so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land She rejoined Call him that I may talk with him whereupon Marjanah fared forth and said to the slave O Ghazban Allah prosper thee so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee Then she took him by the hand and brought him to the Princess whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him her heart took fright at him How ever she said to herself of a truth Need giveth the law and she approached to speak with him yet her heart started away from him Presently she said O Ghazban say me wilt thou help me against the perfidies of Fortune and conceal my secret if I discover it to thee When the slave saw her his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply O my mistress whatsoever thou biddest me do I will not depart therefrom Quoth she I would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the King s horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt and go with us to our own country where if thou desire to abide with us I will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens or if thou prefer return to thine own land we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee When Al Ghazban heard this he rejoiced with great joy and replied O my lady I will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses Then he went away gladsome and saying to himself I shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me I will kill them both and take their riches But he kept this his intent to himself and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses one of which he rode and Princess Abrizah made Marjanah mount the second she mounting the third albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish And the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country when the travail pangs came upon Abrizah and she could no longer resist so she said to Al Ghazban Set me down for the pains of labour are upon me and cried to Marjanah Do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me Then Marjanah dismounted from her horse and Al Ghazban did in like sort and they made fast the bridles and helped the Princess to dismount for she was aswoon from excess of anguish When Al Ghazban saw her on the ground Satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face said O my lady vouchsafe me thy favours Hearing these words she turned to him and said It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves after having refused Kings and Braves And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Fifty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Princess Abrizah said to the black slave Al Ghazban It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves after having refused Kings and Braves And she was wroth with him and cried Woe to thee what words are these thou sayest Out on thee and talk not thus in my presence and know that I will never consent to what thou sayest though I drink the cup of death Wait till I have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth and then if thou be able thereto do with me as thou wilt but an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly I will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this And she began reciting extempore FN two hundred twenty three O spare me thou Ghazban indeed enow for me Are heavy strokes of time mischance and misery Whoredom my Lord forfends to all humanity Quoth He Who breaks my bidding Hell for home shall see And if thou leave not suing me to whoredom s way Against th Almighty s choicest gift my chastity Upon my tribesmen I with might and main will call And gather all however far or near they be And with Yamani blade were I in pieces hewn Ne er shall he sight my face who makes for villeiny The face of free born come of noble folk and brave What then can be to me the seed of whoreson slave When Ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey FN two hundred twenty four his nostrils swelled his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled And he repeated these couplets Ho thou Abrizah mercy leave me not for I Of thy love and Yamani FN two hundred twenty five glance the victim lie My heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty My body wasted and my patience done to die From glances ravishing all hearts with witchery Reason far flies the while desire to thee draws nigh Though at thy call should armies fill the face of earth E en now I d win my wish and worlds in arms defy When Abrizah heard these words she wept with sore weeping and said to him Woe to thee O Ghazban How dareth the like of thee to address me such demand O base born and obscene bred Dost thou deem all folk are alike When the vile slave heard this from her he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death Then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains Such was the case with Al Ghazban but as regards Abrizah she gave birth to a son like the moon and Marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother s side and lo and behold the child fastened to its mother s breast and she dying FN two hundred twenty six When Marjanah saw this she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed saying Alas my mistress Alas the pity of it Thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave after all thy knightly prowess And she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon FN two hundred twenty seven but after awhile it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host Now this was the army of King Hardub Princess Abrizah s father and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to Baghdad and that they were with King Omar bin al Nu uman he had come forth leading those with him to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the King When he had gone a single day s march from his capital he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter Now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and Marjanah and the slave Al Ghazban and he made for them to push inquiry Seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself so he killed Abrizah and fled for his life When they came up King Hardub saw his daughter lying dead and Marjanah weeping over her and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground All the riders of his company the Emirs and Waxirs took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the King a great pavilion domed and circular without which stood the grandees of the realm When Marjanah saw her master she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled and when he came to himself he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said Of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to King Omar bin al Nu uman and she informed him how Sharrkan s father had dealt with the Princess When King Hardub heard this the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping Then he called for a litter and therein laying his dead daughter returned to Caesarea and carried her into the palace where he went in to his mother Zat al Dawahi and said to that Lady of Calamities Shall the Moslems deal thus with my girl Verily King Omar bin al Nu uman despoiled her of her honour by force and after this one of his black slaves slew her By the truth of the Messiah I will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame else will I kill myself with mine own hand And he wept passing sore Quoth his mother None other than Marjanah killed thy daughter for she hated her in secret and she continued to her son Fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter for by the truth of the Messiah I will not turn back from King Omar bin al Nu uman till I have slain him and his sons and of a very truth I will do with him a deed passing the power of Sage and Knight whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place but needs must thou do my bidding in all I shall direct for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire By the virtue of the Messiah replied he I will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say Then quoth she Bring me a number of hand maids high bosomed virgins and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before Kings and the art of conversation and making verses and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge And the sages must be Moslems that they may teach them the language and traditions of the Arabs together with the history of the Caliphs and the ancient annals of the Kings of Al Islam and if we persevere in this for four years space we shall gain our case So possess thy soul in patience and wait for one of the Arabs saith If we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye When we have taught the girls these things we shall be able to work our will with our foe for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter she that hath found mercy FN two hundred twenty eight As soon as I have made an end of their education as described to thee I will take them and set out with them in person When King Hardub heard his mother s words he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him Moslem sages They obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought When these came into presence he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels Then he committed the handmaidens to their hands And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Fifty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of King Hardub he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge philosophy and polite accomplishments and they set themselves to do his bidding Such was the case with King Hardub but as for King Omar bin al Nu uman when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace he sought Princess Abrizah but found her not nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her This was grievous to him and he said How could the lady leave the palace unknown of any Had my kingdom been at stake in this case it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it I will never again go to sport and hunt till I have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them And he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of Princess Abrizah Hereupon behold his son Sharrkan returned from his journey and the father told him what had happened and informed him how the lady had fled whilst he was chasing and hunting whereat he grieved with exceeding grief Then King Omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them appointing for them stipends When Sharrkan saw this he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter so one day his father said to him Why do I see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face O my father replied Sharrkan every time I see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them jealousy seizeth on me and I fear lest it grow on me till I slay them and thou slay me in return And this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion But now I crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest that I may abide there the remnant of my life for as the sayer of bywords saith Absence from my friend is better and fitter for me and Whatso eye doth not perceive that garreth not heart to grieve And he bowed his head towards the ground When King Omar bin al Nu uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down he soothed his heart and said to him O my son I grant thee this and I have not in my reign a greater than the Castle of Damascus and the government of it is thine from this time Thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write Sharrkan s patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of Damascus of Syria And when they had written it he equipped him and sent with him the Wazir Dandan and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations and took leave of him and the grandees and officers of state did likewise and he set out with his host When he arrived at Damascus the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank and the others to the left Thus far concerning Sharrkan but as regards his father Omar bin al Nu uman soon after the departure of his son the children s tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him O our lord thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony The King rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men seeing Zau al Makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship The Prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers loving the poor the Olema and the Koran students so that all the people of Baghdad loved him men and women One day the procession of the Mahmil FN two hundred twenty nine of Irak passed round Baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to Meccah and visitation of the tomb of the Prophet whom Allah bless and preserve When Zau al Makan the Mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim FN two hundred thirty so he went in to his sire and said I come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage But his father forbade him saying Wait till next year and I will go and thou too When the Prince saw that the matter was postponed he betook himself to his sister Nuzhat al Zaman whom he found standing at prayer As soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her I am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah at Meccah and to visit the tomb of the Prophet upon whom be peace I asked my father s leave but he forbade me that so I mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge Allah upon thee exclaimed she take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the Prophet whom Allah bless and keep And he answered As soon as it is dark night do thou come forth from this place without telling any Accordingly When it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man s habit and she ceased not walking to the palace gate where she found Zau al Makan with camels ready for marching So he mounted and mounted her and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the Iraki FN two hundred thirty one pilgrim party and they ceased not marching and Allah wrote safety for them till they entered Meccah the Holy and stood upon Arafat and performed the pilgrimage rites Then they made a visitation to the tomb of the Prophet whom Allah bless and assain and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land But Zau al Makan said to his sister O my sister it is in my mind to visit the Holy House FN two hundred thirty two Jerusalem and Abraham the Friend of Allah FN two hundred thirty three on whom be peace I also desire so to do replied she So they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of Jerusalem palmers That very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill and was grievously ill but presently recovered after which the brother also sickened She tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at Jerusalem but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker They alighted at a Khan and there hired a lodging but Zau al Makan s sickness ceased not to increase on him till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious At this his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great This is the decree of Allah They sojourned in that place awhile his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left Then she sent a servant of the Khan to the bazar with some of her clothes and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had piece by piece till nothing was left but an old rug Whereupon she wept and exclaimed Verily is Allah the Orderer of the past and the future Presently her brother said to her O my sister I feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat By Allah O my brother replied she I have no face to beg but tomorrow I will enter some rich man s house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living Then she bethought herself awhile and said Of a truth tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state but I must despite myself He rejoined Allah forbid Thou wilt be put to shame but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah And he wept and she wept too Then she said O my brother we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year but none hath yet knocked at our door Shall we then die of hunger I know no resource but that I go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive till thou recover from thy sickness when we will travel back to our native land She sat weeping awhile and he wept too propped upon his elbow Then Nuzhat al Zaman arose and veiling her head with a bit of camlet FN two hundred thirty four which had been of the cameleer s clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him weeping and knowing not whither she should wend And she stinted not going and her brother Zau al Makan awaiting her return till the supper time but she came not and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not and this endured till two days went by He was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her and hunger was sore upon him At last he left the chamber and calling the servant of the caravanserai said I wish thee to bear me to the bazar So he carried him to the market street and laid him down there and the people of Jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition He signed to them begging for somewhat to eat so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar and bought food and fed him therewith after which they carried him to a shop where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head When night fell all the folk went away sore concerned for him and in the middle of the night he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him Then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams and hiring a camel said to the driver Carry this sick man to Damascus and leave him in the hospital haply he may be cured and recover health On my head be it replied the camel man but he said to himself How shall I take this sick man to Damascus and he nigh upon death So he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a Hammam and went his way When morning dawned the Stoker FN two hundred thirty five of the bath came to his work and finding Zau al Makan cast on his back exclaimed Why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here So saying he gave him a kick and he moved whereupon quoth the Fireman Some one of you who hath eaten a bit of Hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be Then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land And he cried There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah verily I have sinned against this youth for indeed the Prophet whom Allah bless and keep enjoineth honour to the stranger more especially when the stranger is sick Then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him So she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face Meanwhile the Stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar and sprinkled Zau al Makan s face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet Then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him With this Zau al Makan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him and he sat up and leant against the pillow Hereat the Fireman rejoiced and exclaimed Praise be to Allah for the welfare of this youth O Allah I beseech Thee by Thy knowledge of hidden things that Thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Fifty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Fireman exclaimed O Allah I beseech Thee of Thy knowledge of hidden things that Thou make this young man s life the work of my hands And he ceased not to nurse him for three days giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water and doing him all manner of service and kindness till health began to return to his body and Zau al Makan opened his eyes Presently came in the Fireman and seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment said to him What is now thy state O my son Praise be to Allah replied Zau al Makan I am well and like to recover if such be the will of Allah Almighty at this time The Stoker praised the Lord of All for this and wending fast to the market bought ten chickens which he carried to his wife and said Kill two of these for him every day one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day So she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth When he had done eating she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer Then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it after which she cut it up and bringing it to Zau al Makan said Eat O my son While he was eating behold her husband entered and seeing her feeding him sat down at his head and said to him How is it with thee now O my son Thanks be to Allah for recovery he replied may the Almighty requite thee thy kindness to me At this the Fireman rejoiced and going out bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it Now the Stoker used to work at the Hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams whereof he spent every day for Zau al Makan one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water FN two hundred thirty six and another dirham for fowls and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole Thereupon the Fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him O my son wilt thou go with me to the bath whereto he answered Yes So the Stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy and he mounted Zau al Makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath Then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnace room and went forth to the market and bought Iote leaves and lupin flour FN two hundred thirty seven with which he returned to the bath and said to Zau al Makan O my master in Allah s name walk in and I will wash thy body So they entered the inner room of the bath and the Fireman took to rubbing Zau al Makan s legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal when there came to them a bathman whom the bath keeper had sent to Zau al Makan and he seeing the Stoker washing and rubbing him said This is doing injury to the keeper s rights Replied the Fireman The master overwhelmeth us with his favours Then the bathman proceeded to shave Zau al Makan s head after which he and the Stoker washed themselves and returned to the house where he clad Zau al Makan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck Meanwhile the Fireman s wife had killed and cooked two chickens so as soon as Zau al Makan entered and seated himself on the carpet the husband arose and dissolving sugar in willow flower water made him drink of it Then he brought the food tray and cutting up the chickens fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied when he washed his hands and praised Allah for recovery and said to the Fireman Thou art he whom the Almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure Leave this talk replied the other and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art Thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding Tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me said Zau al Makan and after I will tell thee my story Rejoined the Fireman As for that I found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house as I went to my work near the morning and knew not who had thrown thee there So I carried thee home with me and this is all my tale Quoth Zau al Makan Glory to Him who quickeneth the bones though they be rotten Indeed O my brother thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage And he added But where am I now Thou art in the city of Jerusalem replied the Stoker where upon Zau al Makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept Then he discovered his secret to the Fireman and told him his story and began repeating In love they bore me further than my force would go And for them made me suffer resurrection throe Oh have compassion cruel on this soul of mine Which since ye fared is pitied by each envious foe Nor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance My case to lighten easing this excess of woe Quoth I Heart bear this loss in patience Patience cried Take heed no patience in such plight I m wont to show Then he redoubled his weeping and the Fireman said to him Weep not but rather praise Allah for safety and recovery Asked Zau al Makan How far is it hence to Damascus Answered the other Six days journey Then quoth Zau al Makan Wilt thou send me thither O my lord quoth the Stoker how can I allow thee to go alone and thou a youth and a stranger to boot If thou would journey to Damascus I am one who will go with thee and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me I will take up my abode there for it is no light matter to part with thee Then said he to his wife Wilt thou travel with me to Damascus of Syria or wilt thou abide here whilst I lead this my lord thither and return to thee For he is bent upon going to Damascus of Syria and by Allah it is hard to me to part with him and I fear for him from highway men Replied she I will go with you both and he rejoined Praised be Allah for accord and we have said the last word Then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife s gear And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Fifty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Fire man and his wife agreed with Zau al Makan to travel with him Damascus wards Then the Stoker sold his goods and his wife s gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for Zau al Makan and they set out and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached Damascus And they arrived there towards eventide when the Fireman went forth and as was his wont bought some meat and drink They had dwelt but five days in Damascus when his wife sickened and after a short illness was translated to the mercy of Almighty Allah Her death was a heavy matter to Zau al Makan for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously and the Fireman grieved for her with excessive grief Presently the Prince turned to the Stoker and finding him mourning said to him Grieve not for at this gate we must all go in Replied he Allah make weal thy lot O my son Surely He will compensate us with His favours and cause our mourning to cease What sayst thou O my son about our walking abroad to view Damascus and cheer thy spirits Replied Zau al Makan Thy will is mine So the Fireman arose and placed his hand in that of Zau al Makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the Viceroy of Damascus where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs and horses ready saddled and Bactrian dromedaries while Mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro Quoth Zau al Makan I wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs So he asked one of the eunuchs Whither this dispatching and he answered These are presents sent by the Emir of Damascus to King Omar bin al Nu uman with the tribute of Syria Now when Zau al Makan heard his father s name his eyes brimmed over with tears and he began repeating Oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne Ye whose sight in my spirit shall ever dwell Your charms are gone but this heart of me Hath no sweet and no pleasures its sour dispel If Allah s grace make us meet again In long drawn love tale my love I ll tell And when he had ended his verse he wept and the Fireman said to him O my son we hardly believed that thy health had returned FN two hundred thirty eight so take heart and do not weep for I fear a relapse for thee And he ceased not comforting and cheering him whilst Zau al Makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets Get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way And know how surely Death descends thy life lot to waylay All thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine All thy worldly life is vexing of thy soul in vain display Say is not worldly wone like a wanderer s place of rest Where at night he nakhs FN two hundred thirty nine his camels and moves off at dawn of day And he continued to weep and wail over his separation whilst the Fireman also bewept the loss of his wife yet ceased not to comfort Zau al Makan till morning dawned When the sun rose he said to him Meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land Yes replied Zau al Makan and I can no longer tarry here so I will commend thee to Allah s care and set out with these folk and journey with them little by little till I come to my mother land Said the Stoker And I with thee for of a truth I cannot bear to part with thee I have done thee kindly service and I mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel At this Zau al Makan rejoiced and said Allah abundantly requite thee for me and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together The Fireman at once went forth and bought another ass selling the camel and laid in his provaunt and said to Zau al Makan This is for thee to ride by the way and when thou art weary of riding thou canst dismount and walk Said Zau al Makan May Allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother Then he waited till it was dark night when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey This much befel Zau al Makan and the Fireman but as regards what happened to his sister Nuzhat al Zaman when she left her brother in the Khan where they abode and wrapped in the old camlet went out to seek service with some one that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for she fared on weeping and knowing not whither to go whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land So she implored Allah Almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying Dark falls the night and Passion comes sore pains to gar me dree And pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my tormentry And cease not separation flames my vitals to consume And drives me on destruction way this sorrow s ecstacy And longing breeds me restlessness desire for ever fires And tears to all proclaim what I would keep in secrecy No cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure That I may quit this sickly state may cure my malady The love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel The lover from its hell of fire must bear Hell s agony FN two hundred forty O thou who blamest me for all befel me tis enough Patient I bear what ever wrote the Reed of Doom for me By Love I swear I ll never be consoled no never more I swear the oath of Love s own slaves who know no perjury O Night to chroniclers of Love the news of me declare That sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear Then she walked on weeping and turning right and left as she went when behold there espied her an old Badawi FN two hundred forty one who had come into the town from the desert with wild Arabs other five The old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet and marvelling at her beauty he said to himself This charmer dazzleth men s wits but she is in squalid condition and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger I needs must have her So he followed her little by little till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane and called out to her asking her case and said Tell me O my little daughter art thou a free woman or a slave When she heard this she said to him By thy life do not add to my sorrows Quoth he Allah hath blessed me with six daughters of whom five died and only one is left me the youngest of all and I came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger that I might take thee and carry thee to her to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters If thou have no kith and kin I will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children Nuzhat al Zaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself Haply I may trust myself to this old man Then she said to him O nuncle I am a maiden of the Arabs and a stranger and I have a sick brother but I will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition which is that I may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother If thou strike this bargain I will fare with thee for I am a stranger and I was high in honour among my tribe and I awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject I came with my brother from the land of Al Hijaz and I fearless he know not where I am When the Badawi heard this he said to himself By Allah I have got my desire Then he turned to her and replied There shall none be dearer to me than thou I wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall Or if thou wilt bring him over to dwell with us And the Badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him Then he walked on before her and when she followed him he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels Now this Badawi was a base born churl a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief a rogue in grain past master of plots and chicane He had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when by the decree of the Decreer he fell in with this unhappy one And he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of Jerusalem and when outside he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries So the Badawi mounted a camel having seated Nuzhat al Zaman behind him and they rode on all night Then she knew that the Badawi s proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long while they journeyed on making for the mountains in fear any should see them Now when it was near dawn they dismounted from their dromedaries and the Badawi came up to Nuzhat al Zaman and said to her O city strumpet what is this weeping By Allah an thou hold not thy peace I will beat thee to death O thou town filth When she heard this she loathed life and longed for death so she turned to him and said O accursed old man O gray beard of hell how have I trusted thee and thou hast played me false and now thou wouldst torture me When he heard her reply he cried out O lazy baggage dost thou dare to bandy words with me And he stood up to her and beat her with a whip saying An thou hold not thy peace I will kill thee So she was silent awhile then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly Next day she turned to the Badawi and said to him How couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains and what is thy design with me When he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her O lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent wilt thou bandy words with me and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint Then she bowed down over his feet and kissed FN two hundred forty two them and he left beating her and began reviling her and said By the rights of my bonnet FN two hundred forty three if I see or hear thee weeping I will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte O thou city filth So she was silent and made him no reply for the beating pained her but sat down with her arms round her knees and bowing her head upon her collar began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour and the beating she had endured and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition and how they were both strangers in a far country which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating Time hath for his wont to upraise and debase Nor is lasting condition for human race In this world each thing hath appointed turn Nor may man transgress his determined place How long these perils and woes Ah woe For a life all woeful in parlous case Allah bless not the days which have laid me low I the world with disgrace after so much grace My wish is baffled my hopes cast down And distance forbids me to greet his face O thou who passeth that dear one s door Say for me these tears shall flow evermore When she had finished her verses the Badawi came up to her and taking compassion on her bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears Then he gave her a barley scone and said I love not one who answereth at times when I am in wrath so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and I will sell thee to a good man like myself who will do well with thee even as I have done Yes whatso thou doest is right answered she and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her she ate very little of that barley bread In the middle of the night the Badawi gave orders for departure And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Fifty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Badawi gave the barley scone to Nuzhat al Zaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself she replied Whatso thou doest is right and about midnight when hunger burned her FN two hundred forty four she ate a very little of that barley bread and the Badawi ordered his party to set out so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting Nuzhat al Zaman behind him Then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days till they entered the city of Damascus and alighted at the Sultan s Khan hard by the Viceroy s Gate Now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes So the Badawi came up to her and said O thou city filth by the right of my bonnet if thou leave not this weeping I will sell thee to none but a Jew Then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber and walked off to the bazar and he went round to the merchants who dealt in slave girls and began to parley with them saying I have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill and I sent him to my people about Jerusalem that they might tend him till he is cured As for her I want to sell her but after the dog her brother fell sick the separation from him was grievous to her and since then she doth nothing but weep and now I wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say Thy brother is with me in Jerusalem ill and I will be easy with him about her price Then one of the merchants came up to him and asked How old is she He answered She is a virgin just come to marriageable age and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness But from the day I sent her brother to Jerusalem her heart hath been yearning for him so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened Now when the merchant heard this he set forth with the Badawi and said O Shaykh FN two hundred forty five of the Arabs I will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness and I will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept I will give thee ready money and if thou accept not I will return her to thee Quoth the Badawi An thou wilt take her up to the Sultan Sharrkan son of Omar bin al Nu uman lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan and condition me any conditions thou likest for when thou hast brought her before King Sharrkan haply she will please him and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot Rejoined the merchant It happens that I have just now something to ask from him and it is this that he write me an order upon the office exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father King Omar bin al Nu uman So if he take the girl I will weigh FN two hundred forty six thee out her price at once I agree with thee to this condition answered the Badawi So they returned together to the place where Nuzhat al Zaman was and the wild Arab stood at the chamber door and called out saying O Najiyah FN two hundred forty seven which was the name wherewith he had named her When she heard him she wept and made no answer Then he turned to the merchant and said to him There she sitteth go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as I enjoined thee So the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable especially as she knew the Arabic tongue and he said to the Badawi If she be even as thou saddest I shall get of the Sultan what I will for her Then he bespake her Peace be on thee my little maid How art thou She turned to him and replied This also was registered in the Book of Destiny Then she looked at him and seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face she said to herself I believe this one cometh to buy me and she continued If I hold aloof from him I shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating In any case this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a Badawi May be he cometh only to hear me talk so I will give him a fair answer All this while her eyes were fixed on the ground then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice And upon thee be peace O my lord and Allah s mercy and His benediction FN two hundred forty eight This is what is commanded of the Prophet whom Allah bless and preserve As for thine enquiry how I am if thou wouldst know my case it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe And she held her peace When the merchant heard what she said his fancy took wings for delight in her and turning to the Badawi he asked him What is her price for indeed she is noble Thereupon the Badawi waxed angry and answered Thou wilt turn me the girl s head with this talk Why dost thou say that she is noble FN two hundred forty nine while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk I will not sell her to thee When the merchant heard this he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him Calm thyself for I will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest And how much wilt thou give me for her enquired the Badawi Replied the merchant Name thy price for her none should name the son save his sire Rejoined the Badawi None shall name it but thou thyself Quoth the merchant to himself This wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head By Allah I cannot tell her price for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks and if she can read and write it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser But this Badawi does not know her worth Then he turned and said to him O Shaykh of the Arabs I will give thee in ready money clear of the tax and the Sultan s dues two hundred gold pieces Now when the Badawi heard this he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant saying Get up and go thy ways By Allah wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth I would not sell it to thee And now I will not sell her but will keep her by me to pasture the camels and grind my grist And he cried out to her saying Come here thou stinkard I will not sell thee Then he turned to the merchant and said to him I used to think thee a man of judgment but by the right of my bonnet if thou begone not from me I will let thee hear what shall not please thee Quoth the merchant to himself Of a truth this Badawi is mad and knoweth not her value and I will say no more to him about her price at the present time for by Allah were he a man of sense he would not say By the rights of my bonnet By the Almighty she is worth the kingdom of the Chosroes and I have not her price by me but if he ask even more I will give him what he will though it be all my goods Then he turned and said to him O Shaykh of the Arabs take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee Cried the Badawi And what hath the baggage to do with clothes By Allah this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her With thy leave said the merchant I will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying FN two hundred fifty Replied the other Up and do what thou wilt and Allah keep thy youth Examine her outside and inside and if thou wilt strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked Quoth the trader Allah forfend I will look at naught save her face FN two hundred fifty one Then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Fifty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the merchant went up to Nuzhat al Zaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness so he sat by her side and asked her O my mistress what is thy name She answered Doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day Thereupon the merchant enquired Hast thou then two names to day s and yesterday s Yes replied she my name in the past was Nuzhat al Zaman the Delight of the Age but my name at this present is Ghussat FN two hundred fifty two al Zaman the Despight of the Age When the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her Hast thou not a sick brother Ay by Allah O my lord I have quoth she but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in Jerusalem The merchant s head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself Verily the Badawi spake the truth of her Then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him and she thought of all that had happened to her with the Badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped and she began reciting Allah where er thou be His aid impart To thee who distant dwellest in my heart Allah be near thee how so far thou fare Ward off all shifts of Time all dangers thwart Mine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight And start my tears ah me how fast they start Would Heaven I kenned what quarter or what land Homes thee and in what house and tribe thou art An fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose While drink I tear drops for my sole desert An thou joy slumber in those hours when I Peel twixt my side and couch coals burning smart All things were easy save to part from thee For my sad heart this grief is hard to dree When the merchant heard her verses he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks but she let down her veil over her face saying Heaven forbid O my lord FN two hundred fifty three Then the Badawi who was sitting at a little distance watching them saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her so he rose and running to her dealt her with a camel s halter he had in his hand such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face Her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open and the blood streamed down her cheeks whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly The merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself There is no help for it but that I buy this damsel though at her weight in gold and free her from this tyrant And he began to revile the Badawi whilst Nazhat al Zaman lay in sensible When she came to herself she wiped away the tears and blood from her face and she bound up her head then raising her glance to heaven she besought her Lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating And pity one who erst in honour throve And now is fallen into sore disgrace She weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears And asks What cure can meet this fatal case When she had ended her verse she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone By the Almighty do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not Allah the Most High If I pass this night in his place I shall kill myself with my own hand save me from him so Allah save thee from Gehenna fire Then quoth the merchant to the Badawi O Shaykh of the Arabs this slave is none of thine affair so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt Take her quoth the Badawi and pay me down her price or I will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung FN two hundred fifty four Said the merchant I will give thee fifty thousand diners for her Allah will open FN two hundred fifty five replied the Badawi Seventy thousand said the merchant Allah will open repeated the Badawi this is not the capital spent upon her for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces The merchant rejoined Thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats worth of barley but I will say thee one word wherewith if thou be not satisfied I will set the Viceroy of Damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force The Badawi continued Say on An hundred thousand quoth the merchant I have sold her to thee at that price answered the Badawi I shall be able to buy salt with her The merchant laughed and going to his lodgings brought the money and put it into the hand of the Badawi who took it and made off saying to himself Needs must I go to Jerusalem where haply I shall happen on her brother and I will bring him here and sell him also So he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at Jerusalem where he went to the Khan and asked for Zau al Makan but could not find him Such was the case with him but for what regards the merchant and Nazhat al Zaman when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Fifty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the trader saved Nuzhat al Zaman from the Badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment he went down with her to the bazar where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag which he set before her saying All is for thee and I ask nothing of thee in return but that when I lead thee to the Sultan Viceroy of Damascus thou acquaint him with the price I paid for thee albeit it was little compared with thy value and if seeing thee he buy thee of me thou tell him how I have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent and a written recommendation wherewith I can repair to his father King Omar bin al Nu uman Lord of Baghdad to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which I traffic When she heard his words she wept and sobbed and the merchant said to her O my lady I observe that every time I mention Baghdad thine eyes are tearful is there any one there whom thou lovest If it be a trader or the like tell me for I know all the merchants and so forth there and if thou wouldst send him a message I will bear it for thee Replied she By Allah I have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like I know none there but King Omar bin Nu uman Lord of Baghdad When the merchant heard her words he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself By Allah I have won my wish Then he said to her Hast thou been shown to him in time past She answered No but I was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and I have high honour with him so if thou wouldst have the King grant thee thy desire give me ink case and paper and I will write thee a letter and when thou reachest the city of Baghdad do thou deliver it into the hand of King Omar bin al Nu uman and say to him Thy handmaid Nuzhat al Zaman would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place and she sendeth thee her salams And if he ask further of her say that I am now with the Viceroy at Damascus The merchant wondered at her eloquence and his affection for her increased and he said to her I cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money Tell me dost thou know the Koran by heart Yes answered she and I am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of Galen the physician on the canons of Hippocrates and I have commented him and I have read the Tazkirah and have commented the Burhan and I have studied the Simples of Ibn Baytar and I have something to say of the canon of Meccah by Avicenna I can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy I have read the books of the Shafi i FN two hundred fifty six school and the Traditions of the Prophet and syntax and I can argue with the Olema and discourse of all manner learning Moreover I am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs and I know thoroughly the Spiritual Sciences FN two hundred fifty seven and the times appointed for religious duties and I understand all these branches of knowledge Then quoth she to the merchant Bring me ink case and paper that I write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to Baghdad and enable thee to do without passports Now when the merchant heard this he cried out Brava Brava FN two hundred fifty eight Then O happy he in whose palace thou shalt Thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour She took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses I see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown Say did thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone What makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart Hath every lover strength such memories to own How sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day Tis gone and ere I taste its sweets afar tis flown I pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news From thee to lover wightwi love so woe begone Complains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn For parting pangs can break not only heart but stone And when she had ended writing the verses she continued These words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight She tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes verily sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length No helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses No ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light But shakes my very frame with sorrow s killing might No lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart To meet his mate but breeds in me redoubled blight I bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me Ah me how Love can part man s mortal frame and sprite Then her eyes welled over with tears and she wrote also these two couplets Love smote my frame so sore on parting day That severance severed sleep and eyes for aye I waxt so lean that I am still a man But for my speaking thou wouldst never say Then she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet This cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land the sorrowful hearted woman Nuzhat al Zaman In fine she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed Glory to Him who fashioned thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Fifty ninth Night She said It reached me O auspicious King that Nuzhat al Zaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed Glory to Him who fashioned thee Then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food wherewith he fed her after which he carried her to the Hammam and said to the bath woman As soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head dress her and send and let me know of it And she replied Hearing is obeying Meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath and when the tire woman had done washing her she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench Then she sent to tell the merchant and Nuzhat al Zaman went forth to the outer room where she found the tray spread with food and fruit So she ate and the tire woman with her and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath Then she slept till the morning and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her When he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners a suit of Turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems Moreover he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein worth a thousand diners and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel Now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby and each ball a bezel of balass the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money When she had put these on the merchant bade her adorn herself and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her But when folk saw her all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed Blessed be Allah the most excellent Creator O lucky the man in whose house the hall be And the trader ceased not walking and she behind him till they entered the palace of Sultan Sharrkan when he sought an audience and kissing the earth between his hands said O auspicious King I have brought thee a rare gift unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities Quoth the King Let me see it So the merchant went out and brought her she following him till he made her stand before King Sharrkan When he beheld her blood yearned to blood though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called Nuzhat al Zaman and a brother Zau al Makan he having been jealous of them because of the succession And such was the cause of his knowing little about them Then having placed her before the presence the merchant said O King of the age besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness she is also versed in all learning sacred and profane including the art of government and the abstract sciences Quoth the King to the trader Take her price according as thou boughtest her and go thy ways I hear and I obey replied the merchant but first write me a patent exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise Said the King I will do this but first tell me what price thou paidest for her Said the merchant I bought her for an hundred thousand diners and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand When the Sultan heard these words he declared I will give thee a higher price than this for her and calling his treasurer said to him Pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit Thereupon the Sultan summoned the four Kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said I call you to witness that I free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her So the Kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage when the Sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse Then after paying him his monies Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent exempting him from toll tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Sixtieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate after paying him his monies and they wrote a perpetual patent exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour Then all about him retired and none remained save the Kazis and the merchant whereupon said he to the judges I wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader that we ascertain the truth of his assertions They answered There is no evil in that and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet when they learned that she was become the King s wife Then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness Presently the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs heard that King Sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping and versed in all branches of knowledge that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four Kazis to make trial of her how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them So they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was Nuzhat al Zaman When they came in to her they found the eunuchs standing before her and as soon as she saw the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of the realm coming to call upon her she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy her handmaidens standing behind her and she received them saying Ye be welcome The while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations as if she had been brought up with them so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another This damsel is none other than a Queen the daughter of a King Then they sat down magnifying her worth and said to her O our lady this our city is illumined by thee and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence The kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace and we all are thy handmaids so by Allah do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty And she thanked them for this All this while the curtains were let down between Nuzhat al Zaman and the women with her on the one side and King Sharrkan and the four Kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other Presently King Sharrkan called to her and said O Queen the glory of thine age this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge even to astrology so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects She replied saying O King to hear is to obey FN two hundred fifty nine The first subjects whereof I will treat are the art of government and the duties of Kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners Know then O King that all men s works tend either to religious or to laical life for none attaineth to religion save through this world because it is the best road to futurity Now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people and men s doings are divided into four divisions government commerce husbandry and craftsmanship Now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world which world is the road to futurity since Allah Almighty hath made the world for His servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to Allah and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust If folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity all cause of contention would be cut off but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions so they have need of the Sultan that he do justice between them and order their affairs and if the King restrain not his folk from one another the strong will drive the weak to the wall Hence Ardeshir FN two hundred sixty saith Religion and Kingship be twins religion is a hidden treasure and the King is its keeper and the Divine Ordinances and men s intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a Sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule For know O King that according to the measure of the Sultan s good morals even so will be the time as saith the Apostle of Allah on whom be peace and salvation There be two classes who if they be good the people will be good and if they be bad the people will be bad even the Olema and the Emirs And it is said by a certain sage There be three kinds of Kings the King of the Faith the King who protecteth things to which reverence is due and the King of his own lusts The King of the Faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith and it behoveth he be the most faithful FN two hundred sixty one for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the Faith and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to Divine Ordinance but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented because of submission to the decrees of Destiny As for the King who protecteth things to be reverenced he upholdeth the things of the Faith and of the World and compelleth his folk to follow the Divine Law and to preserve the rights of humanity and it fitteth him to unite Pen and Sword for whoso declineth from what Pen hath written his feet slip and the King shall rectify his error with the sharp Sword and dispread his justice over all mankind As for the King of his own lusts he hath no religion but the following his desire and as he feareth not the wrath of his Lord who set him on the throne so his Kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition And sages say The King hath need of many people but the people have need of but one King wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures that he reduce their discord to concord that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all And know O King that Ardeshir styled Jamr Shadid or the Live Coal third of the Kings of Persia conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and for this purpose get for himself four seal rings one for each division The first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written Alterna lives The second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies and on it was written Building up The third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written Plenty The fourth was the seal of the oppressed and on it was written Justice And these usages remained valid in Persia until the revelation of Al Islam Chosroes also wrote his son who was with the army Be not thou too open handed with thy troops or they will be too rich to need thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Sixty first night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Chosroes wrote his son Be not thou too open handed with thy troops or they will be too rich to need thee nor be thou niggardly with them or they will murmur against thee Give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress There is a legend that a desert Arab came once to the Caliph Al Mansur FN two hundred sixty two and said Starve thy dog and he shall follow thee When the Caliph heard his words he was enraged with the Arab but Abu l Abbas of Tus said to him I fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone the dog would follow him and leave thee alone Thereupon the Caliph Al Mansur s wrath subsided and he knew that the wild Arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present And know O King that Abd al Malik bin Marwan wrote to his brother Abd al Aziz when he despatched him to Egypt as follows Pay heed to thy Secretaries and thy Chamberlains for the Secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the Chamberlains with matters of official ceremony whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee Omar bin Al Khattab FN two hundred sixty three whom Allah accept when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts the second that he should not wear fine clothes the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period It is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence and there is no prudence like piety that there is no means of drawing near to God like good morals no measure like good breeding no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the Divine favour that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law no science like that of meditation no worship like obeying the Divine commends no faith like modesty no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge So guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth and think of death and doom ere it ariseth Saith Ali whose face Allah honour Beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them consult them not in aught FN two hundred sixty four but grudge not complaisance to them lest they greed for intrigue And eke quoth he Whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed and there be rules for this which we will mention if it be Allah s will And Omar whom Allah accept saith There are three kinds of women firstly the true believing Heaven fearing love full and fruit full who helpeth her mate against fate not helping fate against her mate secondly she who loveth her children but no more and lastly she who is a shackle Allah setteth on the neck of whom He will Men be also three the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement the wiser who when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight Justice is indispensable in all things even slave girls have need of justice and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty their order would fall to pieces FN two hundred sixty five In short for the rest the Prince of noble qualities is Beneficence cum Benevolence and how excellent is the saying of the poet By open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe s command Go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee And quoth another In ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect And Truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul Whoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world s good word On glory s course must ever be the first to gain the goal And Nazhat al Zaman discoursed upon the policy of Kings till the bystanders said Never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel Haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this When she heard their words and understood them she said As for the chapter of good breeding it is wide of comprehension being a compend of things perfect Now it so happened that one day there came to the Caliph Mu awiyah FN two hundred sixty six one of his companions who mentioned the people of Irak and the goodness of their wit and the Caliph s wife Maysun mother of Yezid heard his words So when he was gone she said to the Caliph O Prince of the Faithful I would thou let some of the people of Irak come in and talk to thee that I may hear their discourse Therewith Mu awiyah said to his attendants See who is at the door And they answered The Banu Tamim Let them come in said he So they came in and with them Al Ahnaf son of Kays FN two hundred sixty seven Then quoth Mu awiyah Enter O Abu Bahr and drew a curtain between himself and Maysun that she might hear what they said without being seen herself then he said to Al Ahnaf O Son of the Sea draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me Quoth Al Ahnaf Part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes FN two hundred sixty eight and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues and make the Ghusl or complete ablution on Friday as an expiation for all between the Fridays And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Sixty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ahnaf bin Kays replied to Al Mu awiyah s FN two hundred sixty nine question And ever use the toothstick because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete Friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two Fridays Quoth Mu awiyah What is thy counsel to thyself To set my feet firmly on the ground to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes How dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe I lower mine eyes modestly and I salute first I avoid what concerneth me not and I spare my words And how when thou goest in to thine equals I give ear to them when they speak and I do not assail them when they err When thou goest in to thy chiefs I salute without making any sign and await the reply if they bid me draw near I draw near and if they draw off from me I withdraw How dost thou with thy wife Quoth Ahnaf Excuse me from answering this O Commander of the Faithful but Mu awiyah cried I conjure thee inform me He said I entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure for woman was created of a crooked rib FN two hundred seventy And how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her I bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire then should it be as thou knowest FN two hundred seventy one I throw her on her back If the seed abide in her womb I say O Allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel but fashion it into the best of fashions FN two hundred seventy two Then I rise from her to ablution and first I pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly I praise Allah for the joy He hath given me Said Mu awiyah Thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements Said Ahnaf I would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of Allah and do even handed justice between them Thereupon Ahnaf rose to his feet and left the Caliph s presence and when he had gone Maysun said Were there but this man in Irak he would suffice to it Then continued Nuzhat al Zaman And all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding and know O King that Muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al Khattab And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Sixty third Night She said

3606-164911-0002	train-other-500	I returned to my own house and while I was sitting there behold a messenger came to me from Omar and I was afraid and went to him

3606-164911-0004	train-other-500	whereupon Ziyad shed tears Othman asked Why weepest thou and Ziyad answered I once brought Omar bin al Khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham

3606-164911-0010	train-other-500	Then he turned to me and said O Aslam I see it was indeed hunger made them weep and I am glad I did not go away ere I found out the cause of the light I saw And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say

endeth the second section of the first chapter And it so happened that Omar bin Abd al Aziz wrote to the people of the festival at Meccah as follows I call Allah to witness in the Holy Month in the Holy City and on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage FN two hundred ninety three that I am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you in that I have neither commanded this nor purposed it neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me nor have I compassed any knowledge thereof and I trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man for I shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress And if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the Holy Book and the Traditions of the Apostle do authorise obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness He said also Allah accept of him I do not wish to be relieved from death because it is the supreme thing for which the True Believer is rewarded Quoth one of authority I went to the Prince of the Faithful Omarbin Abd al Aziz who was then Caliph and saw before him twelve dirhams which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury So I said to him O Commander of the Faithful thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live An thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house it were well Draw near to me answered he so I drew near to him and he said Now as for thy saying Thou beggarest thy children provide for them and for the poor of thy household it is without reason for Allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house and He will be their guardian Verily they are like other men he who feareth Allah right soon will Allah provide for him a happy issue and he that is addicted to sins I will not up hold him in his sin against Allah Then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them Your Father is between two things either ye will be well to do and your parent will enter the fire or ye will be poor and your parent will enter Paradise and your father s entry into Paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do FN two hundred ninety four So arise and go Allah be your helper for to Him I commit your affairs Khalid bin Safwan FN two hundred ninety five said Yusuf bin Omar FN two hundred ninety six accompanied me to Hisham bin Abd al Malik FN two hundred ninety seven and as I met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants He alighted and a tent was pitched for him When the people had taken their seats I came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him and waiting till my eyes met his eyes bespoke him thus May Allah fulfil His bounty to thee O Commander of the Faithful I have an admonition for thee which hath come down to us from the history of the Kings preceding thee At this he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me Bring what thou hast O son of Safwan Quoth I O Commander of the Faithful one of the Kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time to this very country and said to his companions Saw ye ever any state like mine and say me hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me Now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to Truth upholders of the Right and wayfarers in its highway and he said to him O King thou askest of a grave matter Wilt thou give me leave to answer Yes replied the King and the other said Dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting It is temporary replied the King How then rejoined the man do I see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned Quoth the King Whither shall I flee and what must I seek for me That thou abide in thy kingship replied the other or else robe thee in rags FN two hundred ninety eight and apply thyself to obey Almighty Allah thy Lord until thine appointed hour I will come to thee again at daybreak Khalid bin Safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold the King had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite for the stress of his exhortation When Hisham bin Abd al Malik heard this he wept till his beard was wet and bidding his rich apparel be put off shut himself up in his palace Then the grandees and dependents came to Khalid and said What is this thou hast done with the Commander of the Faithful Thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life Then quoth Nuzhat al Zaman addressing herself to Sharrkan How many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter Of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Sixty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Nuzhat al Zaman continued speaking to Sharrkan Know O King that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but with length of days O King of the age all will be well There said the Kazis O King of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world and of our age the unique pearl Never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives And they called down blessings on the King and went away Then Sharrkan turned to his attendants and said Begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds So they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands and he commanded the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride Hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls and the subjects ate till they were satisfied Moreover Sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of Damascus and they were present together with every slave girl of the King and of the notables who knew how to sing And they went up to the palace in one body When the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles right and left from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace and the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees marched past before King Sharrkan whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her but found she needed no adornment Meantime King Sharrkan went to the Hammam and coming out sat down on his seat of estate whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights Then Sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead FN two hundred ninety nine and she at once conceived by him and when she announced it he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception On the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy Then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father King Omar bin al Nu uman saying that he had bought him a damsel who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge Moreover he wrote There is no help but that I send her to Baghdad to visit my brother Zau al Makan and my sister Nuzhat al Zaman I have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me And he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the Wazir Dandan and all the Emirs Then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence Sharrkan took it and read as follows After the usual Bismillah this is from the afflicted distracted man from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban King Omar bin al Nu uman to his son Sharrkan Know that since thy departure from me the place is become contracted upon me so that no longer I have power of patience nor can I keep my secret and the cause thereof is as follows It chanced that when I went forth to hunt and course Zau al Makan sought my leave to fare Hijaz wards but I fearing for him the shifts of fortune forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Sixty eighth night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Omar bin al Nu uman wrote in his letter My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month and when I returned I found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth When I knew this the wide world narrowed on me O my son but I awaited the return of the caravan hoping that haply they would come back with it Accordingly when the palmers appeared I asked concerning the twain but they could give me no news of them so I donned mourning for them being heavy at heart and in sleep I have no part and I am drowned in the tears of my eyes Then he wrote in verse That pair in image quits me not one single hour Whom in my heart s most honourable place I keep Sans hope of their return I would not live one hour Without my dreams of them I ne er would stretch me in sleep The letter went on And after the usual salutations to thee and thine I command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us When Sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister Then he took the missive and went in with it to Nuzhat al Zaman who knew not that he was her brother nor he that she was his sister albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery Allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter whereupon she sent for Sharrkan and seeing him she said to him This is thy daughter name her as thou wilt Quoth he It is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth FN three hundred Then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw hung about its neck a jewel which he knew at once for one of those which Princess Abrizah had brought from the land of the Greeks Now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe s neck he recognised it right well his senses fled and wrath seized on him his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at Nuzhat al Zaman and said to her Whence hadst thou this jewel O slave girl When she heard this from Sharrkan she replied I am thy lady and the lady of all in thy palace Art thou not ashamed to say to me Slave girl I am a Queen daughter of King Omar bin al Nu uman Hearing this he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Sixty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Sharrkan heard these words his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards for he knew that she was his sister by the same father Then he lost his senses and when he revived he abode in amazement but did not discover his identity to her and asked O my lady say art thou in sooth the daughter of King Omar bin al Nu uman Yes answered she and he continued Tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave So she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end how she had left her brother sick in the Sanctified City Jerusalem and how the Badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader When Sharrkan heard this he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself How can I have my sister to wife By Allah needs must I marry her to one of my chamberlains and if the thing get wind I will declare that I divorced her before consummation and married her to my Chief Chamberlain Then he raised his head and sighing said O Nuzhat al Zaman thou art my very sister and I cry I take refuge with Allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen for I am Sharrkan son of Omar bin al Nu uman She looked at him and knew he spoke the truth and becoming as one demented she wept and buffeted her face exclaiming There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah Verily have we fallen into mortal sin FN three hundred one What shall I do and what shall I say to my father and my mother when they ask me Whence hadst thou thy daughter Quoth Sharrkan It were meetest that I marry thee to my Chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house that none may know thou be my sister This hath befallen us from Almighty Allah for a purpose of his own and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this Chamberlain ere any know Then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him What wilt thou call the girl Call her Kuzia Fakan FN three hundred two answered he Then he gave the mother in marriage to the Chief Chamberlain and transferred her to his house with the child which they reared on the laps of the slave girls and fed with milk and dosed with powders Now all this occurred whilst the brother Zau al Makan still tarried with the Fireman at Damascus One day there came to King Sharrkan a courier from his father with a letter which he took and read and found therein After the Bismillah know O beloved King that I am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me I send thee this letter that as soon as thou receivest it thou make ready the monies and the tribute and send them to us together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife for I long to see her and hear her discourse more especially because there hath come to us from Roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments As soon as I saw them I loved them and I wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand for none of the Kings owneth the like of them so I asked the old woman their price and she answered I will not sell them but for the tribute of Damascus And I by Allah did not hold this price exorbitant indeed it is but little for each one of them is worth the whole valuation So I agreed to that and took them into my palace and they remain in my possession Wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and if she prevail over them I will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of Baghdad And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seventieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Omar son of Al Nu uman said in his letter And send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and if she prevail over them I will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of Baghdad As soon as Sharrkan knew the contents he went in to his brother in law and said to him Bring the damsel to whom I married thee and when she came he showed her the letter and said O my sister what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter Replied she Seek advice from thyself and presently added for she yearned after her people and her native land Send me together with my husband the Chamberlain to Baghdad that I may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the Badawi who sold me to the merchant and that I also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the Chamberlain after setting me free Be it so replied Sharrkan Then Sharrkan took his daughter Kuzia Fakan and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs and he made ready the tribute in haste bidding the Chamberlain travel with the Princess and the treasure to Baghdad He also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife And the Chamberlain replied To hear is to obey Moreover Sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the Chamberlain then he bade farewell to his sister after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter s neck by a chain of pure gold and she and her husband set out for Baghdad the same night Now it so happened that Zau al Makan and his friend the Fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were to see the spectacle and they beheld camels and Bukhti FN three hundred three dromedaries and bat mules and torches and lanterns alight and Zau al Makan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of Damascus going to King Omar bin al Nu uman Lord of the City of Baghdad He then asked Who be the leader of the caravan and they answered The Head Chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science Thereupon Zau al Makan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land and he said to the Stoker I will join this caravan and little by little will journey homewards Quoth the Fireman I would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the Holy City to Damascus then how shall I be sure of thy safety when thou farest for Baghdad But I will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object With joy and good will answered Zau al Makan Then the Fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt and when all was prepared he awaited the passage of the caravan And presently the Chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him Then Zau al Ma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion Do thou mount with me But he replied Not so I will be thy servant Quoth Zau al Makan There is no help for it but thou ride awhile Tis well quoth the Stoker I will ride when I grow tired Then said Zau al Makan O my brother soon shalt thou see how I will deal with thee when I come to my own folk So they fared on till the sun rose and When it was the hour of the noonday sleep FN three hundred four the Chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels Then he gave the signal for departure and after five days they came to the city of Hamah FN three hundred five where they set down and made a three days halt And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seventy first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that they halted in the city of Hamah three days they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city Here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province Diyar Bakr Here blew on them the breezes of Baghdad and Zau al Makan bethought him of his father and mother and native land and how he was returning to his sire without his sister so he wept and sighed and complained and his regrets grew on him and he began improvising these couplets Sweetheart How long must I await by so long suffering teed Nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide Ah me in very sooth our meeting time was short enow Would Heaven shorter prove to me the present parting tide Now trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight How wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste I hide When say they Comfort take for loss of love I but reply By Allah till the Day of Doom no comfort shall betide Thereupon said to him the Fireman Leave this weeping and wailing for we are near the Chamberlain s tent Quoth Zau al Makan Needs must I recite somewhat of verse haply it may quench the fire of my heart Allah upon thee cried the other cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country then do what thou wilt and I will be with thee wherever thou art Replied Zau al Makan By Allah I cannot forbear from this Then he turned his face towards Baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place and Nuzhat al Zaman could not sleep that night but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept And while she was in tears he heard Zau al Makan weeping and improvising the following distichs Al Yaman s FN three hundred six leven gleam I see And sore despair despaireth me For friend who erst abode wi me Crowning my cup with gladdest gree It minds me o one who jilted me To mourn my bitter liberty Say sooth thou fair sheet lightning shall We meet once more in joy and glee O blamer spare to me thy blame My Lord hath sent this dule to dree Of friend who left me fain to flee Of Time that breeds calamity All bliss hath fled the heart of me Since Fortune proved mine enemy He FN three hundred seven brimmed a bowl of merest pine And made me drain the dregs did he I see me sweetheart dead and gone Ere I again shall gaze on thee Time prithee bring our childhood back Restore our happy infancy When joy and safety joyed we From shafts that now they shoot at me Who aids the hapless stranger wight That nights in fright and misery That wastes his days in lonely grief For Time s Delight FN three hundred eight no more must be Doomed us despite our will to bear The hands of base bores cark and care When he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit This is how it fared with him but as regards Nuzhat al Zaman when she heard that voice in the night her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the Chief Eunuch who said to her What is thy will Quoth she Arise and bring me him who recited verses but now Replied he Of a truth I did not hear him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seventy second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Nuzhat Al Zaman heard her brother reciting she called the Chief Eunuch and said to him Go fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry Replied he Of a truth I heard him not and I wot him not and folks are all sleeping But she said Whomsoever thou seest awake he is the reciter So he went yet found none on wake save the Stoker for Zau al Makan was still insensible and when his companion saw the Eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him Then said the Eunuch Art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him The Stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter and being afraid he replied By Allah twas not I Rejoined the Eunuch Who then was the reciter point him out to me Thou must know who it was seeing that thou art awake The Fireman feared for Zau al Makan and said in himself Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt so he answered By Allah I know not who it was Said the Eunuch By Allah thou liest for there is none on wake here but thou So needs must thou know him By Allah replied the Fireman I tell thee the truth some passer by some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake Allah requite him Quoth the Eunuch If thou happen upon him point him out to me and I will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady s litter FN three hundred nine or do thou take him with thine own hand Said the Fireman Go thou back and I will bring him to thee So the Eunuch left him and went his ways and going in to his mistress told her all this and said to her None knoweth who it was it must have been some passer by some wayfarer And she was silent Meanwhile Zau al Makan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle Heavens the breath of the dawn breeze FN three hundred ten breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses when the Fire man asked him What wilt thou do Answered Zau al Makan I have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry that I may quench therewith the fire of my heart Quoth the other Thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint and how I escaped death only by beguiling the Eunuch Tell me what happened quoth Zau al Makan Replied the Stoker Whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an Eunuch with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand who took to looking in all the people s faces as they lay asleep and asked me who it was recited the verses finding none awake but myself I told him in reply it was some passerby some wayfarer so he went away and Allah delivered me from him else had he killed me But first he said to me If thou hear him again bring him to us When Zau al Makan heard this he wept and said Who is it would forbid me to recite I will surely recite befal me what may for I am near mine own land and care for none Rejoined the Fireman Thy design is naught save to lose thy life and Zau al Makan retorted Needs must I recite verses Verily said the Stoker needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place albeit I had intended not to leave thee till I had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father Thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and I have never harmed thee in aught What ails thee then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue But Zau al Makan answered I will not be turned away from my purpose FN three hundred eleven Then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets Stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead Cry thou for an answer belike reply to thee shall be sped If the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch Wi repine and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed If the snake of the sand dunes hiss I shall marvel not at all Let him bite so I bite those beauteous lips of the luscious red O Eden my soul hath fled in despite of the maid I love Had I lost hope of Heaven my heart in despair were dead And he also improvised the two following distichs We were and were the days enthralled to all our wills Dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site Who shall restore the home of the beloved where showed Light of the Place for aye conjoined with Time s Delight FN three hundred twelve And as he ceased his verses he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the Fireman rose and covered him When Nuzhat al Zaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home then she wept and cried at the Eunuch and said to him Woe to thee He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by By Allah an thou fetch him not to me I will assuredly rouse the Chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee out But take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt If he refuse hand to him this purse of a thousand diners then leave him and return to me and tell me after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is Return quickly and linger not And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seventy third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Nuzhat al Zaman sent the Eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said Beware how thou come back to me and report I could not find him So the Eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents but found none awake all being asleep for weariness till he came to the Stoker and saw him sitting up with his head uncovered So he drew near and seizing him by the hand said to him It was thou didst recite the verses The Fireman was afeard for his life and replied No by Allah O chief of the people it was not I But the Eunuch said I will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for I dread returning to my lady without him Now when the Fireman heard these words he feared for Zau al Makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the Eunuch By Allah it was not I and I know him not I only heard some passer by some wayfarer recite verses so do not thou commit sin on me for I am a stranger and come from the Holy City of Jerusalem and Abraham the friend of Allah be with you all Rise up and fare with me rejoined the Eunuch and tell my lady this with thine own mouth for I have seen none awake save thyself Quoth the Stoker Hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where I now am and dost thou not know my station Thou wottest none can stir from his place except the watchman seize him So go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry whether he be near or far it will be I or some one I know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me Then he kissed the Eunuch s head and spake him fair till he went away but the Castrato fetched a round and returning secretly came and stood behind the Fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings As soon as he was gone the Stoker arose and aroused Zau al Makan and said to him Come sit up that I may tell thee what hath happened So Zau al Makan sat up and his companion told him what had passed and he answered Let me alone I will take no heed of this and I care for none for I am mine own country FN three hundred thirteen Quoth the Stoker Why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil If thou fear no one I fear for thee and for my life so Allah upon thee recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land Indeed I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her Belike she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home and this is the second time she hath sent the Eunuch to look for thee However Zau al Makan paid no heed to the Fireman s words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets I fly the carper s injury Whose carping sorely vexeth me He chides and taunts me wotting not He burns me but more grievously The blamer cries He is consoled I say My own dear land FN three hundred fourteen to see They ask Why be that land so dear I say It taught me in love to be They ask What raised its dignity I say What made my ignomy Whate er the bitter cup I drain Far be fro me that land to flee Nor will I bow to those who blame And for such love would deal me shame Hardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion when the Eunuch who had heard him from his hiding place at his head came up to him whereupon the Fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them Then said the Eunuch to Zau al Makan Peace be with thee O my lord And on thee be peace replied Zau al Makan and the mercy of Allah and His blessings O my lord continued the Eunuch And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seventy fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Eunuch said to Zau al Makan O my lord I have sought thee these several times this night for my mistress biddeth thee to her Quoth Zau al Makan And who be this bitch that seeketh for me Allah curse her and curse her husband with her FN three hundred fifteen And he began to revile the Eunuch who could make him no answer because his mistress had charged him to do Zau al Makan no hurt nor bring him save of his own especial free will and if he would not accompany him to give him the thousand diners So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him O my lord take this purse and go with me We will do thee no upright O my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and return in weal and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news When Zau al Makan heard this he arose and went with the Eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk stepping over them whilst the Fireman followed after them from afar and kept his eye upon him and said to himself Alas the pity of his youth Tomorrow they will hang him And he ceased not following them till he approached their station FN three hundred sixteen without any observing him Then he stood still and said How base it will be of him if he say it was I who bade him recite the verses This was the case of the Stoker but as regards what befel Zau al Makan he ceased not walking with the Eunuch till he reached his station and the Castrato went in to Nuzhat al Zaman and said O my lady I have brought thee him whom thou soughtest and he is a youth fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding When she heard this her heart fluttered and she cried Let him recite some verses that I may hear him near hand and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land Then the Eunuch went out to Zau al Makan and said to him Recite what verses thou knowest for my lady is here hard by listening to thee and after I will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition Replied he With love and gladness but an thou ask my name it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste I have a story the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown and behold I am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought When Nuzhat al Zaman heard this she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing and said to the Eunuch Ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father The Castrato asked as she bade him and Zau al Makan replied Yes I have parted from every one I loved but the dearest of all to me was my sister from whom Fate hath separated me When Nuzhat al Zaman heard this she exclaimed Allah Almighty reunite him with what he loveth And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seventy fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Nuzhat al Zaman heard his words she said Allah reunite him with what he loveth Then quoth she to the Eunuch Tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country The Eunuch did so and Zau al Makan sighed heavily and began repeating these couplets FN three hundred seventeen Is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest The house that hometh Hinda be forever blest Her love all levels man can reck of naught beside Naught or before or after can for man have zest Tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris That day when Hinda s footstep on its face is prest Hail to the beauty of our camp the pride of folk The dearling who en Slaves all hearts by her behest Allah on Time s Delight send large dropped clouds that teem With genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast And also these I vow to Allah if at home I sight My sister Nuzhat al Zamani highs I ll pass the days in joyance and delight Mid bashful minions maidens soft and white To sound of harps in various modes they smite Draining the bowl while eyes rain lively light Neath half closed lids a sipping lips red bright By stream bank flowing through my garden site When he had finished his verse Nuzhat al Zaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him As soon as her eyes fell on his face she knew him for certain and cried out O my brother O Zau al Makan He also looked at her and knew her and cried out O my sister O Nuzhat al Zaman Then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit When the Eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover After a while they came to themselves and Nuzhat al Zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses Time sware my life should fare in woeful waste Forsworn art Time expiate thy sin in haste FN three hundred eighteen Comes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid To him who brings good news rise gird thy waist I spurned old world tales of Eden bliss Till came I Kausar FN three hundred nineteen on those lips When Zau al Makan heard this he pressed his sister to his breast tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these couplets FN three hundred twenty Long I lamented that we fell apart While tears repentant railed from these eyne And sware if Time unite us twain once more Severance shall never sound from tongue of mine Joy hath so overwhelmed me that excess Of pleasure from mine eyes draws gouts of brine Tears O mine eyes have now become your wont Ye weep for pleasure and you weep for pine They sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him Come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee and I will tell thee what happened to me So they entered and Zau al Maken said Do thou begin thy tale Accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the Khan and what had happened to her with the Badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother Sharrkan and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of buying how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the King their sire had sent and asked for her from Sharrkan Then quoth she Praised be Allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that even as we left our father together so together shall we return to him And she added Of a truth my brother Sharrkan gave me in marriage to this Chamberlain that he might carry me to my father And this is what befel me from first to last so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since I left thee Thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end and how Allah vouchsafed to send the Fireman to him and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day She praised the Stoker for this and Zau al Makan added Of a truth O my sister this Fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son for that he fasted and gave me to eat and he walked whilst he made me ride and I owe my life to him Said she Allah willing we will requite him for all this according to our power Then she called the Eunuch who came and kissed Zau al Makan s hand and she said Take thy reward for glad tidings O face of good omen It was thy hand reunited me with my brother so the purse I gave thee and all in it are thine But now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me The Castrato rejoiced and going in to the Chamberlain him to his mistress Accordingly he came in to his wife and finding Zau al Makan with her asked who he was So she told him all that had befallen them both first and last and added Know O Chamberlain that thou hast married no slave girl far from it thou hast taken to wife the daughter of King Omar bin al Nu uman for I am Nuzhat al Zaman and this is my brother Zau al Makan When the Chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become King Omar bin al Nu uman s son in law so he said to himself Twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province FN three hundred twenty one Then he went up to Zau al Makan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride Thereupon said Nuzhat al Zaman We are now near our country and I would be left alone with my brother that we may enjoy each other s company and take our fill of it ere we reach Baghdad for we have been parted a long long time Be it as thou biddest replied the Chamberlain and going forth from them sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats together with three suits of the costliest for Zau al Makan Then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and Nuzhat al Zaman said to him Bid the Eunuch bring me the Fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening and let him be forbidden to leave us The Chamberlain called the Castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied I hear and I obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the Stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girthing his ass and preparing for flight The tears were running adown his cheeks out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al Makan and he was saying to himself Indeed I warned him for the love of Allah but he would not listen to me Oh would I knew what is become of him Ere he had done speaking the Eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him The Fireman turned and seeing the Eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seventy sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself saying Oh would I knew what is become of him ere he had done speaking the Castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried Verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices I have done him I believe he hath denounced me to the Eunuch hence these pages et about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime Then the effeminated one cried at him saying Who was it recited the verses O liar why didst thou say I never repeated these couplets nor do I know who repeated them when it was thy companion But now I will not leave thee between this place and Baghdad and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee Quoth the Fireman What I feared hath befallen me And he repeated this couplet Twas as I feared the coming ills discerning But unto Allah we are all returning Then the Eunuch cried upon the pages saying Take him off the ass So they carried him along with the caravan surrounded by the pages as the white contains the black of the eye and the Castrato said to them If a hair of him be lost you will be lost with it And he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him But when the Stoker saw himself beset by the pages he despaired of his life and turning to the Eunuch said to him O Chief I am neither this youth s brother nor am I akin to him nor is he sib to me but I was a Fireman in a Hammam and found him cast out in his sickness on the dung heap Then the caravan fared on and the Stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing but said to him Thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses thou and this youth but fear nothing for thy self and kept laughing at him the while to himself Whenever the caravan halted they served him with food and he and the Castrato ate from one dish FN three hundred twenty two Then the Eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and after drinking himself gave it to the Fireman who drank but all the while his tears never dried out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al Makan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood So they both travelled on with the caravan whilst the Chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife s litter in attendance on Zau al Makan and his sister and now gave an eye to the Fireman and Nuzhat al Zaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days journey from Baghdad Here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts behold there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night FN three hundred twenty three Thereupon the Chamberlain cried out to them Stay and your loading delay then mounting with his Mamelukes rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud When they drew near suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea with flags and standards drums and kettledrums horsemen and footmen The Chamberlain marvelled at this and when the troops saw him there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them five for one whereupon said he to them What is the matter and what are these troops that ye do this with us Asked they Who art thou and whence comest thou and whither art thou bound and he answered I am the Chamberlain of the Emir of Damascus King Sharrkan son of Omar bin al Nu uman Lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan and I bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad When the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept saying In very sooth King Omar is dead and he died not but of poison So fare ye forwards no harm shall befal you till you join his Grand Wazir Dandan Now when the Chamberlain heard this he wept sore and exclaimed Oh for our disappointment in this our journey Then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the Wazir Dandan who granted an interview and called a halt and causing his pavilion to be pitched sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the Chamberlain Then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was Chamberlain to the Emir of Damascus and was bound to King Omar with presents and the tribute of Syria The Wazir hearing the mention of King Omar s name wept and said King Omar is dead by poison and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him until they were like to slay one another on this account but the notables and grandees and the four Kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King s son Sharrkan and make him Sultan over his father s realm And amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet Zau Al Makan for quoth they his name be Light of the Place and he hath a sister Nuzhat al Zaman highs the Delight of the Time but they set out five years ago for Al Hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them When the Chamberlain heard this he knew that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures and he grieved with sore grief for the death of King Omar albeit he joyed with exceeding joy especially at the arrival of Zau al Makan for that he would now become Sultan of Baghdad in his father s stead And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seventy seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Sharrkan s Chamberlain heard of the death of King Omar bin al Nu uman he mourned but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother Zau al Makan who would become Sultan of Baghdad in his father s stead So he turned to the Wazir Dandan and said to him Verily your tale is a wonder of wonders Know O Chief Wazir that here where you have encountered me Allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for that His Almighty Will restoreth to you Zau al Makan and his sister Nuzhat al Zaman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can When the Minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said O Chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence So he repeated to him the whole story and told him that Nuzhat al Zaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of Zau al Makan from first to last As soon as he had ended his tale the Wazir sent for the Emirs and Wazirs and Chief Officers and acquainted them with the matter whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance Then they gathered in a body and went in to the Chamberlain and did their service to him kissing the ground between his hands and the Wazir Dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour After this the Chamberlain held on that day a Divan council and he and the Wazir sat upon a throne whilst all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State took their places before them according to their several ranks FN three hundred twenty four Then they melted sugar in rose water and drank after which the Emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them So the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting rode onwards preceded by the standards of war When the grandees had finished their conference they took horse and rejoined the host and the Chamberlain approached the Wazir Dandan and said I deem it well to ride on before you and precede you that I may get ready a place for the Sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as Sultan over the head of his brother Sharrkan Aright thou reckest answered the Wazir Then the Chamberlain rose up in haste and Dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents which he conjured him to accept In similar guise did all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him Haply thou wilt mention our case to Sultan Zau al Makan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities FN three hundred twenty five The Chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march whereupon the Wazir Dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day s journey from the city And they did his bidding Then the Chamberlain mounted and rode forward full of joy and saying to himself How blessed is this gurney and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes she and her brother Zau al Makan They made all haste over their wayfare till they reached a place distant a day s journey from Baghdad where the Chamberlain called a halt for rest and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the Sultan Zau al Makan son of King Omar bin al Nu uman while he rode forward with his Mamelukes and alighting at a distance from Nuzhat al Zaman s litter commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence They did so and she gave permission whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother and told them of the death of their father and of Zau al Makan how the heads of the people had made him King over them in the stead of his sire and he gave them joy of the kingdom They both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed but the Chamberlain answered The news rests with the Wazir Dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host and it only remaineth for thee O King to do what they counsel since they have unanimously chosen thee Sultan for if thou do not this they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another Sultan Haply he will kill thee or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both Zau al Makan bowed his head awhile and then said I accept this position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the Chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way Then he added O my uncle how shall I do with my brother Sharrkan O my son replied the Chamberlain thy brother will be Sultan of Damascus and thou Sultan of Baghdad so take heart of grace and get ready thy case Zau al Makan accepted this and the Chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger FN three hundred twenty six of state which the Wazir Dandan had brought with him then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion wherein the Sultan might sit to receive the Emirs and Grandees Moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs They did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round After awhile the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of Baghdad and Khorasan a conquering host like the full tide sea And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seventy eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their Sultan they planted a splendid Shahmiyanah FN three hundred twenty seven befitting Kings And as they ended their labours behold a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host and presently it appeared that this was the army of Baghdad and Khorasan preceded by the Wazir Dandan And in it all rejoiced at the accession of the Light of the Place Now Zau al Makan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state so the Chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the Mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot to do him service and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs whilst the Chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the Shahmiyanah with drawn swords in their hands Presently up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the Chamberlain went in to Zau al Makan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them ten by ten The Chamberlain acquainted them with the King s commands to which they replied We hear and we obey and all drew up before the pavilion entrance Then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of Sultan Zau al Makan whom when they saw they were awed but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good So they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked Allah s blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew Then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers and they ceased not to enter ten by ten till none was left but the Wazir Dandan Lastly the Minister went in and kissed the ground before Zau al Makan who rose to meet him saying Welcome O Wazir and sire sans peer Verily thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the Subtle of Lere Then bade he the Chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto So they came and ate and drank Moreover the Sultan commanded his Wazir Dandan call a ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain The Wazir obeyed the commands of the Sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said This needs must be He then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days They did as he bade them and moreover he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the King for service during the space of three days Then the Wazir went to the Sultan and reported all to him and Zau al Makan waited until nightfall when he went in to his sister Nuzhat al Zaman and asked her Dost thou know the cause of my father s murder or not I have no knowledge of the cause she answered and drew a silken curtain before herself whilst Zau al Makan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the Wazir to the presence and when he came said to him I desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire King Omar bin al Nu uman Know then O King replied Dandan that King Omar bin al Nu uman when he returned to Baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city enquired for thee and thy sister but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the Pilgrimage whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings Now while we were in attendance upon him one day after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight lo there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee accompanied by five damsels high bosomed virgins like moons endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe and to crown their perfections of comeliness they could read the Koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples Then that old woman sought audience of the King and he bade admit her whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands I was then sitting by his side and he seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness made her draw near and take seat hard by him And when she had sat down she addressed him and said Know O King that with me are five damsels whose like no King among the Kings possesseth for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection They read the Koran and the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races They stand here between thy hands to do thee service O King of the Age and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised Thy father who hath found mercy FN three hundred twenty eight looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him so he said to them Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seventy ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir Dandan said unto King Zau al Makan Thy father who hath found mercy glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before Thereupon one of them came forward and kissing the ground before him spake as follows FN three hundred twenty nine Know O King that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies and observe the Divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who if he stray therefrom falleth into perdition for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour And know that the chief cause and reason of man s existence is the endeavour after life everlasting and the right way thereto is the service of Allah Wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people and swerve not from this canon for the mightier men are in dignity the more their need of prudence and foresight and indeed Monarchs need this more than the many for the general cast themselves into affairs without taking thought to the issue thereof Be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of Allah and know that if an enemy dispute with thee thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him but as for thy friend there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing Choose therefore thy friend for thyself after thou hast proved him If he be of the brotherhood of futurity FN three hundred thirty let him be zealous in observing the externals of the Holy Law and versed in its inner meaning as far as may be and if he be of the brotherhood of the world let him be free born sincere neither a fool nor a perverse for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him and a liar cannot be a true friend Indeed the word Siddik FN three hundred thirty one friend deriveth from Sidk truth that welleth up from the bottom of the heart and how can this be the case when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue And know that the observance of the Law profiteth him who practiseth it so love thy brother if he be of this quality and do not cast him off even if thou see in him that which irketh thee for a friend is not I like a wife whom one can divorce and re marry nay his heart is like glass once broken it may not be mended And Allah bless him who saith Ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart Tis hard to win thee back the heart offended For hearts indeed whence love is alien made Like broken glass may nevermore be mended The maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say The best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men It is also said It behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking Allah especially for two favours health and reason Again it is said Whoso honoureth himself his lust is a light matter to him and he who maketh much of his small troubles Allah afflicteth him with the greater he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend He who thinketh well of thee do thou fulfill his thought of thee He who exceedeth in contention sinneth and he who against upright standeth not on ward is not safe from the sword Now will I tell thee somewhat of the duties of Kazis and judges Know O King that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice Furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant and mediation is admissible between Moslems except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful FN three hundred thirty two If thou shalt have done aught during the day of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved thou O Kazi shouldst revert to the right for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong Then O judge thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to Allah be He extolled and exalted And require thou proof of the complainant and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it and if not put the defendant to his oath for this is the ordinance of Allah Receive thou the testimony of competent Moslem witnesses one against other for Almighty Allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals He Himself taking charge of the inner and secret things It behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger FN three hundred thirty three and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of Allah Almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself Allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people Quoth al Zuhri FN three hundred thirty four There are three things for which if they be found in a Kazi he should be deposed namely if he honour the base if he love praise and if he fear dismissal And Omar bin Abd al Aziz once deposed a Kazi who asked him Why hast thou dismissed me It hath reached me answered Omar that thy converse is greater than thy condition It is said also that Iskandar FN three hundred thirty five said to his Kazi I have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding To his Cook he said Thou art the Sultan of my body so look thou tender it as thine own self To his Secretary he said Thou art the controller of my wit so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Eightieth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al Makan Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and kissing the ground seven times before the King thy father spake as follows The sage Lukman FN three hundred thirty six said to his son There be three who are known only in three several cases the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath the brave only in battle and thy friend in time of need It is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed Quoth Allah Almighty FN three hundred thirty seven Assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done and who love to be praised for what they have not done shall escape reckoning of punishment indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty And he said FN three hundred thirty eight on whom be salvation and salutation Works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth He said also In the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound and which being unsound the whole is unsound And this is the heart Now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man since it is that which ordereth his whole affair If covetise stir in it desire destroyeth him and if affliction master it anguish slayeth him if anger rage in it danger is hard upon him if it be blest with contentment he is safe from discontent if fear surprise it he is full of mourning and if calamity overtake it affliction betideth him If a man gain the use of wealth peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his Lord if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe or if disquietude waste his heart weakness causeth him to fall Thus in any case nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of Allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next It was asked of a certain sage Who is the most ill conditioned of men and he answered The man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth and how excellently saith the poet Freest am I of all mankind fro meddling wight Who seeing others err self error ne er can sight Riches and talents are but loans to creature lent Each wears the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite If by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make Thou shalt go wrong and if the door be right go right Continued the maiden As for anecdotes of devotees quoth Hisham bin Bashar I asked Omar bin Ubayd What is true piety and he answered The Apostle of Allah to whom be salutation and salvation hath explained it when he sayeth The pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead And it is related that Abu Zarr FN three hundred thirty nine used to say Want is dearer to me than wealth and unheal is dearer to me than health Quoth one of the listeners May Allah have mercy on Abu Zarr For my part I say Whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of Almighty Allah should be content with that condition which Allah hath chosen for him Quoth one of the Companions of the Prophet Ibn Abi Aufa FN three hundred forty once prayed with us the dawn prayer When he had done he recited O Thou Enwrapped FN three hundred forty one till he came to where Allah saith When there shall be a trumping on the trumpet and fell down dead It is said that Sabit al Banani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes They brought him a man to medicine him who said to him I will cure thee provided thou obey my bidding Asked Sabit In what matter Quoth the leach In that thou leave weeping What is the worth of mine eyes rejoined Sabit if they do not weep Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah Exhort thou me And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Eighty first Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al Makan Thus spake the second hand maid to the King who hath found mercy Omar bin al Nu uman Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah Exhort thou me I exhort thee replied he to be a self ruler an abstainer in this world and in the next a greedy slave How so asked the other and Mohammed answered The abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come And quoth Ghaus bin Abdillah There were two brothers among the sons of Israel one of whom said to the other What be the most perilous FN three hundred forty two thing thou hast done Replied the brother I once came upon a nest of young birds so I took out one and threw it back into the nest but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it This is the most perilous thing I ever did now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done He rejoined When I arise for prayer I am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward Now their father heard these words and exclaimed O Allah an say they sooth take them to Thyself It was declared by one of the wise men Verily these were of the most virtuous of children Quoth Sa id bin Jubayr FN three hundred forty three I was once in company with Fuzalah bin Ubaydand said to him Exhort thou me Replied he Bear in mind these two necessaries Shun syntheism FN three hundred forty four and harm not any of Allah s creatures And he repeated these two couplets Be as thou wilt for Allah still is bounteous Lord And care dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban To two things only never draw thee nigh nor give Partner to Allah trouble to thy brother man And how well saith the poet An thou of pious works a store neglect And after death meet one who did collect Thou shalt repent thou diddest not as he Nor madest ready as he did elect Then the third damsel came forward after the second had with drawn and said Of a truth the chapter of piety is exceeding wide but I will mention what occurreth to me thereof concerning the pious of old Quoth a certain holy man I congratulate myself in death though I am not assured of rest therein save that I know death interveneth between a man and his works so I hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works And Ita a al Salami when he had made an end of an exhortation was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore and as they asked him why he did this he answered I desire to enter upon a grave matter and it is the standing up before Almighty Allah to do in accordance with my exhortation In similar guise Zayn al Abidin FN three hundred forty five son of Al Husayn was wont to tremble when he rose to pray Being asked the cause of this he replied Know ye not before whom I stand and whom I address It is said that there lived near Sufyan al Thauri FN three hundred forty six a blind man who when the month of Ramazan came went out with the folk to pray FN three hundred forty seven but remained silent and hung back Said Sufyan On the Day of Resurrection he shall come with the people of the Koran and they

sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me It is related that Bishr Barefoot FN three hundred forty eight said I once heard Khalid say Beware of secret polytheism I asked What may secret polytheism be and he answered When one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity FN three hundred forty nine come upon him And one of the sages said Doing works of weal expiateth what is ill Quoth Ibrahim FN three hundred fifty I supplicated Bishr Barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries but he said O my son this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one of every hundred five even as the legal alms upon money Said Ibrahim I thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while I was praying behold Bishr was also praying so I stood behind him FN three hundred fifty one making the prayer bow till the Mu ezzin called his call Then rose a man of tattered appearance and said O folk beware of a truth which bringeth unweal for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal FN three hundred fifty two and in time of need no choice we heed speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good Presently I saw Bishr drop a danik FN three hundred fifty three so I picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which I gave him Quoth he I will not take it Quoth I It is

family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of Baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light Is this forbidden to us Asked Ahmad Who are thou I am the sister of Bishr Barefoot answered she Rejoined the Iman O household of Bishr I shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts Quoth one of the sages When Allah willeth well to His servant He openeth upon him the gate of action Malik bin Dinar FN three hundred fifty five when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired was wont to say O

bin Ammar FN three hundred fifty six I made a pilgrimage and was faring Meccahwards by way of Cufa and the night was overcast when I heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying O Allah I swear by Thy Greatness and Thy Glory I meant not through my disobedience to transgress against Thee for indeed I am not ignorant of Thee but my fault is one Thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning FN three hundred fifty seven so do Thou pardon my transgression for indeed I disobeyed Thee of my ignorance When he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse O true believers save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones FN three hundred fifty eight Then I heard a fall but not knowing what it was I passed on When the morning morrowed as we went our way behold we fell in with a funeral train followed by an old woman whose strength had left her I asked her of the dead and she answered This is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the Book of Allah Almighty when the man s gall bladder burst and he fell dead Therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said I here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time Maslamah bin Dinar used to say By making sound the secret thoughts sins great and small are covered and when the servant of Allah is resolved to leave sinning victory cometh to him Also quoth he Every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to Allah is a calamity for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future It was asked of Abu Hazim FN three hundred fifty nine Who is the most prosperous of men and he answered Whoso spendeth his life in submission to Allah The other enquired And who is the most foolish of mankind Whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others replied Abu Hazim It is reported of Moses FN three hundred sixty on whom be peace that when he came to the waters of Midian he exclaimed O Lord verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me FN three hundred sixty one And he asked of his Lord and not of his folk There came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first When the twain returned they informed their father Shu ayb on whom be peace who said Haply he is hungry adding to one of them Go back to him and bid him hither Now when she came to Moses she veiled her face and said My father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us Moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her Now she was a woman large in the back parts and the wind blowing upon her garment FN three hundred sixty two covered the hinder cheeks to Moses which when Moses saw he lowered his eyes and said to her Get thee behind while I walk in front So she followed him till he entered the house of Shu ayb where supper was ready And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Eighty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al Makan Now quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire When Moses on whom be peace entered the home of Shu ayb where supper was ready Shu ayb said to him O Moses I desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two But Moses answered I am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world FN three hundred sixty three for what is on earth of gold and silver Then quoth Shu ayb O youth nevertheless thou art my guest and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him So Moses sat down and ate Then Shu ayb hired Moses for eight pilgrimages that is to say eight years and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters and Moses service to him was to stand for her dowry As saith the Holy Writ of him Verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages and if thou fulfil ten years it is in thine own breast for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee FN three hundred sixty four A certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days Thou hast made me desolate for that I have not seen thee this long while Quoth the other I have been distracted from thee by Ibn Shihab dost thou know him Quoth his friend Yes he hath been my neighbour these thirty years but I have never spoken to him He replied Verily thou forgettest Allah in forgetting thy neighbour If thou lovedst Allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour Knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour FN three hundred sixty five even as the right of kith and kin Said Huzayfah We entered Meccah with Ibrahim bin Adham and Shakik al Balkhi was also making a pilgrimage that year Now we met whilst circumambulating the Ka abah and Ibrahim said to Shakik What is your fashion in your country Replied Shakik When we are blest with our daily bread we eat and when we hunger we take patience This wise said Ibrahim do the dogs of Balkh but we when blest with plenty do honour to Allah and when an hungered we thank Him And Shakik seated himself before Ibrahim and said to him Thou art my master Also said Mohammed bin Imran A man once asked of Hatim the Deaf FN three hundred sixty six What maketh thee to trust in Allah Two things answered he I know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread so my heart is at rest as to that and I know that I was not created without the knowledge of Allah and am abashed before Him Then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and kissing the ground before thy father nine times said Thou hast heard O King what these all have spoken on the subject of piety and I will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times It is said that the Imam al Shafi i departed the night into three portions the first for study the second for sleep and the third for prayer The Imam Abu Hanifah FN three hundred sixty seven was wont also to pass half the night in prayer One day a man pointed him out to another as he walked by and remarked Yonder man watcheth the whole night When he heard this Abu Hanifah said I was abashed before Allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me so after this he used to watch the whole night And one of the Sages hath said Who seeketh for pearl in the Deep dives deep Who on high would hie robs his night of sleep Al Rabi a relates that Al Shafi i used to recite the whole Koran seventy times during the month of Ramazan and that in his daily prayers Quoth Al Shafi i Allah accept him During ten years I never ate my fill of barley bread for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray FN three hundred sixty eight It is reported of Abdullah bin Mohammed al Sakra that he said I was once talking with Omar and he observed to me Never saw I a more God fearing or eloquent man than Mohammed bin Idris al Shafi i It so happened I went out one day with Al Haris bin Labib al Saffar who was a disciple of Al Muzani FN three hundred sixty nine and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the Almighty This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves FN three hundred seventy I saw Al Shafi i s colour change his skin shuddered with horripilation he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit When he revived he said I take refuge with Allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent O Allah before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves O Allah of Thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins adorn me with the curtain of Thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings by the magnanimity of Thy Being Then I rose and went away Quoth one of the pious When I entered Baghdad Al Shafi i was there So I sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer and behold there passed me one who said O youth make thy Wuzu ablution well and Allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next I turned and lo there was a man behind whom came a company of people So I hastened to finish my ablution and followed him Presently he turned and asked me Say dost thou want aught Yes answered I I desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which Allah Almighty hath taught thee He said Know then that whoso believeth in Allah shall be saved and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death Shall I tell thee any more I replied Assuredly and he continued Be thou of the world that is heedless and of the world to come greediest Be truthful in all thy dealings and thou shalt be saved with the Salvationists Then he went on and I asked about him and was told that he was the Imam Al Shafi i Al Shafi i was wont to remark I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Eighty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al Makan The old woman bespake thy sire saying The Imam Al Shafi i was wont to remark I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me He also said I never disputed with any one but I would that Almighty Allah should give him the knowledge of the Truth and aid him to dispread it nor did I ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the Truth and I reck not whether Allah manifest it by my tongue or by His He said also whom Allah accept If thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore then bethink thee Whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest It was told to Abu Hanifah that the Commander of the Faithful Abu Ja afar al Mansur had appointed him Kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams but he would not accept of this and when the day came on which the money was to be paid him he prayed the dawn prayer then covered his head with his robe and spoke not When the Caliph s messenger came with the money he went in to the Imam and accosted him but he would not speak to him So the messenger said Verily this money is lawfully thine I know that it is lawfully mine replied he but I abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart FN three hundred seventy one Asked the other If thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them Answered Abu Hanifah Can I look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet Another of Al Shafi i s sayings Allah accept him is Oh soul of me an thou accept my rede Thou shalt be wealthy and of grace entire Cast off ambitious hopes and vain desires How many a death was done by vain desire Among the sayings of Sufyan al Thauri with which he admonished Ali bin al Hasan al Salami was Be thou a man of truth and ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride Be not indebted save to Him who is merciful to His debtors and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world Be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of Allah and in beseeching of Allah peace for what remaineth of thy life Counsel every True Believer when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith and beware of betraying a Believer for whoso betrayeth a Believer betrayeth Allah and His Apostle Avoid dissensions and litigation and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt FN three hundred seventy two so shalt thou be at peace Enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence so shalt thou be loved of Allah Adorn thine inner man and Allah shall adorn thine outer man Accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the Moslems Draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee so shalt thou be the friend of the Prophets Let thine affairs both public and private be in Allah s charge and fear Him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards Resurrection and Judgement stead between the hands of the Lord of Dread and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped either for Heavens eterne or to the Hell fires that burn Thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels Now when thy father who hath found mercy heard their discourse he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time and seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore he showed them all favour Moreover he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged Princess Abrizah daughter of the King of Greece to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed They abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them and whenever the King visited them he found her absorbed in prayer watching by night and fasting by day whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me O Wazir verily this old woman is of the pious and awe of her is strong in my heart Now on the eleventh day the King visited her that he might pay her the price of the damsels but she said to him O King know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men indeed I seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels be it little or much Now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her O my lady and what is their price whereto she answered I will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast watching by night a whole month and abstaining by day all for the love of Allah Almighty and if thou do this they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please So the King wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation she was magnified in his eyes and he said Allah make this pious woman to profit us Then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated and she said to him I will help thee with the prayers I pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water They brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof Lastly she covered it with a cloth and sealing it with her signet ring gave it to thy sire saying When thou hast fasted the first ten days break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith As for me tomorrow I will go forth to my brethren the Invisible FN three hundred seventy three Controuls for I yearn after them and I will return to thee when the first ten days are past Thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace then locked the door and put the key in his pocket Next day the King fasted and the old woman went her ways And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Eighty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir Dandan thus continued to Zau al Makan Now when came the day for the Sultan s fast the old woman went her ways And after he had accomplished the ten days thereof on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach Within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf like no leaf of known tree She went in to thy sire and saluted him and when he saw her he rose to her saying Welcome O pious lady O King quoth she the Invisible Controuls salute thee for I told them of thee and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their Halwa FN three hundred seventy four which is of the sweetmeats of the other world Do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day The King rejoiced at this with great joy and exclaimed Praised be Allah who hath given me brethren of the Invisible World Thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour She went forth for the twenty days of thy father s fast at the end of which time she came to him and said Know O King that I told the Invisible Controuls of the love which is between me and thee and informed them how I had left the maidens with thee and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a King like thee for they were wont when they saw them to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted So I would fain carry them to the Invisible Controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour and peradventure they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth that thou after completing thy fast mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee to the extent of thy desires When thy sire heard her words he thanked her for them and said Except that I fear to cross thee I would not accept the treasure or aught else but when wilt thou set out with them Replied she On the seven and twentieth night and I will bring them back to thee at the head of the month by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal By Allah each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom He said I know it O pious lady Then quoth the old woman There is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the Invisible Controuls Quoth he I have a Greek slave called Sophia by whom I have been blessed with two children a girl and a boy but they were lost years ago Take her with thee that she may get the blessing And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Eighty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al Makan Quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him I have a Greek slave called Sophia by whom I have been blest with two children a girl and a boy but they were lost years ago so take her with thee haply she may get the benediction and belike the Invisible Controuls will sue Allah for her that her two children may be restored to her Thou hast said well replied she for that indeed was her grievousest want Thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him O my son I am going to the Invisible Controuls so bring me Sophia Accordingly he summoned her and she came forthright and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels Then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup presented it to the Sultan saying On the thirtieth day do thou repair to the Hammam and when thou comest out enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup Then sleep and thou shalt attain what thou seekest and peace be with thee Thereat the King was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands Quoth she I commend thee to Allah s care whereat quoth he And when shall I see thee again O pious lady In very sooth I love not to part with thee Then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the Queen whilst the King fasted after her departure other three days till the month ended when he arose and went to the Hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace commanding that none should go in to him There after making fast the door he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day but he did not come out and we said Perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day wherefore he sleepeth So we waited till next day but still he did not come forth Then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter But nothing came of that so at last we lifted up the door FN three hundred seventy five and going in found him dead with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken FN three hundred seventy six When we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed Whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of Kings and who debaucheth them and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that Sharrkan when he came to our country seduced our Queen Abrizah nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you Then he FN three hundred seventy seven sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts This be no kingly deed and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited So do ye suspect none of having killed him for no one slew him but the cunning witch whose name is Zat al Dawahi And behold I have taken the King s wife Sophia and have carried her to her father Afridun King of Constantinople Moreover there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you and ye shall be cut off even to the last man nor shall a living soul be spared by Death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath save he who Cross and Belt FN three hundred seventy eight worshippeth When we read this paper we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught And the troops fell out as to whom they should make Sultan some would have thee and others would have thy brother Sharrkan and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother Sharrkan so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee And such is the manner of the death of Sultan Omar bin al Nu uman Now when the Wazir Dandan had made an end of his story Zau al Makan and his sister Nuzhat al Zaman wept and the Chamberlain who wept also said to Zau al Makan O King weeping will avail thee naught nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead Thereupon Zau al Makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him And the Chamberlain sat by his side and all the armour bearers FN three hundred seventy nine behind him whilst the Wazir Dandan and the rest of the Emirs and Grandees stood each in his individual stead Then quoth King Zau al Makan to the Minister Dandan Inform me concerning my sire s treasures and he replied I hear and I obey and gave him to know of the late King s hoards and monies and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels and acquainted him with other precious things So Zau al Makan opened his hand to the army and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the Wazir Dandan saying Thou continues in office Whereupon Dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life Then he bestowed dresses on the Emirs after which he said to the Chamberlain Bring out before me the tribute of Damascus that is with thee So he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Eighty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Zau al Makan ordered the Chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of Damascus and when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels he took them and parted them all amongst the troops till nothing was left And the Emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life saying Never saw we a King who gave the like of these gifts Then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching So they marched for three days till on the fourth day they drew near to Baghdad When they entered the city they found it decorated and Zau al Makan the Sultan went up to his father s palace and sat down on the throne whilst the Emirs of the army and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain of Damascus stood between his hands Then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother Sharrkan acquainting him with all that had passed from first to last and he concluded As soon as thou hast read this letter make ready thine affair and join us with thine army that we may turn to Holy War upon the Infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour Then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the Minister Dandan None shall carry this letter but thou and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him If thou have a mind to thy father s kingdom it is thine and thy brother shall be Viceroy for thee in Damascus for to this effect am I instructed by him So the Wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march Then Zau al Makan bade set apart a magnificent house for the Fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that Fireman FN three hundred eighty Presently Zau al Makan went out chasing and hunting and as he was returning to Baghdad one of the Emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades One of the damsels pleased him so he went in unto her and knew her that night and she conceived by him forthright After a while the Wazir Dandan returned from his journey bringing him news of his brother Sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him and said It were fitting thou go forth to meet him Zau al Makan replied I hear and I consent and riding forth with his Grandees a day s journey from Baghdad he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother Next morning appeared King Sharrkan amid the army of Syria a horseman of might a lion fierce in fight a prow and doughty knight As the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high Zau al Makan and those with him pushed forward to meet Sharrkan and his men and when Zau al Makan saw his brother he desired to dismount but Sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise and himself footed it and walked a few paces towards him FN three hundred eighty one As soon as he reached Zau al Makan the new Sultan threw himself upon him and Sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other Then they mounted and rode onward they and their troops till they reached Baghdad where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night and when next morning came Zau al Makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts and proclaimed a Holy War and a Razzia FN three hundred eighty two They then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good till in so doing a full month had sped and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body Then Sharrkan said to Zau al Makan O my brother tell me thy history So he told him all that had befallen him from first to last including the benevolent dealing of the Fireman with him Asked Sharrkan Hast thou requited his kindness and he answered O my brother I have not rewarded him as yet but Inshallah I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Eighty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Sharrkan asked his brother Zau al Makan Hast thou requited the Fireman for his kindness and he answered O my brother I have not rewarded him as yet but Inshallah I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid and find time so to do Therewith Sharrkan was certified that his sister Nuzhat al Zaman had told him the whole truth but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the Chamberlain She sent him back her greeting calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter Kuzia Fakan to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety Where upon she praised Almighty Allah and gave him thanks Then Sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure and Zau al Makan said O my brother as soon as the army is complete and the Arabs have come in from all parts we will march forth So he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife who was now five months gone with child and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians to whom he appointed stipends and allowances Then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of Syria and as soon as the Arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions and as he fared forth he was followed by the warriors and the united host Now the name of the General of the Daylam army was Rustam and that of the General of the army of the Turks FN three hundred eighty three Bahram And Zau al Makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother Sharrkan and on his left the Chamberlain his brother in law So the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array till the whole army was in motion They ceased not to fare on for the space of a month and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days for the host was great and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the Greeks Then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to Constantinople But when King Afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to Zat al Dawahi the same who had contrived the stratagem and had travelled to Baghdad and had slain King Omar bin Al Nu uman and who after carrying off her slaves and Queen Sophia had returned with them all to her native land Now when she had been restored to her son the King of Greece and felt herself safe she said to King Hardub Cool thine eyes for I have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter Abrizah and have killed Omar bin al Nu uman and have brought back Sophia So now let us go to the King of Constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces and I will fare with thee to King Afridun Lord of Constantinople for I opine that the Moslems will not await our attack Said Hardub Tarry thou till they draw near our country that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power Accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war and when the news of the Moslems advance reached them they were prepared for defence and Zat al Dawahi had preceded them Now when she and her son arrived at Constantinople the King of Kings Afridun hearing of the approach of Hardub King of the Greeks came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit So Hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother Zat al Dawahi how she had slain the Moslem King and recovered from him Queen Sophia and had said The Moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them Now King Afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of King Omar bin al Nu uman and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the Moslem King So the Nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the Greeks was complete besides which there joined themselves to him Franks from all their lands French Germans FN three hundred eighty four and Ragusans FN three hundred eighty five with men of Zara FN three hundred eighty six Venetians Genoese and all the hosts of the Yellow Faces FN three hundred eighty seven and when the gathering was at its full earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude Then Afridun the Great King ordered a march so they set out and ceased not to defile
