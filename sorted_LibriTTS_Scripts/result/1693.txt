at the head of the table she looked again His eyes were fixed on her with a curious intentness He seemed to be surveying her from the top of her burnished hair to the very gown she wore His gaze made her vaguely uncomfortable It was unsmiling appraising almost only that was incredible in Clay almost hostile Through the open door the half dozen women trailed out Natalie in white softly rustling as she moved missus Haverford in black velvet a trifle tight over her ample figure Marion Hayden in a very brief garment she would have called a frock perennial debutante that she was rather negligible missus Terry Mackenzie and trailing behind the others frankly loath to leave the men Audrey Valentine Clayton Spencer s eyes rested on Audrey with a smile of amused toleration on her outrageously low green gown that was somehow casually elegant on her long green ear rings and jade chain on the cigaret between her slim fingers Audrey s audacity always amused him In the doorway she turned and nonchalantly surveyed the room For heaven s sake hurry she apostrophized the table We are going to knit I feel it And don t give Chris anything more to drink Clay He s had enough She went on a slim green figure moving slowly and reluctantly toward the drawing room her head held high a little smile still on her lips But alone for a moment away from curious eyes her expression changed her smile faded her lovely irregular face took on a curious intensity What a devilish evening Chris drinking too much talking wildly and always with furtive eyes on her Chris Oh well that was life she supposed She stopped before a long mirror and gave a bit of careless attention to her hair With more care she tinted her lips again with a cosmetic stick from the tiny diamond studded bag she carried Then she turned and surveyed the hall and the library beyond A new portrait of Natalie was there hanging on the wall under a shaded light and she wandered in still with her cigaret and surveyed it Natalie had everything The portrait showed it It was beautiful smug complacent missus Valentine s eyes narrowed slightly She stood there thinking about Natalie She had not everything after all There was something she lacked Charm perhaps She was a cold woman But then Clay was cold too He was even a bit hard Men said that hard and ambitious although he was popular Men liked strong men It was only the weak they deplored and loved Poor Chris She lounged into the drawing room smiling her slow cool smile In the big uncarpeted alcove where stood Natalie s great painted piano Marion Hayden was playing softly carefully posed for the entrance of the men Natalie was sitting with her hands folded in the exact center of a peacock blue divan The others were knitting Very pretty effect Toots Audrey called And Miss Hayden gave her the unashamed smile of one woman of the world to another Audrey had a malicious impulse She sat down beside Natalie and against the blue divan her green gown shrieked a discord She was vastly amused when Natalie found an excuse and moved away to dispose herself carefully in a tall old gold chair which framed her like a picture We were talking of men my dear said missus Haverford placidly knitting Of course said Audrey flippantly Of what it is that they want more than anything else in the world Children sons put in missus Mackenzie She was a robust big woman with kindly eyes and she was childless Women called Toots Hayden She was still posed but she had stopped playing missus Haverford s eyes rested on her a moment disapprovingly What do you say Natalie Audrey asked I hadn t thought about it Money probably You are all wrong said Audrey and lighted a fresh cigaret They want different things at different ages That s why marriage is such a rotten failure First they want women any woman will do really So they marry any woman Then they want money After that they want power and place And when they ve got that they begin to want love Good gracious Audrey what a cynical speech said missus Mackenzie If they ve been married all that time Oh tut said Audrey rudely She had the impulse of the unhappy woman to hurt but she was rather ashamed of herself too These women were her friends Let them go on believing that life was a thing of lasting loves that men were true to the end and that the relationships of life were fixed and permanent things I m sorry she said I was just being clever Let s talk about the war It s the only thing worth talking about anyhow In the dining room Clayton Spencer standing tall and erect had watched the women go out How typical the party was of Natalie of her meticulous care in small things and her indifference or real ignorance as to what counted Was it indifference really or was it supreme craftiness the stupidity of her dinners the general unattractiveness of the women she gathered around her the ill assortment of people who had little in themselves and nothing whatever in common Of all the party only Audrey and the rector had interested him even remotely Audrey amused him Audrey was a curious mixture of intelligence and frivolity She was a good fellow Sometimes he thought she was a nice woman posing as not quite nice He didn t know He was not particularly analytical but at least she had been one bit of cheer during the endless succession of courses The rector was the other and he was relieved to find Doctor Haverford moving up to the vacant place at his right I ve been wanting to see you Clay he said in an undertone It s rather stupid to ask you how you found things over there But I m going to do it You mean the war There s nothing else in the world is there One wouldn t have thought so from the conversation here to night Clayton Spencer glanced about the table Rodney Page the architect was telling a story clearly not for the ears of the clergy and his own son Graham forced in at the last moment to fill a vacancy was sitting alone bored and rather sulky and sipping his third cognac If you want my opinion things are bad For the Allies Or for us Good heavens man it s the same thing It is only the Allies who are standing between us and trouble now The French are just holding their own The British are fighting hard but they re fighting at home too We can t sit by for long We re bound to be involved The rector lighted an excellent cigar Even if we are he said hopefully I understand our part of it will be purely naval And I believe our navy will give an excellent account of itself Probably Clay retorted If it had anything to fight But with the German fleet bottled up and the inadvisability of attempting to bombard Berlin from the sea The rector made no immediate reply and Clayton seemed to expect none He sat back tapping the table with long nervous fingers and his eyes wandered from the table around the room He surveyed it all with much the look he had given Natalie a few moments before searching appraising vaguely hostile Yet it was a lovely room simple and stately Rodney Page who was by way of being decorator for the few as he was architect for the many had done the room with its plainly paneled walls the over mantel with an old painting inset its lion chairs its two console tables with each its pair of porcelain jars Clayton liked the dignity of the room but there were times when he and Natalie sat at the great table alone with only the candles for light and the rest of the room in a darkness from which the butler emerged at stated intervals and retreated again when he felt the oppression of it For a dinner party with the brilliant colors of the women s gowns it was ideal For Natalie and himself alone with the long silences between them that seemed to grow longer as the years went on it was inexpressibly dreary He was frequently aware that both Natalie and himself were talking for the butler s benefit From the room his eyes traveled to Graham sitting alone uninterested dull and somewhat flushed And on Graham too he fixed that clear appraising gaze that had vaguely disconcerted Natalie The boy had had too much to drink and unlike the group across the table it had made him sullen and quiet He sat there staring moodily at the cloth and turning his glass around in fingers that trembled somewhat Then he found himself involved in the conversation London as dark as they say inquired Christopher Valentine He was a thin young man with a small affectedly curled mustache Clayton did not care for him but Natalie found him amusing I haven t been over he really said ovah for ages Eight months or so Very dark Hard to get about Most of the fellows I know over there are doing something I d like to run over but what s the use Nobody around street s dark no gayety nothing No You d better stay at home They don t particularly want visitors anyhow Unless they go for war contracts eh said Valentine pleasantly a way he had of taking the edge off the frequent impertinence of his speech No I m not going over We re not popular over there I understand Keep on thinking we ought to take a hand in the dirty mess Graham spoke unexpectedly Well don t you think we ought If you want my candid opinion no We ve been waving a red flag called the Monroe Doctrine for some little time as a signal that we won t stand for Europe coming over here and grabbing anything If we re going to be consistent we can t do any grabbing in Europe can we Clayton eyed him rather contemptuously We might want to grab as you term it a share in putting the madmen of Europe into chains he said I thought you were pro British Chris Only as to clothes women and filet of sole Chris returned flippantly Then seeing Graham glowering at him across the table he dropped his affectation of frivolity What s the use of our going in now he argued This Somme push is the biggest thing yet They re going through the Germans like a hay cutter through a field German losses half a million already And what about the Allies Have they lost nothing This was Clayton s attorney an Irishman named Denis Nolan There had been two n s in the Denis originally but although he had disposed of a part of his birthright he was still belligerently Irish What about Rumania What about the Russians at Lemberg What about Saloniki You Irish said the rector genially Always fighting the world and each other Tell me Nolan why is it that you always have individual humor and collective ill humor He felt that that was rather neat But Nolan was regarding him acrimoniously and Clayton apparently had not heard at all The dispute went on Chris Valentine alternately flippant and earnest the rector conciliatory Graham glowering and silent Nolan had started on the Irish question and Rodney baited him with the prospect of conscription there Nolan s voice full and mellow and strangely sweet dominated the room But Clayton was not listening He had heard Nolan air his views before He was a trifle acid was Nolan He needed mellowing a woman in his life But Nolan had loved once and the girl had died With the curious constancy of the Irish he had remained determinedly celibate Strange race Clayton reflected idly as Nolan s voice sang on Don t know what they want but want it like the devil One woman men too Curious It occurred to him then that his own reflection was as odd as the fidelity of the Irish He had been faithful to his wife He had never thought of being anything else He did not pursue that line of thought He sat back and resumed his nervous tapping of the cloth not listening hardly thinking but conscious of a discontent that was beyond analysis Clayton had been aware since his return from the continent and England days before of a change in himself He had not recognized it until he reached home And he was angry with himself for feeling it He had gone abroad for certain Italian contracts and had obtained them A year or two if the war lasted so long and he would be on his feet at last after years of struggle to keep his organization together through the hard times that preceded the war He would be much more than on his feet Given three more years of war and he would be a very rich man And now that the goal was within sight he was finding that it was not money he wanted There were some things money could not buy He had always spent money His anxieties had not influenced his scale of living Money for instance could not buy peace for the world or peace for a man either It had only one value for a man it gave him independence of other men made him free Three things said the rector apropos of something or other and rather oratorically are required by the normal man Work play and love Assure the crippled soldier that he has lost none of these and Work and play and love Well God knows he had worked Play He would have to take up golf again more regularly He ought to play three times a week Perhaps he could take a motor tour now and then too Natalie would like that Love He had not thought about love very much A married man of forty five certainly had no business thinking about love No he certainly did not want love He felt rather absurd even thinking about it And yet in the same flash came a thought of the violent passions of his early twenties There had been a time when he had suffered horribly because Natalie had not wanted to marry him He was glad all that was over No he certainly did not want love He drew a long breath and straightened up How about those plans Rodney he inquired genially Natalie says you have them ready to look over I ll bring them round any time you say To morrow then Better not lose any time Building is going to be a slow matter at the best Slow and expensive Page added He smiled at his host but Clayton Spencer remained grave I ve been away he said and I don t know what Natalie and you have cooked up between you But just remember this I want a comfortable country house I don t want a public library Page looked uncomfortable The move into the drawing room covered his uneasiness but he found a moment later on to revert to the subject I have tried to carry out Natalie s ideas Clay he said She wanted a sizeable place you know A wing for house parties and that sort of thing Clayton s eyes roamed about the room where portly missus Haverford was still knitting placidly where the Chris Valentines were quarreling under pretense of raillery where Toots Hayden was smoking a cigaret in a corner and smiling up at Graham and where Natalie exquisite and precise was supervising the laying out of a bridge table She would of course he observed rather curtly and moving through a French window went out onto a small balcony into the night He was irritated with himself What had come over him He shook himself and drew a long breath of the sweet night air His tall boyishly straight figure dominated the little place In the half light he looked indeed like an overgrown boy He always looked like Graham s brother anyhow it was one of Natalie s complaints against him But he put the thought of Natalie away along with his new discontent By George it was something to feel that if a man could not fight in this war at least he could make shells to help end it Oblivious to the laughter in the room behind him the clink of glass as whiskey and soda was brought in he planned there in the darkness new organization new expansions and found in it a great content He was proud of his mills They were his of his making The small iron foundry of his father s building had developed into the colossal furnaces that night after night lighted the down town district like a great conflagration He was proud of his mills and of his men He liked to take men and see them work out his judgment of them He was not often wrong Take that room behind him Rodney Page dilettante liked by women who called him Roddie a trifle unscrupulous but not entirely a knave the sort of man one trusted with everything but one s wife Chris too only he let married women alone and forgot to pay back the money he borrowed There was only one man in the room about whom he was beginning to mistrust his judgment and that was his own son Perhaps it was because he had so recently come from lands where millions of boys like Graham were pouring out their young lives like wine that Clayton Spencer was seeing Graham with a new vision He turned and glanced back into the drawing room where Graham in the center of that misfit group and not quite himself was stooping over Marion Hayden They would have to face that of course the woman urge in the boy Until now his escapades had been boyish ones a few debts frankly revealed and as frankly regretted some college mischiefs a rather serious gambling fever quickly curbed But never women thank God But now the boy was through with college and already he noticed something new in their relationship Natalie had always spoiled him and now there were with increasing frequency small consultations in her room when he was shut out and he was beginning to notice a restraint in his relations with the boy as though mother and son had united against him He was confident that Natalie was augmenting Graham s allowance from her own His salary rather for he had taken the boy into the business not as a partner that would come later but as the manager of a department He never spoke to Natalie of money Her house bills were paid at the office without question But only that day Miss Potter his secretary had reported that missus Spencer s bank had called up and he had made good a considerable overdraft He laid the cause of his discontent to Graham finally The boy had good stuff in him He was not going to allow Natalie to spoil him or to withdraw him into that little realm of detachment in which she lived Natalie did not need him and had not either as a lover or a husband for years But the boy did There was a little stir in the room behind The Haverfords were leaving and the Hayden girl who was plainly finding the party dull Graham was looking down at her a tall handsome boy with Natalie s blonde hair but his father s height and almost insolent good looks Come around to morrow she was saying About four There s always a crowd about five you know Clayton knew and felt a misgiving The Hayden house was a late afternoon loafing and meeting place for the idle sons and daughters of the rich Not the conservative old families who had developed a sense of the responsibility of wealth but of the second generation of easily acquired money As she went out with Graham at her elbow he heard Chris at the bridge table Terrible house the Haydens Just one step from the Saturday night carouse in Clay s mill district When Graham came back missus Haverford put her hand on his arm I wish you would come to see us Graham Delight so often speaks of you Graham stiffened almost imperceptibly Thanks I will But his tone was distant You know she comes out this winter Really And you were great friends I think she misses you a little I wish I thought so Gentle missus Haverford glanced up at him quickly You know she doesn t approve of me Why Graham Well ask her he said And there was a real bitterness under the lightness of his tone I ll come of course missus Haverford Thank you for asking me I haven t a lot of time I m a sort of clerk down at the mill you know Natalie overheard and her eyes met Clayton s with a glance of malicious triumph She had been deeply resentful that he had not made Graham a partner at once He remembered a conversation they had had a few months before Why should he have to start at the bottom she had protested You have never been quite fair to him Clay His boyish diminutive had stuck to him You expect him to know as much about the mill now as you do after all these years Not at all I want him to learn That s precisely the reason why I m not taking him in at once How much salary is he to have Three thousand a year Three thousand Why it will take all of that to buy him a car There are three cars here now I should think he could manage Every boy wants his own car I pay my other managers three thousand he had said still patient He will live here His car can be kept here without expense Personally I think it too much money for the service he will be able to give for the first year or two And although she had let it go at that he had felt in her a keen resentment Graham had got a car of his own was using it hard if the bills the chauffeur presented were an indication and Natalie had overdrawn her account two thousand

none	none	dollars The evening wore on Two tables of bridge were going with Denis Nolan sitting in at one Money in large amounts was being written in on the bridge scores The air of the room was heavy with smoke and all the men and some of the women were drinking rather too much There were splotches of color under the tan in Graham s cheeks and even Natalie s laughter had taken on a higher note Chris s words rankled in Clayton Spencer s mind A step from the Saturday night carouse How much better was this sort of thing A dull party driven to cards and drink to get through the evening And what sort of home life were he and Natalie giving the boy Either this or the dreary evenings when they were alone with Natalie sifting with folded hands or withdrawing to her boudoir upstairs where invariably she summoned Graham to talk to him behind closed doors He went into the library and shut the door The room rested him after the babble across He lighted a cigar and stood for a moment before Natalie s portrait It had been painted while he was abroad at he suspected Rodney s instigation It left him quite cold as did Natalie herself He could look at it dispassionately as he had never quite cared to regard Natalie Between them personally there was always the element she never allowed him to forget that she had given him a son This was Natalie herself Natalie at forty one girlish beautiful fretful and selfish Natalie with whom he was to live the rest of his life who was to share his wealth and his future and with whom he shared not a single thought in common He had a curious sense of disloyalty as he sat down at his desk and picked up a pad and pencil But a moment later he had forgotten her as he had forgotten the party across the hall He had work to do Thank God for work CHAPTER II Natalie was in bed when he went up stairs Through the door of his dressing room he could see her lying surrounded by papers Natalie s handsome bed was always covered with things her handkerchief a novel her silk dressing gown flung over the footboard sometimes bits of dress materials and lace Natalie did most of her planning in bed He went in and clearing a space sat down on the foot of the bed facing her Her hair was arranged in a loose knot on top of her head and there was a tiny space perhaps a quarter of an inch slightly darker than the rest He realized with a little start that she had had her hair touched up during his absence Still she looked very pretty her skin slightly glistening with its night s bath of cold cream her slim arms lying out on the blue silk eiderdown coverlet I told Doctor Haverford to night that we would like to give him a car Natalie he began directly It was typical of him the we A car What for To ride about in my dear It s rather a large parish you know And I don t feel exactly comfortable seeing him tramping along when most people are awheel He s not very young He ll kill himself

4018_103416_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 all right 
none	none	The guests were all right I may have unconsciously resented your attitude about Doctor Haverford Certainly he didn t angle for it and I had no idea of throwing a sop to Providence That isn t what was wrong at dinner Do you really want me to tell you Not if it s too disagreeable Good heavens Natalie One would think I bullied you Oh no you don t bully It s worse It s the way you look Your face sets Well I didn t feel unpleasant It s rather my misfortune that my face Didn t you like my gown Very much It seemed a trifle low but you know I always like your clothes He was almost pathetically anxious to make up to her for that moment s disloyalty in the library There she said brushing the papers aside Now we re getting at it Was I anything like as low as Audrey Valentine Of course not Her back You just drive me to despair Clay Nothing I do pleases you The very tone of that secretary of yours to day when I told her about that over draft it was positively insulting I don t like overdrafts he said without any irritation When you want extra amounts you have only to let me know You are always finding fault with me she complained It s either money or my clothes or Graham or something Her eyes filled She looked young and absurdly childish But a talk he had had with the rector was still in his mind It was while they were still at the table and Nolan had been attacking the British government We get out of this world largely what we put into it he had said You give largely Clay and you receive largely I rejoice in your prosperity because you have earned it You think then he had asked that we only receive as we give I don t mean material things of course The rector had fixed him with kindly rather faded old eyes That has been my experience he said Happiness for instance only comes when we forget our eternal search for it and try to make others happy Even religion is changing The old selfish idea of saving our own souls has given way largely to the saving of others by giving them a chance to redeem themselves Decent living conditions He had gone on but Clayton had not listened very intently He had been wondering if happiness was not the thing he had somehow missed It was then that he had decided to give the car If after all that would make for the rector s happiness I don t want to find fault with you Natalie he said gravely I would like to see you happy Sometimes I think you are not I have my business but you have nothing to do and I suppose you wouldn t be interested in war work would you There are a lot of committees and since I ve been in England I realize what a vast amount is needed Clothes you know and bandages and well everything Nothing to do she looked up her eyes wide and indignant But of course you would think that This house runs itself I suppose Let s be honest Natalie he said with a touch of impatience Actually how much time each day do you give this house You have plenty of trained servants An hour Two hours I ll not discuss it with you She took up a typewritten sheet and pretended to read it carefully Clayton had a half humorous half irritated conviction that if he was actually hunting happiness he had begun his search for it rather badly He took the paper from her gently What s this he inquired Anything I should not see Decorator s estimates for the new house Her voice was resentful You ll have to see them some time Library curtains gray Chippendale velvet gold gimp faced with colonial yellow he read an item picked at random two thousand dollars That s going some for curtains isn t it It s not too much for that sort of thing But look here Natalie he expostulated This is to be a country house isn t it I thought you wanted chintzed and homey things This looks like a city house in the country He glanced down at the total The hangings alone with a tapestry or two were to be thirty five thousand dollars He whistled Hangings alone And what sort of a house has Rodney planned anyhow Italian with a sunken garden The landscape estimates are there too He did not look at them It seems to me you and Rodney have been pretty busy while I ve been away he remarked Well I want you to be happy my dear Only I don t want to tie up a fortune just now We may get into this war and if we do He rose and yawned his arms above his head I m off to bed he said Big day to morrow I ll want Graham at the office at eight thirty She had sat up in bed and was staring at him Her face was pale Do you mean that we are going to get into this war I think it very likely my dear But if we do Graham We might as well face it Graham will probably want to go He ll do nothing of the sort she said sharply He s all I have All Do you think I m going to send him over there to be cannon fodder I won t let him go She was trembling violently I won t want him to go of course But if the thing comes he s of age you know She eyed him with thinly veiled hostility You re hard Clay she accused him You re hard all the way through You re proud too Proud and hard You d want to be able to say your son was in the army It s not because you care anything about the war except to make money out of it What is the war to you anyhow You don t like the English and as for French you don t even let me have a French butler He was not the less angry because he realized the essential truth of part of what she said He felt no great impulse of sympathy with any of the combatants He knew the gravity of the situation rather than its tragedy He did not like war any war He saw no reason why men should kill But this war was a fact He had had no hand in its making but it was made His first impulse was to leave her in dignified silence But she was crying and I he disliked leaving her in tears Dead as was his love for her and that night somehow he knew that it was dead she was still his wife They had had some fairly happy years together long ago And he felt the need too of justification Perhaps you are right Natalie he said after a moment I haven t cared about this war as much as I should Not the human side of it anyhow But you ought to understand that by making shells for the Allies I am not only making money for myself they need the shells And I ll give them the best I don t intend only to profit by their misfortunes She had hardly listened Then if we get into it as you say you ll encourage Graham to go I shall allow him to go if he feels it his duty Oh duty duty I m sick of the word She bent forward and suddenly caught one of his hands You won t make him go Clay she begged You you ll let him make his own decision If you will What do you mean If you ll keep your hands off too We re not in it yet God knows I hope we won t be But if I promise not to influence him you must do the same thing I haven t any more influence over Graham than that she said and snapped her finger But she did not look at him Promise he said steadily Oh all right Her voice and face were sulky She looked much as Graham had that evening at the table Is that a promise Good heavens do you want me to swear to it I want you to play fair That s all She leaned back again among her pillows and gathered her papers All right she said indifferently Have you any preference as to color for your rooms in the new house He was sorry for his anger and after all these things which seemed so unimportant to him were the things that made up her life He smiled You might match my eyes I m not sure what color they are Perhaps you know But she had not forgiven him I ve never noticed she replied And small bundle of samples in her hand resumed her reading and her inspection of textiles Good night Natalie Good night She did not look up Outside his wife s door he hesitated Then he crossed and without knocking entered Graham s bedroom The boy was lounging in a long chair by an open fire He was in his dressing gown and slippers and an empty whiskey and soda glass stood beside him on a small stand Graham was sound asleep Clayton touched him on the shoulder but he slept on his head to one side his breathing slow and heavy It required some little effort to waken him Graham said Clayton sharply Yes He stirred but did not open his eyes Graham Wake up boy Graham sat up suddenly and looked at him The whites of his eyes were red but he had slept off the dinner wine He was quite himself Better get to bed his father suggested I ll want you early to morrow What time sir He leaned forward and pressed a button beside the mantel piece What are you doing that for Ice water Awfully thirsty The servants have gone to bed Go down and get it yourself Graham looked up at the tone At his father s eyes he looked away Sorry sir he said Must have had too much champagne Wasn t much else to do was there Mother s parties my God what a dreary lot Clayton inspected the ice water carafe on the stand and found it empty I ll bring you some water from my room he said And I don t want to see you this way again Graham When a man cannot take a little wine at his own table without taking too much he fails to be entirely a gentleman He went out When he came back Graham was standing by the fire in his pajamas looking young and rather ashamed Clayton had a flash of those earlier days when he had come in to bid the boy good night and there had always been that last request for water which was to postpone the final switching off of the light I m sorry father Clayton put his hand on the boy s shoulder and patted him We ll have to do better next time That s all For a moment the veil of constraint of Natalie s weaving lifted between them I m a pretty bad egg I guess You d better shove me off the dock and let me swim or drown I d hardly like to do that you know You are all I have I m no good at the mill You haven t had very much time I ve been a good many years learning the business I ll never be any good Not there If there was something to build up it would be different but it s all done You ve done it I m only a sort of sublimated clerk I don t mean he added hastily that I think I ought to have anything more It s only that well the struggle s over if you know what I mean I ll talk to you about that to morrow Get to bed now It s one o clock He moved to the doorway Graham carafe in hand stood staring ahead of him He had the courage of the last whiskey and soda and a sort of desperate contrition Father Yes Graham I wish you d let me go to France and fly Something like a cold hand seemed to close round Clayton s heart Fly Why Because I m not doing any good here And because I d like to see if I have any good stuff in me All the fellows are going he added rather weakly That s not a particularly worthy reason is it It s about as worthy as making money out of shells when we haven t any reason for selling them to the Allies more than the Germans except that we can t ship to the Germans He looked rather frightened then But Clayton was not angry He saw Natalie s

none	none	hand there and the boy s impressionable nature Think that over Graham he said gravely I don t believe you quite mean it Good night He went across to his own bedroom where his silk pajamas neatly folded lay on his painted Louis XVI bed Under his reading lamp there was a book It was a part of Natalie s decorative scheme for the room it s binding was mauve to match the hangings For the first time since the room had been done over during his absence he picked up the book Rodney s idea for a cent he reflected looking rather grimly at the cover He undressed slowly his mind full of Graham and the problem he presented Then he thought of Natalie and of the little things that made up her life and filled her days He glanced about the room beautiful formal exquisitely appointed His father s portrait was gone from over the mantel and an old French water color hung there instead That was too bad of Natalie Or had it been Rodney He would bring it back And he gave a fleeting thought to Graham and his request to go abroad He had not meant it It was sheer reaction But he would talk to Graham He lighted a cigaret and getting into bed turned on his reading lamp Queer how a man could build and then find that after all he did not care for the achievement It was the building alone that was worth while He picked up the book from the table and opened it casually When first I loved I gave my very soul Utterly unreserved to Love s control But Love deceived me wrenched my youth away And made the gold of life forever gray Long I lived lonely yet I tried in vain With any other joy to stifle pain There is no other joy I learned to know And so returned to love as long ago Yet I this little while ere I go hence Love very lightly now in self defense Twaddle said Clayton Spencer and put the book away That was the sort of stuff men like Rodney lived on In a mauve binding too After he had put out the light he lay for a long time staring into the darkness It was not love he wanted he was through with all that Power was the thing integrity and power To yield to no man to achieve independence for one s soul not that he put it that way He formulated it drowsily Not to give a damn for any one so long as you re right Of course it was not always possible to know if one was right He yawned His conscious mind was drowsing and from the depths below released of the sentry of his waking hours came the call of his starved imagination CHAPTER III There was no moral to be adduced from Graham s waking the next morning He roused reluctantly enough but blithe and hungry He sang as he splashed in his shower chose his tie whistling and went down the staircase two steps at a time to a ravenous breakfast Clayton was already at the table in the breakfast room sitting back with the newspaper his coffee at his elbow the first cigarette of the morning half smoked He looked rather older in the morning light Small fine threads had begun to show themselves at the corners of his eyes The lines of repression from the nostrils to the corners of the mouth seemed deeper But his invincible look of boyishness persisted at that There was no awkwardness in Graham s Morning dad He had not forgotten the night before but he had already forgiven himself He ignored the newspaper at his plate and dug into his grapefruit Anything new he inquired casually You might look and see Clayton suggested good naturedly I ll read going down in the car Can t stand war news on an empty stomach Mother all right this morning I think she is still sleeping Well I should say she needs it after last night How in the world we manage with all the interesting people in the world to get together such a dreary lot as that Lord it was awful Clayton rose and folded his paper The car s waiting he said I ll be ready in five minutes He went slowly up the stairs In her pink bedroom Natalie had just wakened Madeleine her elderly French maid had brought her breakfast and she was lying back among the pillows the litter of the early mail about her and a morning paper on her knee He bent over and kissed her perfunctorily and he was quick to see that her resentment of the evening before had survived the night Sleep well he inquired looking down at her She evaded his eyes Not particularly Any plans for to day I ll just play around I m lunching out and I may run out with Rodney to Linndale The landscape men are there today She picked up the newspaper as though to end the discussion He saw then that she was reading the society news and he rather more than surmised that she had not even glanced at the black headings which on the first page announced the hideous casualties of the Somme Then you ve given the planting contract Some things have to go in in the fall Clay For heaven s sake don t look like a thunder cloud Have you given the landscape contract Yes And please go out You make my head ache How much is it to be I don t know Ask Rodney I ll do nothing of the sort my dear This is not Rodney s investment Nor mine I suppose All I want you to do Natalie is to consult me I want you to have a free hand but some one with a sense of responsibility ought to check up these expenditures But it isn t only that I d like to have a hand in the thing myself I ve rather looked forward to the time when we could have the sort of country place we wanted You don t like any of the strings to get out of your fingers do you I didn t come up to quarrel Natalie I wish you wouldn t force it on me I force it on you she cried and laughed in a forced and high pitched note Just because I won t be over ridden without a protest I m through that s all I shan t go near the place again You don t understand he persisted patiently I happen to like gardens I had an idea I told you about it of trying to duplicate the old garden at home You remember it When we went there on our honeymoon You don t call that a garden Of course I didn t want to copy it exactly It was old and out of condition But there were a lot of old fashioned flowers However if you intend to build an Italian villa naturally I don t intend to build anything or to plant anything Her voice was frozen You go ahead Do it in your own way And then you can live there if you like I won t Which was what he carried away with him that morning to the mill He was not greatly disturbed by her threat to keep her hands off He knew quite well indeed that the afternoon would find her with Rodney Page picking her way in her high heeled shoes over the waste that was some day to bloom not like the rose of his desire but according to the formal and rigid blueprint which Rodney would be carrying But in five minutes he had put the incident out of his mind After all if it gave her happiness and occupation certainly she needed both And his powers of inhibition were strong For many years he had walled up the small frictions of his married life and its disappointments and outside that wall had built up an existence of his own which was the mill When he went down stairs he found that Graham had ordered his own car and was already in it drawing on his gloves Have to come back up town early dad he called in explanation and drove off going at the reckless speed he affected Clayton rode down alone in the limousine He had meant to outline his plans of expansion to Graham but he had had no intention of consulting him In his own department the boy did neither better nor worse than any other of the dozens of young men in the organization If he had shown neither special aptitude for nor interest in the business he had at least not signally failed to show either Now paper and pencil in hand Clayton jotted down the various details of the new system in their sequence the building of a forging plant to make the rough casts for the new Italian shells out of the steel from the furnaces the construction of a new spur to the little railway which bound the old plant together with its shining steel rails There were questions of supplies and shipping and bank credits to face the vast and complex problems of the complete new munition works to be built out of town and involving such matters as the housing of enormous numbers of employees He scrawled figures and added them Even with the size of the foreign contract their magnitude startled him He leaned back his mouth compressed the lines from the nostrils to the corners deeper than ever He had completely forgotten Natalie and the country house Outside the gates to the mill enclosure he heard an early extra being called and bought it The Austrian premier had been assassinated The successful French counter attack against Verdun was corroborated also On the center of the front page was the first photograph to reach America of a tank He inspected it with interest So the Allies had at last shown same inventive genius of their own Perhaps this was but the beginning Even at that enough of these fighting mammoths and the war might end quickly With the tanks and the Allied offensive and the evidence of discontent in Austria the thing might after all be over before America was involved He reflected however that an early peace would not be an unmixed blessing for him He wanted the war to end he hated killing He felt inarticulately that something horrible was happening to the world But personally his plans were premised on a war to last at least two years more until the fall of nineteen eighteen That would let him out cover the cost of the new plant bring renewals of his foreign contracts justify those stupendous figures on the paper in his hand He wondered rather uncomfortably what he would do under the circumstances if it were in his power to declare peace to morrow In his office in the mill administration building he found the general manager waiting Through the door into the conference room beyond he could see the superintendents of the various departments with Graham rather aloof and detached and a sprinkling of the most important foremen On his desk neatly machined was the first tentative shell case made in the mill machine shop an experiment rather than a realization Hutchinson the general manager was not alone Opposite him very neatly dressed in his best clothes his hat in his hand and a set expression on his face was one of the boss rollers of the steel mill Herman Klein At Clayton s entrance he made a motion to depart but Hutchinson stopped him Tell mister Spencer what you ve been telling me Klein he said curtly Klein fingered his hat but his face remained set I ve just been saying mister Spencer he said in good English but with the guttural accent which thirty years in America had not eliminated that I ll be leaving you now Leaving Why Because of that He pointed without intentional drama at the shell case I can t make those shells for you mister Spencer and me a German You re an American aren t you I am sir It is not that It iss that I His face worked He had dropped back to the old idiom after years of painful struggle to abandon it It iss that I am a German also I have people there in the war To make shells to kill them no He is determined mister Spencer said Hutchinson I have been arguing with him but you can t argue with a German Clayton was uneasily aware of something like sympathy for the man I understand how you feel Klein he observed But of course you know whether you go or stay the shells will be made anyhow I know that You are throwing up a good position I ll try to get another The prospective loss of Klein was a rather serious one Clayton seated behind his great desk eyed him keenly and then stooped to bribery He mentioned a change in the wage scale with bonuses to all foremen and rollers He knew Klein s pride in the mill and he outlined briefly the growth that was about to be developed But the boss roller remained obdurate He understood that such things were to be but it was not necessary that he assist Germany s enemies against her Against the determination in his heavy square figure Clayton argued in vain When ten minutes later he went into the conference room followed by a secretary with a sheaf of papers the mill was minus a boss roller and there was rankling in his mind Klein s last words I haf no objection mister Spencer to your making money out of this war but I will not There had been no insolence in his tone He had gone out with his heavy German stolidity of mien unchanged and had closed the door behind him with quiet finality CHAPTER IV Graham left the conference that morning in a rather exalted mood The old mill was coming into its own at last He had a sense of boyish triumph in the new developments a feeling of being a part of big activities that would bring rich rewards And he felt a new pride in his father He had sat a little way from the long table and had watched the faces of the men gathered about it as clearly and forcibly the outlines of the new departure were given out Hitherto Spencer s had made steel only Now they were not only to make the steel but they were to forge the ingots into rough casts these casts were then to be carried to the new munition works there to be machined drilled polished provided with fuses which Spencer s were also to make and shipped abroad The question of speeding production had been faced and met The various problems had been discussed and the bonus system tentatively taken up Then the men had dispersed each infected with the drive of his father s contagious force Pretty fine old boy Graham had considered And he wondered vaguely if when his time came he would be able to take hold For a few minutes Natalie s closetings lost their effect He saw his father not as one from whom to hide extravagance and unpaid bills but as the head of a great concern that was now to be a part of the war itself He wandered into his father s office and picked up the shell Clayton was already at his letters but looked up Think we rather had them eh Graham Think you did sir Carried them off their feet Pretty isn t it He held up the shell case If a fellow could only forget what the damned things are for They are to help to end the war said Clayton crisply Don t forget that boy And went back to his steady dictation Graham went out of the building into the mill yard The noise always irritated him He had none of Clayton s joy and understanding of it To Clayton each sound had its corresponding activity To Graham it was merely din an annoyance to his ears as the mill yard outraged his fastidiousness But that morning he found it rather more bearable He stooped where in front of the store the storekeeper had planted a tiny garden Some small late blossoming chrysanthemums were still there and he picked one and put it in his buttonhole His own office was across the yard He dodged in front of a yard locomotive picked his way about masses of lumber and the general litter of all mill yards and opened the door of his own building Just inside his office a girl was sitting on a straight chair her hat a trifle crooked and her eyes red from crying He paused in amazement Why Miss Klein he said What s the matter She was rather a pretty girl even now She stood up at his voice and made an effort to straighten her hat Haven t you heard she asked I haven t heard anything that ought to make Miss Anna Klein weep of a nice frosty morning in October Unless he sobered for her grief was evident Tell me about it Father has given up his job No I m telling you mister Spencer He won t help to make those shells He s been acting queer for three or four days and this morning he told your father Graham whistled As if it made any difference she went on irritably Some one else will get his job That s all What does he care about the Germans He left them and came to America as soon as he could walk Graham sat down Now let s get this he said He won t make shells for the Allies and so he s given up his position All right That s bad but he s a good workman He ll not have any trouble getting another job Now why are you crying I didn t think you d want me to stay on Putting her fear into words brought back her long hours of terror She collapsed into the chair again and fell to unquiet sobbing Graham was disturbed You re a queer girl he said Why should that lose me my most valued assistant When she made no reply he got up and going over to her put a hand on her shoulder Tell me that he said He looked down at her The hair grew very soft and blonde at the nape of her neck and he ran a finger lightly across it Tell me that I was afraid it would And even if it had which you are a goose for thinking you re just as good in your line as your father is in his I ve been expecting any time to hear of your leaving me for a handsomer man He had been what he would have termed jollying her back to normality again But to his intense surprise she suddenly leaned back and looked up into his face There was no doubting what he saw there Just for a moment the situation threatened to get out of hand Then he patted her shoulders and put the safety of his desk between them Run away and bathe your eyes he said and then come back here looking like the best secretary in the state and not like a winter thaw We have the deuce of a lot of work to do But after she had gone he sat for some little time idly rapping a pencil on the top of his desk By Jove Anna Klein Of all girls in the world It was rather a pity too She was a nice little thing and in the last few months she had changed a lot She had been timid at first and hideously dressed Lately she had been almost smart Those ear rings now they changed her a lot Queer how things went on in a girl s mind and a fellow didn t know until something happened He settled his tie and smoothed back his heavy hair During the remainder of the day he began to wonder if he had not been a fatuous idiot Anna did her work with the thoroughness of her German blood plus her American training She came back minus her hat and with her eyes carefully powdered and not once during the morning was he able to meet her eyes fully By the middle of the afternoon sex vanity and curiosity began to get the better of his judgment and he made an excuse when she stood beside him over some papers her hand on the desk to lay his fingers over hers She drew her hand away quickly and when he glanced up boyishly smiling her face was flushed Please she said And he felt hurt and rebuffed He had no sentiment for her whatever but the devil of mischief of twenty two was behind him urging him on to the eternal experiment He was very formal with her for the rest of the day and had the satisfaction of leaving her at four o clock white faced and miserable over her machine in the little office next to his He forgot her immediately in the attempt to leave the mill without encountering his father Clayton he knew would be staying late and would be exacting similar tribute to the emergency from the entire force Also he had been going about the yard with contractors most of the afternoon But Graham made his escape safely It was two hours later when his father getting into the limousine noticed the absence of the boy s red car and asked the gateman how long it had been gone Since about four o clock mister Spencer Suddenly Clayton felt a reaction from the activities of the day He sank back in the deeply padded seat and felt tired and in some odd fashion lonely He would have liked to talk to Graham on the way up town if only to crystallize his own thoughts He would have liked to be going home to review with Natalie the day s events the fine spirit of his men the small difficulties But Natalie hated the mention of the mill He thought it probable too that they were dining out Yes he remembered They were dining at the Chris Valentines Well that was better than it might have been They were not dull anyhow His mind wandered to the Valentine house small not too well ordered frequently noisy but always gay and extremely smart He thought of Audrey and her curious friendship with Natalie Audrey the careless with her dark lazy charm her deep and rather husky contralto her astonishing little French songs which she sang with nonchalant grace and her crowds of boyish admirers whom she alternately petted and bullied surely she and Natalie had little enough in common Yet in the last year or so he had been continually coming across them together at the club at luncheon in the women s dining room at his own house Natalie always perfectly and expensively dressed Audrey in the casual garments which somehow her wearing made effective He smiled a little Certain of Audrey s impertinences came to his mind She was an amusing young woman He had an idea that she was always in debt and that the fact concerned her very little He fancied that few things concerned her very deeply including Chris But she knew about food Her dinners were as casual as her house as to service but they were worth eating She claimed to pay for them out of her bridge winnings and indeed her invitation for to night had been frankness itself I m going to have a party Clay she had said I ve made two killings at bridge and somebody has shipped Chris some ducks If you ll send me some cigarets like the last I ll make it Tuesday He had sent the cigarets and this was Tuesday The pleasant rolling of the car soothed him The street flashed by brilliant with lights that in far perspective seemed to meet The shop windows gleamed with color From curb to curb were other cars like the one in which he rode carrying home other men like himself to whatever the evening held in store He remembered London at this hour already dark and quiet its few motors making their cautious way in the dusk its throngs of clerks nearly all women now hurrying home to whatever dread the night might hold And it made him slightly more complacent These things that he had taken for granted before had since his return assumed the quality of luxury Pray God we won t get into it he said to himself He reviewed his unrest of the night before and smiled at it Happiness Happiness came from a sense of achievement Integrity and power that was the combination The respect of one s fellow men the day s work well done Romance was done at his age but there remained the adventure of success A few years more and he would leave the mill to Graham and play awhile After that he had always liked politics They needed business men in politics If men of training and leisure would only go in for it there would be some chance of cleaning up the situation Yes he might do that He was an easy speaker and The car drew up at the curb and the chauffeur got out Natalie s car had drawn up just ahead and the footman was already opening the door Rodney Page got out and assisted Natalie to alight Clayton smiled So she had changed her mind He saw Rodney bend over her hand and kiss it after his usual ceremonious manner Natalie seemed a trifle breathless when she turned and saw him You re early aren t you she said I fancy it is you who are late Then he realized that the chauffeur was waiting to speak to him Yes Jackson I m sorry sir I guess I ll be leaving at the end of my month mister Spencer Come into the library and I ll talk to you What s wrong There s nothing wrong sir I have been

none	none	suited It s only I used to be in the regular army sir and I guess I m going to be needed again You mean we are going to be involved Yes sir I think we are There s no answer to that Jackson he said But a sense of irritation stirred him as he went up the steps to the house door Jackson was a good man Jackson and Klein and who knew who would be next Oh damn the war he reflected rather wearily CHAPTER V The winter which preceded the entrance of the United States into the war was socially an extraordinary one 
4018_103416_000002_000001	train-clean-100	It was marked by an almost feverish gayety as though having apparently determined to pursue a policy dictated purely by self interest the people wished to forget their anomalous position 
none	none	Like a woman who covers her shame with a smile 
4018_103416_000002_000003	train-clean-100	The vast number of war orders from abroad had brought prosperity into homes where it had long been absent 
4018_103416_000002_000004	train-clean-100	Mills and factories took on new life Labor was scarce and high 
4018_103416_000003_000000	train-clean-100	It was a period of extravagance rather than pleasure 
4018_103416_000003_000001	train-clean-100	People played that they might not think 
4018_103416_000003_000002	train-clean-100	Washington convinced that the nation would ultimately be involved kept its secret well and continued to preach a neutrality it could not enforce 
4018_103416_000003_000003	train-clean-100	War was to most of the nation a great dramatic spectacle presented to them at breakfast and in the afternoon editions 
4018_103416_000003_000004	train-clean-100	It furnished unlimited conversation at dinner parties led to endless wrangles gave zest and point to the peace that made those dinner parties possible furnished an excuse for retrenchment here and there and brought into vogue great bazaars and balls for the Red Cross and kindred activities 
4018_103416_000004_000000	train-clean-100	But although the war was in the nation s mind it was not yet in its soul 
4018_103416_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 not yet 
none	none	in its soul 
4018_103416_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Life went on much as before 
4018_103416_000005_000001	train-clean-100	An abiding faith in the Allies was the foundation stone of its complacency 
4018_103416_000005_000002	train-clean-100	The great six months battle of the Somme with its million casualties was resulting favorably 
4018_103416_000005_000003	train-clean-100	On the east the Russians had made some gains 
4018_103416_000005_000004	train-clean-100	There were wagers that the Germans would be done in the Spring 
none	none	But again Washington knew that the British and French losses at the Somme had been frightful that the amount of lost territory regained was negligible as against the territory still held that the food problem in the British Islands was acute that the submarine sinkings were colossal 
4018_103416_000006_000001	train-clean-100	Our peace was at a fearful cost 
4018_103416_000007_000000	train-clean-100	And on the edge of this volcano America played 
4018_103416_000008_000000	train-clean-100	When Graham Spencer left the mill that Tuesday afternoon it was to visit Marion Hayden 
none	none	He was rather bored now at the prospect He would have preferred going to the Club to play billiards which was his custom of a late afternoon He drove rather more slowly than was his custom and so missed Marion s invitation to get there before the crowd 
4018_103416_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Three cars before the house showed that she already had callers and indeed when the parlor maid opened the door a burst of laughter greeted him 
4018_103416_000009_000001	train-clean-100	The Hayden house was a general rendezvous 
4018_103416_000009_000002	train-clean-100	There were usually by seven o clock whiskey and soda glasses and tea cups on most of the furniture and half smoked cigarets on everything that would hold them including the piano 
none	none	Marion herself met him in the hall and led him past the drawing room door There are people in every room who want to be left alone she volunteered
4018_103416_000011_000001	train-clean-100	 I kept the library as long as I could 
none	none	We can sit on the stairs if you like 
4018_103416_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Which they proceeded to do quite amiably 
none	none	From various open doors came subdued voices The air was pungent with tobacco smoke permeated with a faint scent of late afternoon highballs
4018_103416_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Tommy Marion called when she had settled herself 
4018_103416_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes from a distance 
none	none	Did you leave your cigaret on the piano
4018_103416_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 No Toots dear 
4018_103416_000016_000001	train-clean-100	But I can easily 
4018_103416_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Mother Marion explained is getting awfully touchy about the piano Well do you remember half the pretty things you told me last night 
4018_103416_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Not exactly 
4018_103416_000018_000001	train-clean-100	But I meant them 
4018_103416_000019_000000	train-clean-100	He looked up at her admiringly 
none	none	He was only a year from college and he had been rather arbitrarily limited to the debutantes He found therefore something rather flattering in the attention he was receiving from a girl who had been out five years and who was easily the most popular young woman in the gayer set It gave him a sense of maturity Since the night before he had been rankling under a sense of youth
4018_103416_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Was I pretty awful last night he asked 
none	none	You were very interesting 
4018_103416_000021_000001	train-clean-100	And I imagine rather indiscreet 
none	none	Fine 
4018_103416_000022_000001	train-clean-100	What did I say 
4018_103416_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 You boasted my dear young friend 
4018_103416_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Great Scott 
4018_103416_000024_000001	train-clean-100	I must have been awful 
4018_103416_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 About the new war contracts 
4018_103416_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh business 
4018_103416_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 But I found it very interesting 
4018_103416_000027_000001	train-clean-100	You know I like business 
4018_103416_000027_000002	train-clean-100	And I like big figures 
4018_103416_000027_000003	train-clean-100	Poor people always do 
none	none	Has it really gone through I mean those things do slip up sometimes don t they It s gone through all right Signed sealed and delivered 
4018_103416_000029_000000	train-clean-100	Encouraged by her interest he elaborated on the new work 
4018_103416_000029_000001	train-clean-100	He even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise 
none	none	And the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder Her eyes slightly narrowed watched him closely 
4018_103416_000029_000003	train-clean-100	She knew every move of the game she was determining to play 
4018_103416_000030_000000	train-clean-100	Marion Hayden at twenty five knew already what her little world had not yet realized that such beauty as she had had was the beauty of youth only and that that was going 
none	none	Late hours golf perhaps a little more champagne than was necessary at dinners and the mornings found her almost plain 
4018_103416_000030_000002	train-clean-100	And too she had the far vision of the calculating mind She knew that if the country entered the war every eligible man she knew would immediately volunteer 
none	none	At twenty five she already noticed a change in the personnel of her followers The unmarried men who had danced with her during her first two winters were now sending flowers to the debutantes and cutting in on the younger men at balls 
4018_103416_000031_000002	train-clean-100	Her house was still a rendezvous but it was for couples like the ones who had preempted the drawing room the library and the music room that afternoon 
4018_103416_000031_000003	train-clean-100	They met there smoked her cigarets made love in a corner occasionally became engaged 
4018_103416_000031_000004	train-clean-100	But she was of the game no longer in it 
none	none	Men still came to see her a growing percentage of them married 
4018_103416_000032_000001	train-clean-100	They brought or sent her tribute flowers candy and cigarets 
4018_103416_000032_000002	train-clean-100	She was enormously popular at dances 
none	none	But more and more her dinner invitations were from the older crowd 
4018_103416_000032_000004	train-clean-100	Like Natalie Spencer s stupid party the night before 
4018_103416_000033_000000	train-clean-100	So she watched Graham and listened 
none	none	He was a nice boy and a handsome one 
4018_103416_000033_000002	train-clean-100	Also he promised to be sole heir to a great business 
4018_103416_000033_000003	train-clean-100	If the war only lasted long enough 
none	none	Imagine your knowing all those things she said admiringly
4018_103416_000034_000001	train-clean-100	 You re a partner aren t you 
4018_103416_000035_000000	train-clean-100	He flushed slightly 
none	none	Not yet 
4018_103416_000036_000001	train-clean-100	But of course I shall be 
none	none	When you really get going I wonder if you will take me round and show me how shells are made I m the most ignorant person you ever knew
4018_103416_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 I ll be awfully glad to 
none	none	Very well For that promise you shall have a highball 
4018_103416_000039_000002	train-clean-100	You re an awful dear you know 
none	none	She placed a slim hand on his shoulder and patted it 
4018_103416_000040_000001	train-clean-100	Then leaning rather heavily on him for support she got to her feet 
none	none	We ll go in and stir up some of the lovers she suggested And if Tommy Hale hasn t burned up the piano we can dance a bit You dance divinely you know It was after seven when he reached home 
4018_103416_000042_000001	train-clean-100	He felt every inch a man 
4018_103416_000042_000002	train-clean-100	He held himself very straight as he entered the house and the boyish grin with which he customarily greeted the butler had given place to a dignified nod 
4018_103416_000043_000000	train-clean-100	Natalie was in her dressing room 
none	none	At his knock she told the maid to admit him and threw a dressing gown over her bare shoulders 
4018_103416_000043_000002	train-clean-100	Then she sent the maid away and herself cautiously closed the door into Clayton s room 
4018_103416_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 I ve got the money for you darling she said 
none	none	From her jewel case she took a roll of bills and held them out to him Five hundred
4018_103416_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 I hate to take it mother 
4018_103416_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Never mind about taking it 
4018_103416_000046_000001	train-clean-100	Pay those bills before your father learns about them 
none	none	That s all 
4018_103416_000047_000000	train-clean-100	He was divided between gratitude and indignation 
4018_103416_000047_000001	train-clean-100	His new found maturity seemed to be slipping from him 
4018_103416_000047_000002	train-clean-100	Somehow here at home they always managed to make him feel like a small boy 
none	none	Honestly mother I d rather go to father and tell him about it He d make a row probably but at least you d be out of it She ignored his protest as she always ignored protests against her own methods of handling matters
4018_103416_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 I m accustomed to it was her sole reply 
4018_103416_000050_000001	train-clean-100	But her resigned voice brought her as it always had the ready tribute of the boy s sympathy Sit down Graham I want to talk to you 
4018_103416_000051_000000	train-clean-100	He sat down still uneasily fingering the roll of bills 
4018_103416_000051_000001	train-clean-100	Just how far Natalie s methods threatened to undermine his character was revealed when at a sound in Clayton s room he stuck the money hastily into his pocket 
4018_103416_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 Have you noticed a change in your father since he came back 
none	none	Her tone was so ominous that he started
4018_103416_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 He s not sick is he 
none	none	Not that 
4018_103416_000055_000001	train-clean-100	But he s different 
4018_103416_000055_000002	train-clean-100	Graham your father thinks we may be forced into the war 
4018_103416_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Good for us 
4018_103416_000056_000001	train-clean-100	It s time that s sure 
none	none	Graham
4018_103416_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 Why good heavens mother he began we should have been in it last May 
4018_103416_000058_000001	train-clean-100	we should 
none	none	have been in it last May We should 
4018_103416_000059_000000	train-clean-100	She was holding out both hands to him piteously 
4018_103416_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 You wouldn t go would you 
4018_103416_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 I might have to go he evaded 
4018_103416_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 You wouldn t Graham 
none	none	You re all I have 
4018_103416_000062_000002	train-clean-100	All I have left to live for You wouldn t need to go 
none	none	It s ridiculous You re needed here Your father needs you
4018_103416_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 He needs me the hell of a lot the boy muttered 
4018_103416_000063_000001	train-clean-100	But he went over and stooping down kissed her trembling face 
4018_103416_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t worry about me he said lightly 
4018_103416_000064_000001	train-clean-100	 I don t think we ve got spine enough to get into the mix up anyhow 
4018_103416_000064_000002	train-clean-100	And if we have 
4018_103416_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 You won t go 
4018_103416_000065_000001	train-clean-100	Promise me you won t go 
4018_103416_000066_000000	train-clean-100	When he hesitated she resorted to her old methods with both Clayton and the boy 
4018_103416_000066_000001	train-clean-100	She was doing all she could to make them happy 
none	none	She made no demands none But when she asked for something that meant more than life to her it was refused of course 
4018_103416_000066_000004	train-clean-100	She had gone through all sorts of humiliation to get him that money and this was the gratitude she received 
none	none	Graham listened 
4018_103416_000067_000001	train-clean-100	She was a really pathetic figure crouched in her low chair and shaken with terror 
none	none	She must have rather a bad time there were so many things she dared not take to his father 
4018_103416_000067_000003	train-clean-100	She brought them to him instead her small grievances her elaborate extravagances her disappointments 
4018_103416_000067_000004	train-clean-100	It did not occur to him that she transferred to his young shoulders many of her own burdens 
4018_103416_000067_000005	train-clean-100	He was only grateful for her confidence and a trifle bewildered by it 
4018_103416_000067_000006	train-clean-100	And she had helped him out of a hole just now 
none	none	All right 
4018_103416_000068_000001	train-clean-100	I promise he said at last 
4018_103416_000068_000002	train-clean-100	 But you re worrying yourself for nothing mother 
4018_103416_000069_000000	train-clean-100	She was quite content then cheered at once consulted the jewelled watch on her dressing table and rang for the maid 
4018_103416_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Heavens how late it is she exclaimed 
none	none	Run out now dear 
4018_103416_000070_000002	train-clean-100	And Graham tell Buckham to do up a dozen dinner napkins in paper 
4018_103416_000070_000003	train-clean-100	Audrey Valentine has telephoned that she has just got in and finds she hasn t enough 
none	none	If that isn t like her CHAPTER VI Months afterward Clayton Spencer looking back realized that the night of the dinner at the Chris Valentines marked the beginning of a new epoch for him Yet he never quite understood what it was that had caused the change All that was clear was that in retrospect he always commenced with that evening when he was trying to trace his own course through the months that followed with their various changes to the momentous ones of the following Summer Everything pertaining to the dinner save the food stood out with odd distinctness Natalie s silence during the drive broken only by his few questions and her brief replies Had the place looked well Very And was the planting going on all right She supposed so He had hesitated rather discouraged Then I don t want to spoil your pleasure in the place Natalie he had said rather awkwardly After all you will be there more than I shall You d better have it the way you like it She had appeared mollified at that and had relaxed somewhat He fancied that the silence that followed was no longer resentful that she was busily planning But when they had almost reached the house she turned to him Please don t talk war all evening Clay she said I m so ghastly sick of it All right he agreed amiably Of course I can t prevent the others doing it It s generally you who lead up to it Ever since you came back you ve bored everybody to death with it Sorry he said rather stiffly I ll be careful He had a wretched feeling that she was probably right He had come back so full of new impressions that he had probably overflowed with them It was a very formal extremely tall and reticent Clayton Spencer who greeted Audrey that night Afterward he remembered that Audrey was not quite her usual frivolous self that evening But perhaps that was only in retrospect in view of what he learned later She was very daringly dressed as usual wearing a very low gown and a long chain and ear rings of black opals and as usual all the men in the room were grouped around her Thank heaven for one dignified man she exclaimed looking up at him Clayton you do give tone to my parties It was not until they went in to dinner that he missed Chris He heard Audrey giving his excuses He s been called out of town she said Clay you re to have his place And the flowers are low so I can look across and admire you There were a dozen guests and things moved rapidly Audrey s dinners were always hilarious And Audrey herself Clayton perceived from his place of vantage was flirting almost riotously with the man on her left She had two high spots of color in her cheeks and Clayton fancied or was that in retrospect too that her gayety was rather forced Once he caught her eyes and it seemed to him that she was trying to convey something to him And then of course the talk turned to the war and he caught a flash of irritation on Natalie s face Ask the oracle said Audrey s clear voice Ask Clay He knows all there is to know I didn t hear it but I suppose it is when the war will end Amazing perspicacity some one said I can only give you my own opinion Ten years if we don t go in Possibly four if we do There were clamors of dissent None of them can hold out so long If we go in it will end in six months Nonsense The Allies are victorious now I only gave an opinion he protested One man s guess is just as good as another s All I contend is that it is going on to a finish The French and English are not going to stop until they have made the Hun pay in blood for what he has cost them I wish I were a man Audrey said suddenly I don t see how any man with red blood in his veins can sit still and not take a gun and try to stop it Sometimes I think I ll cut off my hair and go over anyhow I ve only got one accomplishment I can shoot I d like to sit in a tree somewhere and pick them off The butchers There was a roar of laughter not so much at the words as at the fierceness with which she delivered them Clayton however felt that she was in earnest and liked her the better for it He surmised indeed that under Audrey s affectations there might be something rather fine if one could get at it She looked around the table coolly appraising every man there Look at us she said Here we sit over fed over dressed Only not over wined because I can t afford it And probably yes I think actually every man at this table is more or less making money out of it all There s Clay making a fortune There s Roddie making money out of Clay Here am I serving Clayton s cigarets I don t know why I pick on you Clay The rest are just as bad You re the most conspicuous that s all Natalie evidently felt that the situation required saving I m sure we all send money over she protested To the Belgians and all that And if they want things we have to sell Oh yes I know all that Audrey broke in rather wearily I know We re the saviors of the Belgians and we ve given a lot of money and shiploads of clothes But we re not stopping the war And it s got to be stopped Clayton watched her Somehow what she had just said seemed to crystallize much that he had been feeling The damnable butchery ought to be stopped Right Audrey he supported her I d give up every prospect I have if the thing could be ended now He meant it then He might not have meant it entirely to morrow or the day after But he meant it then He glanced down the table to find Natalie looking at him with cynical amusement The talk veered then but still focused on the war It became abstract as was so much of the war talk in America in nineteen sixteen Were we after this war was over to continue to use the inventions of science to destroy mankind or for its welfare Would we ever again in wars to come go back to the comparative humanity of the Hague convention Were such wickednesses as the use of poison gas the spreading of disease germs and the killing of non combatants all German precedents to inaugurate a new era of cruelty in warfare Was this the last war Would there ever be a last war Would there not always be outlaw nations as there are outlaw individuals Would there ever be a league of nations to enforce peace From that to Christianity It had failed On the contrary there was a great revival of religious faith Creeds no Belief yes Too many men were dying to permit the growth of any skepticism as to a future life We must have it or go mad In the midst of that discussion Audrey rose Her color had faded and her smile was gone I won t listen any longer she said I m ready to talk about fighting but not about dying Clayton was conscious that he had had in spite of Audrey s speech about the wine rather more to drink than he should have He was not at all drunk but a certain excitement had taken the curb off his tongue After the departure of the women he found himself rather to his own surprise delivering a harangue on the Germans Liars and cheats he said And was conscious of the undivided attention of the men They lied when they signed the Hague Convention they lie when they claim that they wanted peace not war they lie when they claim the mis use by the Allies of the Red Cross they lie to the world and they lie to themselves And their peace offers will be lies Always lies Then conscious that the table was eying him curiously he subsided into silence You re a dangerous person Clay somebody said You re the kind who develops a sort of general hate and will force the President s hand if he can You re too old to go yourself but you re willing to send a million or two boys over there to fight a war that is still none of our business I ve got a son Clayton said sharply And suddenly remembered Natalie He would want to boast she had said that he had a son in the army Good God was he doing it already He subsided into the watchful silence of a man not entirely sure of himself He took no liquor and with his coffee he was entirely himself again But he was having a reaction He felt a sort of contemptuous scorn for the talk at the table The guard down they were either mouthing flamboyant patriotism or attacking the Government It had done too much It had done too little Voices raised faces flushed they wrangled protested accused And the nation he reflected was like that divided apparently hopelessly Was there anything that would unite it as for instance France was united Would even war do it Our problem was much greater more complicated We were of every race And the country was founded and had grown by men who had fled from the quarrels of Europe They had come to find peace Was there any humanitarian principle in the world strong enough to force them to relinquish that peace Clayton found Audrey in the hall as they moved at last toward the drawing room He was the last of the line of men and as he paused before her she touched him lightly on the arm I want to talk to you Clay Unless you re going to play I d rather not unless you need me I don t I m not playing either And I must talk to some one There was something wrong with Audrey Her usual insouciance was gone and her hands nervously fingered the opal beads of her long necklace What I really want to do she added is to scream But don t look like that I shan t do it Suppose we go up to Chris s study She was always a casual hostess Having got her parties together and having fed them well she consistently declined further responsibility She kept open house her side board and her servants at the call of her friends but she was quite capable of withdrawing herself without explanation once things were moving well to be found later by some one who was leaving writing letters fussing with her endless bills or sending a check she could not possibly afford to some one in want whom she happened to have heard about Her popularity was founded on something more substantial than her dinners Clayton was liking Audrey better that night than he had ever liked her though even now he did not entirely approve of her And to the call of any woman in trouble he always responded It occurred to him following her up the stairs that not only was something wrong with Audrey but that it was the first time he had ever known her to show weakness Chris s study was dark She groped her way in and turned on the lamp and then turned and faced him I m in an awful mess Clay she said And the worst of it is I don t know just what sort of a mess it is Are you going to tell me about it Some of it And if I don t start to yelling like a tom cat You re not going to do that Let me get you something He was terrified by her eyes Some aromatic ammonia That was Natalie s cure for everything I m not going to faint I never do Close the door and sit down And then give me a hundred dollars if you have it Will you Is that enough he asked And drew out his black silk evening wallet with its monogram in seed pearls He laid the money on her knee for she made no move to take it She sat back her face colorless and surveyed him intently What a comfort you are Clay she said Not a word in question Just like that Yet you know I don t borrow money usually The only thing that is important is that I have the money with me Are you sure it s enough Plenty I ll send it back in a week or so I m selling this house It s practically sold I don t know why anybody wants it It s a poky little place But well it doesn t matter about the house I called up some people to day who have been wanting one in this neighborhood and I m practically sure they ll take it But you and Chris We have separated Clay At least Chris has gone There s a long story behind it I m not up to telling it to night And this money will end part of it That s all I m going to tell about the money It s a small sum isn t it to break up a family Why it s absurd It s it s horrible Audrey Oh it isn t the money That s a trifle I just had to have it quickly And when I learned I needed it of course the banks were closed Besides I fancy Chris had to have all there was Clayton was puzzled and distressed He had not liked Chris He had hated his cynicism his pose of indifference His very fastidiousness had never seemed entirely genuine And this going away and taking all Audrey s small reserve of money Where is he I don t know I believe on his way to Canada Do you mean Oh no he didn t steal anything He s going to enlist in the Canadian army Or he said so when he left Look here Audrey you can t tell me only part of the story Do you mean to say that Chris has had a magnificent impulse and gone to fight Or that he s running away from something Both said Audrey I ll tell you this much Clay Chris has got himself into a scrape I won t tell you about that because after all that s his story And I m not asking for sympathy If you dare to pity me I ll cry and I ll never forgive you Why didn t he stay and face it like a man Not leave you to face it Because the only person it greatly concerned was myself He didn t want to face me The thing that is driving me almost mad is that he may be killed over there Not because I love him so much I think you know how things have been But because he went to well I think to reinstate himself in my esteem to show me he s a man after all Good heavens Audrey And you went through dinner with all this to bear I ve got to carry it right along haven t I You know how I ve been about this war Clay I ve talked and talked about wondering how our men could stay out of it So when the smash came he just said he was going He would show me there was some good stuff in him still You see I ve really driven him to it and if he s killed A surge of resentment against the absent man rose in Clayton Spencer s mind How like the cynicism of Chris s whole attitude that he should thrust the responsibility for his going onto Audrey He had made her unhappy while he was with her and now his death if it occurred would be a horror to her I don t know why I burden you with all this she said rather impatiently I daresay it is because I knew you d have the money No I don t mean that I d rather go to you in trouble than to any one else that s why I hope you always will Oh I shall Don t worry But her attempt at gayety fell flat She lighted a cigaret from the stand beside her and fell to studying his face What s happened to you she asked There s a change in you somehow I ve noticed it ever since you came home You ought to be smug and contented if any man should But you re not are you I m working hard That s all I don t want to talk about myself he added impatiently What about you What are you going to do Sell my house pay my debts and live on my own little bit of an income But good heavens Audrey Chris has no right to cut off like this and leave you I don t know the story but at least he must support you A man can t just run away and evade every obligation I think I ll have to go after him and give him a talking to No she said bending forward Don t do that He has had a bad scare But he s had one decent impulse too Let him alone Clay She placed the money on the stand and rose As she faced him she impulsively placed her hands on his shoulders I wish I could tell you Clay she said in her low slightly husky voice how very very much I admire you You re pretty much of a man you know And there aren t such a lot of them For an uneasy moment he thought she was going to kiss him But she let her hands fall and smiling faintly led the way downstairs Once down however she voiced the under lying thought in her mind If he comes out Clay he ll never forgive me probably And if he is if he doesn t I ll never forgive myself So I m damned either way But ten minutes later with a man on either side of her she was sitting at the piano with a cigaret tucked behind her ear looking distractingly pretty and very gay and singing a slightly indecorous but very witty little French song Clayton Spencer cutting in on the second rubber wondered which of the many he knew was the real Audrey He wondered if Chris had not married for instance the girl at the piano only to find she was the woman upstairs And he wondered too if that were true why he should have had to clear out So many men married the sort Audrey had been in Chris s little study only to find that after all the thing they had thought they were getting was a pose and it was the girl at the piano after all He missed her somewhat later She was gone a full half hour and he fancied her absence had something to do with the money she had borrowed CHAPTER VII Two things helped greatly to restore Clayton to a more normal state of mind during the next few days One of them undoubtedly was the Valentine situation Beside Audrey s predicament and Chris s wretched endeavor to get away and yet prove himself a man his own position seemed if not comfortable at least tenable He would have described it had he been a man to put such a thing into words as that he and Natalie didn t exactly hit it off There were times too during those next few days when he wondered if he had not exaggerated their incompatibility Natalie was unusually pleasant She spent some evening hours on the arm of his big chair talking endlessly about the Linndale house and he would lean back smiling and pretend to a mad interest in black and white tiles and loggias He made no further protest as to the expense Tell me he said once what does a fellow wear in this er Italian palace If you have any intention of draping me in a toga and putting vine leaves in my hair or whatever those wreaths were made of Natalie had no sense of humor however She saw that he meant to be amusing and she gave the little fleeting smile one gives to a child who is being rather silly Of course he went on we ll have Roman baths and be anointed with oil afterwards by lady Greek slaves Perfumed oil Don t be vulgar Clay And he saw she was really offended While there was actually no change in their relationship which remained as it had been for a dozen years their surface life was pleasanter And even that small improvement cheered him greatly He was thankful for such a peace even when he knew that he had bought it at a heavy price The other was his work The directorate for the new munition plant had been selected and on Thursday of that week he gave a dinner at his club to the directors It had been gratifying to him to find how easily his past reputation carried the matter of the vast credits needed how absolutely his new board deferred to his judgment The dinner became in a way an ovation He was vastly pleased and a little humbled He wanted terribly to make good to justify their faith in him They were the big financial men of his time and they were agreeing to back his judgment to the fullest extent When the dinner was over a few of the younger men were in no mood to go home They had dined and wined and the night was young Denis Nolan who had been present as the attorney for the new concern leaned back in his chair and listened to them with a sort of tolerant cynicism Oh go home you fellows he said at last You make me sick Enough s enough Why the devil does every dinner like this have to end in a debauch In the end however both he and Clayton went along Clayton at least frankly anxious to keep an eye on one or two of them until they started home He had the usual standards of course except for himself A man s private life so long as he was not a bounder concerned him not at all But this had been his dinner He meant to see it through Once or twice he had seen real tragedy come to men as a result of the recklessness of long dinners many toasts and the instinct to go on and make a night of it Afterward they went to a midnight roof garden and at first it was rather dreary Their youth was only comparative after all and the eyes of the girls who danced and sang passed over them to rest on boys in their twenties Nolan chuckled Pathetic he said The saddest sight in the world Every one of you here would at this moment give up everything he s got to be under thirty Oh shut up some one said almost savagely Of course there are compensations he drawled At twenty you want to take the entire bunch home and keep em At thirty you know you can t but you still want to At forty and over you don t want them at all but you think it s damned curious they don t want you Clayton had watched the scene with a rather weary interest He was indeed trying to put himself in Graham s place at Graham s age He remembered once at twenty having slipped off to see The Black Crook then the epitome of wickedness and the disillusionment of seeing women in tights with their accentuated curves and hideous lack of appeal to the imagination The caterers of such wares had learned since then Here were soft draperies instead laces and chiffons The suggestion was not to the eyes but to the mind How devilishly clever it all was Perhaps there were some things he ought to discuss with Graham He wondered how a man led up to such a thing Nolan bent toward him I ve been watching for a girl he said but I don t see her Last time I was here I came with Chris She was his girl Chris Yes It stumped me at first She came and sat with us not a bad little thing but Good Lord Clay ignorant and not even pretty And Chris was fastidious in a way I don t understand it The ancient perplexity of a man over the sex selections of his friends puckered his forehead Damned if I understand it he repeated A great wave of pity for Audrey Valentine surged in Clayton Spencer s heart She had known it of course that was why Chris had gone away How long had she known it She was protecting Chris s name even now For all her frivolity there was something rather big in Audrey The way she had held up at her dinner for instance and he rather fancied that the idea of his going into the army had come from her directly or indirectly So Chris from being a fugitive was already by way of being a hero to his friends Poor Audrey He made a mental note to send her some flowers in the morning He ordered them on his way down town and for some curious reason she was in his mind most of the day Chris had been a fool to throw away a thing so worth having Not every man had behind him a woman of Audrey s sort CHAPTER VIII That afternoon accompanied by a rather boyishly excited elderly clergyman he took two hours off from the mill and purchased a new car for Doctor Haverford The rector was divided between pleasure at the gift and apprehension at its cost but Clayton having determined to do a thing always did it well Nonsense he said My dear man the church has owed you this car for at least ten years If you get half the pleasure out of using it that I m having in presenting it to you it will be well worth while I only wish you d let me endow the thing It s likely to cost you a small fortune Doctor Haverford insisted that he could manage that He stood off surveying with pride not unmixed with fear its bright enamel its leather linings the complicated system of dials and bright levers which filled him with apprehension Delight says I must not drive it he said She is sure I would go too fast and run into things She is going to drive for me How is Delight I wish you could see her Clayton She well all young girls are lovely but sometimes I think Delight is lovelier than most She is much older than I am in many ways She looks after me like a mother But she has humor too She has been drawing the most outrageous pictures of me arrested for speeding and she has warned me most gravely against visiting road houses But Delight will have to be taught if she is to run the car The salesman says they will send some one They give one lesson I believe That s not enough I think Graham could show her some things He drives well Flying uptown a little later in Clayton s handsome car the rector dreamed certain dreams First his mind went to his parish visiting list so endless so never cleaned up and now about to be made a pleasure instead of a penance And into his mind so strangely compounded of worldliness and spirituality came a further dream of Delight and Graham Spencer of ease at last for the girl after the struggle to keep up appearances of a clergyman s family in a wealthy parish Money had gradually assumed an undue importance in his mind Every Sunday every service he dealt in money He reminded his people of the church debt He begged for various charities He tried hard to believe that the money that came in was given to the Lord but he knew perfectly well that it went to the janitor and the plumber and the organist He watched the offertory after the sermon and only too often as he stood waiting before raising it before the altar he wondered if the people felt that they had received their money s worth He had started life with a dream of service but although his own sturdy faith persisted he had learned the cost of religion in dollars and cents So going up town he wondered if Clayton would increase his church subscription now that things were well with him After all he reflected war is not an unmixed evil and outlined a sermon to be called the Gains of War and subsequently reprinted in pamphlet form and sold for the benefit of the new altar fund He instructed Jackson to drive to the parish house instead of to the rectory so that he might jot down the headings while they were in his mind They ran like this Spiritual growth the nobility of sacrifice the pursuit of an ideal the doctrine of thy brother s keeper He stopped to speak to Jackson from the pavement I daresay we shall be in frequent difficulties with that new car of ours Jackson he said genially I may have to ask you to come round and explain some of its mysterious interior to me Jackson touched his cap Thank you sir I ll be glad to come But I am leaving mister Spencer soon Leaving Going back to the army sir In the back of his mind the rector had been depending on Jackson and he felt vaguely irritated I m sorry to hear it I d been counting on you Very sorry sir I m not leaving immediately I sometimes think observed the rector still ruffled that a man s duty is not always what it appears on the surface To keep mister Spencer er comfortable while he is doing his magnificent work for the Allies may be less spectacular but it is most important Jackson smiled a restrained and slightly cynical smile That s a matter for a man s conscience isn t it sir he asked And touching his cap again moved off Doctor Haverford felt reproved Worse than that he felt justly reproved He did not touch the Gains of War that afternoon In the gymnasium he found Delight captaining a basket ball team In her knickers and middy blouse she looked like a little girl and he stood watching her as flushed and excited she ran round the long room At last she came over and dropped onto the steps at his feet Well she inquired looking up Did you get it I did indeed A beauty Delight A flivver Not at all A very handsome car He told her the make and she flushed again with pleasure Joy and rapture she said Did you warn him I am to drive it I did He suggests that Graham give you some lessons Graham Why not He ll be bored to insanity That s all You you didn t suggest it did you daddy With all her adoration of her father Delight had long recognized under his real spirituality a certain quality of worldly calculation That where it concerned her it was prompted only by love did not make her acceptance of it easier Certainly not said the rector stiffly Graham s changed you know He used to be a nice little kid But he s I don t know what it is Spoiled I suppose He ll steady down Delight She looked up at him with clear slightly humorous eyes Don t get any queer ideas about Graham Spencer and me Daddy she said In the first place I intend to choose my own husband He s to look as much as possible like you but a trifle less nose And in the second place after I ve backed the car into a telegraph pole and turned it over in a ditch Graham Spencer is just naturally going to know I am no woman to tie to She got up and smiled at him Anyhow I wouldn t trust him with the communion service she added and walking out onto the floor blew shrilly on her whistle The rector watched her with growing indignation These snap judgments of youth The easy damning of the young They left no room for argument They condemned and walked away leaving careful plans in ruin behind them And Delight having gone so far went further She announced that evening at dinner that she would under no circumstances be instructed by Graham Spencer Her mother ventured good humored remonstrance The way to learn to drive a car said Delight is to get into it and press a few things and when it starts keep on going You ve got to work it out for yourself And when Clayton calling up with his usual thoughtfulness that evening offered Graham as instructor she refused gratefully but firmly You re a dear to think of it she said and you re a dear to have given Daddy the car But I m just naturally going to fight it out in my own way if it takes all winter Natalie gathering her refusal from Clayton s protest had heaved a sigh of relief Not that she objected to Delight Haverford She liked her as much as she liked and understood any young girl which was very little But she did not want Graham to marry To marry would be to lose him And again watching Clayton s handsome head above his newspaper she reflected that Graham was all she had Nevertheless Delight received a lesson in driving from Graham and that within two days On Saturday afternoon finding the mill getting on his nerves Clayton suggested to Graham what might be the last golf of the autumn and Graham consented cheerfully enough For one thing the offices closed at noon and Anna Klein had gone He was playing a little game with Anna a light hearted matter of a glance now and then caught and held a touched hand very casually done and an admiring comment now and then on her work And Anna was blossoming like a flower She sat up late to make fresh white blouses for the office and rose early to have abundance of time to dress She had taken to using a touch of rouge too although she put it on after she reached the mill and took it off before she started for home Her father sullen and irritable these days would have probably beaten her for using it But Anna had gone and a telephone call to Marion Hayden had told him she was not at home He thought it possible she had gone to the country club and accepted his father s suggestion of golf willingly From the moment he left the mill Anna had left his mind He was at that period when always in the back of his mind there was a girl During the mill hours the girl was Anna because she was there In the afternoon it was Marion just then but even at that there were entire evenings when at the theater a pretty girl in the chorus held and absorbed his entire attention or at a dance a debutante cloudy and mysterious in white chiffon bounded his universe for a few hours On this foundation of girl he built the superstructure of his days Not evil but wholly irresponsible The urge of vital youth had caught him and held him And Clayton sitting that day beside him in the car while Graham drove and the golf clubs rattled in their bags at his feet remembered again the impulses of his own adolescence and wondered There had been a time when he would have gone to the boy frankly with the anxieties he was beginning to feel There were so many things he wanted to tell the boy So many warnings he should have But Natalie had stolen him That was what it amounted to She had stolen his confidence as only a selfish woman could And against that cabal of mother and son he felt helpless It was even more than that As against Natalie s indulgence he did not wish to pose as a mentor pointing out always the way of duty How old are you Graham he said suddenly Twenty two Graham glanced at him curiously His father knew his age of course I was married at your age Tough luck said Graham And then I m sorry father I didn t mean that But it s pretty early isn t it No time for a good time or anything I fancy Nature meant men to marry young don t you It saves a lot of complications The girl a fellow marries at that age isn t often the one he d marry at thirty said Graham And feeling that he had said the wrong thing changed the subject quickly Clayton did not try to turn it back into its former channel The boy was uncomfortable unresponsive There was a barrier between them of self consciousness on his part of evasion and discomfort on Graham s On the way over they had sighted Delight in the new car She had tried to turn had backed into a ditch and was at that moment ruefully surveying a machine which had apparently sat down on its rear wheels with its engine pointed pathetically skyward Delight s face fell when she recognized them Of course it would have to be you she said Of all the people who might have seen my shame I m going on with you I never want to see the old thing again Anything smashed Graham inquired It looks smashed I can t tell It was not until the car was out of the ditch and Clayton had driven off in Graham s car toward the club that Delight remembered her father s voice the day he had told her Graham would teach her to drive She stiffened and he was quick to see the change in her manner The total damage was one flat tire and while the engine was inflating it he looked at her She had grown to be quite pretty His eyes approved her Better let me come round and give you a few lessons Delight I d rather learn by myself if you don t mind You ll have a real smash unless you learn properly But she remained rather obstinately silent What s the matter with me Delight You re not exactly crazy about me are you That s silly I don t know anything about you any more That s your fault You know I ve been away for four years and since I came back I haven t seen much of you But if you ll let me come round You can come if you like You ll be bored probably You re being awfully nasty you know Here I come to pull you out of a ditch and generally rescue you and Come now Delight what is it There s something We used to be pals I don t know Graham she said truthfully I only know well I hear things of course Nothing very bad Just little things I wish you wouldn t insist It s idiotic What does it matter what I think Graham flushed He knew well enough one thing she had heard Her father and mother had been at dinner the other night and he had had too much to drink Sorry He stopped the pump and put away the tools all in silence Good heavens was all the world divided into two sorts of people the knockers and under that heading he placed his father Delight and all those who occasionally disapproved of him and the decent sort who liked a fellow and understood him But his training had been too good to permit him to show his angry scorn He made an effort and summoned a smile All ready he said And since you won t let me teach you perhaps I d better take you home You were going to the club Oh that s all right Father s probably found some one But she insisted that he drive them both to the club and turn the car round there Then with a grinding of gear levers that made him groan she was off toward home leaving Graham staring after her Well can you beat it he inquired of the empty air Can you beat it And wounded in all the pride of new manhood he joined Marion and her rather riotous crowd around the fire inside the clubhouse Clayton had given him up and was going around alone followed by a small caddie The links were empty and the caddie lonely He ventured small bits of conversation now and then looking up with admiration at Clayton s tall figure And after a little Clayton took the bag from him and used him only for retrieving balls The boy played round whistling Kinda quiet to day ain t it he offered trudging a foot or two behind It is rather young man Mostly on Saturdays I caddie for mister Valentine But he s gone to the war Oh he has has he Clayton built a small tee and placed his ball on it Well maybe we ll all be going some day He drove off and started after the ball It was not until he was on the green that he was conscious of the boy beside him again How old d you have to be to get into the army mister Spencer inquired the caddie anxiously Clayton looked at him quizzically Want to try for it do you Well I m afraid you ll have to wait a bit I m older than I look mister Spencer How old are you Sixteen Afraid you ll have to wait a while said Clayton and achieved a well nigh perfect long putt I d just like to get a whack at them Germans offered the boy and getting no response trudged along again at his heels Suddenly it struck Clayton as rather strange that in all the time since his return from Europe only four people had shown any but a sort of academic interest in the war and that ironically enough a German had been the first to make a sacrifice for principle Chris had gone to get out of trouble The little caddie wanted to go to get a whack at the madmen of Europe And Jackson the chauffeur was going giving up his excellent wages to accept the thirty odd dollars a month of a non com from a pure sense of responsibility But among the men he knew best in business and in the clubs the war still remained a magnificent spectacle A daily newspaper drama Suddenly Clayton saw Audrey Valentine She was swinging toward him her bag with its clubs slung over her shoulder her hands in the pockets of an orange colored sweater In her black velvet tam and short skirt she had looked like a little girl and at first he did not recognize her She had seen him however and swung toward him Hello Clay she called when they were within hailing distance Bully shot that last Where s your caddie I didn t want one I had a feeling that if I took one and he lost a ball in these impecunious times of mine I d murder him Saw you at the fifth hole I d know your silhouette anywhere Under her rakish cap her eyes were rather defiant She did not want pity she almost dared him to pity her Come round again with me Audrey won t you I m off my game to day I ll wander along if you don t mind I ll probably sneeze or something when you re driving of course Nothing he said gravely approaching his ball so adds distance to my drive as a good explosive sneeze just behind it They talked very little Audrey whistled as she walked along with the free swinging step that was characteristic of her and Clayton was satisfied merely to have her companionship She was not like some women a man didn t have to be paying her compliments or making love to her She even made no comments on his shots and after a time that rather annoyed him Well he demanded after an excellent putt Was that good or wasn t it Very good she said gravely I am only surprised when you do a thing badly Not when you do it well He thought that over Have you anything in mind that I do badly I mean particularly in mind Not very much But after a moment Why don t you make Natalie play golf She hates it He rather wondered if she thought Natalie was one of the things he managed badly The sense of companionship warmed him Although neither of them realized it their mutual loneliness and dissatisfaction had brought them together and mentally at least they were clinging each desperately to the other But their talk was disjointed I ll return that hundred soon I ve sold the house I wish you wouldn t worry about it It s ridiculous Audrey And a hundred yards or so further on They wouldn t have Chris in Canada His heart He s going into the French Ambulance service Good for Chris But she came out very frankly when they started back to the clubhouse It s done me a lot of good meeting you Clay There s something so big and solid and dependable about you I wonder I suppose you don t mind my using you as a sort of anchor to windward Good heavens Audrey If I could only do something You don t have to do a thing She smiled up at him and her old audacity was quite gone You ve just got to be And you don t have to send me flowers you know I mean I understand that you re sorry for me without that You re the only person in the world I d allow to be sorry for me He was touched There was no coquetry in her manner She paid her little tribute quite sincerely and frankly I ve been taking stock to day she went on and I put you among my assets One reliable gentleman six feet tall weight about a hundred and seventy in good condition Heavens what a lot of liabilities you had to off set He stopped and looked down at her Audrey dear he said what am I to say to all that What can I do How can I help You might tell me No that s silly What is silly But she did not answer She called Joey and gave him her clubs Joey wants to be a soldier she observed So he says I want to be a soldier too Clay A good soldier He suspected that she was rather close to unusual tears As they approached the clubhouse they saw Graham and Marion Hayden standing outside Graham was absently dropping balls and swinging at them It was too late when Clayton saw the danger and shouted sharply A ball caught the caddie on the side of the head and he dropped like a shot All through that night Clayton and Audrey Valentine sat by the boy s white bed in the hospital Clayton knew Graham was waiting outside but he did not go out to speak to him He was afraid of himself afraid in his anger that he would widen the breach between them Early in the evening Natalie had come in a great evening coat that looked queerly out of place but she had come he knew not through sympathy for the thin little figure on the bed but as he had known she would come to plead for Graham And her cry of joy when the surgeons had said the boy would live was again for Graham She had been too engrossed to comment on Audrey s presence there and Audrey had gone out immediately and left them together Clayton was forced that night to an unwilling comparison of Natalie with another woman On the surface of their lives where only they met Natalie had always borne comparison well But here was a new standard to measure by and another woman a woman with hands to serve and watchful intelligent eyes outmeasured her Not that Clayton knew all this He felt in a vague way that Natalie was out of place there and he felt even more strongly that she had not the faintest interest in the still figure on its white bed save as it touched Graham and herself He was resentful too that she felt it necessary to plead with him for his own boy Good God if she felt that way about him no wonder Graham She had placed a hand on Clayton s arm as he sat in that endless vigil and bent down to whisper although no sound would have penetrated that death like stupor It was an accident Clay she pled You know Graham s the kindest soul in the world You know that Clay He had been drinking His voice sounded cold and strained to his own ears Not much Almost nothing Toots says positively Then I d rather he had been Natalie If he drove that ball out of wanton indifference He didn t see the boy He should have looked In her anger she ceased her sibilant whispering and stood erect I told him you d be hard she said He s outside half sick with fright because he is afraid Afraid of you she added and went out her silks rustling in the quiet corridor She had gone away soon after that the nurse informed him And toward dawn Clayton left Audrey in the sick room and found Graham He was asleep in a chair in the waiting room and looked boyish and very tired Clayton s heart contracted He went back to his vigil and let Graham sleep on Some time later he roused from a doze in his chair Graham was across the bed from him looking down Audrey was gone And the injured boy stirred and opened his eyes H hello Joey said Graham with a catch in his voice Joey lay still his eyes taking in his new surroundings Then he put out a hand and touched the bandage on his head What I got on he demanded faintly Graham caught his father s eyes across the bed and smiled a shaky tremulous smile I guess he s all right Father he said And suddenly crumpled up beside the bed and fell into a paroxysm of silent sobbing With his arm around the boy s shoulders Clayton felt in that gray dawn the greatest thankfulness of his life Joey would live That cup was taken from his boy s lips And he and Graham were together again close together The boy s grip on his hand was tight Please God they would always be together from now on CHAPTER IX Clayton did not care to tell Natalie of Chris s flight She would learn it soon enough he knew and he felt unwilling to discuss the affair as Natalie would want to discuss it Not that he cared about Chris but he had begun to feel a protective interest in Audrey Valentine an interest that had in it a curious aversion to hearing her name in connection with Chris s sordid story He and Natalie met rarely in the next few days He dined frequently at his club with men connected in various ways with the new enterprise and transacted an enormous amount of business over the dinner or luncheon table Natalie s door was always closed on those occasions when he returned and he felt that with the stubbornness characteristic of her she was still harboring resentment against him for what he had said at the hospital He knew she was spending most of her days at Linndale and he had a vague idea that she and Rodney together had been elaborating still further on the plans for the house It was the furtiveness of it rather than the fact itself that troubled him He was open and straightforward himself Why couldn t Natalie be frank with him It was missus Haverford punctually paying her dinner call in an age which exacts dinner calls no longer even from its bachelors who brought Natalie the news of Chris s going Natalie who went down to see her with a mental protest found her at a drawing room window making violent signals at somebody without and was unable to conceal her amazement It s Delight explained missus Haverford She s driving me round She won t come in and she s forgotten her fur coat And it s simply bitter outside Well my dear how are you Natalie was well and said so She was conscious that missus Haverford was listening with only half an ear and indeed a moment later she had risen again and hurried to the window Natalie she cried Do come and watch She s turning the car We do think she drives wonderfully Only a few days too Why won t she come in I m sure I don t know Unless she is afraid Graham may be here What in the world has Graham got to do with it Natalie s voice was faintly scornful I was going to ask you that Natalie Have they quarreled or anything I don t think they meet at all do they They met once since Clayton gave Doctor Haverford the car Graham helped her when she had got into a ditch I believe And I thought perhaps they had quarreled about something That would imply a degree of intimacy that hardly exists does it Natalie said sharply But missus Haverford had not fought the verbal battles of the parish for twenty years in vain It was the day of that unfortunate incident at the country club Natalie Natalie colored Accident rather than incident How is the poor child He is quite well again Natalie said impatiently I can not understand the amount of fuss every one makes over the boy He ran in front of where Graham was driving and got what he probably deserved I understand Clayton has given him a position He has made him an office boy How like dear Clayton breathed missus Haverford and counted the honors as hers But she had not come to quarrel She had had indeed a frankly benevolent purpose in coming and she proceeded to carry it out at once I do think my dear she said that some one ought to tell Audrey Valentine the stories that are going about What has she been doing Natalie asked with her cool smile There is always some story about Audrey isn t there Do you mean to say you haven t heard I don t hear much gossip missus Haverford let that pass You know how rabid she has been about the war Well the story is she went on with a certain unction that she has driven Chris to enlisting in the Foreign Legion or something Anyhow he sailed from Halifax last week Natalie straightened in her chair Are you certain It s town talk my dear Doctor Haverford spoke to Clayton about it some days ago He rather gathered Clayton already knew That too was like dear Clayton Natalie reflected bitterly He had told her nothing In her heart she added secretiveness to the long list of Clayton s deficiencies toward her Personally I imagine they were heavily in debt missus Haverford went on They had been living beyond their means of course I like missus Valentine but I do think to drive a man to his death or what may be his death I don t believe it I don t believe he went to fight anyway He was probably in some sort of a scrape She has sold her house Natalie s impulse of sympathy toward Audrey was drowned in her rising indignation That all this could happen and Audrey not let her know was incredible I haven t seen her recently she said coldly Nobody has I do think she might have seen her clergyman There is a time when only the church can give us the comfort we need my dear And whatever missus Haverford s faults she meant that quite simply And you say Clay knew It s rather likely he would They were golfing together weren t they when that caddie was hurt Natalie was not a jealous woman She had for years taken Clay s faithfulness for granted and her own complacency admitted no chance of such a possibility But she was quick to realize that she had him at a disadvantage How long have you known it she asked him that night when after the long dinner was over she sat with her elbows on the table and faced him across the candles He was tired and depressed and his fine face looked drawn But he roused and smiled across at her He had begun to have a feeling that he must make up to Natalie for something he hardly knew for what Known what dear About Chris and Audrey He was fundamentally honest so he answered her directly Since the day Chris left When was that The day we dined there And Audrey told you She had to in a way I m sure she ll tell you herself She s been rather hiding away I imagine Why did she have to tell you If you want the exact truth she borrowed a small sum from me as the banks were closed naturally There was some emergency I don t know what She borrowed from you A very small amount my dear Don t look like that Natalie She knew I generally carried money with me Oh I m not jealous Audrey probably thinks of you as a sort of grandfather anyhow It s not that It is your keeping the thing from me It was not my secret But Natalie was jealous She had that curious jealousy of her friends which some women are cursed with of being first in their regard and their confidence A slow and smoldering anger against Audrey which had nothing whatever to do with Clayton darkened her eyes I m through with Audrey That s all she said And the man across regarded her with a sort of puzzled wonder Her indignation against Clayton took the form of calculation and she was quick to pursue her advantage In the library she produced the new and enlarged plans for the house Roddie says he has tried to call you at the mill but you are always out of your office So he sent these around to day True to the resolution he had made that night in the hospital he went over them carefully And even their magnitude while it alarmed him brought no protest from him After all the mill and the new plant were his toys to play with He found there something to fill up the emptiness of his life If a great house was Natalie s ambition if it gave her pleasure and something to live for she ought to have it She had prepared herself for a protest but he made none even when the rather startling estimate was placed before him I just want you to be happy my dear he said But I hope you ll arrange not to run over the estimate It is being pretty expensive as it is But after all success doesn t mean anything unless we are going to get something out of it They were closer together that evening than they had been for months And at last he fell to talking about the mill Natalie curled up on the chaise longue in her boudoir listened attentively but with small comprehension as he poured out his dream for himself now for Graham later A few years more and he would retire Graham could take hold then He might even go into politics He would be fifty then and a man of fifty should be in his prime And to retire and do nothing was impossible A fellow went to seed Eyes on the wood fire he talked on until at last roused by Natalie s silence he glanced up She was sound asleep Some time later in his dressing gown and slippers he came and roused her She smiled up at him like a drowsy child Awfully tired she said Is Graham in Not yet She held up her hands and he drew her to her feet You ve been awfully dear about the house she said And standing on tiptoe she kissed him on the cheek Still holding both her hands he looked down at her gravely Do you really think that Natalie Of course Then will you do something in return Her eyes became shrewd watchful Anything in reason Don t don t dear make Graham afraid of me As if I did If he is afraid of you it is your own fault Perhaps it is But I try good God Natalie I do try He needs a curb now and then All boys do But if we could only agree on it don t you see how it is now he asked trying to reason gently with her All the discipline comes from me all the indulgence from you And I don t want to lose my boy my dear She freed her hands So we couldn t even have one happy evening she said I won t quarrel with you Clay And I won t be tragic over Graham If you ll just be human to him he ll come out all right She went into her bedroom the heavy lace of her negligee trailing behind her and closed the door Clayton had a visitor the next morning at the mill a man named Dunbar who marked on his visitors slip under the heading of his business with the head of the concern the words Private and confidential Clayton looking up saw a small man in a suit too large for him and with ears that projected wide on either side of a shrewd rather humorous face mister Spencer Yes Sit down please Even through the closed window the noise of the mill penetrated The yard engine whistled shrilly The clatter of motor trucks the far away roar of the furnaces the immediate vicinity of many typewriters made a very bedlam of sound mister Dunbar drew his chair closer and laid a card on the desk My credentials he explained Clayton read the card Very well mister Dunbar What can I do for you Dunbar fixed him with shrewd light eyes and bent forward Have you had any trouble in your mill mister Spencer None whatever Are you taking any measures to prevent trouble I had expected to Not that I fear anything but of course no one can tell We have barely commenced to get lined up for our new work May I ask the nature of the precautions Clayton told him with an uneasy feeling that mister Dunbar was finding them childish and inefficient Exactly said his visitor And well enough as far as they go They don t go far enough The trouble with you manufacturers is that you only recognize one sort of trouble and that s a strike I suppose you know that the Kaiser has said if we enter the war that he need not send an army here at all That his army is here already armed and equipped Bravado said Clayton I wonder mister Dunbar reached into his breast pocket and produced a long typed memorandum You might just glance at that Clayton read it carefully It was a list of fires mostly in granaries and warehouses and the total loss was appalling All German work said his visitor Arson for the Fatherland All supplies for the Allies you see I ve got other similar lists here all German deviltry And they re only commencing If we go into the war The immediate result of the visit was that Clayton became a member of a protective league which undertook with his cooperation to police and guard the mill But mister Dunbar s last words left him thinking profoundly We re going to be in it that s sure And soon And Germany s army is here It s not only Germans either It s the I W W for one thing We ve got a list through the British post office censor of a lot of those fellows who are taking German money to day They re against everything Not only work They re against law and order And they re likely to raise hell He rose to leave How do your Germans like making shells for the Allies he asked We haven t a great many We ve had no trouble One man resigned a boss roller That s all Watch him He s got a grievance He s been here a long time I haven t an idea he d do us any harm It was a matter of principle with him Oh it s a matter of principle with all of them They can justify themselves seven ways to the ace Keep an eye on him or let us do it for you Clayton sat for some time after Dunbar had gone Was it possible that Klein or men like Klein old employees and faithful for years could be reached by the insidious wickedness of Germany It was incredible But then the whole situation was incredible that a peaceful and home loving people to all appearances should suddenly shed the sheep skin of years of dissimulation and appear as the wolves of the world One of his men had died on the Lusitania a quiet little chap with a family in the suburbs and a mania for raising dahlias He had been in the habit of bringing in his best specimens and putting them in water on Clayton s desk His pressed glass vase was still there empty Then his mind went back to Herman Klein He had a daughter in the mill She was earning the livelihood for the family now temporarily And the Germans were thrifty If for no other reason he thought Klein would not imperil either his daughter s safety or her salary There was a good bit of talk about German hate but surely there was no hate in Klein Something else Dunbar had said stuck in his mind We ve got to get wise and soon It s too big a job for the regular departments to handle Every city in the country and every town ought to have a civilian organization to watch and to fight it if it has to They re hiding among us everywhere and every citizen has got to be a sleuth if we re to counter their moves Every man his own detective He had smiled as he said it but Clayton had surmised a great earnestness and considerable knowledge behind the smile CHAPTER X Delight Haverford was to come out in December but there were times when the Doctor wondered if she was really as keen about it as she pretended to be He found her once or twice her usually active hands idle in her lap and a pensive droop to her humorous young mouth Tired honey he asked on one of those occasions No Just talking to myself Say a few nice things for me while you re about it then Nice things I don t deserve them What awful crime have you been committing Break it to me gently You know my weak heart Your tobacco heart she said severely Well I ve been committing a mental murder if you want to know the facts Don t protest It s done She s quite dead already Good gracious And I have reared this young viper Who is she I don t intend to make you an accessory daddy But behind her smile he felt a real hurt He would have given a great deal to have taken her in his arms and tried to coax out her trouble so he might comfort her But that essential fineness in him which his worldliness only covered like a veneer told him not to force her confidence Only he wandered off rather disconsolately to hunt his pipe and to try to realize that Delight was now a woman grown and liable to woman s heart aches What do you think it is he asked that night when after her nightly custom missus Haverford had reached over from the bed beside his and with a single competent gesture had taken away his book and switched off his reading lamp and he had with the courage of darkness voiced a certain uneasiness Who do you think it is you mean Very well only the word is whom missus Haverford ignored this It s that Hayden girl she said Toots And Graham Spencer Do you think that Delight She always has For years Which was apparently quite clear to them both If it had only been a nice girl missus Haverford protested plaintively But Toots She s fast I m sure of it My dear And that boy needs a decent girl if anybody ever did A shallow mother and a money making father all Toots Hay den wants is his money She s ages older than he is I hear he is there every day and all of Sundays The rector had precisely as much guile as a turtle dove and long after missus Haverford gave unmistakable evidences of slumber he lay with his arms above his head and plotted He had no conscience whatever about it He threw his scruples to the wind and if it is possible to follow the twists of a theological mind turned from the straight and narrow way into the maze of conspiracy his thoughts ran something like this She is Delight Therefore to see her is to love her To see her with any other girl is to see her infinite superiority and charm Therefore Therefore on the following Sunday afternoon the totally unsuspecting daughter of a good man gone wrong took a note from the rector to the Hayden house about something or other of no importance and was instructed to wait for an answer And the rector vastly uneasy and rather pleased with himself took refuge in the parish house and waited ten eternities or one hour by the clock Delight herself was totally unsuspicious The rectory on a Sunday afternoon was very quiet and she was glad to get away She drove over and being in no hurry she went by the Spencer house She did that now and then making various excuses to herself such as liking the policeman at the corner or wanting to see the river from the end of the street But all she saw that day was Rodney Page going in in a top hat and very bright gloves Precious said Delight to herself Her bump of reverence was very small But she felt a little thrill as she always did when she passed the house Since she could remember she had cared for Graham She did not actually know that she loved him She told herself bravely that she was awfully fond of him and that it was silly because he never would amount to anything But she had a little argument of her own for such occasions which said that being really fond of any one meant knowing all about them and liking them anyhow She stopped the car at the Hayden house and carried her note to the door When she went in however she was instantly uncomfortable The place reeked with smoke and undeniably there was dancing going on somewhere A phonograph was scraping noisily Delight s small nose lifted a little What a deadly place Coming in from the fresh outdoors the noise and smoke and bar room reek stifled her Then a door opened and Marion Hayden was drawing her into a room How providential Delight she said You ll take my hand won t you It s Graham s dummy and we want to dance The two connecting rooms were full of people and the air was heavy Through the haze she saw Graham and nodded to him but with a little sinking of the heart She was aware however that he was looking at her with a curious intentness and a certain expectancy Maybe he only hoped she would let him dance with Toots No thanks she said Sorry Why not Delight Just a hand anyhow Three good reasons I don t play cards on Sunday I don t ever play for money and I m stifling for breath already in this air She was indeed a little breathless There was had she only seen it relief in Graham s face She did not belong there he felt Delight was well she was different He had not been thinking of her before she came in he forgot her promptly the moment she went out But she had given him for an instant a breath of the fresh out doors and quietness and perhaps something clean and fine There was an insistent clamor that she stay and Tommy Hale even got down on his knees and made a quite impassioned appeal But Delight s chin was very high although she smiled You are all very nice she said But I m sure I d bore you in a minute and I m certain you d bore me Besides I think you re quite likely to be raided Which met with great applause But there was nothing of Delight of the high head when she got out of her car and crept up the rectory steps How could she even have cared How could she That was his life those were the people he chose to play with She had a sense of loss rather than injury The rector tapping at her door a little later received the answer to his note through a very narrow crack and went away feeling that the way of the wicked is indeed hard Clayton had been watching with growing concern Graham s intimacy with the gay crowd that revolved around Marion Hayden It was more thoughtless than vicious more pleasure seeking than wicked but its influence was bad and he knew it But he was very busy At night he was too tired to confront the inevitable wrangle with Natalie that any protest about Graham always evoked and he was anxious not to disturb the new rapprochement with the boy by direct criticism The middle of December which found the construction work at the new plant well advanced saw the social season definitely on also and he found himself night after night going to dinners and then on to balls There were fewer private dances than in previous Winters but society had taken up various war activities and made them fashionable The result was great charity balls On these occasions he found himself watching for Audrey always She had with a sort of diabolical cleverness succeeded in losing herself Her house was sold he knew and he had expected that she would let him know where to find her She had said she counted on him and he had derived an odd sort of comfort from the thought It had warmed him to think that out of all the people he knew to one woman he meant something more than success But although he searched the gayest crowds with his eyes those hilarious groups of which she had been so frequently the center he did not find her And there had been no letter save a brief one without an address enclosing her check for the money she had borrowed She had apparently gone not only out of her old life but out of his as well At one of the great charity balls he met Nolan and they stood together watching the crowd Pretty expensive I take it Nolan said indicating the scene Orchestra florist supper I wonder how much the Belgians will get Personally I d rather send the money and get some sleep Precisely But would you send the money We ve got to have a quid pro quo you know most of us He surveyed the crowd with cynical dissatisfied eyes At the end of two years of the war he observed apropos of nothing five million men are dead and eleven million have been wounded A lot of them were doing this sort of thing two years ago I would like to know where we will be two years from now Some of us won t be here Have you seen Lloyd George s speech on the German peace terms That means going on to the end A speedy peace might have left us out but there will be no peace Not yet or soon And still we don t prepare The English tradition persists said the Irishman bitterly We want to wait and play to the last moment and then upset our business and overthrow the whole country trying to get ready in a hurry I wonder what they will do when the time comes with men like you and myself Take our money said Nolan viciously Tax our heads off Thank God I haven t a son Clayton eyed him with the comprehension of long acquaintance Exactly he said But you ll go yourself if you can And fight for England I will not He pursued the subject further going into an excited account of Ireland s grievances He was flushed and loquacious He quoted Lloyd George s quagmire of distrust in tones raised over the noise of the band And Clayton was conscious of a growing uneasiness How much of it was real how much a pose Was Nolan representative of the cultured Irishman in America And if he was what would be the effect of their anti English mania Would we find ourselves like the British split into factions Or would the country be drawn together by trouble until it changed from a federation of states to a great nation united and unbeatable Were we really the melting pot of the world and was war the fiery furnace which was to fuse us together or were there elements like Nolan like the German Americans that would never fuse He left Nolan still irritable and explosive and danced once with Natalie his only dance of the evening Then finding that Rodney Page would see her to her car later he went home He had a vague sense of disappointment a return of the critical mood of the early days of his return from France He went to his room and tried to read but he gave it up and lay cigaret in hand thinking There ought to have come to a man when he reached the middle span certain compensations for the things that had gone with his youth the call of adventure the violent impulses of his early love life There should come to take their place friends a new zest in the romance of achievement since other romance had gone and peace But the peace of the middle span of life should be the peace of fulfillment and of a home and a woman Natalie was not happy but she seemed contented enough Her life satisfied her The new house in the day time bridge the theater in the evening or the opera dinners dances clothes they seemed to be enough for her But his life was not enough for him What did he want anyhow In God s name what did he want One night impatient with himself he picked up the book of love lyrics in its mauve cover from his bedside table He read one then another He read them slowly engrossingly It was as though something starved in him was feeding eagerly on this poor food Their passion stirred him as in his earlier years he had never been stirred For just a little time while Natalie danced that night Clayton Spencer faced the tragedy of the man in his prime still strong and lusty with life with the deeper passions of the deepening years who has outgrown and outloved the woman he married A man s house must be built on love Without love it can not stand Natalie coming in much later and seeing his light still on found him sleeping with one arm under his head and a small black hole burned in the monogrammed linen sheet The book of poems had slipped to the floor The next day she missed it from its place and Clayton s man interrogated said he had asked to have it put away somewhere He did not care for it Natalie raised her eyebrows She had thought the poems rather pretty One resolution Clayton made as a result of that night He would not see Audrey again if he could help it He was not in love with her and he did not intend to be He was determinedly honest with himself Men in his discontented state were only too apt to build up a dream woman compounded of their own starved fancy and translate her into terms of the first attractive woman who happened to cross the path He was not going to be a driveling idiot like Chris and some of the other men he knew Things were bad but they could be much worse It happened then that when Audrey called him at the mill a day or so later it was a very formal voice that came back to her over the wire She was quick to catch his tone I suppose you hate being called in business hours Clay Not at all That means yes you know But I m going even further I m coming down to see you Why is anything wrong He could hear her laughter a warm little chuckle Don t be so urgent she said gayly I want to consult you That s all May I come There was a second s pause Then Don t you think I d better come to see you I ve only a little flat I don t think you ll like it That s nonsense Where is it She gave him the address When shall I come Whenever it suits you I have nothing to do Say this afternoon about four That nothing to do was an odd change in itself for Audrey had been in the habit of doling out her time like sweetmeats Where in the world have you been all this time he demanded almost angrily To his own surprise he was suddenly conscious of a sense of indignation and affront She had said she depended on him and then she had gone away and hidden herself It was ridiculous Just getting acquainted with myself she replied with something of her old airy manner Good by His irritation passed as quickly as it came He felt calm and very sure of himself and rather light hearted Joey who was by now installed as an office adjunct and who commonly referred to the mill as ours heard him whistling blithely and cocked an ear in the direction of the inner room Guess we ve made another million dollars he observed to the pencil sharpener Clayton was not in the habit of paying afternoon calls on women The number of such calls that he had paid without Natalie during his married life could have been numbered on the fingers of his two hands Most of the men he knew paid such visits dropping in somewhere for tea or a highball on the way uptown He had preferred his club when he had a little time the society of other men He wondered if he should call Natalie and tell her But he decided against it It was possible for one thing that Audrey still did not wish her presence in town known If she did she would tell Natalie herself And it was possible too that she wanted to discuss Chris and the reason for his going He felt a real sense of relief when at last he saw her to find her looking much the same as ever He hardly knew what he had expected Audrey having warned him as to the apartment did not mention its poverty again It was a tiny little place but it had an open fire in the living room and plain pale yellow walls and she had given it that curious air of distinction with which she managed in her casual way to invest everything about her I hope you observe how neat I am she said as she gave him her hand My rooms of course Frightfully so He towered in the low room Audrey sat down and surveyed him as he stood by the fire It is nice to have a man about again Do you mean to say you have been living here without even visitors for two months You ll laugh Clay I m studying Studying What Stenography Oh it s not as bad as that I don t have to earn my living I ve just got to do something for my soul s sake I went all over the ground and I saw I was just a cumberer of the earth and then I thought She hesitated What did you think If some time or other I could release a man to go and fight it would be the next best thing to giving myself Not here necessarily I don t believe we will ever go in But in England anywhere You ve released Chris He released himself And he s not fighting He s driving an ambulance He waited hoping she would go on He was not curious but he thought it might be good for her to talk Chris and the trouble over with some one But she sat silent and suddenly asked him if he cared for tea He refused How s Natalie Very well And the house Held up by cold weather now It should be finished by the end of April Clay she said after a moment are you going to employ women in the new munition works In certain departments yes I have a girl I want work for She s not trained of course None of them are We have to teach them I can give you a card to the employment department if you want it Thanks There was a short silence She sat looking at the fire and he had a chance to notice the change in her She had visualized it herself Her long ear rings were gone and with them some of the insolence they had seemed to accentuate She was not rouged and he had thought at first for that reason that she looked ill She was even differently dressed in something dark and girlish with a boyish white Eton collar I wonder if you think I m hiding Clay she said finally Well what are you doing He smiled down at her from the hearth rug Paying my bills That s not all the truth either I ll tell you Clay I just got sick of it all When Chris left I had a chance to burn my bridges and I burned them The same people the same talk the same food the same days filled with the same silly things that took all my time and gave me nothing How long had you been feeling like that I don t know Ever since the war I suppose I just got to thinking Her voice trailed off I have some of Chris s Scotch if you want a high ball Thanks no Audrey do you hear from Chris Yes He s in a dangerous place now and sometimes at night I suppose I did force him in a way He was doing no good here and I thought he would find himself over there But I didn t send him He Tell me about making shells He was a little bit disappointed Evidently she did not depend on him enough to tell him Chris s story But again she was being loyal to Chris He told her about the mill phrasing his explanation in the simplest language the presses drilling on white hot metal the great anvils the forge the machine shop with its lathes where the rough surfaces of the shells were first rough turned and then machined to the most exact measurements And finding her interested he told her of England s women workers in their khaki colored overalls and caps and of the convent like silence and lack of movement in the filling sheds where one entered with rubber shod feet and the women silent and intent sat all day and all night with queer veils over their faces filling shells with the death load Audrey listened her hands clasped behind her head If other women can do that sort of thing why can t I Clay Nonsense But why I m intelligent It s not work for a lady Lady How old fashioned you are There are no ladies any more Just women And if we aren t measured by our usefulness instead of our general not worth a damn ness well we ought to be Oh I ve had time to think lately He was hardly listening Seeing her after all those weeks had brought him a wonderful feeling of peace The little room with its fire was cozy and inviting But he was quite sure looking down at her that he was not in danger of falling in love with her There was no riot in him no faint stirring of the emotions of that hour with the mauve book There was no suspicion in him that the ways of love change with the years that the passions of the forties when they come are to those of the early years as the deep sea to a shallow lake less easily roused infinitely more terrible This girl you spoke about that was the business you mentioned Yes She hesitated I could have asked you that over the telephone couldn t I The plain truth is that I ve had two bad months never mind why and Christmas was coming and I just wanted to see your perfectly sane and normal face again I wish you d let me know sooner where you were She evaded his eyes I was getting settled and studying and learning to knit and oh I m the most wretched knitter Clay I just stick at it doggedly I say to myself that hands that can play golf and use a pen and shoot and drive a car have got to learn to knit But look here She held up a forlorn looking sock to his amused gaze And I think I m a clever woman You re a very brave woman Audrey he said You ll let me come back won t you Heavens yes Whenever you like And I m going to stop being a recluse I just wanted to think over some things On the way home he stopped at his florist s and ordered a mass of American beauties for her on Christmas morning She had sent her love to Natalie so that night he told Natalie he had seen her and such details of her life as he knew I m glad she s coming to her senses Natalie said Everything s been deadly dull without her She always made things go I don t know just how she added as if she had been turning her over in her mind What sort of business did she want to see you about She has a girl she wants to get into the mill Good gracious she must be changed said Natalie And proceeded she was ready to go out to dinner to one of her long and critical surveys of herself in the cheval mirror Recently those surveys had been rather getting on Clayton s nerves She customarily talked not to him but to his reflection over her shoulder when indeed she took her eyes from herself I wonder she said fussing with a shoulder strap who Audrey will marry if anything happens to Chris She saw his face and raised her eyebrows You needn t scowl like that He s quite as likely as not never to come back isn t he And Audrey didn t care a pin for him We re talking rather lightly of a very terrible thing aren t we Oh you re not she retorted You think just the same things as I do but you re not so open about them That s all CHAPTER XI Graham was engaged He hardly knew himself how it had come about His affair with Marion had been up to the very moment of his blurted out I want you as light hearted as that of any of the assorted young couples who flirted and kissed behind the closed doors of that popular house The crowd which frequented the Hayden home was gay tolerant and occasionally nasty It made ardent love semi promiscuously it drank rather more than it should and its desire for a good time often brought it rather close to the danger line It did not actually step over but it hovered gayly on the brink And Toots remained high priestess of her little cult The men liked her The girls imitated her And Graham young as he was seeing her popularity was vastly gratified to find himself standing high in her favor Marion was playing for the stake of the Spencer money In her intimate circle every one knew it but Graham How s every little millionaire was Tommy Hale s usual greeting She knew only one way to handle men and with the stake of the Spencer money she tried every lure of her experience on Graham It was always Marion who on cold nights sat huddled against him in the back seat of the Hayden s rather shabby car her warm ungloved hand in his It was Marion who taught him to mix the newest of cocktails and who later praised his skill It was Marion who insisted on his having a third too when the second had already set his ears drumming The effect on the boy of her steady propinquity of her constant caressing touches of the general letting down of the bars of restraint was to rouse in him impulses of which he was only vaguely conscious and his proposal of marriage when it finally came was by nature of a confession He had kissed her not for the first time but this time she had let him hold her and he had rained kisses on her face I want you he had said huskily And even afterward when the thing was done and she had said she would marry him she had to ask him if he loved her I of course I do he had said And had drawn her back into his arms He wanted to marry her at once It was the strongest urge of his life and put into his pleading an almost pathetic earnestness But she was firm enough now I don t think your family will be crazy about this you know What do we care for the family They re not marrying you are they They will have to help to support me won t they And he had felt a trifle chilled It was not a part of Marion s program to enter the Spencer family unwelcomed She had a furtive fear of Clayton Spencer the fear of the indirect for the direct of the designing woman for the essentially simple and open male It was not on her cards to marry Graham and to try to live on his salary So for a few weeks the engagement was concealed even from missus Hayden and Graham who had received some stock from his father on his twenty first birthday secretly sold a few shares and bought the engagement ring With that Marion breather easier It was absolute evidence Her methods were the methods of her kind and her time To allure a man by every wile she knew and having won him to keep him uncertain and uneasy was her perfectly simple creed So she reduced love to its cheapest terms passion and jealousy played on them both and made Graham alternately happy and wretched Once he found Rodney Page there lounging about with the manner of a habitue It seemed to Graham that he was always stumbling over Rodney those days either at home with drawings and color sketches spread out before him or at the Hayden house What s he hanging around here for he demanded when Rodney having bent over Marion s hand and kissed it had gone away If he could see that bare spot on the top of his head he d stop all that kow towing You re being rather vulgar aren t you Marion had said He s a very old friend and a very dear one Probably in love with you once like all the rest He had expected denial from her but she had held her cigaret up in the air and reflectively regarded its small gilt tip I m afraid he s rather unhappy Poor Rod About me About me Look here Toots he burst out I m playing square with you I never go anywhere but here I I m perfectly straight with you But every time here I find some of your old guard hanging round It makes me wild They ve always come here and as long as our engagement isn t known I can t very well stop them Then let me go to father He ll turn you out you know I know men dear old thing and father is going to raise a merry little hell about us He s the sort who wants to choose his son s wife for him He d like to play Providence She watched him smiling but with slightly narrowed eyes I rather think he has somebody in mind for you now I don t believe it Of course you don t But he has Who Delight She s exactly the sort he thinks you ll need He still thinks you are a little boy Graham so he picks out a nice little girl for you Such a nice little girl The amused contempt in her voice made him angry for Delight rather than himself He was extremely grown up and dignified the rest of the afternoon he stood very tall and straight and spoke in his deepest voice It became rather an obsession in him to prove his manhood and added to that was the effect of Marion s constant insidious appeal to the surging blood of his youth And day after day he was shut in his office with Anna Klein He thought he was madly in love with Marion He knew that he was not at all in love with Anna Klein But she helped to relieve the office tedium He was often aware sitting at his desk with Anna before him notebook in hand that while he read his letters her eyes were on him More than once he met them and there was something in them that healed his wounded vanity He was a man to her He was indeed almost a god but that he did not know In his present frame of mind he would have accepted even that however Then one day he kissed her She was standing very close and the impulse was quick and irresistible She made no effort to leave his arms and he kissed her again Like me a little do you he had asked smiling into her eyes Oh I do I do she had replied hoarsely It was almost an exact reversal of his relationship with Marion There the huskiness was his the triumphant smile was Marion s And the feeling of being adored without stint or reservation warmed him He released her then but their relationship had taken on a new phase He would stand against the outer door to prevent its sudden opening And she would walk toward him frightened and helpless until his arms closed about her It was entirely a game to him There were days when Marion was trying or the work of his department was nagging him when he scarcely noticed her at all But again the mischief in him the idler the newly awakened hunting male took him to her with arms outheld and the look of triumph in his eyes that she mistook for love On one such occasion Joey came near to surprising a situation so near that his sophisticated young mind guessed rather more than the truth He went out whistling He waited until Graham had joined the office force in the mill lunchroom and invented an errand back to Graham s office Anna was there powdering her nose with the aid of a mirror fastened inside her purse Joey had adopted Clayton with a sort of fierce passion hidden behind a pose of patronage He s all right he would say to the boys gathered at noon in the mill yard He s kinda short tempered sometimes but me I understand him And there ain t many of these here money kings that would sit up in a hospital the way he did with me The mill yard had had quite enough of that night in the hospital It would fall on him in one of those half playful half vicious attacks that are the humor of the street and sometimes it was rather a battered Joey who returned to Clayton s handsome office to assist him in running the mill But it was a very cool and slightly scornful Joey who confronted Anna that noon hour He lost no time in preliminaries What do you think you re doing anyhow he demanded Powdering my nose if you insist on knowing They spoke the same language Anna knew what was coming and was on guard instantly You cut it out that s all You cut out of this office And that s all Joey sat down on Graham s desk and folded his arms What are you going to get out of it anyhow he said with a shift from bullying to argument Out of what You know all right She whirled on him Now see here Joey she said You run out and play I ll not have any little boys meddling in my affairs Joey slid off the desk and surveyed her with an impish smile Your affairs he repeated What the hell do I care about your affairs I m thinking of the boss It s up to him if he wants to keep German spies on the place But it s up to some of us here to keep our eyes open so that they don t do any harm Sheer outrage made Anna s face pale She had known for some time that the other girls kept away from her and she had accepted it with the stolidity of her blood She had no German sympathies her sympathies in the war lay nowhere But she a spy You get out of here she said furiously or I ll go to mister Spencer and complain about you I m no more a spy than you are Not as much the way you come sneaking around listening and watching Now you get out And Joey had gone slowly to show that the going was of his own free will and whistling He went out and closed the door Then he opened it and stuck his head in You be good he volunteered and when the little old U S gets to mixing up with the swine over there I ll bring you a nice fat Hun as a present CHAPTER XII Two days before Christmas Delight came out There was an afternoon reception at the rectory and the plain old house blossomed with the debutante s bouquets and baskets of flowers For weeks before the house had been getting ready The rector looking about for his accustomed chair had been told it was at the upholsterer s or had found his beloved and ragged old books relegated to dark corners of the bookcases There were always stepladders on the landings and paper hangers waiting until a man got out of bed in the morning And once he put his ecclesiastical heel in a pail of varnish and slid down an entire staircase to the great imperilment of his kindly old soul But he had consented without demur to the coming out party and he had taken during all the morning of the great day a most mundane interest in the boxes of flowers that came in every few minutes He stood inside a window under pretense of having no place to sit down and called out regularly Six more coming mother And a boy with three ringing across the street I think he s made a mistake Yes he has He s coming over When all the stands and tables were overflowing the bouquets were hung to the curtains in the windows And Delight taking a last survey from the doorway expressed her satisfaction It s heavenly she said Imagine all those flowers for me It looks she squinted up her eyes critically it looks precisely like a highly successful funeral But a part of her satisfaction was pure pose for the benefit of that kindly pair who loved her so Alone in her room dressed to go down stairs Delight drew a long breath and picked up her flowers which Clayton Spencer had sent It had been his kindly custom for years to send to each little debutante as she made her bow a great armful of white lilacs and trailing tiny white rosebuds Fifty dollars probably Delight reflected And the Belgians needing flannels It s dreadful Her resentment against Graham was dying After all he was only a child in Toots Hayden s hands And she made one of those curious He loves me he loves me not arrangements in her own mind If Graham came that afternoon she would take it as a sign that there was still some good in him and she would try to save him from himself She had been rather nasty to him If he did not come A great many came mostly women with a sprinkling of men The rector who loved people was in his element He was proud of Delight proud of his home he had never ceased being proud of his wife He knew who exactly had sent each basket of flowers each hanging bunch Your exquisite orchids he would say or that perfectly charming basket It is there just beside missus Haverford But when Natalie Spencer came in alone splendid in Russian sables he happened to be looking at Delight and he saw the light die out of her eyes Natalie had tried to bring Graham with her She had gone into his room that morning while he was dressing and asked him To tell the truth she was uneasy about Marion Hayden and his growing intimacy there You will won t you Graham dear Sorry mother I just can t I m taking a girl out I suppose it s Marion Her tone caused him to turn and look at her Yes it s Marion What s wrong with that It s so silly Graham She s older than you are And she s not really nice Graham I don t mean anything horrid but she s designing She knows you are young and well she s just playing with you I know girls Graham I She stopped before his angry gaze She is nice enough for you to ask here he said hastily She wants your money That s all He had laughed then an ugly laugh There s a lot of it for her to want And Natalie had gone away to shed tears of fury and resentment in her own room She was really frightened Bills for flowers sent to Marion were coming in to lie unpaid on Graham s writing table She had over drawn once again to pay them and other bills for theater tickets checks signed at restaurants over due club accounts So she went to the Haverfords alone and managed very effectually to snub missus Hayden before the rector s very eyes missus Hayden thereupon followed an impulse If it were not for Natalie Spencer she said following that lady s sables with malevolent eyes I should be very happy in something I want to tell you Can we find a corner somewhere And Doctor Haverford had followed her uneasily behind some palms She was a thin little woman with a maddening habit of drawing her tight veil down even closer by a contortion of her lower jaw so that the rector found himself watching her chin rather than her eyes I want you to know right away as Marion s clergyman and ours she had said and had given her jaw a particularly vicious wag and twist Of course it is not announced I don t believe even the Spencers know it yet I am only telling you now because I know how dearly she did it again how dearly interested you are in all your spiritual children Marion is engaged to Graham Spencer The rector had not been a shining light for years without learning how to control his expression He had a second too while she contorted her face again to recover himself Thank you he said gravely I much appreciate your telling me missus Hayden had lowered her voice still more The revelation took on the appearance of conspiracy In the early spring probably she said we shall need your services and your blessing So that was the end of one dream He had dreamed so many in his youth of spiritualizing his worldly flock in middle life of a bishopric he had dreamed of sons to carry on the name he had meant to make famous But the failures of those dreams had been at once his own failure and his own disappointment This was different He was profoundly depressed He wandered out of the crowd and after colliding with a man from the caterer s in a dark rear hall found his way up the servant s staircase to the small back room where he kept the lares and penates of his quiet life his pipe his fishing rods a shabby old smoking coat and back files of magazines which he intended some day to read when he got round to it The little room was jammed with old furniture stripped from the lower floor to make room for the crowd He had to get down on his knees and crawl under a table to reach his pipe But he achieved it finally still with an air of abstraction and lighted it Then as there was no place to sit down he stood in the center of the little room and thought He did not go down again He heard the noise of the arriving and departing motors subside its replacement by the sound of clattering china being washed below in the pantry He went down finally to be served with a meal largely supplemented by the left overs of the afternoon refreshments ornate salads fancy ices and an overwhelming table decoration that shut him off from his wife and Delight and left him in magnificent solitude behind a pyramid of flowers Bits of the afternoon s gossip reached him the comments on Delight s dress and her flowers the reasons certain people had not come But nothing of the subject nearest his heart At the end of the meal Delight got up I m going to call up mister Spencer she said He has about fifty dollars worth of thanks coming to him I didn t see Graham said missus Haverford Was he here Delight stood poised for flight He couldn t come because he had enough to do being two places at once His mother said he was working and missus Hayden said he had taken Marion to the Country Club I don t know why they take the trouble to lie to me CHAPTER XIII Christmas day of the year of our Lord nineteen sixteen dawned on a world which seemed to have forgotten the Man of Peace In Asia Minor the Allies celebrated it by the capture of a strong Turkish position at Maghdadah The Germans spent it concentrating at Dead Man s Hill the British were ejected from enemy positions near Arras There was no Christmas truce The death grip had come Germany conscious of her superiority in men and her hypocritical peace offers unanimously rejected was preparing to free herself from the last restraint of civilization and to begin unrestricted submarine warfare On Christmas morning Clayton received a letter from Chris Evidently it had come by hand for it was mailed in America Dear Clay I am not at all sure that you will care to hear from me In fact I have tried two or three times to write to you and have given it up But I am lonelier than Billy be damned and if it were not for Audrey s letters I wouldn t care which shell got me and my little cart I don t know whether you know why I got out or not Perhaps you don t I d been a fool and a scoundrel and I ve had time between fusses to know just how rotten I ve been But I m not going to whine to you What I am trying to get over is that I m through with the old stuff for good God only knows why I am writing to you anyhow unless it is because I ve always thought you were pretty near right And I d like to feel that now and then you are seeing Audrey and bucking her up a bit I think she s rather down Do you know Clay I think this is a darned critical time The press hasn t got it yet but both the British and the French are hard up against it They ll fight until there is no one left to fight but these damned Germans seem to have no breaking point They haven t any temperament I daresay or maybe it is soul they lack But they ll fight to the last man also and the plain truth is that there are too many of them It looks mighty bad unless we come in And I don t mind saying that there are a good many eyes over here straining across the old Atlantic Are we doing anything I wonder Getting ready The officers here say we can t expand an army to get enough men without a draft law Can you see the administration endangering the next election with a draft law Not on your life I m on the wagon Clay Honestly it s funny I don t mind telling you I m darned miserable sometimes But then I get busy and I m so blooming glad in a rush to get water that doesn t smell to heaven that I don t want anything else I suppose they ll give us a good hate on Christmas Well think of me sometimes when you sit down to dinner and you might drink to our coming in If we have a principle to divide among us we shall have to Clayton read the letter twice He and Natalie lunched alone Natalie in radiant good humor His gift to her had been a high collar of small diamonds magnificently set and Natalie whose throat commenced to worry her had welcomed it rapturously Also he had that morning notified Graham that his salary had been raised to five thousand dollars Graham had shown relief rather than pleasure I daresay I won t earn it Father he had said But I ll at east try to keep out of debt on it If you can t better let me be your banker Graham The boy had flushed Then he had disappeared as usual and Clayton and Natalie sat across from each other in their high armed lion chairs and made a pretense of Christmas gayety True to Natalie s sense of the fitness of things a small Nuremberg Christmas tree hung with tiny toys and lighted with small candles stood in the center of the table We are dining out she explained So I thought we d use it now It s very pretty Clayton acknowledged And he wondered if Natalie felt at all as he did the vast room and the two men serving with Graham no one knew where and that travesty of Christmas joy between them His mind wandered to long ago Christmases It s not so very long since we had a real tree he observed Do you remember the one that fell and smashed all the things on it And how Graham heard it and came down Horribly messy things said Natalie and watched the second man critically He was new and she decided he was awkward She chattered through the meal however with that light gayety of hers which was not gayety at all and always of the country house The dining room floor is to be oak with a marble border she said You remember the ones we saw in Italy And the ceiling is blue and gold You ll love the ceiling Clay There was claret with the luncheon and Clayton raising his glass thought of Chris and the water that smelled to heaven Natalie s mind was on loggias by that time An upstairs loggia too she said Bordered with red geraniums I loathe geraniums but the color is good Rodney wants Japanese screens and things but I m not sure What do you think I think you re a better judge than I am he replied smiling He had had to come back a long way but he made the effort It s hardly worth while struggling to have things attractive for you she observed petulantly You never notice anyhow Clay do you know that you sit hours and hours and never talk to me No Do I I m sorry You re a perfectly dreary person to have around I ll talk to you my dear But I m not much good at houses Give me something I understand The mill I suppose Or the war Do I really talk of the war When you talk at all What in the world do you think about Clay when you sit with your eyes on nothing It s a vicious habit Oh ships and sails and sealing wax and cabbages and kings he said lightly That afternoon Natalie slept and the house took on the tomb like quiet of an establishment where the first word in service is silence Clay wandered about feeling an inexpressible loneliness of spirit On those days which work did not fill he was always discontented He thought of the club but the vision of those disconsolate groups of homeless bachelors who gathered there on all festivals that centered about a family focus was unattractive All at once he realized that since he had wakened that morning he had been wanting to see Audrey He wanted to talk to her real talk not gossip Not country houses Not personalities Not recrimination Such talk as Audrey herself had always led at dinner parties of men and affairs of big issues of the war He felt suddenly that he must talk about the war to some one Natalie was still sleeping when he went down stairs It had been raining but a cold wind was covering the pavement with a glaze of ice Here and there men in top hats like himself were making their way to Christmas calls Children clinging to the arms of governesses their feet in high arctics slid laughing on the ice A belated florist s wagon was still delivering Christmas plants tied with bright red bows The street held more of festivity to Clayton than had his house Even the shop windows as he walked toward Audrey s unfashionable new neighborhood cried out their message of peace Peace when there was no peace Audrey was alone but her little room was crowded with gifts and flowers I was hoping you would come Clay she said I ve had some visitors but they re gone I ll tell them down stairs that I m not at home and we can really talk That s what I came for And when she had telephoned I ve had a letter from Chris Audrey She read it slowly and he was surprised when she finally looked up to find tears in her eyes Poor old Chris she said I ve never told you the story have I Clay Of course I know perfectly well I haven t There was another woman I think I could have understood it perhaps if she had been a different sort of a woman But I suppose it hurt my pride I didn t love him She was such a vulgar little thing Not even pretty Just woman He nodded He was fastidious too I don t understand it And he swears he never cared for her I don t believe he did either I suppose there s no explanation for these things They just happen It s the life we live I dare say When I look back She s the girl I sent into the mill He was distinctly shocked But Audrey he protested you are not seeing her are you Now and then She has fastened herself on me in a way Don t scowl like that She says she is straight now and that she only wants a chance to work She s off the stage for good She danced That money I got from you was for her She was waiting up stairs Chris was behind with her rent and she was going to lose her furniture That you should have to do such a thing he protested It s well it s infamous But she only smiled Well I ve never been particularly shielded It hasn t hurt me I don t even hate her But I m puzzled sometimes Where there s love it might be understandable Most of us would hate to have to stand the test of real love I daresay There s a time in every one s life I suppose when love seems to be the only thing that matters That was what the poet in that idiotic book had said There is no other joy Even you Clay she reflected smilingly You big grave men go all to pieces sometimes I never have he retorted She returned Chris s letter to him There she said I ve had my little whimper and I feel better Now talk to me The little clock was striking six when at last he rose to go The room was dark with only the glow of the wood fire on Audrey s face He found her very lovely rather chastened and subdued but much more appealing than in her old days of sparkle and high spirits You are looking very sweet Audrey Am I How nice of you She got up and stood on the hearth rug beside him looking up at him Then Don t be startled Clay she announced smilingly I am going to kiss you for Christmas And kiss him she did putting both hands on his shoulders and rising on her toes to do it It was a very small kiss and Clayton took it calmly and as she intended him to take it But it was at that rather a flushed Audrey who bade him good night and God bless you Clayton took away with him from that visit a great peace and a great relief He had talked out to her for more than an hour of the many things that puzzled and bewildered him He had talked war and the mill and even Graham and his problems And by talking of them some of them had clarified A little of his unrest had gone He felt encouraged he had a new strength to go on It was wonderful he reflected what the friendship of a woman could mean to a man He was quite convinced that it was only friendship He turned toward home reluctantly Behind him was the glow of Audrey s fire and the glow that had been in her eyes when he entered If a man had such a woman behind him He went into his great silent house and the door closed behind him like a prison gate For a long time after he had gone Audrey doors closed to visitors sat alone by her fire with one of his roses held close to her cheek In her small upper room in a white frame cottage on the hill overlooking the Spencer furnaces Anna Klein locked away from prying eyes sat that same Christmas evening and closely inspected a tiny gold wrist watch And now and then like Audrey she pressed it to her face Not the gift but the giver CHAPTER XIV Having turned Dunbar and his protective league over to Hutchinson the general manager Clayton had put him out of his mind But during the week after Christmas he reached the office early one morning to find that keen and rather shabby gentleman already there waiting Not precisely waiting for he was standing by one of the windows well back from it and inspecting the mill yard with sharp darting glances Hello Dunbar said Clayton and proceeded to shed his fur lined coat Dunbar turned and surveyed him with the grudging admiration of the undersized man for the tall one Cold morning he said coming forward Not that I suppose you know it He glanced at the coat I thought Hutchinson said that you d gone away Been to Washington I brought something back that will interest you From inside his coat he produced a small leather case and took from it a number of photographs I rather gathered mister Spencer he said dryly when I was here last that you thought me an alarmist I don t know that I blame you We always think the other fellow may get it but that we are safe You might glance at those photographs He spread them out on the desk Beyond the windows the mill roared on men shouted the locomotive whistled a long file of laborers with wheelbarrows went by And from a new building going up came the hammering of the riveting machines so like the rapid explosions of machine guns Interesting aren t they queried Dunbar This is a clock bomb with a strap for carrying it under a coat That s a lump of coal only it isn t It s got enough explosive inside to blow up a battleship It s meant for that primarily That s fire confetti damnable stuff understand it s what burned up most of Belgium And that s a fountain pen What do you think of that Use one yourself don t you Don t leave it lying around That s all What on earth can they do with a fountain pen One of their best little tricks said mister Dunbar with a note of grudging admiration in his voice Here s a cut of the mechanism You sit down dip your pen and commence to write There s the striking pin or whatever they call it It hits here and good night Do you mean to say they re using things like that here I mean to say they re planning to if they haven t already That coal now you d see that go into your furnaces or under your boilers or wherever you use it and wouldn t worry would you Are these actual photographs Made from articles taken from a German officer s trunk in a neutral country He was on his way somewhere I imagine Clayton sat silent Then he took out his fountain pen and surveyed it with a smile Rather off fountain pens for a time I take it observed Dunbar Well I ve something else for you You ve got one of the best little I W W workers in the country right here in your mill Some of them aren t so bad hot air and nothing else But this fellow s a fanatic Which is the same as saying he s crazy Who is he Name s Rudolph Klein He s a sort of relation to the chap that got out Old man s been sore on him but I understand he s hanging around the Klein place again Clayton considered I don t remember him Of course I can t keep track of the men We ll get rid of him mister Dunbar eyed him That s the best thing you can think of I don t want him round do I Nine of you men out of ten say that You d turn him loose and so warn him Not only that but he ll be off on his devil s work somewhere Perhaps here Perhaps elsewhere And we want him where we can find him See here mister Spencer d you ever hear of counter espionage Clayton never had but the term explained itself Set a spy to watch a spy said Dunbar Let him think he s going on fine Find his confederates Let them get ready to spring something And then get them Remember he added with sarcasm we re still neutral You can t lock a man up because he goes around yelling Down with capital The whole country is ready to yell it with him And even if you find him with a bomb under his coat labeled made in Germany it s hard to link Germans up with the thing He can say that he always buys his bombs in Germany That they make the best bombs in the world That he likes the way they pack em and their polite trade methods Clayton listened thinking hard We have a daughter of Klein s here She is my son s secretary Dunbar glanced at him quickly but his eyes were on the window I know that Think I should get rid of her Dunbar hesitated He liked Clayton Spencer and it was his business just then to know something about the Kleins It would be a good thing for Clayton Spencer s boy if they got rid of the girl On the other hand to keep her there and watch her was certainly a bigger thing If she stayed there might be trouble but it would concern the boy only If she left and if she was one link in the chain to snare Rudolph there might be a disaster costing many lives He made his decision quickly Keep her by all means he said And don t tell mister Graham anything He s young and he d be likely to show something I suppose she gets considerable data where she is Only of the one department But that s a fair indication of the rest Dunbar rose I m inclined to think there s nothing to that end of it he said The old chap is sulky but he s not dangerous It s Rudolph I m afraid of At the luncheon hour that day Clayton having finished his mail went to Graham s office He seldom did that but he was uneasy He wanted to see the girl He wanted to look her over with this new idea in his mind She had been a quiet little thing he remembered thorough but not brilliant He had sent her to Graham from his own office He disliked even the idea of suspecting her his natural chivalry revolted from suspecting any woman Joey who customarily ate his luncheon on Clayton s desk in his absence followed by one of Clayton s cigarets watched him across the yard and whistled as he saw him enter Graham s small building Well what do you think of that he reflected I hope he coughs before he goes in But Clayton did not happen to cough Graham s office was empty but there was a sound of voices from Anna Klein s small room beyond He crossed to the door and opened it to stand astonished his hand on the door knob Anna Klein was seated at her desk with her luncheon spread before her on a newspaper and seated on the desk a sandwich in one hand the other resting on Anna s shoulder was Graham He was laughing when Clayton opened the door but the smile froze on his face He slid off her desk Want me father Yes said Clayton curtly And went out leaving the door open A sort of stricken silence followed his exit then Graham put down the sandwich and went out closing the door behind him He stood just inside it in the outer room rather pale but looking his father in the eyes Sorry father he said I didn t hear you I What has that to do with it The boy was silent To Clayton he looked furtive guilty His very expression condemned him far more than the incident itself And Clayton along with his anger was puzzled as to his best course Dunbar had said to leave the girl where she was But was it feasible under these circumstances He was rather irritated than angry He considered a flirtation with one s stenographer rotten bad taste at any time The business world to his mind was divided into two kinds of men those who did that sort of thing and those who did not It was a code rather than a creed that the boy had violated Besides he had bad a surprise The girl who sat laughing into Graham s face was not the Anna Klein he remembered a shy drab little thing badly dressed rather sallow and unsmiling Here was a young woman undeniably attractive slightly rouged trim in her white blouse and with an air of piquancy that was added had he known it by the large imitation pearl earrings she wore Get your hat and go to lunch Graham he said And you might try to remember that a slightly different standard of conduct is expected from my son here than may be the standard of some of the other men It doesn t mean anything that sort of fooling You and I may know that The girl may not Then he went out and Graham returned unhappily to the inner room Anna was not crying she was too frightened to cry She had sat without moving her hand still clutching her untouched sandwich Graham looked at her and tried to smile I m gone I suppose Don t you worry about that he said with boyish bravado Don t you worry about that little girl Father will kill me she whispered He s queer these days and if I go home and have to tell him She shuddered I ll see you get something else if the worst comes you know She glanced up at him with that look of dog like fidelity that always touched him I ll find you something good he promised Something good she repeated with sudden bitterness And you ll get another girl here and flirt with her and make her crazy about you and Honestly do you like me like that I m just mad about you she said miserably Frightened though he was her wretchedness appealed to him The thought that she cared for him too was a salve to his outraged pride A moment ago in the other room he had felt like a bad small boy As with Marion Anna made him feel every inch a man But she gave him what Marion did not the feeling of her complete surrender Marion would take this girl would give He bent down and put his arms around her Poor little girl he said Poor little girl CHAPTER XV The gay and fashionable crowd of which Audrey had been the center played madly that winter The short six weeks of the season were already close to an end By mid January the south and California would have claimed most of the women and some of the men There were a few of course who saw the inevitable catastrophe the Mackenzies had laid up their house boat on the west coast of Florida Denis Nolan had let his little place at Pinehurst The advance wave of the war tide the increased cost of living had sobered and made thoughtful the middle class but above in the great businesses and below among the laboring people money was plentiful and extravagance ran riot And Audrey Valentine s world missed her It refused to accept her poverty as an excuse and clamored for her It wanted her to sit again at a piano somewhere anywhere with a lighted cigaret on the music rack and sing her husky naive little songs It wanted her cool audacity It wanted her for week end parties and bridge and to canter on frosty mornings on its best horses and make slaves of the park policemen so that she might jump forbidden fences It wanted to see her oust its grinning chauffeurs and drive its best cars at their best speed Audrey Valentine leading a cloistered life Impossible Selfish And Audrey was not cut out for solitude She did not mind poverty She found it rather a relief to acknowledge what had always been the fact But she did mind loneliness And her idea of making herself over into something useful was not working out particularly well She spent two hours a day at a down town school struggling with shorthand and her writing table was always littered with papers covered with queer hooks and curves or with typed sheets beginning Messrs Smith and company Dear Sirs Clayton Spencer met her late in December walking feverishly along with a book under her arm and a half desperate look in her eyes He felt a little thrill when he saw her which should have warned him but did not She did not even greet him She stopped and held out her book to him Take it she said I ve thrown it away twice and two wretched men have run after me and brought it back He took it and glanced at it Spelling Can t you spell Certainly I can spell she said with dignity I m a very good speller Clay there isn t an i in business is there It is generally considered necessary to have two pretty good eyes in business But he saw then that she was really rather despairing There is one i he said It seems foolish doesn t it Audrey dear what are you trying to do For heaven s sake if it s money It isn t that I have enough Honestly Clay I just had some sort of an idea that I d been playing long enough But I m only good for play That man this morning said as much when we fussed about my spelling He said I d better write a new dictionary Clayton threw back his head and laughed and after a moment she laughed too But as he went on his face was grave Somebody ought to be looking after her It was not for some time that he realized he carried the absurd little spelling book He took it back to the office with him and put it in the back of a drawer of his desk Joey coming in some time later found him with the drawer open and something in his hands which he hastily put away Later on Joey investigated that drawer and found the little book He inspected it with a mixture of surprise and scorn Spelling he muttered And a hundred dollar a month girl to spell for him It was Rodney Page who forced Audrey out of her seclusion Rodney had had a prosperous year and for some time his conscience had been bothering him For a good many years he had blithely accepted the invitations of his friends dinners balls week end and yachting parties paying his way with an occasional box of flowers He decided that last winter of peace to turn host and true to instinct to do the unusual It was Natalie who gave him the suggestion Why don t you turn your carriage house into a studio and give a studio warming Roddie It would be fun fixing it up And you might make it fancy dress Before long of course he had accepted the idea as of his own originating and was hard at work Rodney s house had been his father s He still lived there although the business district had encroached closely And for some time he had used the large stable and carriage house at the rear as a place in which to store the odd bits of furniture old mirrors and odds and ends that he had picked up here and there Now and then as to Natalie he sold some of them but he was a collector not a merchant In his way he was an artist In the upper floor he had built a skylight and there in odd hours he worked out in water color sketches of interiors sometimes for houses he was building sometimes purely for the pleasure of the thing The war had brought him enormous increase in his collection Owners of French chateaus driven to poverty were sending to America treasures of all sorts of furniture tapestries carpets old fountains porcelains even carved woodwork and ancient mantels and Rodney from the mixed motives of business and pride decided to exhibit them The old brick floor of the stable he replaced with handmade tiles The box stalls were small display rooms hung with tapestries and lighted with candles in old French sconces The great carriage room became a refectory with Jacobean and old monastery chairs and the vast loft overhead reached by a narrow staircase that clung to the wall was railed on its exposed side waxed as to floor hung with lanterns and became a ballroom Natalie worked with him spending much time and a prodigious amount of energy There was springing up between them one of those curious and dangerous intimacies of idleness on the woman s part of admiration on the man s which sometimes develop into a wholly spurious passion Probably Rodney realized it certainly Natalie did not She liked his admiration she dressed each day for Rodney s unfailing comment on her clothes Clay never notices what I wear she said once plaintively So it was Rodney who brought Audrey Valentine out of her seclusion and he did it by making her angry He dropped in to see her between Christmas and New years and made a plea A stable warming she said How interesting And fancy dress Are you going to have them come as grooms or jockeys If I were going I d go as a circus rider I used to be able to stand up on a running horse Of course you re having horses What s a stable without a horse He saw she was laughing at him and was rather resentful I told you I have made it into a studio But when he implored her to go she was obdurate Do go away and let me alone Rodney she said at last I loathe fancy dress parties It won t be a party without you Then don t have it I ve told you over and over I m not going out It isn t decent this year in my opinion And anyhow I haven t any money any clothes any anything A bad evening at bridge and I shouldn t be able to pay my rent That s nonsense Why do you let people say you are moping about Chris You re not Of course not She sat up What else are they saying Well there s some talk naturally You can t be as popular as you have been and then just drop out without some gossip It s not bad What sort of talk He was very uncomfortable Well of course you have been pretty strong on the war stuff Oh they think I sent him If only you wouldn t hide Audrey That s what has made the talk It s not Chris s going I m not hiding That s idiotic I was bored to death if you want the truth Look here Rodney You re not being honest What do they say about Chris and myself He was cornered Is it about another woman Well of course now and then there are always such stories And of course Chris Yes they knew Chris Her voice was scornful So they think I m moping and hiding because How interesting She sat back with her old insolent smile Poor Chris she said The only man in the lot except Clay Spencer who is doing his bit for the war and they when is your party Roddie New year s Eve I ll come she said And smiling again dangerously I ll come with bells on CHAPTER XVI There had been once in Herman Klein the making of a good American He had come to America not at the call of freedom but of peace and plenty Nevertheless he had possibilities Taken in time he might have become a good American But nothing was done to stimulate in him a sentiment for his adopted land He would indeed have been for all his citizenship papers a man without a country but for one thing The Fatherland had never let go When he went to the Turnverein it was to hear the old tongue to sing the old songs Visiting Germans from overseas were constantly lecturing holding before him the vision of great Germany He saw moving pictures of Germany he went to meetings which commenced with Die Wacht am Rhine One Christmas he received a handsome copy of a photograph of the Kaiser through the mail He never knew who sent it but he had it framed in a gilt frame and it hung over the fireplace in the sitting room He had been adopted by America but he had not adopted America save his own tiny bit of it He took what the new country gave him with no faintest sense that he owed anything in return beyond his small yearly taxes He was neither friendly nor inimical His creed through the years had been simple to owe no man money even for a day to spend less than he earned to own his own home to rise early work hard and to live at peace with his neighbors He had learned English and had sent Anna to the public school He spoke English with her always And on Sunday he put on his best clothes and sat in the German Lutheran church dozing occasionally but always rigidly erect With his first savings he had bought a home a tiny two roomed frame cottage on a bill above the Spencer mill with a bit of waste land that he turned into a thrifty garden Anna was born there and her mother had died there ten years later But long enough before that he had added four rooms and bought an adjoining lot At that time the hill had been green the way to the little white house had been along and up a winding path where in the spring the early wild flowers came out on sunny banks and the first buds of the neighborhood were on Klein s own lilac bushes He had had a magnificent sense of independence those days and of freedom He voted religiously and now and then in the evenings he had been the moderate member of a mild socialist group Theoretically he believed that no man should amass a fortune by the labor of others Actually he felt himself well paid a respected member of society and a property owner In the early morning winter and summer he emerged into the small side porch of his cottage and there threw over himself a pail of cold water from the well outside Then he rubbed down dressed in the open air behind the old awning hung there took a dozen deep breaths and a cup of coffee and was off for work The addition of a bathroom with running hot water had made no change in his daily habits He was very strict with Anna and with the women who one after another kept house for him I ll have no men lounging around was his first instruction on engaging them And to Anna his solicitude took the form almost of espionage The only young man he tolerated about the place was a distant relative Rudolph Klein On Sunday evenings Rudolph came in to supper But even Rudolph found it hard to get a word with the girl alone What s eating him anyhow he demanded of Anna one Sunday evening when by the accident of a neighbor calling old Herman to the gate he had the chance of a word He knows a lot about you fellows Anna had said And the more he knows the less he trusts you I don t wonder He hasn t anything on me But Anna had come to the limit of her patience with her father at last What s the matter with you she demanded angrily one night when Herman had sat with his pipe in his mouth and had refused her permission to go to the moving pictures with another girl Do you think I m going on forever like this without a chance to play I m sick of it That s all You vill not run around with the girls on this hill He had conquered all but the English w He still pronounced it like a v What s the matter with the girls on this hill And when he smoked on in imperturbable silence she had flamed into a fury This is free America she reminded him It s not Germany And I ve stood about all I can I work all day and I need a little fun I m going And she had gone rather shaky as to the knees but with her head held high leaving him on the little veranda with his dead pipe in his mouth and his German American newspaper held before his face She had returned still terrified to find the house dark and the doors locked and rather than confess to any one she had spent the night in a chair out of doors At dawn she had heard him at the side of the house drawing water for his bath He had gone through his morning program as usual by the sounds and had started off for work without an inquiry about her Only when she heard the gate click had she hammered at the front door and been admitted by the untidy servant Fine way to treat me she had stormed and for a part of that day she was convinced that she would never go back home again But fear of her father was the strongest emotion she knew and she went back that night as usual It not being Herman s way to bother with greetings she had passed him on the porch without a word and that night winding a clock before closing the house he spoke to her for the first time There is a performance at the Turnverein Hall to morrow night Rudolph vill take you I don t like Rudolph Rudolph viii take you he had repeated stolidly And she had gone He had no conception of any failure in himself as a parent He had the German idea of women They had a distinct place in the world but that place was not a high one Their function was to bring children into the world They were breeding animals and as such to be carefully watched and not particularly trusted They had no place in the affairs of men outside the home Not that he put it that way In his way he probably loved the girl But never once did he think of her as an intelligent and reasoning creature He took her salary gave her a small allowance for car fare and banked the rest of it in his own name It would all be hers some day so what difference did it make But the direst want would not have made him touch a penny of it He disliked animals But in a curious shame faced fashion he liked flowers Such portions of his garden as were useless for vegetables he had planted out in flowers But he never cut them and brought them into the house and he watched jealously that no one else should do so He kept poisoned meat around for such dogs in the neighborhood as wandered in and Anna had found him once callously watching the death agonies of one of them Such at the time the Spencer mill began work on its new shell contract was Herman Klein sturdily honest just according to his ideas of justice callous rather than cruel but the citizen of a world bounded by his memories of Germany his life at the mill and his home But for all that he was not a man the German organization in America put much faith in Rudolph feeling his way had had one or two conversations with him early in the war that had made him report adversely Let them stop all this fighting Herman had said What matter now who commenced it Let them all stop It is the only way Sure let them stop said Rudolph easily Let them stop trying to destroy Germany That is nonsense Herman affirmed sturdily Do you think I know nothing I who was in the Prussian Guard for five years Think you I know nothing of the plan The report of the German atrocities however found him frankly incredulous and one noon hour in the mill having read the Belgian King s statement that the German army in Belgium had protected its advance with women and children Rudolph found him tearing the papers to shreds furiously Such lies he cried It is not possible that they should be believed The sinking of the Lusitania however left him thoughtful and depressed In vain Rudolph argued with him They were warned he said If they chose to take the chance is it Germany s fault If you tell me not to put my hand on a certain piece in a machine and I do it anyhow is it your fault if I lose a hand Old Herman eyed him shrewdly And if Anna had been on the ship you think the same eh Rudolph had colored For some time now Rudolph had been in love with Anna He had not had much encouragement She went out with him since he was her only means of escape but she treated him rather cavalierly criticized his clothes and speech laughed openly at his occasional lapses into sentiment and was once in a long time so kind that she set his heart leaping Until the return of Graham Spencer all had gone fairly well But with his installment in the mill Rudolph s relations with Anna had changed She had grown prettier Rudolph was not observant enough to mark what made the change but he knew that he was madder about her than ever And she had assumed toward him an attitude of almost scornful indifference The effect on his undisciplined young mind was bad He had no suspicion of Graham He only knew his own desperate unhappiness In the meetings held twice weekly in a hall on Third Street he was reckless advocating violence constantly The conservative element watched him uneasily the others kept an eye on him for future use The closing week of the old year found the situation strained in the Klein house Herman had had plenty of opportunities for situations but all of them had to do directly or indirectly with the making of munitions for the Allies Old firms in other lines were not taking on new men It was the munition works that were increasing their personnel And by that time the determination not to assist Germany s enemies had become a fixed one The day after Christmas in pursuit of this idea he commanded Anna to leave the mill But she had defied him for the second time in her life her face pale to the lips Not on your life she had said You may want to starve I don t There is plenty of other work Don t you kid yourself And anyhow I m not looking for it I don t mind working so you can sit here and nurse a grouch but I certainly don t intend to start hunting another job She had eyed him morosely If you ask me she continued you re out of your mind What s Germany to you You forgot it as fast as you could until this war came along You and Rudolph You re long distance patriots you are I will not help my country s enemies he had said doggedly Your country s enemies My word Isn t this your country What s the old Kaiser to you He had ordered her out of the house then but she had laughed at him She could always better him in an argument Suppose I do go she had inquired What are you going to live on I m not crazy in the head if you are She rather thought he would strike her He had done it before with the idea of enforcing discipline If he did she would leave him Let him shift for himself He had taken her money for years and he could live on that But he had only glared at her We would have done better to remain in Germany he said America has no respect for parents It has no discipline It is a country without law She felt a weakening in him and followed up her advantage And another thing while we re at it she flung at him Don t you go on trying to shove Rudolph down my throat I m off Rudolph for keeps She flung out her arm and old Herman saw the gleam of something gold on her wrist He caught her hand in his iron grip and shoved up her sleeve There was a tiny gold wrist watch there on a flexible chain His amazement and rage gave her a moment to think although she was terrified Where did you get that The mill gave them to the stenographers for Christmas Why did you not tell me We re not talking much these days are we He let her go then and that night in the little room behind Gustav Shroeder s saloon he put the question to Rudolph Because he was excited and frightened he made slow work of his inquiry and Rudolph had a moment to think Sure he replied All the girls in the executive offices got them But when the meeting was over Rudolph did not go back to his boarding house He walked the streets and thought He had saved Anna from her father But he was of no mind to save her from himself She would have to account to him for that watch Anna herself lay awake until late She saw already the difficulties before her Herman was suspicious He might inquire There were other girls from the mill offices on the hill And he might speak to Rudolph The next evening she found Rudolph waiting for her outside the mill gate Together they started up what had been when Herman bought the cottage a green hill with a winding path But the smoke and ore from the mill had long ago turned it to bareness had killed the trees and shrubbery and filled the little hollows where once the first arbutus had hidden with cinders and ore dust The path had become a crooked street lined with wooden houses and paved with worn and broken bricks Where once Herman Klein had carried his pail and whistled bits of Shubert as he climbed along a long line of blackened men made their evening way Untidy children sat on the curb dogs lay in the center of the road and women in all stages of dishabille hung over the high railings of their porches and watched for their men Under protest of giving her a lift up the hill Rudolph slipped his hand through Anna s left arm Immediately she knew that the movement was a pretext She could not free herself Be good now he cautioned her I ve got you I want to see that watch You let me alone I m going to see that watch With his free hand he felt under her sleeve and drew down the bracelet So the mill gave it to you eh That s a lie and you know it I ll tell you Rudolph she temporized Only don t tell father All the girls have watches and I wanted one So I bought it That s a lie too On the installment plan she insisted A dollar a week that s straight I ve paid five on it already He was almost convinced not quite He unfastened it awkwardly and took it off her wrist It was a plain little octagonal watch and on the back was a monogram The monogram made him suspicious again It s only gold filled Rudolph Pretty classy monogram for a cheap watch He held it close on the dial was the jeweler s name a famous one He said nothing more put it back on Anna s arm and released her At the next corner he left her with a civil enough good bye but with rage in his heart CHAPTER XVII The New year destined to be so crucial came in cheerfully enough There was to be sure a trifle less ostentation in the public celebrations but the usual amount of champagne brought in the most vital year in the history of the nation The customary number of men warmed by that champagne made reckless love to the women who happened to be near them and forgot it by morning And the women themselves presented pictures of splendor of a peculiar gorgeousness The fact that almost coincident with the war there had come into prominence an entirely new school of color formed one of the curious contrasts of the period Into a drab world there flamed strange and bizarre theatrical effects in scenery and costume Some of it was beautiful most of it merely fantastic But it was immediately reflected in the clothing of fashionable women Europe which had originated it could use it but little but great opulent America adopted it and made it her own So while the rest of the world was gray America flamed and Natalie Spencer spending her days between dressmakers and decorators flamed with the rest On New year s Eve Clayton Spencer always preceded the annual ball of the City Club of which he was president by a dinner to the board of governors and their wives It was his dinner He and not Natalie arranged the seating ordered the flowers and planned the menu He took considerable pride in it he liked to think that it was both beautiful and dignified His father had been president before him and he liked to think that he was carrying on his father s custom with the punctilious dignity that had so characterized him He was dressed early Natalie had been closeted with Madeleine her maid and a hair dresser for hours As he went down stairs he could hear her voice raised in querulous protest about something When he went into the library Buckham was there stooping over the fire his austere old face serious and intent Well another year almost gone Buckham he said Yes mister Spencer It would be interesting to know what the New year holds I hope it will bring you peace and happiness sir Thank you And after Buckham had gone he thought that rather a curious New year s wish Peace and happiness Well God knows he wanted both A vague comprehension of the understanding the upper servants of a household acquire as to the inner life of the family stirred in him how much they knew and concealed under their impassive service When Natalie came down the staircase a few minutes later she was swathed in her chinchilla evening wrap and she watched his face after her custom when she expected to annoy him with the furtive look that he had grown to associate with some unpleasantness I hate dressing for a ball at this hour she said rather breathlessly I don t feel half dressed by midnight Madeleine in street costume was behind her with a great box She has something for my hair she explained Her tone was nervous but he was entirely unsuspicious You don t mind if I don t go on to Page s do you I m rather tired and I ought to stay at the club as late as I can Of course not I shall probably pick up some people anyhow Everybody is going on In the car she chattered feverishly and he listened lapsing into one of the silences which her talkative spells always enforced What flowers are you having she asked finally White lilacs and pussy willow Did your orchids come Thanks yes But I m not wearing them My gown is flame color They simply shrieked Flame color A sort of orange she explained And in a slightly defiant tone Rodney s is a costume dance you know Do you mean you are in fancy dress I am indeed He was rather startled The annual dinner of the board of governors of the City Club and their wives was a most dignified function always He was the youngest by far of the men the women were all frankly dowagers They represented the conservative element of the city s social life that element which frowned on smartness and did not even recognize the bizarre It was old fashioned secure in its position influential and slightly tedious There will be plenty in fancy dress Not at the dinner Stodgy old frumps was Natalie s comment I believe you would rather break one of the ten commandments than one of the conventions she added It was when he saw her coming down the staircase in the still empty clubhouse that he realized the reason for her defiant attitude when she acknowledged to fancy dress For she wore a peacock costume of the most daring sort Over an orange foundation eccentric in itself and very short was a vivid tunic covered with peacock feathers on gold tissue with a sweeping tail behind and on her head was the towering chest of a peacock on a gold bandeau She waved a great peacock fan also and half way down the stairs she paused and looked down at him with half frightened eyes Do you like it It is very wonderful he said gravely He could not hurt her Her pleasure in it was too naive It dawned on him then that Natalie was really a child a spoiled and wilful child And always afterward he tried to remember that and to judge her accordingly She came down the upturned wired points of the tunic trembling as she stepped When she came closer he saw that she was made up for the costume ball also her face frankly rouged fine lines under her eyes her lashes blackened She looked very lovely and quite unfamiliar But he had determined not to spoil her evening and he continued gravely smiling You d better like it Clay she said and took a calculating advantage of what she considered a softened mood It cost a thousand dollars She went on past him toward the room where the florist was still putting the finishing touches to the flowers on the table When the first guests arrived she came back and took her place near him and he was uncomfortably aware of the little start of surprise with which she burst upon each new arrival In the old and rather staid surroundings of the club she looked out of place oriental extravagant absurd And Clayton Spencer suffered To draw him as he stood in the club that last year of our peace nineteen sixteen is to draw him not only with his virtues but with his faults his over emphasis on small things his jealousy for his dignity his hatred of the conspicuous and the unusual When after the informal manner of clubs the party went in to dinner he was having one of the bad hours of his life to that time And when as was inevitable the talk of the rather serious table turned to the war it seemed to him that Natalie gorgeous and painted represented the very worst of the country he loved indifference extravagance and ostentatious display But Natalie was not America Thank God Natalie was not America Already with the men she was having a triumph The women soberly clad glanced at each other with raised eye brows and cynical smiles Above the band already playing in the ballroom Clayton could hear old Terry Mackenzie paying Natalie extravagant flagrant compliments You should be sitting in the sun or on a balcony he was saying his eyes twinkling And pretty gentlemen with long curls and their hats tucked under their arms should be feeding you nightingale tongues or whatever it is you eat Bugs said Natalie But tell me Terry bent toward her and missus Terry kept fascinated eyes on him Tell me lovely creature aren t peacocks unlucky Are they What bad luck can happen to me because I dress like this Frightfully bad luck said Terry jovially Some one will undoubtedly carry you away in the course of the evening and go madly through the world hunting a marble balustrade to set you on I ll do it myself if you ll give me any encouragement Perhaps had Clayton Spencer been entirely honest with himself that night he would have acknowledged that he had had a vague hope of seeing Audrey at the club Cars came up discharged their muffled occupants under the awning and drove away again Delight and missus Haverford arrived and he danced with Delight to her great anxiety lest she might not dance well Graham came very late in the wake of Marion Hayden But Audrey did not appear He waited until the New year came in The cotillion was on then and the favors for the midnight figure were gilt cornucopias filled with loose flowers The lights went out for a moment on the hour the twelve strokes were rung on a triangle in the orchestra and there was a moment s quiet Then the light blazed again flowers and confetti were thrown and club servants in livery carried round trays of champagne Clayton standing glass in hand surveyed the scene with a mixture of satisfaction and impatience He found Terry Mackenzie at his elbow Great party Clay he said Well here s to nineteen seventeen and may it bring luck May it bring peace said Clayton and raised his glass Some time later going home in the car with missus Mackenzie quiet and slightly grim beside him Terry spoke out of a thoughtful silence There s something wrong with Clay he said If ever a fellow had a right to be happy he has a queer look Have you noticed it Anybody married to Natalie Spencer would develop what you call a queer look she replied tartly Don t you think he is in love with her If you ask me I think he has reached the point where he can t bear the sight of her But he doesn t know it She s pretty So is a lamp shade replied missus Terry acidly Or a kitten or a fancy ice cream But you wouldn t care to be married to them would you It was almost dawn when Natalie came in Clayton had not been asleep He had got to thinking rather feverishly of the New year Without in any way making a resolution he had determined to make it a better year than the last to be more gentle with Natalie more understanding with Graham to use his new prosperity wisely to forget his own lack of happiness in making others happy He was very vague about that The search of the ages the rector had called happiness and one found it by giving it To his surprise Natalie came into his bedroom looking like some queer oriental bird vivid and strangely unlike herself I saw your light Heavens what a party I m glad you enjoyed it I hope you didn t mind my not going on I wish you had Clay you ll never guess what happened Probably not What Well Audrey just made it that s all Funny I wish you d seen some of their faces Of course she was disgraceful but she took it off right away But it was like her no one else would have dared His mouth felt dry Audrey disgraceful It was in the stable you know I told you And just at midnight the doors opened and a big white horse leaped in with Audrey on his back No saddle nothing She was dressed like a bare back rider in the circus short tulle skirts and tights They nearly mobbed her with joy She yawned Well I m off to bed He roused himself A happy New year my dear Thanks she said and wandered out her absurd feathered tail trailing behind her He lay back and closed his eyes So Audrey had done that Audrey who had been in his mind all those sleepless hours for he knew now that back of all his resolutions to do better had been the thought of her He felt disappointed and bitter The sad disillusion of the middle years still heroically clinging to faiths that one after another destroyed themselves was his CHAPTER XVIII Audrey was frightened She did not care a penny s worth what her little world thought Indeed she knew that she had given it a new thrill and so had won its enthusiastic approval She was afraid of what Clayton would think She was absurdly quiet and virtuous all the next day gathered out her stockings and mended them began a personal expenditure account for the New year heading it carefully with darning silk fifty cents wrote a long letter to Chris and listened for the telephone If only he would call her so she could explain Still what could she explain She had done it It was water over the dam and it is no fault of Audrey s that she would probably have spelled it damn By noon she was fairly abject She did not analyze her own anxiety or why the recollection of her escapade which would a short time before have filled her with a sort of unholy joy now turned her sick and trembling Then in the middle of the afternoon Clay called her up She gasped a little when she heard his voice I wanted to tell you Audrey he said that we can probably use the girl you spoke about rather soon Very well Thank you Is wasn t there something else too Something else You are angry aren t you He hesitated Surprised Not angry I haven t any possible right to be angry Will you come up and let me tell you about it Clay I don t see how that will help any It will help me He laughed at that her new humility was so unlike her Why of course I ll come Audrey he said and as he rang off he was happier than he had been all day He was coming Audrey moved around the little room adjusting chairs rearranging the flowers that had poured in on New year s day brushing the hearth And as she worked she whistled He would be getting into the car now He would be so far on his way He would be almost there She ran into her bedroom and powdered her nose with her lips puckered still whistling and her heart singing But he scolded her thoroughly at first Why on earth did you do it he finished I still can t understand I see you one day gravity itself a serious young woman as you are to day And then I hear it isn t like you Audrey Oh yes it is It s exactly like me Like one me There are others of course She told him then making pitiful confession of her own pride and her anxiety to spare Chris s name I couldn t bear to have them suspect he had gone to the war because of a girl Whatever he ran away from Clay he s doing all right now He listened gravely with toward the end a jealousy he would not have acknowledged even to himself Was it possible that she still loved Chris Might she not after the fashion of women be building a new and idealized Chris now that he had gone to war out of his very common clay He has done splendidly he agreed Again the warmth and coziness of the little room enveloped him Audrey s low huskily sweet voice her quick smile her new and unaccustomed humility and the odd sense of her understanding comforted him She made her indefinite appeal to the best that was in him Nothing so ennobles a man as to have some woman believe in his nobility Clay she said suddenly you are worrying about something Nothing that won t straighten out in time Would it help to talk about it He realized that he had really come to her to talk about it It had been in the back of his head all the time I m rather anxious about Graham Toots Hayden Partly I m afraid she s got him Clay There isn t a trick in the game she doesn t know He had about as much chance as I have of being twenty again She wants to make a wealthy marriage and she s picked on Graham That s all It isn t only Marion I m afraid there s another girl a girl at the mill his stenographer I have no proof of anything In fact I don t think there is anything yet She s in love with him probably or she thinks she is I happened on them together and she looked Of course if what you say about Marion is true he can not care for her even well in any way Oh nonsense Clay A man especially a boy can love a half dozen girls He can be crazy about any girl he is with It may not be love but it plays the same tricks with him that the real thing does I can t believe that No You wouldn t She leaned back and watched him How much of a boy he was himself anyhow And yet how little he understood the complicated problems of a boy like Graham irresponsible but responsive rich without labor with time for the sort of dalliance Clay himself at the same age had had neither leisure nor inclination to indulge He was wandering about the room his hands in his pockets his head bent When he stopped What am I to do with the girl Audrey Get rid of her That s easy Not so easy as it sounds He told her of Dunbar and the photographs of Rudolph Klein and the problem as he saw it So there I am he finished If I let her go I lose one of the links in Dunbar s chain If I keep her Can t Natalie talk to him Sometimes a woman can get to the bottom of these things when a man can t He might tell her all about it Possibly But I think it unlikely Natalie would tell me She leaned over and patted his hand impulsively What devils we women are she said Now and then one of us gets what she deserves That s me And now and then one of us get s something she doesn t deserve And that s Natalie She s over indulgent to Graham He is all she has She has you Something in her voice made him turn and look at her That ought to be something you know she added And laughed a little Does Natalie pay his debts I rather think so But that was a subject he could not go on with The fault is mine I know my business better than I know how to handle my life or my family I don t know why I trouble you with it all anyhow You have enough He hesitated That s not exactly true either I do know I m relying on your woman s wit to help me I m wrong somehow About Graham I have a curious feeling that I am losing him I can t ask for his confidence I can t apparently even deserve it I see him day after day with all the good stuff there is in him working as little as he can drinking more than he should out half the night running into debt good heavens Audrey what can I do She hesitated Of course you know one thing that would save him Clay What Our getting into the war I ought not to have to lose my boy in order to find him But we are going to be in it He had risen and was standing an elbow on the mantel piece looking down at her I suppose every man wonders once in a while how he d conduct himself in a crisis When the Lusitania went down I dare say a good many fellows wondered if they d have been able to keep their coward bodies out of the boats I know I did And I wonder about myself now What can I do if we go into the war I couldn t do a forced march of more than five miles I can t drill or whatever they call it I can shoot clay pigeons but I don t believe I could hit a German coming at me with a bayonet at twenty feet I d be pretty much of a total loss Yet I ll want to do something And when she sat very silent looking into the fire You see you think it absurd yourself Hardly absurd she roused herself to look up at him If it is it s the sort of splendid absurdity I am proud of I was wondering what Natalie would say I don t believe it lies between a man and his wife It s between him and his God He was rather ashamed of that however and soon after he went away CHAPTER XIX Natalie Spencer was finding life full of interest that winter Now and then she read the headings in the newspapers not because she was really interested but that she might say at the dinner party which was to her the proper end of a perfect day What do you think of Turkey declaring her independence Or I see we have taken the Etoile Wood Clayton had overheard her more than once and had marveled at the dexterity with which these leaders thrown out she was able to avoid committing herself further The new house engrossed her She was seeing a great deal of Rodney too and now and then she had fancied that there was a different tone in Rodney s voice when he addressed her She never analyzed that tone or what it suggested but it gave her a new interest in life She was always marceled massaged freshly manicured And she had found a new facial treatment Clayton in his room at night could hear the sharp slapping of flesh on flesh as Madeleine gently pounded certain expensive creams into the skin of her face and neck She refused all forms of war activity although now and then she put some appeal before Clayton and asked him if he cared to send a check He never suggested that she answer any of these demands personally after an experience early in the winter Why don t you send it yourself he had asked Wouldn t you like it to go in your name It doesn t matter I don t know any of the committee He had tried to explain what he meant You might like to feel that you are doing something I thought my allowance was only to dress on If I m to attend to charities too you ll have to increase it But he argued patiently if you only sent them twenty five dollars did without some little thing to do it you d feel rather more as though you were giving wouldn t you Twenty five dollars And be laughed at He had given in then If I put an extra thousand dollars to your account to morrow will you check it out to this fund It s too much Will you Yes of course she had agreed indifferently And he had notified her that the money was in the bank But two months later the list of contributors was published and neither his name nor Natalie s was among them Toward personal service she had no inclination whatever She would promise anything but the hour of fulfilling always found her with something else to do Yet she had kindly impulses at times when something occurred to take her mind from herself She gave liberally to street mendicants She sent her car to be used by those of her friends who had none She was lavish with flowers to the sick although Clayton paid her florist bills She was lavish with money but never with herself In the weeks after the opening of the new year Clayton found himself watching her He wondered sometimes just what went on in her mind during the hours when she sat her hands folded gazing into space He could not tell He surmised her planning always planning the new house a gown a hat a party But late in January he began to think that she was planning something else Old Terry Mackenzie had been there one night and he had asserted not only that war was coming but that we would be driven to conscription to raise an army They ve all had to come to it he insisted And we will as sure as God made little fishes You can t raise a million volunteers for a war that s three thousand miles away You mean conscription among the laboring class Natalie had asked naively and there had been a roar of laughter Not at all Terry had said And chuckled This war if it comes is every man s burden rich and poor Only the rich will give most because they have most to give I think that s ridiculous Natalie had said It was after that that Clayton began to wonder what she was planning He came home late one afternoon to find that they were spending the evening in and to find a very serious Natalie waiting when he came down stairs dressed for dinner She made an effort to be conversational but it was a failure He was uneasily aware that she was watching him inspecting calculating choosing her moment But it was not until they were having coffee that she spoke I m uneasy about Graham Clay He looked up quickly Yes I think he ought to go away somewhere He ought to stay here and make a man of himself he came out almost in spite of himself He knew well enough that such a note always roused Natalie s antagonism and he waited for the storm But none came He s not doing very well is he He s not failing entirely But he gives the best of himself outside the mill That s all She puzzled him Had she heard of Marion Don t you think if he was away from this silly crowd he plays with as he calls it that he would be better off Where for instance You keep an agent in England He could go there Or to Russia if the Russian contract goes through He was still puzzled But why England or Russia Anywhere out of this country He doesn t have to leave this country to get away from a designing woman From her astonished expression he knew that he had been wrong She was not trying to get him away from Marion From what She bent forward her face set hard What woman Well it was out She might as well know it Don t you think it possible Natalie that he may intend to marry Marion Hayden There was a very unpleasant half hour after that Marion was a parasite of the rich She had abused Natalie s hospitality She was designing She played bridge for her dress money She had ensnared the boy And then That settles it I should think He ought to leave America If you have a single thought for his welfare you ll send him to England Then you hadn t known about Marion when you proposed that before No I knew he was not doing well And I m anxious After all he s my boy He is I know he supplemented gravely He is all you have But I still don t understand why he must leave America It was not until she had gone up stairs to her room leaving him uneasily pacing the library floor that he found the solution Old Terry Mackenzie and his statement about conscription Natalie wanted Graham sent out of the country so he would be safe She would purchase for hint a shameful immunity if war came She would stultify the boy to keep him safe In that hour of clear vision he saw how she had always stultified the boy to keep him safe He saw her life a series of small subterfuges of petty indulgences of little plots against himself all directed toward securing Graham immunity from trouble at school from debt from his own authority A wave of unreasoning anger surged over him but with it there was pity too pity for the narrowness of her life and her mind pity for her very selfishness And for the first time in his life he felt a shamefaced pity for himself He shook himself violently When a man got sorry for himself CHAPTER XX Rudolph Klein had not for a moment believed Anna s story about the watch and on the day after he discovered it on her wrist he verified his suspicions During his noon hour he went up town and with the confident swagger of a certain type of man who feels himself out of place entered the jeweler s shop in question He had to wait for some little time and he spent it in surveying contemptuously the contents of the show cases That even his wildest estimate fell far short of their value he did not suspect but his lips curled This was where the money earned by honest workmen was spent that women might gleam with such gewgaws Wall Street bought them Wall Street which was forcing this country into the war to protect its loans to the Allies America was to pull England s chestnuts out of the fire that women and yet more women might wear those strings of pearls those glittering diamond baubles Into his crooked mind there flashed a line from a speech at the Third Street hall the night before War is hell Let those who want to go to hell So Wall Street bought pearls for its women and the dissolute sons of the rich bought gold wrist watches for girls they wanted to seduce The expression on his face was so terrible that the clerk behind the counter waiting to find what he wanted was startled I want to look at gold wrist watches he said And eyed the clerk for a trace of patronage Ladies Yes He finally found one that was a duplicate of Anna s and examined it carefully Yes it was the same the maker s name on the dial the space for the monogram on the back everything How much is this one One hundred dollars He almost dropped it A hundred dollars Then he remembered Anna s story Have you any gold filled ones that look like this We do not handle gold filled cases He put it down and turned to go Then he stopped Don t sell on the installment plan either I suppose The sneer in his voice was clearer than his anxiety In his mind he already knew the answer Sorry No He went out So he had been right That young skunk had paid a hundred dollars for a watch for Anna To Rudolph it meant but one thing That had been early in January For some days he kept his own counsel thinking planning watching He was jealous of Graham but with a calculating jealousy that set him wondering how to turn his knowledge to his own advantage And Anna s lack of liberty comforted him somewhat He couldn t meet her outside the mill at least not without his knowing it He established a system of espionage over her that drove her almost to madness What re you hanging round for she would demand when he stepped forward at the mill gate D you suppose I never want to be by myself Or You just go away Rudolph Klein I m going up with some of the girls But she never lost him He was beside her or at her heels his small crafty eyes on her When he walked behind her there was a sensuous gleam in them After a few weeks she became terrified There was a coldness of deviltry in him she knew And he had the whip hand She was certain he knew about the watch and her impertinence masked an agony of fear Suppose he went to her father Why if he knew didn t he go to her father She suspected him but she did not know of what She knew he was an enemy of all government save that of the mob that he was an incendiary a firebrand who set on fire the brutish passions of a certain type of malcontents She knew for all he pretended to be the voice of labor he no more represented the honest labor of the country than he represented law and order She watched him sometimes at the table when on Sundays he ate the mid day meal with them his thin hatchet face his prominent epiglottis He wore a fresh cotton shirt then with a flaming necktie but he did not clean his fingernails And his talk was always of tearing down never of building up Just give us time and we ll show them he often said And them was always the men higher up He hated policemen He and Herman had had many arguments about policemen Herman was not like Rudolph He believed in law and order He even believed in those higher up But he believed very strongly in the fraternity of labor Until the first weeks of that New year Herman Klein outside the tyranny of his home life represented very fairly a certain type of workman believing in the dignity and integrity of his order But with his failure to relocate himself something went wrong in Herman He developed in his obstinate stubborn German head a suspicion of the land of his adoption He had never troubled to understand it He had taken it for granted as he took for granted that Anna should work and turn over her money to him Now it began to ask things of him Not much A delegation of women came around one night and asked him for money for Belgian Relief The delegation came because no one woman would venture alone I have no money for Belgians he said He would not let them come in Why should I help the Belgians Liars and hypocrites The story went about the neighborhood and he knew it He cared nothing for popularity but he resented losing his standing in the community And all along he was convinced that he was right that the Belgians had lied There had been in the Germany he had left no such will to wanton killing These people were ignorant Out of the depths of their ignorance they talked He read only German newspapers In the little room back of Gustav Shroeder s he met only Germans And always at his elbow there was Rudolph Until the middle of January Rudolph had not been able to get him to one of his incendiary meetings Then one cold night while Anna sewed by the lamp inside the little house Rudolph and Herman walked in the frozen garden Herman with his pipe Rudolph with the cheap cigarets he used incessantly Anna opened the door a crack and listened at first She was watchful of Rudolph always those days But the subject was not Anna You think we get in then Herman asked Sure But for what So Spencers can make more money out of it said Rudolph bitterly And others like them But they and their kind don t do the dying It s the workers that go and die Look at Germany Yes It is so in Germany All this talk about democracy that s bunk Just plain bunk Why should the workers in this country kill the workers in another Why To make money for capital more money Ja Herman assented That is what war is Always the same I came here to get away from war Well you didn t get far enough You left a king behind but we ve got a Czar here Herman was slowly methodically following an earlier train of thought I am a workman he said I would not fight against other workmen Just as I a German will not fight against other Germans But you would sit here on the hill and do nothing What can I do One man and with no job Come to the meeting to night You and your meetings the old German said impatiently You talk That s all Rudolph lowered his voice You think we only talk eh Well you come and hear some things Talk You come he coaxed changing his tone And we ll have some beer and schnitzel at Gus s after My treat How about it Old Herman assented He was tired of the house tired of the frozen garden tired of scolding the slovenly girl who pottered around all day in a boudoir cap and slovenly wrapper Tired of Anna s rebellious face and pert answers He went inside the house and put a sweater under his coat and got his cap I go out he said to the impassive figure under the lamp You will stay in Oh I don t know I may take a walk You will stay in he repeated and followed Rudolph outside There he reached in secured the key and locked the door on the outside Anna listening and white with anger heard his ponderous steps going around to the back door and the click as he locked that one also Beast she muttered German schwein It was after midnight when she heard him coming back She prepared to leap out of her bed when he came up stairs to confront him angrily and tell him she was through She was leaving home But long after she had miserably cried herself to sleep Herman sat below his long stemmed pipe in his teeth his stockinged feet spread to the dying fire In that small guarded hail that night he had learned many surprising things there and at Gus s afterward The Fatherland s war was already being fought in America and not only by Germans The workers of the world had banded themselves together according to the night s speakers And because they were workers they would not fight the German workers It was all perfectly simple With the cooperation of the workers of the world which recognized no country but a vast brotherhood of labor it was possible to end war all war In the meantime while all the workers all over the world were being organized one prevented as much as possible any assistance going to capitalistic England One did some simple thing started a strike or sawed lumber too short or burned a wheat field or put nails in harvesting machinery or missent perishable goods or changed signal lights on railroads or drove copper nails into fruit trees so they died This was a pity the fruit trees But at least they did not furnish fruit for Germany s enemies So each one did but one thing and that small so small that it was difficult to discover But there were two hundred thousand men to do them according to Rudolph and that meant a great deal Only one thing about the meeting Herman had not liked There were packages of wicked photographs going about Filthy things When they came to him he had dropped them on the floor What had they to do with Germany s enemies or preventing America from going into the war Rudolph laughed when he dropped them They won t bite you he had said and had stooped to pick them up But Herman had kept his foot on them So America would go into the war against the Fatherland unless many hundreds of thousands did each their little bit And if they did not America would go in and fight for England to control the seas and the Spencer plant would make millions of shells that honest German workers sweat brothers of the world might die He remembered word for word the peroration of the evening s speech We would extend the hand of brotherhood to the so called enemy and strangle the cry for war in the fat white throats of the blood bloated money lenders of Wall Street before it became articulate He was very tired He stooped and picked up his shoes and with them in his hand drawn to his old time military erectness he stood for some time before the gilt framed picture on the wall Then he went slowly and ponderously up stairs to bed CHAPTER XXI From the moment the day before Christmas when Graham had taken the little watch from his pocket and fastened it on Anna s wrist he was rather uneasily aware that she had become his creature He had had no intention of buying Anna He was certainly not in love with her But he found her amusing and at times comforting He had of course expected to lose her after the unlucky day when Clayton had found them together but Dunbar had advised that she be kept on for a time at least Mentally Graham figured that the first of January would see her gone and the thought of a Christmas present for her was partly compounded of remorse He had been buying a cigaret case for Marion when the thought came to him He had not bought a Christmas present for a girl except flowers since the first year he was at college He had sent Delight one that year a half dozen little leather bound books of poetry What a precious young prig he must have been He knew now that girls only pretended to care for books They wanted jewelry and they got past the family with it by pretending it was not real or that they had bought it out of their allowances One of Toots friends was taking a set of silver fox from a man and she was as straight as a die Oh he knew girls now The next day he asked Anna Klein What would you like for Christmas Anna however had insisted that she did not want a Christmas present Later on however she had seen a watch one of the girls on the hill had bought for twelve dollars and on his further insistence a day or so later she had said Do you really want to know Of course I do You oughtn t to spend money on me you know You let me attend to that Now out with it So she told him rather nervously for she felt that twelve dollars was a considerable sum He had laughed and agreed instantly but when he went to buy it he found himself paying a price that rather startled him Don t you lose it young lady he admonished her when the day before Christmas he fastened it on her wrist Then he had stooped down to kiss her and the intensity of feeling in her face had startled him It s a good watch he had said rather uneasily no excuse for your being late now All the rest of the day she was radiant He meant well enough even then He had never pretended to love her He accepted her adoration petted and teased her in return worked off his occasional ill humors on her was indeed conscious sometimes that he was behaving extremely well in keeping things as they were But by the middle of January he began to grow uneasy The atmosphere at Marion s was bad there was a knowledge of life plus an easy toleration of certain human frailties that was as insidious as a slow fever The motto of live and let live prevailed And Marion refused to run away with him and marry him or to let him go to his father In his office all day long there was Anna so yielding so surely his to take if he wished Already he knew that things there must either end or go forward Human emotions do not stand still they either advance or go back and every impulse of his virile young body was urging him on He made at last an almost frenzied appeal to Marion to marry him at once but she refused flatly I m not going to ruin you she said If you can t bring your people round we ll just have to wait They d be all right once it is done Not if I know your father Oh he d be all right in ten years or so But what about the next two or three We d have to live wouldn t we He lay awake most of the night thinking things over Did she really care for him as Anna cared for instance She was always talking about their having to live If they couldn t manage on his salary for a while then it was because Marion did not care enough to try For the first time he began to question Marion s feeling for him She had been rather patronizing him lately He had overheard her once speaking of him as a nice kid and it rankled In sheer assertion of his manhood he met Anna Klein outside the mill at the noon hour the next day and took her for a little ride in his car After that he repeatedly did the same thing choosing infrequented streets and roads dining with her sometimes at a quiet hotel out on the Freeland road How do you get away with this to your father he asked her once Tell him you re getting ready to move out to the new plant and we re working He s not round much in the evenings now He s at meetings or swilling beer at Gus s saloon They re a bad lot Graham that crowd at Gus s How do you mean bad Well they re Germans for one thing the sort that shouts about the Fatherland They make me sick Let s forget them honey said Graham and reaching under the table cloth caught and held one of her hands He was beginning to look at things with the twisted vision of Marion s friends He intended only to flirt a little with Anna Klein but he considered that he was extremely virtuous and perhaps a bit of a fool for letting things go at that Once indeed Tommy Hale happened on them in a road house sitting very quietly with a glass of beer before Graham and a lemonade in front of Anna and had winked at him as though he had received him into the brotherhood of those who were seeing life Then near the end of January events took another step forward Rudolph Klein was discharged from the mill Clayton coming down one morning found the manager Hutchinson and Dunbar in his office The two men had had a difference of opinion and the matter was laid before him He is a constant disturbing element Hutchinson finished I understand mister Dunbar s position but we can t afford to have the men thrown into a ferment constantly If you discharge him you rouse his suspicions and those of his gang said Dunbar sturdily There is a gang then A gang My God In the end however Clayton decided to let Rudolph go Hutchinson was insistent Production was falling down One or two accidents to the machinery lately looked like sabotage He had found a black cat crudely drawn on the cement pavement outside his office door that very morning the black cat being the symbol of those I W W s who advocated destruction What about the girl Dunbar asked when the manager had gone I have kept her against my better judgment mister Dunbar For just a moment Dunbar hesitated He knew certain things that Clayton Spencer did not things that it was his business to know The girl might be valuable one of these days She was in love with young Spencer The time might come when he Dunbar would need to capitalize that love and use it against Rudolph and the rest of the crowd that met in the little room behind Shroeder s saloon It was too bad in a way He was sorry for this man with the strong repressed face and kindly mouth who sat across from him But these were strange times A man could not be too scrupulous Better keep her on for a month or two anyhow he said They re up to something and I miss my guess if it isn t directed against you How about Herman Klein Nothing doing stated mister Dunbar flatly Our informer is tending bar at Gus s Herman listens and drinks their beer but he s got the German fear of authority in him He s a beer socialist That s all But in that mister Dunbar left out of account the innate savagery that lurked under Herman s phlegmatic surface You don t think it would do if she was moved to another office The point is this Dunbar moved his chair forward The time may come when we will need the girl as an informer Rudolph Klein is infatuated with her Now I understand that she has a certain feeling of loyalty to mister Graham In that case he glanced at Clayton the welfare of the many mister Spencer against the few For a long time after he was gone Clayton sat at his desk thinking Every instinct in him revolted against the situation thus forced on him There was something wrong with Dunbar s reasoning Then it flashed on him that Dunbar probably was right and that their points of view were bitterly opposed Dunbar would have no scruples because he was not quite a gentleman But war was a man s game It was not the time for fine distinctions of ethics And Dunbar was certainly a man If only he could talk it over with Natalie But he knew Natalie too well to expect any rational judgment from her She would demand at once that the girl should go Yet he needed a woman s mind on it In any question of relationship between the sexes men were creatures of impulse but women had plotted and planned through the ages They might lose their standards but never their heads Not that he put such a thought into words He merely knew that women were better at such things than men That afternoon as a result of much uncertainty he took his problem to Audrey And Audrey gave him an answer You ve got to think of the mill Clay she said The Dunbar man is right And all you or any other father of a boy can do is to pray in season and to trust to Graham s early training And all the repressed bitterness in Clayton Spencer s heart was in his answer He never had any early training Audrey Oh he had certain things His manners for instance But other things I ought not to say that It was my fault too I m not blaming only Natalie Only now when it is all we have to count on He was full of remorse when he started for home He felt guilty of every disloyalty And in masculine fashion he tried to make up to Natalie for the truth that had been wrung from him He carried home a great bunch of roses for her But he carried home too a feeling of comfort and vague happiness as though the little room behind him still reached out and held him in its warm embrace CHAPTER XXII In the evening of the thirty first of January Clayton and Graham were waiting for Natalie to come down to dinner when the bell rang and Dunbar was announced Graham welcomed the interruption He had been vaguely uneasy with his father since that day in his office when Clayton had found him on Anna Klein s desk Clayton had tried to restore the old friendliness of their relation but the boy had only half heartedly met his advances Now and then he himself made an overture but it was the almost timid advance of a puppy that has been beaten It left Clayton discouraged and alarmed set him to going back over the past for any severity on his part to justify it Now and then he wondered if in Graham s frequent closetings with Natalie she did not covertly undermine his influence with the boy to increase her own But if she did why What was going on behind the impassive lovely mask that was her face Dunbar was abrupt as usual I ve brought you some news mister Spencer he said He looked oddly vital and alive in the subdued and quiet room They ve shown their hand at last But maybe you ve heard it I ve heard nothing new Then listen said Dunbar bending forward over a table much as it was his habit to bend over Clayton s desk We re in it at last Or as good as in it Unrestricted submarine warfare All merchant ships bound to and from Allied ports to be sunk without warning We re to be allowed mark this it s funny we re to be allowed to send one ship a week to England nicely marked and carrying passengers only There was a little pause Clayton drew a long breath That means war he said finally Hell turned over and stirred up with a pitch fork if we have any backbone at all agreed Dunbar He turned to Graham You young fellows ll be crazy about this You bet we will said Graham Clayton slipped an arm about the boy s shoulders He could not speak for a moment All at once he saw what the news meant He saw Graham going into the horror across the sea He saw vast lines of marching men boys like Graham boys who had frolicked through their careless days whistled and played and slept sound of nights now laden like pack animals and carrying the implements of death in their hands going forward to something too terrible to contemplate And a certain sure percentage of them would never come back His arm tightened about the boy When he withdrew it Graham straightened If it s war it s my war father And Clayton replied quietly It is your war old man Dunbar turned his back and inspected Natalie s portrait When he faced about again Graham was lighting a cigaret and Natalie herself was entering the room In her rose colored satin she looked exotic beautiful and Dunbar gave her a fleeting glance of admiration as he bowed She looked too young to have a boy going to war Behind her he suddenly saw other women thousands of other women living luxurious lives sheltered and pampered and suddenly called on to face sacrifice without any training for it Didn t know you were going out he said Sorry I ll run along now We are dining at home said Natalie coldly She remained standing near the door as a hint to the shabby gentleman with the alert eyes who stood by the table But Dunbar had forgotten her already I came here right away he explained because you may be having trouble now In fact I m pretty sure you will If we declare war to morrow as we may War said Natalie and took a step forward Dunbar remembered her We will probably declare war in a day or two The Germans But Natalie was looking at Clayton with a hostility in her eyes she took no trouble to conceal I hope you ll be happy now You ve been talking war wanting war and now you ve got it She turned and went out of the room The three men in the library below heard her go up the stairs and the slam of her door behind her Later on she sent word that she did not care for any dinner and Clayton asked Dunbar to remain Practical questions as to the mill were discussed Graham entering into them with a new interest He was flushed and excited But Clayton was rather white and very quiet Once Graham took advantage of Dunbar s preoccupation with his asparagus to say You don t object to the aviation service father Wherever you think you can be useful After coffee Graham rose I ll go and speak to mother he said And Clayton felt in him a new manliness It was as though his glance said She is a woman you know War is men s work work for you and me But it s hard on them Afterward Clayton was to remember with surprise how his friends gathered that night at the house Nolan came in early his twisted grin rather accentuated his tall frame more than usually stooped He stood in the doorway of the library one hand in his pocket a familiar attitude which made him look oddly boyish Well he drawled without greeting They ve done it The English have got us We hadn t a chance The little Welshman Come in Clayton said and talk like an American and not an Irishman I don t want to know what you think about Lloyd George What are you going to do I was thinking Nolan observed advancing of blowing up Washington We d have a fresh start you see With Washington gone root and branch we would have some sort of chance a clear sweep with the capital here or in Boston Or London Clayton laughed Behind Nolan s cynicism he felt a real disturbance But Dunbar eyed him uncertainly He didn t know about some of these Irish They d fight like hell of course if only they d forget England Don t worry about Washington Clayton said Let it work out its own problems We will have our own What do you suppose men like you and myself are going to do We can t fight Nolan settled himself in a long chair Why can t we fight he asked I heard something the other day Roosevelt is going to take a division abroad older men I rather like the idea Wherever he goes there ll be fighting I m no Rough Rider God knows but I haven t spent a half hour every noon in a gymnasium for the last ten years for nothing And I can shoot And you are free Clayton observed quietly Nolan looked up It s going to be hard on the women he said You re all right They won t let you go You re too useful where you are But of course there s the boy When Clayton made no reply Nolan glanced at him again I suppose he ll want to go he suggested Clayton s face was set For more than an hour now Graham had been closeted with his mother and as the time went on and no slam of a door up stairs told of his customary method of leaving a room he had been conscious of a growing uneasiness The boy was soft the fiber in him had not been hardened yet not enough to be proof against tears He wanted desperately to leave Nolan to go up and learn what arguments what coaxing and selfish whimperings Natalie was using with the boy But he wanted also desperately to have the boy fight his own fight and win He will want to go I think Of course his mother will be shaken just now It ll all new to her She wouldn t believe it was coming He ll go Nolan said reflectively They ll all go the best of them first After all we ve been making a lot of noise about wanting to get into the thing Now we re in and that s the first price we pay the boys A door slammed up stairs and Clayton heard Graham coming down He passed the library door however and Clayton suddenly realized that he was going out Graham he called Graham stopped and came back slowly Yes father he said from the doorway Aren t you coming in I thought I d go out for a hit of a spin if you don t mind Evening mister Nolan The boy was shaken Clayton knew it from his tone All the fine vigor of the early evening was gone And an overwhelming rage filled him against Natalie against himself even against the boy Trouble which should have united his house had divided it The first threat of trouble indeed You can go out later he said rather sharply We ought to talk things over Graham This is a mighty serious time What s the use of talking things over father We don t know anything but that we may declare war That s enough isn t it But he was startled when he saw Graham s face He was very pale and his eyes already looked furtive They were terribly like Natalie s eyes sometimes The frankness was gone out of them He came into the room and stood there rigid I promised mother to get her some sleeping powders Sleeping powders She s nervous Bad things sleeping powders said Nolan Get her to take some setting up exercises by an open window and she ll sleep like a top Do you mind if I go father Clayton saw that it was of no use to urge the boy Graham wanted to avoid him wanted to avoid an interview The early glow of the evening faded Once again the sense of having lost his son almost overwhelmed him Very well he said stiffly And Graham went out However he did not leave the house At the door he met Doctor Haverford And Delight and Clayton heard the clergyman s big bass booming through the hall like a lamb to the slaughter he was saying And I a man of peace When he came into the library he was still holding forth with an affectation of rage I ask you Clayton he said what refuge is there for a man of peace My own child leading me out into the night and inquiring on the way over if I did not feel that the commandment not to kill was a serious error Of course he s going she said He has been making the most outrageous excuses just to hear mother and me reply to them And all the time nothing would hold him back My dear said the rector solemnly T shall have to tell you something I shall have to lay bare the secrets of my heart How are you Nolan Delight they will not take me I have three back teeth on a plate I have never told you this before I did not wish to ruin your belief that I am perfect But In the laugh that greeted this Graham returned He was Clayton saw vaguely puzzled by the rector and rather incredulous as to Delight s attitude Do you really want him to go he asked her Of course Aren t you going Isn t everybody who is worth anything going I d go myself if I could You don t know how lucky you are But is your Mother willing Why what sort of a mother do you think I have Clayton overheard that and he saw Graham wince His own hands clenched What a power in the world a brave woman was And what evil could be wrought by a woman without moral courage a selfish woman He brought himself up short at that Others came in Hutchinson from the mill Terry Mackenzie Rodney Page in evening clothes and on his way from the opera to something or other In a corner Graham and Delight talked The rector in a high state of exaltation was inclined to be oratorical and a trifle noisy He dilated on the vast army that would rise overnight at the call He considered the raising of a company from his own church and nominated Clayton as its captain Nolan grinned sardonically Precisely he said dryly Clayton because he looks like a Greek god is ideally fitted to lead a lot of men who never saw a bayonet outside of a museum Against trained fighting men There s a difference you know dominie between a clay pigeon and a German with a bomb in one hand and a saw toothed bayonet in the other We did that in the Civil War We did And it took four years to fight a six months war We must have an army I daresay you ll grant that Well you can bet on one thing we re not going to have every ward boss who wants to make a record raising a regiment out of his henchmen and leading them to death What would you suggest inquired the rector rather crestfallen I d suggest training men as officers And then a draft Never come to it in the world Hutchinson spoke up I ve heard men in the mill talking They ll go some of them but they won t be driven It would be civil war Clayton glanced at Graham as he replied The boy was leaning forward listening There s this to be said for the draft he said Under the volunteer system the best of our boys will go first That s what happened in England And they were wiped out It s every man s war now There is no reason why the few should be sacrificed for the many And there s this too Graham broke in He was flushed and nervous A fellow would have to go He wouldn t be having to think whether his going would hurt anybody or not He wouldn t have to decide He d just go There was a little hush in the room Then Nolan spoke Right o he said The only trouble about it is that it s likely to leave out some of us old chaps who d like to have a fist in it Hutchinson remained after the others had gone He wanted to discuss the change in status of the plant We ll be taken over by the government probably Clayton told him They have all the figures capacity and so on The Ordnance Department has that in hand Hutchinson nodded He had himself made the report We ll have to look out more than ever I suppose he said as he rose to go The government is guarding all bridges and railways already Met a lot of National Guard boys on the way Graham left when he did offering to take him to his home and Clayton sat for some time alone smoking and thinking So the thing had come at last A year from now and where would they all be The men who had been there to night himself Graham Would they all be even living Would Graham He looked back over the years Graham a baby splashing water in his bath and shrieking aloud with joy Graham in his first little boy clothes riding a velocipede in the park and bringing in bruises of an amazing size and blackness Graham going away to school and manfully fixing his mind on his first long trousers so he would not cry Graham at college coming in with the winning crew and stumbling half collapsed into the arms of a waiting cheering crowd And the Graham who had followed his mother up the stairs that night to come down baffled thwarted miserable He rose and threw away his cigar He must have the thing out with Natalie The boy s soul was more important than his body He wanted him safe God how he wanted him safe But he wanted him to be a man Natalie s room was dark when he went in He hesitated Then he heard her in bed sobbing quietly He was angry at himself for his impatience at the sound He stood beside the bed and forced a gentleness he did not feel Can I get you anything he asked No thank you And he moved toward the lamp Don t turn the light on I look dreadful Shall I ring for Madeleine No Graham is bringing me a sleeping powder If you are not sleepy may I talk to you about some things I m sick Clay My head is bursting Sometimes it helps to talk out our worries dear He was still determinedly gentle He heard her turning her pillow and settling herself more comfortably Not to you You ve made up your mind What s the use Made up my mind to what To sending Graham to be killed That s hardly worthy of you Natalie he said gravely He is my son too I love him at least as much as you do I don t think this is really up to us anyhow It is up to him If he wants to go She sat up suddenly her voice thin and high How does he know what he wants she demanded He s too young He doesn t know what war is you say so yourself You say he is too young to have a position worth while at the plant but of course he s old enough to go to war and have a leg shot off or to be blinded or something Her voice broke He sat down on the bed and felt around until he found her hand But she jerked it from him You promised me once to let him make his own decision if the time came When did I promise that In the fall when I came home from England I never made such a promise Will you make it now No He rose more nearly despairing than he had ever been He could not argue with a hysterical woman He hated cowardice but far deeper than that was his conviction that she had already exacted some sort of promise And the boy was not like her in that respect He regarded a promise as almost in the nature of an oath He himself had taught him that in the creed of a gentleman a promise was a thing of his honor to be kept at any cost You are compelling me to do a strange and hateful thing he said If you intend to use your influence to keep him out I shall have to offset it by urging him to go That is putting a very terrible responsibility on me He heard her draw her breath sharply If you do that I shall leave you she said in a frozen voice Suddenly he felt sorry for her She was so weak so childish so cowardly And this was the nearest they had come to a complete break You re tired and nervous he said We have come a long way from what I started out to say And a long way from the way things used to be between us If this thing to night does not bring two people together Together she cried shrilly When have we been together Not in years You have been married to your business I am only your housekeeper and Graham s mother And even Graham you are trying to take away from me Oh go away and let me alone Down stairs thoughts that were almost great had formulated themselves in his mind that to die that others might live might be better than to live oneself that he loved his country although he had been shamefaced about it that America was really the melting pot of the world and that perhaps only the white flame of war would fuse it into a great nation But Natalie made all these thoughts tawdry She cheapened them She found in him nothing fine therefore there was probably nothing fine in him He went away to lie awake most of the night CHAPTER XXIII But with the breaking off of diplomatic relations matters remained for a time at a standstill Natalie dried her eyes and ordered some new clothes and saw rather more of Rodney Page than was good for her With the beginning of February the country house was far enough under way for it to be promised for June and Natalie the fundamentals of its decoration arranged for began to haunt old furniture shops accompanied always by Rodney Not that your taste is not right Natalie he explained It is exquisite But these fellows are liars and cheats some of them Besides I like trailing along if you don t mind Trailing along was a fairly accurate phrase There was scarcely a day now when Natalie s shining car with its two men in livery did not draw up before Rodney s office building or stand as unostentatiously as a fire engine not too near the entrance of his club Clayton going in had seen it there once or twice and had smiled rather grimly He considered its presence there in questionable taste but he felt no uneasiness Determined as he was to give Natalie such happiness as was still in him to give he never mentioned these instances But a day came early in February which was to mark a change in the relationship between Natalie and Rodney It started simply enough They had lunched together at a down town hotel and then went to look at rugs Rodney had found her rather obdurate as to old rugs They were still arguing the matter in the limousine I just don t like to think of all sorts of dirty Turks and Arabs having used them she protested Slept on them walked on them spilled things on the ugh But the colors Natalie dear The old faded copper tones the dull blues the dead rose There is a beauty about age you know Lovely as you are you ll be even lovelier as an old woman I m getting there rather rapidly He turned and looked at her critically No slightest aid that she had given her beauty missed his eyes the delicate artificial lights in her hair her eyebrows drawn to a hair s breadth and carefully arched the touch of rouge under her eyes and on the lobes of her ears But she was beautiful no matter what art had augmented her real prettiness She was a charming finished product from her veil and hat to her narrowly shod feet He liked finished things well done He liked the glaze on a porcelain he liked the perfect lacquering on the Chinese screen he had persuaded Natalie to buy he preferred wood carved into the fine lines of Sheraton to the trees that grow in the Park for instance through which they were driving A Sheraton sideboard was art Even certain forms of Colonial mahogany were art although he was not fond of them And Natalie was art Even if she represented the creative instincts of her dressmaker and her milliner and not her own he did not like a Louis XV sofa the less that it had not carved itself Possibly Natalie appealed then to his collective instinct he had not analyzed it He only knew that he liked being with her and he was not annoyed certainly by the fact that he knew their constant proximity was arousing a certain amount of comment So You are very beautiful he said with his appraising glance full on her You are quite the loveliest woman I know Still With a grown son I am not a boy myself you know What has that to do with it He hesitated then laughed a little I don t know he said I didn t mean to say that exactly Of course that fact is that I m rather glad you are not a debutante You would be giving me odds and ends of dances if you were you know and shifting me as fast as possible As it is The coquetry which is a shallow woman s substitute for passion stirred in her Well I m awfully interested He turned and faced her I wonder if you are Go on Roddie As it is As it is he said rather rapidly you give me a great deal of happiness I can t say all I would like to but just being with you Natalie I wonder if you know how much it means to me to see you every day I like it or I wouldn t do it But I wonder if it means anything to you Curiously enough with the mere putting it into words his feeling for her seemed to grow He was even somewhat excited He bent toward her his eyes on her face and caught one of her gloved hands He was no longer flirting with a pretty woman He was in real earnest But Natalie was still flirting Do you want to know why I like to be with you Because of course I do or I shouldn t be Does a famishing man want water Because you are sane and sensible You believe as I do in going on as normally as possible All these people who go around glooming because there is a war across the Atlantic They are so tiresome Good heavens the hysterical attitude of some women And Clay He released her hand So you like me because I m sensible Thanks That s a good reason isn t it Good God Natalie I m only sensible because I have to be Not about the war I m not talking about that About you What have I got to do with your being sensible and sane Just think about things and you ll know She was greatly thrilled and quite untouched It was a pleasant little game and she held all the winning cards So she said very softly We mustn t go on like this you know We mustn t spoil things And by her very we let him understand that the plight was not his but theirs They were to suffer on she implied in a mutual unacknowledged passion He flushed deeply But although he was profoundly affected his infatuation was as spurious as her pretense of one He was a dilettante in love as he was in art His aesthetic sense which would have died of an honest passion fattened on the very hopelessness of his beginning an affair with Natalie Confronted just then with the privilege of marrying her he would have drawn back in dismay Since no such privilege was to be his however he found a deep satisfaction in considering himself hopelessly in love with her He was profoundly sorry for himself He saw himself a tragic figure hopeless and wretched He longed for the unattainable he held up empty hands to the stars and by so mimicking the gesture of youth he regained youth You won t cut me out of your life Natalie he asked wistfully And Natalie who would not have sacrificed this new thrill for anything real in the world replied It would be better wouldn t it There was real earnestness in his voice when he spoke He had dramatized himself by that time Don t take away the only thing that makes life worth living dear Which Natalie after a proper hesitation duly promised not to do There were other conversations after that About marriage for instance which Rodney broadly characterized as the failure of the world he liked treading on dangerous ground When a man has married and had children he has fulfilled his duty to the State That s all marriage is duty to the State After that he follows his normal instincts of course If you are defending unfaithfulness Not at all I admire faithfulness It s rare enough for admiration No I m recognizing facts Don t you suppose even dear old Clay likes a pretty woman Of course he does It s a total difference of view point Natalie What is an incident to a man is a crime to a woman Or All this economic freedom of women is going to lead to other freedoms you know What freedoms The right to live wherever they please One liberty brings another you know Women used to marry for a home for some one to keep them Now they needn t but they have to live just the same I wish you wouldn t Rodney It s so cheap It was cheap It was the old game of talking around conversational corners of whispering behind mental doors It was insidious dangerous and tantalizing It made between them a bond of lowered voices of being on the edge of things Their danger was as spurious as their passion but Natalie without humor and without imagination found the sense of insecurity vaguely attractive Fundamentally cold she liked the idea of playing with fire CHAPTER XXIV When war was not immediately declared the rector who on the Sunday following that eventful Saturday of the President s speech to Congress had preached a rousing call to arms began to feel a bit sheepish about it War or no war my dear he said to Delight it made them think for as much as an hour And I can change it somewhat and use it again if the time really comes Second hand stuff she scoffed You with your old sermons and Mother with my old dresses But it was a good sermon she added I have hardly been civil to that German laundress since Good gracious Delight Can t you remember that we must love our enemies Do you love them You know perfectly well that the moment you get on the other side if you do you ll be jerking the cross off your collar and bullying some wretched soldier to give you his gun He had a guilty feeling that she was right It was February then and they were sitting in the parish house Delight had been filling out Sunday school reports to parents an innovation she detested For a little while there was only the scratching of her pen to be heard and an occasional squeal from the church proper where the organ was being repaired The rector sat back in his chair his fingertips together and whistled noiselessly a habit of his when he was disturbed Now and then he glanced at Delight s bent head My dear he commented finally Just a minute That wretched little Simonton girl has been absent three Sundays out of four And on the fourth one she said she had a toothache and sat outside on the steps Well daddy Do you see anything of Graham Spencer now Very little She looked at him with frank eyes He has changed somehow daddy When we do meet he is queer I sometimes think he avoids me He fell back on his noiseless whistling And Delight who knew his every mood got up and perched herself on the arm of his chair Don t you get to thinking things she said And slipped an arm around his neck I did think in the winter I ll tell you about that she broke in bravely I suppose if he d cared for me at all I d have been crazy about him It isn t because he s good looking I well I don t know why I just know as long as I can remember I however that s not important He thinks I m a nice little thing and lets it go at that It s a good bit worse of course than having him hate me Sometimes I think you are not very happy I m happier than I would be trying to make him fall in love with me Oh you needn t be shocked It can be done Lots of girls do it It isn t any moral sense that keeps me from it either It s just pride My dear And there s another angle to it I wouldn t marry a man who hasn t got a mind of his own Even if I had the chance which I haven t That silly mother of his she is silly daddy and selfish Do you know what she is doing now We ought not to discuss her She Fiddlesticks You love gossip and you know it Her tone was light but the rector felt that arm around his neck tighten He surmised a depth of feeling that made him anxious She is trying to marry him to Marion Hayden The rector sat up almost guiltily But are you sure she is doing that Everybody says so She thinks that if he is married and there is a war he won t want to go if he has a wife She was silent for a moment Marion will drive him straight to the devil daddy The rector reached up and took her hand She cared more than she would admit he saw She had thought the thing out perhaps in the long night when he slept placidly Thought and suffered he surmised And again he remembered his worldly plans for her and felt justly punished I suppose it is hard for a father to understand how any one can know his little girl and not love her Or be the better for it She kissed him and slid off the arm of his chair Don t you worry she said cheerfully I had to make an ideal for myself about somebody Every girl does Sometimes it s the plumber It doesn t really matter who it is so you can pin your dreams to him The only thing that hurts is that Graham wasn t worth while She went back to her little cards but some ten minutes later the rector lost in thought heard the scratching of her pen cease Did you ever think daddy she said of the influence women have over men Look at the Spencers missus Spencer spoiling Graham and making her husband desperately unhappy And Unhappy What makes you think that He looks unhappy The rector was startled He had an instant vision of Clayton Spencer tall composed handsome impeccably clothed He saw him in the setting that suited him best the quiet elegance of his home Clayton unhappy Nonsense But he was uneasy too That very gravity which he had noticed lately that was certainly not the gravity of an entirely happy man Clayton had changed somehow Was there trouble there And if there were why The rector who reduced most wretchedness to terms of dollars and cents of impending bills and small deprivations found himself at a loss I am sure you are wrong he objected rather feebly Delight eyed him with the scorn of nineteen for fifty I wonder what you would do she observed if mother just lay around all day and had her hair done and got new clothes and never thought a thought of her own and just used you as a sort of walking bank account My dear I really can not I ll tell you what you d do she persisted You d fall in love with somebody else probably Or else you d just naturally dry up and be made a bishop He was extremely shocked at that and a little hurt It took her some time to establish cheerful relations again and a very humble apology But her words stuck in the rector s mind He made a note for a sermon with the text Her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her He went quietly into the great stone building and sat down The organist was practicing the Introit anthem and half way up the church a woman was sitting quietly The rector leaned back and listened to the music He often did that when he had a sermon in his mind It was peaceful and quiet Hard to believe in that peace of great arches and swelling music that across the sea at that moment men were violating that fundamental law of the church Thou shalt not kill The woman turned her head and he saw that it was Audrey Valentine He watched her with kindly speculative eyes Self reliant frivolous Audrey sitting alone in the church she had so casually attended surely that was one of the gains of war People all came to it ultimately They held on with both hands as long as they could and then they found their grasp growing feeble and futile and they turned to the Great Strength The organist had ceased Audrey was kneeling now The rector eyes on the gleaming cross above the altar repeated softly Save and deliver us we humbly beseech Thee from the hands of our enemies that we being armed with Thy defense may be preserved evermore from all perils Audrey was coming down the aisle She did not see him She had indeed the fixed eyes of one who still looks inward She was very pale but there was a new look of strength in her face as of one who has won a victory To glorify Thee who are the only giver of all victory through the merits of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord finished the rector CHAPTER XXV On the last day of February Audrey came home from her shorthand class and stood wearily by the window too discouraged even to remove her hat The shorthand was a failure the whole course was a failure She had not the instinct for plodding for the meticulous attention to detail that those absurd irrational lines and hooks and curves demanded She could not even spell And an idiot of an instructor had found fault with the large square band she wrote as being uncommercial Uncommercial Of course it was So was she uncommercial She had dreamed a dream of usefulness but after all why was she doing it We would never fight Here we were saying to Germany that we had ceased to be friends and letting it go at that She might go to England They needed women there But not untrained women Not she thought contemptuously women whose only ability lay in playing bridge or singing French chansons with no particular voice After all the only world that was open to her was her old world It liked her It even understood her It stretched out a tolerant pleasure beckoning hand to her I m a fool she reflected bitterly I m not happy and I m not useful I might as well play It s all I can do But her real hunger was for news of Clayton Quite suddenly he had stopped dropping in on his way up town He had made himself the most vital element in her life and then taken himself out of it At first she had thought he might be ill It seemed too cruel otherwise But she saw his name with increasing frequency in the newspapers It seemed to her that every relief organization in the country was using his name and his services So he was not ill He had tired of her probably She had nothing to give had no right to give anything And of course he could not know how much he had meant to her of courage to carry on How the memory of his big solid dependable figure had helped her through the bad hours when the thought of Chris s defection had left her crushed and abject She told herself that the reason she wanted to see Natalie was because she had neglected her shamefully Perhaps that was what was wrong with Clay perhaps he felt that by avoiding Natalie she was putting their friendship on a wrong basis Actually she had reached that point all loving women reach when even to hear a beloved name coming out of a long silence was both torture and necessity She took unusual pains with her dress that afternoon and it was a very smart slightly rouged and rather swaggering Audrey who made her first call in weeks on Natalie that afternoon Natalie was a little stiff still slightly affronted I thought you must have left town she said But you look as though you d been having a rest cure Rouge said Audrey coolly No I haven t been entirely resting There are all sorts of stories going about That you re going into a hospital that you re learning to fly that you re in the secret service Just because I find it stupid going about without a man Natalie eyed her shrewdly but there was no self consciousness in Audrey s face If the stories were true and there had been another woman she was carrying it off well At least Chris is in France I have to go when I go without Clay And there is no excuse whatever You mean he is working Not at night He is simply obstinate He says he is tired I don t really mind any more He is so hatefully heavy these days Heavy Clay My dear Natalie drew her chair closer and lowered her voice What can one do with a man who simply lives war He spends hours over the papers He s up if the Allies make a gain and impossible if they don t I can tell by the very way he slams the door of his room when he comes home what the news is It s dreadful Audrey flushed I wish there were more like him But Natalie smiled tolerantly You are not married to him I suppose the war is important but I don t want it twenty four hours a day I want to forget it if I can It s hideous Audrey s mouth twitched After all what was the good of talking to Natalie She would only be resentful How is the house coming on she asked She had Natalie on happy ground there For a half hour she looked at blueprints and water color sketches heard Rodney s taste extolled listened to plans for a house party which she gathered was rather belatedly to include her And through it all she was saying to herself This is his wife This is the woman he loves He has had a child by her He is building this house for her He goes into her room as Chris came into mine And she is not good enough She is not good enough Now that she had seen Natalie she knew why she had not seen her before She was jealous of her Jealous and contemptuous Suddenly she hated Natalie She hated her because she was Clayton Spencer s wife with all that that implied She hated her because she was unworthy of him She hated her because she loved Clay and hated her more because she loved herself more than she loved him Audrey sat back in her chair and saw that she had traveled a long way along a tragic road For the first time in her brave and reckless life she was frightened She was even trembling She lighted a cigaret from the stand at Natalie s elbow to steady herself Natalie chattered on and Audrey gave her the occasional nod that was all she needed She thought Does he know about her Is he still fooled She is almost beautiful Rodney is falling in love with her probably Does he know that Will he care terribly if he finds it out She looks cold but one can t tell and some men has she a drop of honest unselfish passion in her She got up suddenly Heavens how late it is she said I must run on Why not stay on to dinner Graham is seldom home and we can talk if Clay doesn t The temptation to see Clay again was strong in Audrey But suddenly she knew that she did not want to see them together in the intimacy of their home She did not want to sit between them at dinner and then go away leaving them there together And something fundamentally honest in her told her that she had no right to sit at their table I ll come another time if you ll ask me Not to day she said And left rather precipitately It hurt her rather to have Natalie with an impulsive gesture gather the flowers out of a great jar and insist on her carrying them home with her It gave her a miserable sense of playing unfairly She walked home The fresh air after Natalie s flower scented overheated room made her more rational She knew where she stood anyhow She was in love with Clayton Spencer She had she reflected cynically been in love before A number of times before She almost laughed aloud She had called those things love those sickly romances those feeble emotions Then her eyes filled with unexpected tears She had always wanted some one to make her happy Now she wanted to make some one happy She cared nothing for the cost She would put herself out of it altogether He was not happy Any one could see that He had everything but he was not happy If he belonged to her she would live to make him happy She would Suddenly she remembered Chris Perhaps she did not know how to hold a man s love She had not held him He had protested that she was the only woman he had ever loved but all the time there had been that other girl How account for her then He did not think of me she reflected defiantly I shall not think of him She was ashamed of that instantly After all Chris was doing a man s part now She was no longer angry with him She had written him that over and over in the long letters she had made a point of sending him Only she did not love him any more She thought now that she never had loved him What about the time when he came back What would she do then She shivered But Chris after all was not to come back He would never come back again The cable was there when she reached her apartment a cold statement irrefutable final She had put the flowers on the table and had raised her hands to unpin her hat when she saw it She read it with a glance first then slowly painfully her heart contracted as if a hand had squeezed it She stood very still not so much stricken as horrified and her first conscious thought was of remorse terrible gasping remorse All that afternoon while she had been hating Natalie and nursing her love for Clay Chris had been lying dead somewhere Chris was dead She felt very tired but not faint It seemed dreadful indeed that she could be standing there full of life while Chris was dead Such grief as she felt was for him not for herself He had loved life so even when he cheapened it He had wanted to live and now he was dead She who did not care greatly to live lived on and he was gone All at once she felt terribly alone She wanted some one with her She wanted to talk it all out to some one who understood She wanted Clay She said to herself that she did not want him because she loved him All love was dead in her now She wanted him because he was strong and understanding She made this very clear to herself because she had a morbid fancy that Chris might be watching her There were people who believed that sort of thing To her excited fancy it seemed as though Chris s cynical smile might flash out from any dusky corner She knew she was not being quite rational Which was strange because she felt so strong and because the voice with which she called Clayton s number was so steady She knew too that she was no longer in love with Clay because his steady voice over the telephone left her quite calm and unmoved I want you to come up Clay she said If you can easily I can come at once Is anything wrong Chris has been killed she replied and hung up the receiver Then she sat down to wait and to watch for Chris s cynical smile to flash in some dusky corner Clayton found her there collapsed in her chair a slim gray faced girl with the rouge giving a grotesque vitality to her bloodless cheeks She got up very calmly and gave him the cablegram Then she fainted in a crumpled heap at his feet CHAPTER XXVI The new munition plant was nearing completion Situated on the outskirts of the city it spread over a vast area of what had once been waste land Of the three long buildings two were already in operation and the third was well under way To Clayton Spencer it was the realization of a dream He never entered the great high walled enclosure without a certain surprise at the ease with which it had all been accomplished and a thrill of pride at the achievement He found the work itself endlessly interesting The casts made of his own steel lying in huge rusty heaps in the yard the little cars which carried them into the plant the various operations by which the great lathes turned them out smooth and shining only to lose their polish when heated again they were ready for the ponderous hammer to close their gaping jaws The delicacy of the work appealed to him the machining to a thousandth of an inch the fastidious making of the fuses tiny things almost microscopic and requiring the delicate touch of girls most of whom had been watchmakers and jewelry workers And with each carload of the finished shells that left the plant he felt a fine glow of satisfaction The output was creeping up Soon they would be making ten thousand shells a day And every shell was one more chance for victory against the Hun It became an obsession with him to make more ever more As the work advanced he found an unexpected enthusiasm in Graham Here was something to be done a new thing The steel mill had been long established Its days went on monotonously The boy found it noisy dirty without appeal to his imagination But the shell plant was different There were new problems to face of labor of supplies of shipping and output He was however reluctantly coming to the conclusion that the break with Germany was the final step that the Government intended to take That it would not declare war However the break had done something It had provided him with men from the local National Guard to police the plant and he found the government taking a new interest an official interest in his safety Agents from the Military Intelligence and the Department of Justice scanned his employment lists and sent agents into the plant In the building where men and women were hired each applicant passed a desk where they were quietly surveyed by two unobstrusive gentlemen in indifferent business suits who eyed them carefully Around the fuse department where all day girls and women handled guncotton and high explosive powder a special guard was posted day and night Early in March Clayton put Graham in charge of the first of the long buildings to be running full and was rewarded by a new look in the boy s face He was almost startled at the way he took it I ll do my very best sir he said rather huskily If I can t fight I can help put the swine out of business anyhow He was by that time quite sure that Natalie had extracted a promise of some sort from the boy On the rare occasions when Graham was at home he was quiet and suppressed He was almost always at Marion Hayden s in the evenings and from things he let fall Clayton gathered that the irresponsible group which centered about Marion was in the boy s own vernacular rather shot to pieces Tommy Hale had gone to England to join the Royal Flying Corps One or two of them were in Canada trying to enlist there and one evening Graham brought home to dinner an inordinately tall and thin youngster in the kilts of a Scotch Canadian regiment with an astounding length of thin leg below his skirts who had been one of Marion s most reckless satellites Look like a fool I know sir said the tall individual sheepishly Just had to get in it somehow No camouflage about these skirts is there And Clayton had noticed with a thrill of sympathy how wistfully Graham eyed the debonnair young Scot by adoption and how Buckham had hovered over him filling his plate and his glass Even Graham noticed Buckham Old boy looks as though he d like to kiss you Sid he said It s the petticoats Probably thinks you re a woman I look better with my legs under the table said the tall boy modestly Clayton was still determined that Graham should fight the thing out for himself He wished sometimes that he knew Marion Hayden s attitude Was she like Natalie Would she if the time came use her undeniable influence for or against And there again he resented the influence of women in the boy s life Why couldn t he make his own decisions Why couldn t they let him make his own decisions He remembered his father and how his grandmother in sixty one had put a Bible into one pocket and a housewife into another and had sent him off to war Had the fiber of our women weakened since then But he knew it had not All day in the new plant women were working with high explosives quite calmly And there were Audrey and the Haverford women strong enough in all conscience Every mental path those days somehow led eventually to Audrey She was the lighted window at the end of the long trail Graham was as a matter of fact trying to work out his own salvation He blundered as youth always blunders and after a violent scene with Marion Hayden he made an attempt to break off his growing intimacy with Anna Klein to find as many a man had before him that the sheer brutality of casting off a loving woman was beyond him The scene with Marion came one Sunday in the Spencer house with Natalie asleep up stairs after luncheon and Clayton walking off a sense of irritation in the park He did not like the Hayden girl He could not fathom Natalie s change of front with regard to Graham and the girl He had gone out leaving them together and Marion had launched her attack fiercely Now she cried I couldn t come last night That s all Marion It is certainly not all Why couldn t you come I worked late Where At the plant That s a lie Graham I called the plant I ll tell you where you were You were out with a girl You were seen if you want to know it Oh if you are going to believe everything you hear about me Don t act like a child Who was the girl It isn t like you to be jealous Marion I let you run around all the time with other fellows but the minute I take a girl out for a little spin you re jealous Jealous She laughed nastily But she knew she was losing her temper and brought herself up short Let him think she was jealous What really ailed her was deadly fear lest her careful plan go astray She was terrified That was all And she meant to learn who the girl was I know who it was she hazarded I think you are bluffing It was Delight Haverford Delight She knew then that she was wrong but it was her chance to assail Delight and she took it That child she continued contemptuously Don t you suppose I ve seen how she looks at you I m not afraid of her You are too much a man of the world to let her put anything over on you At least I thought you were Of course if you like milk and water It was not Delight he said doggedly And I don t think we need to bring her into this at all She s not in love with me She wouldn t wipe her feet on me Which was unfortunate Marion smiled slowly Oh But you are good enough for me to be engaged to I wonder He went to the window and stood for a moment looking out Then he went slowly back to her I m not good enough for you to be engaged to Marion he said I don t you want to call it a day She was really terrified then She went white and again miserably he mistook her agitation for something deeper You want to break the engagement Not if you still want me I only mean I m a pretty poor sort You ought to have the best and God help this country if I m the best Graham you re in some sort of trouble He drew himself up in boyish bravado He could not tell her the truth It opened up too hideous a vista Even his consciousness of the fact that the affair with Anna was still innocent did not dull his full knowledge of whither it was trending He was cold and wretched It s nothing he muttered You can tell me You can tell me anything I know a lot you see I m no silly kitten If you re in a fix I ll help you I don t care what it is I ll help you I I m crazy about you Graham Anna s words too Look here Marion he said roughly you ve got to do one of two things Either marry me or let me go Let you go I like that If that is how you feel Oh don t He threw up his arm I want you You know that Marry me to morrow I will not Do you think I m going to come into this family and have you cut off Don t you suppose I know that Clayton Spencer hates the very chair I sit on He ll come and beg me to marry you some day Until then You won t do it To morrow Certainly not And again he felt desperately his powerlessness to loosen the coils that were closing round him fetters forged of his own red blood his own youth the woman urge She was watching him with her calculating glance You must be in trouble she said If I am it s you and mother who have driven me there He was alarmed then and lapsed into dogged silence His anxiety had forced into speech thoughts that had never before been articulate He was astounded to hear himself uttering them although with the very speaking he realized now that they were true Sorry Marion he muttered I didn t mean all that I m excited That s all When he sat down beside her again and tried to take her hand she drew it away You ve been very cruel Graham she said I ve been selfish Every girl who is terribly in love is selfish I am going to give you your ring and leave you free to do whatever you want Her generosity overcame him He was instantly ashamed humbled Don t he begged Don t let me go I ll just go to the dogs If you really care Care she said softly And as he buried his head in her lap she stroked his hair softly Her eyes triumphant surveyed the long room with its satin paneled walls its French furniture its long narrow gilt framed mirrors softening the angles of the four corners Some day all this would be hers For this she would exchange the untidy and imitation elegance of her present setting She stroked the boy s head absently Graham made an attempt to free himself the next day He was about to move his office to the new plant and he made a determination not to take Anna with him He broke it to her as gently as he could mister Weaver is taking my place here he said avoiding her eyes Yes Graham He ll there ought to be some one here who knows the ropes Do you mean me Well you know them don t you He had tried to smile at her Do you mean that you are going to have another secretary at the plant Look here Anna he said impulsively You know things can t go on indefinitely the way we are now You know it don t you She looked down and nodded Well don t you think I d better leave you here She fumbled nervously with her wrist watch I won t stay here if you go she said finally I hate mister Weaver I m afraid of him I oh don t leave me Graham Don t I haven t anybody but you I haven t any home not a real home You ought to see him these days She always referred to her father as him He s dreadful I m only happy when I m here with you He was angry out of sheer despair I ve told you he said Things can t go on as they are You know well enough what I mean I m older than you are Anna God knows I don t want any harm to come to you through me But if we continue to be together I m not blaming you She looked at him honestly I d just rather have you care about me than marry anybody else He kissed her with a curious mingling of exultation and despair He left her there when he went away that afternoon a rather downcast young figure piling up records and card indexes and following him to the door with worshiping anxious eyes Later on in the afternoon Joey wandering in from Clayton s office on one of his self constituted observation tours found her crying softly while she wiped her typewriter preparatory to covering it for the night Somebody been treatin you rough he asked more sympathetic than curious What are you doing here anyhow she demanded angrily You re always hanging around spying on me Somebody s got to keep an eye on you Well you don t Look here he said his young old face twitching with anxiety You get out from under kid You take my advice and get out from under Something s going to fall Just mind your own business and stop worrying about me That s all He turned and started out Oh very well he said sharply But you might take a word of warning anyhow That cousin of yours has got an eye on you all right And we don t want any scandal about the place We Who are we Me and mister Clayton Spencer said Joey smartly and went out banging the door cheerfully Anna climbed the hill that night wearily but with a sense of relief that Rudolph had not been waiting for her at the yard gate She was in no mood to thrust and parry with him She wondered rather dully what mischief Rudolph was up to He was gaining a tremendous ascendency over her father she knew Herman was spending more and more of his evenings away from home creaking up the stairs late at night shoes in hand to undress in the cold darkness across the hall Out she asked Katie sitting by the fire with the evening paper Conversation in the cottage was almost always laconic Ate early Katie returned Rudolph was here too I m going to quit if I ve got to cook for that sneak any longer You d think he had a meal ticket here Your supper s on the stove I m not hungry She ate her supper however and undressed by the fire Then she went up stairs and sat by her window in the gathering night She was suffering acutely Graham was tired of her He wanted to get rid of her Probably he had a girl somewhere else a lady Her idea of the life of such a girl had been gathered from novels The sort that has her breakfast in bed she muttered and has her clothes put on her by somebody Her underclothes too The immodesty of the idea made her face burn with anger Late that night Herman came back Herman had been a difficult proposition for Rudolph to handle His innate caution his respect for law and under his bullying exterior a certain physical cowardice made him slow to move in the direction Rudolph was urging He was controversial He liked to argue over the beer and schnitzel Rudolph bought And Rudolph was growing impatient Rudolph himself was all eagerness and zeal It was his very zeal that was his danger although it brought him slavish followers He was contemptuous ill tempered and impatient but of limited intelligence himself he understood for that very reason the mental processes of those he would lead There was a certain simplicity even in his cunning With Herman he was a ferret driving out of their hiding places every evil instinct that lay dormant Under his goading Herman was becoming savage sullen and potentially violent He was confused too Rudolph s arguments always confused him He was confused that night heavy with fatigue and with Rudolph s steady talk in his ear He was tired of pondering great questions tired of hearing about the Spencers and the money they were making Anna s clothing was scattered about the room and he frowned at it She spent too much money on her clothes Always sewing at something He stooped down to gather up his shoes and his ear thus brought close to the table was conscious in the silence of a faint rhythmical sound He stood up and looked about Then he moved the newspaper on the table Underneath it forgotten in her anxiety and trouble lay the little gold watch He picked it up still following his train of thought It fitted into the evening s inflammable proceedings So with such trinkets as this capital would silence the cry of labor for its just share in the products of its skill and strength It would bribe and cheaply Ten dollars perhaps that ticking insult For ten dollars He held it close to his spectacles Ah but it was not so cheap It came from the best shop in the city He weighed it carefully in his hand and in so doing saw the monogram A doubt crept into his mind a cold and chilling fear Since when had the Spencer plant taken to giving watches for Christmas The hill girls who worked as stenographers in the plant they came in often enough and he did not remember any watches or any mention of watches His mind working slowly recalled that never before had he seen the watch near at hand And he went into a slow and painful calculation Fifty dollars at least it had cost A hundred stenographers that would be five thousand dollars for watches Suddenly he knew that Anna had lied to him One of two things then either she had spent money for it unknown to him or some one had given it to her There was in his mind not much difference in degree between the two alternatives Both were crimes of the first magnitude He picked the watch up between his broad thumb and forefinger and then his face a cold and dreadful mask he mounted the stairs CHAPTER XXVII Clayton Spencer was facing with characteristic honesty a situation that he felt was both hopeless and shameful He was hopelessly in love with Audrey He knew now that he had known it for a long time Here was no slender sentiment no thin romance With every fiber of him heart and soul and body he loved her and wanted her There was no madness about it save the fact itself which was mad enough It was not the single attraction of passion although he recognized that element as fundamental in it It was the craving of a strong man who had at last found his woman He knew that as certainly as he knew anything He did not even question that she cared for him It was as though they both had passed through the doubting period without knowing it and had arrived together at the same point the crying need of each other He rather thought looking back that Audrey had known it sooner than he had She had certainly known the night she learned of Chris s death His terror when she fainted the very way he had put her out of his arms when she opened her eyes those had surely told her Yet had Chris s cynical spirit been watching there had been nothing even then There was between them nothing now He had given way to the people who flocked to her with sympathy had called her up now and then had sent her a few books some flowers But the hopelessness of the situation held him away from her Once or twice at first he had called her on the telephone and had waited almost trembling for her voice over the wire only to ask her finally in a voice chilled with repression how she was feeling or to offer a car for her to ride in the park And her replies were equally perfunctory She was well She was still studying but it was going badly She was too stupid to learn all those pot hooks Once she had said Aren t you ever coming to see me Clay Her voice had been wistful and it had been a moment before he had himself enough in hand to reply formally Thank you I shall very soon But he had not gone to the little fiat again Through Natalie he heard of her now and then I saw Audrey to day she said once She is not wearing mourning It s bad taste I should say When one remembers that she really drove Chris to his death He had interrupted her angrily That is a cruel misstatement Natalie She did nothing of the sort You needn t bite me you know He went and had about as much interest in this war as as As you have he finished And had gone out leaving Natalie staring after him He was more careful after that but the situation galled him He was no hypocrite but there was no need of wounding Natalie unnecessarily And that after all was the crux of the whole situation Natalie It was not Natalie s fault that he had found the woman of his heart too late He had no thought of blame for her In decency there was only one thing to do He could not play the lover to her but then he had not done that for a very long time He could see however that she was not hurt Perhaps in all her futile life Natalie had for all her complaining never been so content in her husband as in those early spring months when she had completely lost him He made no demands whatever In the small attentions which he had never neglected he was even more assiduous He paid her ever increasing bills without comment He submitted in those tense days when every day made the national situation more precarious to hours of discussion as to the country house to complaints as to his own lack of social instinct and to that new phase of her attitude toward Marion Hayden that left him baffled and perplexed Then on the Sunday when he left Graham and Marion together at the house he met Audrey quite by accident in the park He was almost incredulous at first She came like the answer to prayer a little tired around the eyes showing the strain of the past weeks but with that same easy walk and unconscious elegance that marked her always She was not alone There was a tall blonde girl beside her hideously dressed but with a pleasant shallow face Just before they met Audrey stopped and held out her hand Then you ll let me know Clare Thank you I will indeed missus Valentine With a curious glance at Clayton the girl went on Audrey smiled at him Please don t run she said There are people looking It would be so conspicuous Run he replied He stood looking down at her and at something in his eyes her smile died It s too wonderful Clay For a moment he could not speak After all those weeks of hunger for her there was no power in him to dissemble He felt a mad boyish impulse to hold out his arms to her Malacca stick gloves and all It s a bit of luck I hadn t expected Audrey he said at last unsteadily She turned about quite simply and faced in the direction he was going I shall walk with you she said with a flash of her old impertinence You have not asked me to but I shall anyhow Only don t call this luck It isn t at all I walk here every Sunday and every Sunday I say to myself he will think he needs exercise Then he will walk and the likeliest place for him to go is the park Good reasoning isn t it She glanced up at him but his face was set and unsmiling Don t pay any attention to me Clay I m a little mad probably You see she hesitated I need my friends just now And when the very best of them all hides away from me Don t say that I stayed away because He hesitated I m almost through Don t worry But I was walking along before I met Clare I ll tell you about her presently and I was saying to myself that I thought God owed me something I didn t know just what Happiness maybe I ve been careless and all that but I ve never been wicked And yet I can look back and count the really happy days of my life on five fingers She held out one hand Five fingers she repeated and I am twenty eight The percentage is pretty low you know Perhaps you and I ask too much He was conscious of her quick searching glance Oh You feel that way too I mean as I do that it s all hardly worth while But you seem to have everything Clay You have one thing I lack Youth Youth At twenty eight You can still mold your life Audrey dear You have had a bad time but with all reverence to Chris s memory his going out of it under the circumstances is a grief But it doesn t spell shipwreck Do you mean that I will marry again she asked in a low tone Don t you think you will some time Some nice young chap who will worship you all the days of his life That well that is what I expect for you It s at least possible you know Is it what you want for me Good God he burst out his restraint suddenly gone What do you want me to say What can I say except that I want you to be happy Don t you think I ve gone over it all over and over again I d give my life for the right to tell you the things I think but I haven t that right Even this little time together is wrong the way things are It is all wrong I m sorry Clay I know I am just reckless to day You know I am reckless It s my vice But sometimes we d better talk about the mill But he could not talk about the mill just then They walked along in silence and after a little he felt her touch his arm Wouldn t it be better just to have it out she asked wistfully That wouldn t hurt anybody would it I m afraid Audrey I m not she said proudly I sometimes think oh I think such a lot these days that if we talked these things over I d recover my friend I ve lost him now you see And I m so horribly lonely Clay Lost him Lost him she repeated I ve lost my friend and I haven t gained anything It didn t hurt anybody for us to meet now and then Clay You know that I wish you would understand she added impatiently I only want to go back to things as they were I want you to come in now and then We used to talk about all sorts of things and I miss that Plenty of people come but that s different It s only your occasional companionship I want I don t want you to come and make love to me You say you have missed the companionship he said rather unsteadily I wonder if you think I haven t I know you have my dear And that is why I want you to come To come without being afraid that I expect or want anything else Surely we can manage that He smiled down at her rather wryly at her straight courageous figure her brave eyes meeting his so directly How like her it all was the straightforwardness of it the absence of coquetry And once again he knew not only that he loved her with all the depths of him of his strong body and his vigorous mind but that she was his woman The one woman in the world for him It was as though all his life he had been searching for her and he had found her and it was too late She knew it too It was in her very eyes I have wanted to come terribly he said finally And when she held out her hand to him he bent down and kissed it Then that s settled she said in a matter of fact tone And now I ll tell you about Clare I m rather proud of her Clare The tension had been so great that he had forgotten the blonde girl entirely Do you remember the night I got a hundred dollars from you And later on that I asked you for work in your mill for the girl I got it for Do you mean He looked at her in surprise That was the girl You see she rather holds onto me It s awful in a way too It looks as though I am posing as magnanimous I m not Clay If I had cared awfully it would have been different But then if I had cared awfully perhaps it would never have happened You have nothing to blame yourself for Audrey Well I do rather But that s not the point Sometimes when I am alone I have wicked thoughts you know Clay I m reckless and sometimes I think maybe there is only one life and why not get happiness out of it I realize that but for some little kink in my brain I might be in Clare s position So I don t turn her out She s a poor cheap thing but well she is fond of me If I had children it s funny but I rather mother her And she s straight now straight as a string She was sensitive to his every thought and she knew by the very change in the angle of his head that he was thinking that over and not entirely approving But he said finally You re a big woman Audrey But you don t like it I don t like her troubling you Troubling me She doesn t borrow money you know Why she makes more money from your plant than I have to live on And she brings me presents of flowers and the most awful embroidery that she does herself You ought not to know that side of life She laughed a little bitterly Not know it she said I ve had to know it I learned it pretty well too And don t make any mistake Clay She looked up at him with her clear understanding gaze Being good decent with a lot of people is only the lack of temptation Only thank God there are some who have the strength to withstand it when it comes And he read in her clear eyes her promise and her understanding that they loved each other that it was the one big thing in both their lives but that between them there would be only the secret inner knowledge of that love There would be no shipwreck And for what she gave she demanded his strength and his promise It was to what he read in her face not to her words that he replied I ll do my very best Audrey dear He went back to her rooms with her and she made him tea while he built the fire in the open fireplace and nursed it tenderly to a healthy strength Overnursed it she insisted They were rather gay indeed and the danger point passed by safely There was so much to discuss she pretended The President s unfortunate phrase of peace without victory the deportation of the Belgians the recent leak in Washington to certain stock brokers and more and more imminent the possibility of a state of war being recognized by the government If it comes she said gayly I shall go of course I shall go to France and sing them into battle My shorthand looks like a music score as it is What will you do I can t let you outshine me he said And I don t want to think of your going over there without me My dear My dear She ignored that and gave him his tea gravely CHAPTER XXVIII When Natalie roused from her nap that Sunday afternoon it was to find Marion gone and Graham waiting for her in her boudoir Through the open door she could see him pacing back and forward and something in his face made her vaguely uneasy She assumed the child like smile which so often preserved her from the disagreeable What a sleep I ve had she said and yawned prettily I ll have one of your cigarets darling and then let s take a walk Graham knew Natalie s idea of a walk which was three or four blocks along one of the fashionable avenues with the car within hailing distance At the end of the fourth block she always declared that her shoes pinched and called the machine You don t really want to walk mother Of course I do with you Ring for Madeleine dear She was uncomfortable Graham had been very queer lately He would have long quiet spells and then break out in an uncontrollable irritation generally at the servants But Graham did not ring for Madeleine He lighted a cigaret for Natalie and standing off surveyed her She was very pretty She was prettier than Toots That pale blue wrapper or whatever it was made her rather exquisite And Natalie curled up on her pale rose chaise longue set to work as deliberately to make a conquest of her son as she had ever done to conquer Rodney Page or the long list of Rodney s predecessors You re growing very handsome you know boy she said Almost too handsome A man doesn t need good looks They re almost a handicap Look at your father They haven t hurt him any I should say I don t know She reflected eyeing her cigaret He presumes on them rather And a good many men never think a handsome man has any brains Well he fools them there too She raised her eyebrows slightly Tell me about the new plant Graham I don t know anything about it yet he said bluntly And you wouldn t be really interested if I did That s rather disagreeable of you No I m just trying to talk straight for once We you and I we always talk around things I don t know why You look terribly like your father just now You are quite savage That s exactly what I mean mother You don t say father is savage God knows he isn t that You just say I act like father and that I am savage Natalie blew a tiny cloud of cigaret smoke and watched it for a moment You sound fearfully involved But never mind about that I daresay I ve done something I don t know what but of course I am guilty Why did you bring Marion here to day mother Well if you want to know exactly I met her coming out of church and it occurred to me that we were having rather a nice luncheon and that it would be a pity not to ask some one to come in It was a nice luncheon wasn t it That s why you asked her For food Brutally put but correct You have been asking her here a lot lately And yet the last time we discussed her you said she was fast That she wanted to marry me for my money That people would laugh if I fell for it I hardly used those words did I For heaven s sake mother he cried exasperated Don t quibble Let s get down to facts Does your bringing her here mean that you ve changed your mind Natalie considered She was afraid of too quick a surrender lest he grow suspicious She decided to temporize with the affectation of frankness that had once deceived Clayton and that still she knew affected Graham I ll tell you exactly she said slowly At first I thought it was just an infatuation And you really are young Graham although you look and act like such a man But I feel now that time has gone on and you still care about her that after all your happiness is all that matters Mother But she held up her hand Remember I am only speaking for myself My dearest wish is to make you happy You are all I have But I cannot help you very much Your father looks at those things differently He doesn t quite realize that you are grown up and have a right to decide some things for yourself He has moved me up raised my salary That s different You re valuable to him naturally I don t mean he doesn t love you she added hastily as Graham wheeled and stared at her Of course he does in his own way It s not my way but then I m only a woman and a mother You think he ll object I think he must be handled If you rush at him and demand the right to live your own life It is my life Precisely Only he may not see it that way He took a step toward her Mother do you really want me to marry Marion I think you ought to be married To Marion To some one you love Circles again he muttered You ve changed your mind for some reason What is it mother He had an uneasy thought that she might have learned of Anna There was that day for instance when his father had walked into the back room Natalie was following a train of thought suggested by her own anxiety You might be married quietly she suggested Once it was done I am sure your father would come around You are both of age you know He eyed her then with open eyed amazement I m darned if I understand you he burst out And then in one of his quick remorses I m sorry mother I m just puzzled that s all But that plan s no good anyhow Marion won t do it She will have to be welcome in the family or she won t come She ought to be glad to come any way she can Natalie said sharply And found Graham s eyes on her studying her You don t want her That s plain But you do want her That s not so plain What s the answer mother And Natalie with an irritable feeing that she had bungled somehow got up and flung away the cigaret I am trying to give you what you want she said pettishly That s clear enough I should think There s no other reason What other reason could there be Dressing to dine at the Hayden s that night Graham heard Clayton come in and go into his dressing room He had an impulse to go over tie in hand as he was and put the matter squarely before his father The marriage urge surely a man would understand that Even Anna and his predicament there Anything was better than this constant indirectness of gaining his father s views through his mother Had he done so things would have been different later But by continual suggestion a vision of his father as hard detached immovable had been built up in his mind He got as far as the door hesitated turned back It was Marion herself who solved the mystery of Natalie s changed attitude when Graham told of it that night She sat listening her eyes slightly narrowed restlessly turning her engagement ring Well at least that s something she said noncommittally But in her heart she knew as one designing woman may know another She knew that Natalie had made Graham promise not to enlist at once if war was declared and now she knew that she was desperately preparing to carry her fear for Graham a step further even at the cost of having her in the family She smiled wryly But there was triumph in the smile too She had them now The time would come when they would crawl to her to marry Graham to keep him from going to war Then she would make her own terms In the meantime the thing was to hold him by every art she knew There was another girl somewhere She had been more frightened about that than she cared to admit even to herself She must hold him close She used every art she knew She deliberately inflamed him And the vicious circle closed in about him Natalie and Marion and Anna Klein And to offset them only Delight Haverford at evening prayer in Saint Luke s and voicing a tiny petition for him that he might walk straight that he might find peace even if that peace should be war CHAPTER XXIX Herman Klein watch between forefinger and thumb climbed heavily to Anna s room She heard him pause outside the door and her heart almost stopped beating She had been asleep and rousing at his step she had felt under the pillow for her watch to see the time It was not there She remembered then she had left it below on the table And he was standing outside her door She heard him scratching a match striking it against the panel of her door For so long as it would take the match to burn out she heard him there breathing heavily Then the knob turned She leaped out of the bed in a panic of fear The hall like the room was dark and she felt his ponderous body in the doorway rather than saw it You will put on something and come down stairs he said harshly I will not She tried to keep her voice steady I ve got to work if you haven t I ve got to have my sleep Her tone rose hysterically If you think you can stay out half the night and guzzle beer and then come here to get me up you can think again You are already up he said in a voice slowed and thickened by rage You will come down stairs He turned away and descended the creaking stairs again She listened for the next move but he made none She knew then that he was waiting at the foot of the stairs She was half maddened with terror by that time and she ran to the window But it was high Even if she could have dropped out and before she could put on enough clothing to escape in he would be back again his rage the greater for the delay She slipped into a kimono and her knees giving way under her she went down the stairs Herman was waiting He moved under the lamp and she saw that he held the watch dangling Now he said Where you got this Tell me I ve told you how I got it That was a lie So Rudolph had told him I like that she blustered trying to gain time I guess it s time they gave me something I ve worked hard enough They gave them to all the girls That is a lie also I like that Telling me I m lying You ask mister Graham Spencer He ll tell you If that is true why do you shake so You scare me father She burst into frightened tears I don t know what s got into you I do my best I give you all I make I ve kept this house going and she gained a little courage I ve had darned little thanks for it You think I believe the mill gave five thousand dollars in watches last Christmas To morrow I go with this to mister Clayton Spencer not to that degenerate son of his and I ask him Then I shall know He turned as if about to leave her but the alternative he offered her was too terrible Father she said I ll tell you the truth I bought it myself With what money I had a raise I didn t tell you I had a raise of five dollars a week I m paying for it myself Honest to heaven that s right father So you have had a raise and you have not told me I give all the rest to you What do I get out of all my hard work Just a place to live No clothes No fun No anything All the other girls have a good time now and then but I m just like a prisoner You take all I earn and I get the devil Her voice rose to a terrified squeal Behind her she heard the slovenly servant creaking down the stairs As Herman moved toward her she screamed Katie she called Quick Help But Herman had caught her by the shoulder and was dragging her toward a corner where there hung a leather strap Katie peering round the door of the enclosed staircase saw him raise the strap and Anna s white face upraised piteously For God s sake father The strap descended Even after Katie had rushed up the stairs and locked herself in the room she could hear above Anna s cries the thud of the strap relentless terrible lusty with cruelty Herman went to church the next morning Lying in her bed too sore and bruised to move Anna heard him carefully polishing his boots on the side porch heard him throw away the water after he had shaved heard at last the slam of the gate as he started upright in his Sunday clothes for church Only when he had reached the end of the street and Katie could see him picking his way down the blackened hill did she venture up with a cup of coffee Anna had to unlock her door to admit her to remove a further barricade of chairs When Katie saw her she almost dropped the cup You poor little rat she said compassionately Gee He was crazy I never saw such a face Gee Anna said nothing She dropped on the side of the bed and took the coffee drinking gingerly through a lip swollen and cut I m going to leave Katie went on It ll be my time next If he tries any tricks on me I ll have the law on him He s a beast that s what he is Katie Anna said if I leave can you get my clothes to me I ll carry all I can He d take the strap to me Well if you re leaving anyhow you can put some of my things in your trunk Good and right you are to get out Katie agreed Sure I ll do it Where do you think you ll go I thought last night I d jump in the river I ve changed my mind though I ll pay him back and not the way he expects Give it to him good assented Katie I d have liked to slip some of that Paris green of his in his coffee this morning And now he s off for church the old hypocrite To Katie s curious inquiries as to the cause of the beating Anna was now too committal I held out some money on him was all she said Katie regarded her with a mixture of awe and admiration You ve got your nerve she said I wonder he didn t kill you What s yours is his and what s his is his own But Anna could not leave that morning She lay in her bed cold compresses on her swollen face and shoulders a bruised and broken thing planning hideous reprisals Herman made no inquiry for her He went stolidly about the day s work carried in firewood and coal from the shed inspected the garden with a view to early planting and ate hugely of the mid day dinner In the afternoon Rudolph came Where s Anna he asked briskly She is in her room She is not well If Rudolph suspected anything it was only that Anna was sulking But later on he had reason to believe that there trouble Out of a clear sky Herman said She has had a raise Anna was she to him Since when Rudolph asked with interest I know nothing She has not given it to me She has been buying herself a watch So Rudolph s tone was wary She will buy herself no more watches said Herman with an air of finality Rudolph hesitated The organization wanted Herman he had had great influence with the millworkers Through him many things would be possible The Spencers trusted him too At any time Rudolph knew they would be glad to reinstate him and once inside the plant there was no limit to the mischief he could do But Herman was too valuable to risk Suppose he was told now about Graham Spencer and Anna and beat the girl and was jailed for it Besides ugly as Rudolph s suspicions were they were as yet only suspicions He decided to wait until he could bring Herman proof of Graham Spencer s relations with Anna When that time came he knew Herman He would be clay for the potter He Rudolph intended to be the potter Katie had an afternoon off that Sunday When she came back that night Herman weary from the late hours of Saturday was already snoring in his bed Anna met Katie at her door and drew her in I ve found a nice room Katie whispered Here s the address written down The street cars go past it Three dollars a week Are you ready Anna was ready even to her hat Over it she placed a dark veil for she was badly disfigured Then with Katie crying quietly she left the house In the flare from the Spencer furnaces Katie watched until the girl reappeared on the twisting street below which still followed the old path that path where Herman years ago had climbed through the first spring wild flowers to the cottage on the hill Graham was uncomfortable the next morning on his way to the mill Anna s face had haunted him But out of all his confusion one thing stood out with distinctness If he was to be allowed to marry Marion he must have no other entanglement He would go to her clean and clear So he went to the office armed toward Anna with a hardness he was far from feeling Poor little kid he reflected on the way down Rotten luck all round He did not for a moment believe that it would be a lasting grief He knew that sort of girl he reflected out of his vast experience of twenty two They were sentimental but they loved and forgot easily He hoped she would forget him but even with that there was a vague resentment that she should do so She ll marry some mill hand he reflected and wear a boudoir cap and have a lot of children who need their noses wiped But he was uncomfortable Anna was not in her office Her coat and hat were not there He was surprised somewhat relieved It was out of his hands then she had gone somewhere else to work Well she was a good stenographer Somebody was having a piece of luck Clayton finding him short handed sent Joey over to help him pack up his office belongings the fittings of his desk his personal papers the Japanese prints and rugs Natalie had sent after her single visit to the boy s new working quarters And when Graham came back from luncheon Joey had a message for him Telephone call for you mister Spencer What was it Lady called up from a pay phone She left her number and said she d wait Joey lowered his voice confidentially Sounded like Miss Klein he volunteered He was extremely resentful when Graham sent him away on an errand And Graham himself frowned as he called the number on the pad It was like a girl this breaking off clean and then telephoning instead of letting the thing go once and for all But his face changed as he heard Anna s brief story over the wire Of course I ll come he said I m pretty busy but I can steal a half hour Don t you worry We ll fix it up some way He was more concerned than deeply anxious when he rang off It was unfortunate that was all And the father was a German swine and ought to be beaten himself To think that his Christmas gift had brought her to such a pass A leather strap God He was vaguely uneasy however He had a sense of a situation being forced on him He knew too that Clayton was waiting for him at the new plant But Anna s trouble absurd as its cause seemed to him was his responsibility It ceased to be absurd however when he saw her discolored features It would be some time before she could even look for another situation Her face was a swollen mask and since such attraction as she had had for him had been due to a sort of evanescent prettiness of youth he felt a repulsion that he tried his best to conceal You poor little thing he said He s a brute I d like He clenched his fists Well I got you into it I m certainly going to see you through She had lowered her veil quickly and he felt easier The telephone booth was in the corner of a quiet hotel and they were alone He patted her shoulder I ll see you through he repeated Don t you worry about anything Just lie low See me through How I can give you money that s the least I can do Until you are able to work again And as she drew away We ll call it a loan if that makes you feel better You haven t anything have you He has everything I ve earned I ve never had a penny except carfare Poor little girl he said again She was still weak he saw and he led her into the deserted cafe He took a highball himself not because he wanted it but because she refused to drink at first He had never before had a drink in the morning and he felt a warm and reckless glow to his very finger tips Bending toward her while the waiter s back was turned he kissed her marred and swollen cheek To think I have brought you all this trouble You mustn t blame yourself I do But I ll make it up to you Anna You don t hate me for it do you Hate you You know better than that I ll come round to take you out now and then in the evenings I don t want you to sit alone in that forsaken boarding house and mope He drew out a bill fold and extracted some notes Don t be silly he protested as she drew back It s the only way I can get back my self respect You owe it to me to let me do it She was not hard to persuade Anything was better than going back to the cottage on the hill and to that heavy brooding figure and the strap on the wall But the taking of the money marked a new epoch in the girl s infatuation It bought her She did not know it nor did he But hitherto she had been her own earning her own livelihood What she gave of love of small caresses and intimacies had been free gifts From that time she was his creature In her creed which was the creed of the girls on the hill one did not receive without giving She would pay him back but all that she had to give was herself You ll come to see me too Won t you The tingling was very noticeable now He felt warm and young and very very strong Of course I ll come to see you he said recklessly You take a little time off you ve worked hard and we ll play round together She bent down unexpectedly and put her bruised cheek against his hand as it lay on the table I love you dreadfully she whispered CHAPTER XXX February and March were peaceful months on the surface Washington was taking stock quietly of national resources and watching for Germany s next move The winter impasse in Europe gave way to the first fighting of spring raids and sorties mostly since the ground was still too heavy for the advancement of artillery On the high seas the reign of terror was in full swing and little tragic echoes of the world drama began again to come by cable across the Atlantic Some of Graham s friends like poor Chris found the end of the path of glory The tall young Canadian Highlander died before Peronne in March Denis Nolan s nephew was killed in the Irish Fusileers One day Clayton came home to find a white faced Buckham taking his overcoat in the hall and to learn that he had lost a young brother Clayton was uncomfortable at dinner that night He wondered what Buckham thought of them sitting there around the opulent table in that luxurious room Did he resent it After dinner he asked him if he cared to take a few days off but the old butler shook his head I m glad to have my work to keep me busy sir he said And anyhow in England it s considered best to go on quite as though nothing had happened It s better for the troops sir There was a new softness and tolerance in Clayton that early spring He had mellowed somehow a mellowing that had nothing to do with his new prosperity In past times he had wondered how he would stand financial success if it ever came He had felt fairly sure he could stand the other thing But success Now he found that it only increased his sense of responsibility He was outside of the war situation as nearly happy as he had been in years Natalie s petulant moods when they came no longer annoyed him He was supported had he only known it by the strong inner life he was living a life that centered about his weekly meetings with Audrey Audrey gave him courage to go on He left their comradely hours together better and stronger All the week centered about that one hour out of seven days when he stood on her hearth rug or lay back in a deep chair listening or talking such talk as Natalie might have heard without resentment Some times he felt that that one hour was all he wanted it carried so far helped so greatly He was so boyishly content in it And then she would make a gesture or there would be for a second a deeper note in her voice and the mad instinct to catch her to him was almost overwhelming Some times he wondered if she were not very lonely not knowing that she too lived for days on that one hour She was not going out because of Chris s death and he knew there were long hours when she sat alone struggling determinedly with the socks she was knitting Only once did they tread on dangerous ground and that was on her birthday He stopped in a jeweler s on his way up town and brought her a black pearl on a thin almost invisible chain only to have her refuse to take it I can t Clay Why not It s too valuable I can t take valuable presents from men It s value hasn t anything to do with it I m not wearing jewelry anyhow Audrey he said gravely it isn t the pearl It isn t its value That s absurd Don t you understand that I would like to think that you have something I have given you When she sat still thinking over what he had said he slipped the chain around her neck and clasped it Then he stooped down very gravely and kissed her For my silent partner he said In all those weeks that was the only time he had kissed her He knew quite well the edge of the gulf they stood on and he was determined not to put the burden of denial on her He felt a real contempt for men who left the strength of refusal to a woman who pleaded knowing that the woman s strength would save them from themselves and that if she weakened the responsibility was hers So he fed on the husks of love and was if not happy happier Graham too was getting on better For one thing Anna Klein had been ill She lay in her boarding house frightened at every step on the stairs and slowly recovered from a low fever Graham had not seen her but he sent her money for a doctor for medicines for her room rent enclosed in brief letters purely friendly and interested But she kept them under her pillow and devoured them with feverish eyes But something had gone out of life for Graham Not Anna Natalie watching him closely wondered what it was He had been strange and distant with her ever since that tall boy in kilts had been there He was studiously polite and attentive to her rose when she entered a room and remained standing until she was seated brought her the book she had forgotten lighted her occasional cigaret kissed her morning and evening But he no longer came into her dressing room for that hour before dinner when Natalie in dressing gown and slippers had closed the door to Clayton s room and had kept him for herself She was jealous of Clayton those days Some times she found the boy s eyes fixed on his father with admiration and something more She was jealous of the things they had in common of the days at the mill of the bits of discussion after dinner when Clayton sat back with his cigar and Graham voiced as new discoveries things about the work that Clayton had realized for years He always listened gravely with no hint of patronage But Natalie would break in now and then impatient of a conversation that excluded her Your father knows all these things Graham she said once You talk as though you d just discovered the mill like Columbus discovering America Not at all Clayton said hastily He has a new viewpoint I am greatly interested Go on Graham But the boy s enthusiasm had died He grew self conscious apologetic And Clayton felt a resentment that was close to despair The second of April fell on a Saturday Congress having ended the session the fourth of March had been hastily reconvened and on the evening of that day Saturday at half past eight the President went before the two Houses in joint session Much to Clayton s disgust he found on returning home that they were dining out Only at the Mackenzies It s not a party Natalie said As usual she was before the dressing table and she spoke to his reflection in the mirror I should think you could do that without looking like a thunder cloud Goodness knows we ve been quiet enough this Lent You know Congress has been re convened I don t know why that should interfere It s rather a serious time He tried very hard to speak pleasantly Her engrossment in her own reflection irritated him so he did not look at her But of course I ll go Every time is a serious time with you lately she flung after him Her tone was not disagreeable She was merely restating an old grievance A few moments later he heard her calling through the open door I got some wonderful old rugs to day Clay Yes You ll scream when you pay for them I ve lost my voice screaming my dear You ll love these They have the softest colors dead rose and faded blue and old copper tones I m very glad you re pleased She was in high good humor when they started Clayton trying to meet her conversational demands found himself wondering if the significance of what was to happen in Washington that night had struck home to her If it had and she could still be cheerful then it was because she had forced a promise from Graham He made his decision then to force her to release the boy from any promise to allow him his own choice But he felt with increasing anxiety that some of Natalie s weakness of character had descended to Graham that in him as in Natalie perhaps obstinacy was what he hoped was strength He wondered listening to her what it would be to have beside him that night some strong and quiet woman to whom he could carry his problems his perplexities Some one to sit hand in his and set him right as such a woman could on many things And for a moment he pictured Audrey Audrey his wife driving with him in their car to whatever the evening might hold And after it was all over going back with her away from all the chatter that meant so little to the home that shut them in together He was very gentle to Natalie that night Natalie had been right It was a small and informal group gathered together hastily to discuss the emergency only Denis Nolan the Mackenzies Clayton and Natalie and Audrey We brought her out of her shell said Terry genially because the country is going to make history to night The sort of history Audrey has been shouting for for months The little party was very grave Yet of them all only the Spencers would be directly affected The Mackenzies had no children Button my secretary Terry announced is in Washington He is to call me here when the message is finished Isn t it possible said Natalie recalling a headline from the evening paper that the House may cause an indefinite delay And as usual Clayton wondered at the adroitness with which in the talk that followed she escaped detection They sat long at the table rather as though they clung together And Nolan insisted on figuring the cost of war in money Queer thing he said In ancient times the cost of war fell almost entirely on the poor But it s the rich who will pay for this war All taxation is directed primarily against the rich The poor pay in blood said Audrey rather sharply They give their lives and that is all they have Rich and poor are going to do that now old Terry broke in Fight against it all you like you members of the privileged class the draft is coming This is every man s war But Clayton Spencer was watching Natalie She had paled and was fingering her liqueur glass absently Behind her lowered eyelids he surmised that again she was planning But what Then it came to him like a flash Old Terry had said the draft would exempt married men She meant to marry Graham to a girl she detested to save him from danger Through it all however and in spite of his anger and apprehension he was sorry for her Sorry for her craven spirit Sorry even with an understanding that came from his own fears Sorry for her that she had remained an essential child in a time that would tax the utmost maturity She was a child Even her selfishness was the selfishness of a spoiled child She craved things and the spirit the essence of life escaped her And beside him was Audrey valiant eyed courageous honest Natalie and Audrey Some time during the evening his thoughts took this form that there were two sorts of people in the world those who seized their own happiness at any cost and those who saw the promised land from a far hill and having seen it turned back CHAPTER XXXI Graham was waiting in Clayton s dressing room when he went up stairs Through the closed door they could hear Natalie s sleepy and rather fretful orders to her maid Graham rose when he entered and threw away his cigaret I guess it has come father It looks like it A great wave of tenderness for the boy flooded over him That tall straight body cast in his own mold but young only ready to live that was to be cast into the crucible of war to come out God alone knew how And not his boy only but millions of other boys Yet better to break the body than ruin the soul How is mother taking it Natalie s voice came through the door She was insisting that the house be kept quiet the next morning She wanted to sleep late Clayton caught the boy s eyes on him and a half smile on his face Does she know Yes She isn t taking it very hard is she Then his voice changed I wish you d talk to her father She s well she s got me You see I promised her not to go in without her consent When did you do that The night we broke with Germany in February I was a fool but she was crying and I didn t know what else to do And there was a ring of desperation in his voice she s holding me to it I ve been to her over and over again And you want to go Want to go I ve got to go He broke out then into a wild appeal He wanted to get away He was making a mess of all sorts of things He wasn t any good He would try to make good in the army Maybe it was only the adventure he wanted he didn t know He hadn t gone into that He hated the Germans He wanted one chance at them anyhow They were beasts Clayton listening was amazed at the depth of feeling and anger in his voice I ll talk to your mother he agreed when the boy s passion had spent itself I think she will release you But he was less certain than he pretended to be He remembered Natalie s drooping eyelids that night at dinner She might absolve him from the promise but there were other ways of holding him back than promises Perhaps we would better go into the situation thoroughly he suggested I have rather understood lately that you what about Marion Hayden Graham I m engaged to her There was rather a long pause Clayton s face was expressionless Since when Last fall sir Does your mother know I told her yes He looked up quickly I didn t tell you I knew you disliked her and mother said He checked himself Marion wanted to wait She wanted to be welcome when she came into the family I don t so much dislike her as I disapprove of her That s rather worse isn t it Clayton was tired His very spirit was tired He sat down in his big chair by the fire She is older than you are you know I don t see what that has to do with it father In Clayton s defense was his own situation He did not want the boy to repeat his mistakes to marry the wrong woman and then find too late the right one During the impassioned appeal that followed he was doggedly determined to prevent that Perhaps he lost the urgency in the boy s voice Perhaps in his new conviction that the passions of the forties were the only real ones he took too little count of the urge of youth He roused himself You think you are really in love with her I want her I know that That s different That s you are too young to know what you want I ought to be married It would settle me I m sick of batting round You want to marry before you enter the army Yes Do you think for a moment that your wife will be willing to let you go Graham straightened himself She would have to let me go And in sheer despair Clayton played his last card Played it and regretted it bitterly a moment later We must get this straight Graham It s not a question of your entering the army or not doing it It s a question of your happiness Marriage is a matter of a life time It s got to be based on something more than he hesitated And your mother Please go on You have just said that your mother does not want you to go into the army Has it occurred to you she would even see you married to a girl she detests to keep you at home Graham s face hardened So he said heavily Marion wants me for the money she thinks I m going to have and mother wants me to marry to keep me safe By God it s a dirty world isn t it Suddenly he was gone and Clayton following uneasily to the doorway heard a slam below When some hours later Graham had not come back he fell into the heavy sleep that follows anxiety and brings no rest In the morning he found that Graham had gone back to the garage and taken his car and that he had not returned Afterward Clayton was to look back and to remember with surprise how completely the war crisis had found him absorbed in his own small group But perhaps in the back of every man s mind war was always first of all a thing of his own human contacts It was only when those were cleared up that he saw the bigger problem The smaller questions loomed so close as to obscure the larger vision He went out into the country the next day a cold Sunday going afoot his head down against the wind and walked for miles He looked haggard and tired when he came back but his quiet face held a new resolve War had come at last He would put behind him the selfish craving for happiness forget himself He would not make money out of the nation s necessity He would put Audrey out of his mind if not out of his heart He would try to rebuild his house of life along new and better lines Perhaps he could bring Natalie to see things as he saw them as they were not as she wanted them to be Some times it took great crises to bring out women Child bearing did it often Urgent need did it too But after all the real test was war The big woman met it squarely took her part of the burden the small woman weakened went down under it found it a grievance rather than a grief He did not notice Graham s car when it passed him outside the city limits or see Anna Klein s startled eyes as it flashed by Graham did not come in until evening At ten o clock Clayton found the second man carrying up stairs a tray containing whisky and soda and before he slept he heard a tap at Graham s door across the hall and surmised that he had rung for another Later still he heard Natalie cross the hall and rather loud and angry voices He considered ironically that a day which had found a part of the nation on its knees found in his own house only dissension and bitterness In the morning at the office Joey announced a soldier to see him and added with his customary nonchalance We ll be having a lot of them around now I expect Clayton glancing up from the visitor s slip in his hand surprised something wistful in the boy s eyes Want to go do you Give my neck to go sir He always added the sir when he remembered it with the air of throwing a sop to a convention he despised You may yet you know This thing is going to last a while Send him in Joey He had grown attached to this lad of the streets He found in his loyalty a thing he could not buy Jackson was his caller Clayton who had been rather more familiar with his back in its gray livery than with any other aspect of him found him strange and impressive in khaki I m sorry I couldn t get here sooner mister Spencer he explained I ve been down on the border Yuma I just got a short leave and came back to see my family He stood very erect a bronzed and military figure Suddenly it seemed strange to Clayton Spencer that this man before him had only a few months before opened his automobile door for him and stood waiting with a rug to spread over his knees He got up and shook hands You look like a different man Jackson Well at least I feel like a man Sit down he said And again it occurred to him that never before had he asked Jackson to sit down in his presence It was wrong somehow The whole class system was absurd Maybe war would change that too It was doing many queer things already He had sent for Jackson but he did not at once approach the reason He sat back while Jackson talked of the border and Joey slipped in and pretended to sharpen lead pencils Clayton s eyes wandered to the window Outside in the yard were other men now employees of his who would soon be in khaki Out of every group there in a short time some would be gone and of those who would go a certain number would never come back That was what war was one day a group of men laboring with their hands or their brains that some little home might live that they might go back at evening to that home and there rest for the next day s toil And the next gone Every man out there in the yard was loved by some one To a certain number of them this day meant death or wounding It meant separation and suffering and struggle And all over the country there were such groups The roar of the plant came in through the open window A freight car was being loaded with finished shells As fast as it was filled another car was shunted along the spur to take its place Over in Germany in hundreds of similar plants similar shells were being hurried to the battle line to be hurled against the new army that was soon to cross the seas All those men and back of every man a woman Jackson had stopped Joey was regarding him with stealthy admiration and holding his breast bone very high Already in his mind Joey was a soldier You did not say in your note why you wanted to see me mister Spencer He roused himself with a visible effort I sent for you yes he said I sent I ll tell you why I sent for you Jackson I ve been meaning to do it for several weeks Now that this has come I m more than glad I did so You can t keep your family on what you are getting That s certain My wife is going to help me sir The boy will soon be weaned Then she intends to get a position She was a milliner when we were married But Great Scott She ought not to leave a child as young as that Jackson smiled She s going to fix that all right She wants to do it And we re all right so far I had saved a little Then there were women like that Women who would not only let their men go to war but who would leave their homes and enter the struggle for bread to help them do it She says it s the right thing volunteered Jackson proudly Women who felt that a man going into the service was a right thing Women who saw war as a duty to be done not a wild adventure for the adventurous You ought to be very proud of her he said slowly There are not many like that Well Jackson said apologetically they ll come round sir Some of them kind of hate the idea just at first But I look to see a good many doing what my wife s doing Clayton wondered grimly what Jackson would think if he knew that at that moment he was passionately envious of him of his uniform of the youth that permitted him to wear that uniform of his bronzed skin of his wife of his pride in that wife You re a lucky chap Jackson he said I sent for you because I wanted to say that as long as you are in the national service I shall feel that you are on a vacation he smiled at the word on pay Under those circumstances I owe you quite a little money Jackson was too overwhelmed to reply at once As a matter of fad Clayton went on it s a national move in a way You don t owe any gratitude We need our babies you see More than we do hats If this war goes on we shall need a good many boy babies And his own words suddenly crystallized the terror that was in him It was the boys who would go boys who whistled in the morning boys who dreamed in the spring long dreams of romance and of love Boys Not men like himself with their hopes and dreams behind them Not men who had lived enough to know that only their early dreams were real Not men who having lived knew the vast disillusion of living and were ready to die It was only after Jackson had gone that he saw the fallacy of his own reasoning If to live were disappointment then to die still dreaming the great dream was not wholly evil He found himself saying To earn some honorable advancement for one s soul Deep down in him overlaid with years of worldliness there was a belief in a life after death He looked out the window at the little changing group In each man out there there was something that would live on after he had shed that sweating often dirty always weary sometimes malformed shell that was the body And then the thing that would count would be not how he had lived but what he had done This war was a big thing It was the biggest thing in all the history of the world There might be perhaps some special heaven for those who had given themselves to it some particular honorable advancement for their souls Already he saw Jackson as one apart a man dedicated Then he knew that all his thinking was really centered about his boy He wanted Graham to go But in giving him he was giving him to the chance of death Then he must hold to his belief in eternity He must feel that or the thing would be unbearable For the first time in his life he gave conscious thought to Natalie s religious belief She believed in those things She must She sat devoutly through the long service she slipped with a little rustle of soft silk so easily to her knees Perhaps if he went to her with that CHAPTER XXXII For a week after Anna s escape Herman Klein had sat alone and brooded Entirely alone now for following a stormy scene on his discovery of Anna s disappearance Katie had gone too I don t know where she is she had said angrily and if I did know I wouldn t tell you If I was her I d have the law on you Don t you look at that strap You lay a hand on me and I ll kill you If you think I m afraid of you you can think again She is my daughter and not yet of age Herman said heavily You tell her for me that she comes back or I go and bring her Yah Katie jeered You try it She s got marks on her that ll jail you And on his failure to reply her courage mounted This ain t Germany you know They know how to treat women over here And you ask me her voice rose and I ll just say that there s queer comings and goings here with that Rudolph I ve heard him say some things that ll lock him up good and tight For all his rage Teutonic caution warned him not to lay hands on the girl But his anger against her almost strangled him Indeed when she came down stairs dragging her heavy suitcase he took a step or two toward her with his fists clenched She stopped terrified You old bully she said between white lips You touch me and I ll scream till I bring in every neighbor in the block There s a good lamp post outside that s just waiting for your sort of German He had refused to pay her for the last week also But that she knew well enough was because he was out of money As fast as Anna s salary had come in he had taken out of it the small allowance that was to cover the week s expenses and had banked the remainder But Anna had carried her last pay envelope away with her and added to his anger at her going was his fear that he would have to draw on his savings With Katie gone he set heavily about preparing his Sunday dinner Long years of service done for him however had made him clumsy He cooked a wretched meal and then leaving the dishes as they were he sat by the fire and brooded When Rudolph came in later he found him there in his stocking feet a morose and untidy figure Rudolph s reception of the news roused him however He looked up after the telling to find the younger man standing over him and staring down at him with blood shot eyes You beat her he was saying What with What does that matter She had bought herself a watch What did you beat her with Rudolph was licking his lips Receiving no reply he called Katie Katie has gone Maybe you beat her too She wasn t my daughter No by God You wouldn t dare to touch her She didn t belong to you You Get out said Herman somberly He stood up menacingly You go now Rudolph hesitated Then he laughed All right old top he said in a conciliatory tone No offense meant I lost my temper He picked up the empty coal scuffle and went out into the shed where the coal was kept He needed a minute to think Besides he always brought in coal when he was there In the shed however he put down the scuttle and stood still The old devil he muttered But his rage for Anna was followed by rage against her Where was she to night Did Graham Spencer know where she was And if he did what then Were they at that moment somewhere together Hidden away the two of them The conviction that they were together grew on him and with it a frenzy that was almost madness He left the coal scuttle in the shed and went out into the air For a half hour he stood there looking down toward the Spencer furnace sending up now red now violet bursts of flame He was angry enough jealous enough But he was quick too to see that that particular lump of potters clay which was Herman Klein was ready for the wheel Even while he was cursing the girl his cunning mind was already plotting revenge for the Spencers self aggrandizement among his fellows for himself His inordinate conceit wounded by Anna s defection found comfort in the early prospect of putting over a big thing He carried the coal in to find Herman gloomily clearing his untidy table For a moment they worked in silence Rudolph at the stove Herman at the sink Then Rudolph washed his hands under the faucet and faced the older man How do you know she bought herself that watch he demanded Herman eyed him Perhaps you gave it to her Something like suspicion of Rudolph crept into his eyes Me A hundred dollar watch How do you know it cost a hundred dollars I saw it She tried that story on me too But I was too smart for her I went to the store and asked A hundred bucks Herman s lips drew back over his teeth You knew it eh And you did not tell me It wasn t my funeral said Rudolph coolly If you wanted to believe she bought it herself If she bought it herself Rudolph s shoulder was caught in an iron grip You will tell me what you mean Well I ask you do you think she d spend that much on a watch Anyhow the installment story doesn t go That place doesn t sell on installments Who is there would buy her such a watch Herman s voice was thick How about Graham Spencer She s been pretty thick with him How you mean thick Rudolph shrugged his shoulders I don t mean anything But he s taken her out in his car And the Spencers think there s nothing can t be bought with money Herman put down the dish cloth and commenced to draw down his shirt sleeves Where you going Rudolph demanded uneasily I go to the Spencers Listen Rudolph said excitedly Don t you do it not yet You got to get him first We don t know anything we don t even know he gave her that watch We ve got to find her don t you see And then we ve got to learn if he s going there wherever she is I shall bring her back Herman said stubbornly I shall bring her back and I shall kill her And get strung up yourself Now listen he argued You leave this to me I ll find her I ve got a friend a city detective and he ll help me see We ll get her back all right Only you ve got to keep your hands off her It s the Spencers that have got to pay Herman went back to the sink slowly That is right It is the Spencers he muttered Rudolph went out Late in the evening he came back with the news that the search was on And knowing Herman s pride he assured him that the hill need never learn of Anna s flight and if any inquiries came he advised him to say the girl was sick In Rudolph s twisted mind it was not so much Anna s delinquency that enraged him The hill had its own ideas of morality But he was fiercely jealous with that class jealousy which was the fundamental actuating motive of his life He never for a moment doubted that she had gone to Graham And sitting by the fire in the little house old Herman s untidy head shrunk on his shoulders Rudolph almost forgot Anna in plotting to use this new pawn across the hearth from him in his game of destruction By the end of the week however there was no news of Anna She had not returned to the mill Rudolph s friend on the detective force had found no clew and old Herman had advanced from brooding by the fire to long and furious wanderings about the city streets He felt no remorse only a growing and alarming fury He returned at night to his cold and unkempt house to cook himself a frugal and wretched meal His money had run very low and with true German stubbornness he refused to draw any from the savings bank Rudolph was very busy There were meetings always and to the little inner circle that met behind Gus s barroom one night later in March he divulged the plan for the destruction of the new Spencer munition plant But will they take him back one of the men asked He was of better class than the rest with a military bearing and a heavy German accent for all his careful English Will a dog snatch at a bone countered Rudolph Take him back They ll be crazy about it He has been there a long time He may at the last weaken But Rudolph only laughed and drank more whisky of the German agent s providing He won t weaken he said Give me a few days more to find the girl and all hell won t hold him On the Sunday morning after the President had been before Congress he found Herman dressed for church but sitting by the fire All around him lay the Sunday paper and he barely raised his head when Rudolph entered Well it s here said Rudolph It has come Yes Wall Street will be opening champagne to day Herman said nothing But later on he opened up the fountain of rage in his heart It was wrong all wrong We had no quarrel with Germany It was the capitalists and politicians who had done it And above all England He went far He blamed America and Americans for his loss of work for Anna s disappearance He searched his mind for grievances and found them in the ore dust on the hill which killed his garden in the inefficiency of the police who could not find Anna in the very attitude of Clayton Spencer toward his resignation And on this smoldering fire Rudolph piled fuel Not that he said a great deal He worked around the cottage washed dishes threw pails of water on the dirty porches swept the floor carried in coal and wood And gradually he began to play on the older man s vanity He had had great influence with the millworkers No one man had ever had so much Old Herman sat up and listened sourly But after a time he got up and pouring some water out of the kettle proceeded to shave himself And Rudolph talked on If now he were to go back and it were to the advantage of the Fatherland and of the workers of the world to hamper the industry who so able to do it as Herman Hamper How Herman asked suspiciously holding his razor aloft He had a great fear of the law Rudolph re assured him cunning eyes averted Well a strike he suggested The men ll listen to you God knows they ve got a right to strike I shall not go back said Herman stolidly and finished his shaving But Rudolph was satisfied He left Herman sitting again by the fire but his eyes were no longer brooding He was thinking watching the smoke curl up from the china bowled German pipe which he had brought from the Fatherland and which he used only on special occasions CHAPTER XXXIII The declaration of war found Graham desperately unhappy Natalie held him rigidly to his promise but it is doubtful if Natalie alone could have kept him out of the army Marion was using her influence too She held him by alternating between almost agreeing to runaway marriage and threats of breaking the engagement if he went to war She had tacitly agreed to play Natalie s game and she was doing it Graham did not analyze his own misery What he said to himself was that he was making a mess of things Life which had seemed to be a simple thing compounded of work and play had become involved difficult and wretched Some times he watched Clayton almost with envy He seemed so sure of himself he was so poised so calm so strong And he wondered if there had been a tumultuous youth behind the quiet of his maturity He compared the even course of Clayton s days his work his club the immaculate orderliness of his life with his own disordered existence He was hedged about with women Wherever he turned they obtruded themselves He made plans and women brushed them aside He tried to live his life and women stepped in and lived it for him His mother Marion Anna Klein Even Delight with her friendship always overclouded with disapproval Wherever he turned a woman stood in the way Yet he could not do without them He needed them even while he resented them Then gradually into his self engrossment there penetrated a conviction that all was not well between his father and his mother He had always taken them for granted much as he did the house and the servants In his brief vacations during his college days they had agreed or disagreed amicably enough He had considered in those days that life was a very simple thing People married and lived together Marriage he considered was rather the end of things But he was older now and he knew that marriage was a beginning and not an end It did not change people fundamentally It only changed their habits His discovery that his father and mother differed about the war was the first of other discoveries that they differed about him that they differed about many matters that indeed they had no common ground at all on which to meet between them although Graham did not put it that way was a No Man s Land strewn with dead happiness lost desires and the wreckage of years of dissension It was incredible to Graham that he should ever reach the forties but he wondered some times if all of life was either looking forward or looking back And it seemed to him rather tragic that for Clayton who still looked like a boy there should be nothing but his day at the mill his silent evening at home or some stodgy dinner party where the women were all middle aged and the other men a trifle corpulent For the first time he was beginning to think of Clayton as a man rather than a father Not that all of this was coherently thought out It was a series of impressions outgrowth of his own beginning development and of his own uneasiness He wondered too about Rodney Page He seemed to be always around underfoot suave fastidious bowing Natalie out of the room and in again He had deplored the war until he found his attitude unfashionable and then he began with great enthusiasm to arrange pageants for Red Cross funds and even to make little speeches graceful and artificial patterned on his best after dinner manner Graham was certain that he supported his mother in trying to keep him at home and he began to hate him with a healthy young hate However late in April he posed in one of the pageants rather ungraciously in a khaki uniform It was not until the last minute that he knew that Delight Haverford was to be the nurse bending over his prostrate figure He turned rather savage Rotten nonsense he said to her when they stood waiting to be posed Oh I don t know They re rather pretty Pretty Do you suppose I want it be pretty Well I do said Delight calmly It s fake That s what I hate If you were really a nurse and was really in uniform But this parading in somebody else s clothes or stuff hired for the occasion it s sickening Delight regarded him with clear appraising eyes Why don t you get a uniform of your own then she inquired She smiled a little He never knew what the effort cost her He was pale and angry and his face in the tableau was so set that it brought a round of applause With the ringing down of the curtain he confronted her almost menacingly What did you mean by that he demanded We ve hardly got into this thing yet We are in it Graham Just because I don t leap into the first recruiting office and beg them to take me what right have you got to call me a slacker But I heard Go on It doesn t matter what I heard if you are going Of course I m going he said truculently He meant it too He would get Anna settled somewhere she had begun to mend and then he would have it out with Marion and his mother But there was no hurry The war would last a long time And so it was that Graham Spencer joined the long line of those others who had bought a piece of ground or five yoke of oxen or had married a wife It was the morning after the pageant that Clayton going down town with him in the car voiced his expectation that the government would take over their foreign contracts and his feeling that in that case it would be a mistake to profit by the nation s necessities What do you mean sir I mean we should take only a small profit A banker s profit Graham had been fairly stunned and had sat quiet while Clayton explained his attitude There were times when big profits were allowable There was always the risk to invested capital to consider But he did not want to grow fat on the nation s misfortunes Italy was one thing This was different But we are just getting on our feet Think it over said Clayton This is going to be a long war and an expensive one We don t particularly want to profit by it do we Graham flushed He felt rather small and cheap but with that there was a growing admiration of his father Suddenly he saw that this man beside him was a big man one to be proud of For already he knew the cost of the decision He sat still turning this new angle of war over in his mind I d like to see some of your directors when you put that up to them Clayton nodded rather grimly He did not anticipate a pleasant hour How about mother I think we may take it for granted that she feels as we do Graham pondered that too What about the new place It s too soon to discuss that We are obligated to do a certain amount Of course it would be wise to cut where we can Graham smiled She ll raise the deuce of a row was his comment It had never occurred to him before to take sides between his father and his mother but there was rising in him a new and ardent partisanship of his father a feeling that they were in a way men together He had more than once been tempted to go to him with the Anna Klein situation He would have probably but a fellow felt an awful fool going to somebody and telling him that a girl was in love with him and what the dickens was he to do about it He wondered too if anybody would believe that his relationship with Anna was straight under the circumstances For weeks now he had been sending her money out of a sheer sense of responsibility for her beating and her illness He took no credit for altruism He knew quite well the possibilities of the situation He made no promises to himself But such attraction as Anna had had for him had been of her prettiness and their propinquity Again she was girl and that was all And the attraction was very faint now He was only sorry for her When she could get about she took to calling him up daily from a drug store at a near by corner and once he met her after dark and they walked a few blocks together She was still weak but she was spiritualized too He liked her a great deal that night Do you know you ve loaned me over a hundred dollars Graham she asked That s not a loan I owed you that I ll pay it back I m going to start to morrow to look for work and it won t cost me much to live If you send it back I ll buy you another watch And tragic as the subject was they both laughed I d have died if I hadn t had you to think about when I was sick Graham I wanted to die except for you He had kissed her then rather because he knew she expected him to When they got back to the house she said You wouldn t care to come up I don t think I had better Anna The landlady doesn t object There isn t any parlor All the girls have their callers in their rooms I have to go out to night he said evasively I ll come some other time As he started away he glanced back at her She was standing in the doorway eying him wistfully a lonely and depressed little figure He was tempted to throw discretion to the wind and go back But he did not On the day when Clayton had broached the subject of offering their output to the government at only a banker s profit Anna called him up at his new office in the munition plant He was rather annoyed His new secretary was sitting across the desk and it was difficult to make his responses noncommittal Graham Yes Is anybody there Can you talk Not very well Then listen I ll talk I want to see you I m busy all day Sorry Listen Graham I must see you I ve something to tell you All right go ahead It s about Rudolph I was out looking for a position yesterday and I met him Yes He looked up Miss Peterson was absently scribbling on the cover of her book and listening intently He was terrible Graham He accused me of all sorts of things about you He almost groaned aloud over the predicament he was in It began to look serious Suppose I pick you up and we have dinner somewhere At the same corner Yes He was very irritable all morning He felt as though a net was closing in around him and his actual innocence made him the more miserable Miss Peterson found him very difficult that day and shed tears in her little room before she went to lunch Anna herself was difficult that evening Her landlady s son had given up a good job and enlisted Everybody was going She supposed Graham would go next and she d be left alone I don t know I d like to Oh you ll go all right And you ll forget I ever existed She made an effort You re right of course I m only looking ahead If anything happens to you I ll kill myself The idea interested her She began to dramatize herself a forlorn figure driven from home and deserted by her lover She saw herself lying in the cottage stately and mysterious while the hill girls went in and out and whispered I ll kill myself she repeated Nothing will happen to me Anna dear I don t know why I care so I m nothing to you That s not so If you cared you d have come up the other night You left me alone in that lonesome hole It s hell that place All smells and whispering and dirt Now listen to me Anna You re tired or you wouldn t say that You know I m fond of you But I ve got you into trouble enough I m not for God s sake don t tempt me Anna She looked at him half scornfully Tempt you Then she gave a little scream Graham following her eyes looked through the window near them Rudolph she whimpered And began to weep out of pure terror But Graham saw nobody To soothe her however he went outside and looked about There were half a dozen cars a group of chauffeurs but no Rudolph He went hack to her to find her sitting pale and tense her hands clenched together They ll pay you out some way she said I know them They ll never believe the truth That was Rudolph all right He ll think we re living together He d never believe anything else Do you think he followed you the other day I gave him the shake in the crowd Then I don t see why you re worrying We re just where we were before aren t we You don t know them I do They ll be up to something She was excited and anxious and with the cocktail he ordered for her she grew reckless I m just hung around your neck like a stone she lamented You don t care a rap for me I know it You re just sorry for me Her eyes filled again and Graham rose with an impatient movement Let s get out of this he said roughly The whole place is staring at you But on the road the fact that she had been weeping for him made him relent He put an arm around her and drew her to him Don t cry honey he said It makes me unhappy to see you miserable He kissed her And they clung together finding a little comfort in the contact of warm young bodies He went up to her room that night He was more anxious as to Rudolph than he cared to admit but he went up treading softly on stairs that creaked with every step He had no coherent thoughts He wanted companionship rather than love He was hungry for what she gave him the touch of her hands about his neck the sense of his manhood that shone from her faithful eyes the admiration and unstinting love she offered him But alone in the little room he had a reaction not the less keen because it was his fastidious rather than his moral sense that revolted The room was untidy close sordid Even Anna s youth did not redeem it Again he had the sense when he had closed the door of being caught in a trap and this time a dirty trap When she had taken off her hat and held up her face to be kissed he knew he would not stay It s awful isn t it she asked following his eyes It doesn t look like you That s sure I hurried out It s not so bad when it s tidy He threw up the window and stood there a moment The spring air was cool and clean and there was a sound of tramping feet below He looked down The railway station was near by and marching toward it with the long swing of regulars a company of soldiers was moving rapidly The night the absence of drums or music the businesslike rapidity of their progress held him there looking down He turned around Anna had slipped off her coat and had opened the collar of her blouse Her neck gleamed white and young She smiled at him I guess I ll be going he stammered Going I only wanted to see how you are fixed His eyes evaded hers I ll see you again in a day or two I He could not tell her the thoughts that were surging in him The country was at war Those fellows below there were already in it of it And here in this sordid room he had meant to take her not because he loved her but because she offered herself It was cheap It was terrible It was dirty Good night he said and tried to kiss her But she turned her face away She stood listening to his steps on the stairs as he went down steps that mingled and were lost in the steady tramp of the soldiers feet in the street below CHAPTER XXXIV With his many new problems following the declaration of war Clayton Spencer found a certain peace It was good to work hard It was good to fill every working hour and to drop into sleep at night too weary for consecutive thought Yet had he been frank with himself he would have acknowledged that Audrey was never really out of his mind Back of his every decision lay his desire for her approval He did not make them with her consciously in his mind but he wanted her to know and understand In his determination for instance to offer his shells to the government at a nominal profit there was no desire to win her approbation It was rather that he felt her behind him in the decision He shrank from telling Natalie Indeed until he had returned from Washington he did not broach the subject And then he was tired and rather discouraged and as a result almost brutally abrupt Coming on top of a hard fight with the new directorate a fight which he had finally won Washington was disheartening Planning enormously for the future it seemed to have no vision for the things of the present He was met vaguely put off questioned He waited hours as patiently as he could to find that no man seemed to have power to act or to know what powers he had He found something else too a suspicion of him of his motives Who offered something for nothing must be actuated by some deep and hidden motive He found his plain proposition probed and searched for some ulterior purpose behind it It s the old distrust mister Spencer said Hutchinson who had gone with him to furnish figures and various data The Democrats are opposed to capital They re afraid of it And the army thinks all civilians are on the make which is pretty nearly true He saw the Secretary of War finally and came away feeling better He had found there an understanding that a man may even should make sacrifices for his country during war But although he carried away with him the conviction that his offer would ultimately be accepted there was nothing actually accomplished He sent Hutchinson back and waited for a day or two convinced that his very sincerity must bring a concrete result and soon Then lunching alone one day in the Shoreham he saw Audrey Valentine at another table He had not seen her for weeks and he had an odd moment of breathlessness when his eyes fell on her She was pale and thin and her eyes looked very tired His first impulse was to go to her The second on which he acted was to watch her for a little to fill his eyes for the long months of emptiness ahead She was with a man in uniform a young man gay and smiling He was paying her evident court in a debonair fashion bending toward her across the table Suddenly Clayton was jealous fiercely jealous The jealousy of the young is sad enough but it is an ephemeral thing Life calls from many directions There is always the future and the things of the future And behind it there is the buoyancy and easy forgetfulness of youth But the jealousy of later years knows no such relief It sees time flying and happiness evading it It has not the easy self confidence of the twenties It has learned too that happiness is a rare elusive thing to be held and nursed and clung to and that even love must be won and held It has learned that love must be free but its instinct is to hold it with chains He suffered acutely and was ashamed of his suffering After all Audrey was still young Life had not been kind to her and she should be allowed to have such happiness as she could He could offer her nothing He would give her up He had already given her up She knew it Then she saw him and his determination died under the light that came in her eyes Give her up How could he give her up when she was everything he had in the world With a shock he recognized in the thought Natalie s constant repetition as to Graham So he had come to that He felt Audrey s eyes on him but he did not go to her He signed his check and went out He fully meant to go away without seeing her But outside he hesitated That would hurt her and it was cowardly When a few moments later she came out followed by the officer it was to find him there obviously waiting I wondered if you would dare to run away she said This is Captain Sloane Clay and he knows a lot about you Close inspection showed Sloane handsome bronzed and with a soft Southern voice somewhat like Audrey s And it developed that he came from her home and was on his way to one of the early camps He obviously intended to hold on to Audrey and Clayton left them there with the feeling that Audrey s eyes were following him wistful and full of trouble He had not even asked her where she was stopping He took a long walk that afternoon and re made his noon hour resolution He would keep away from her It might hurt her at first but she was young She would forget And he must not stand in her way Having done which he returned to the Shoreham and spent an hour in a telephone booth calling hotels systematically and inquiring for her When he finally located her his voice over the wire startled her Good heavens Clay she said Are you angry about anything Of course not I just wanted to I am leaving to night and I m saying good by That s all Oh She waited Have you had a pleasant afternoon Aren t you going to see me before you go I don t think so Don t you want to know what I am doing in Washington That s fairly clear isn t it You are being rather cruel Clay He hesitated He was amazed at his own attitude Then Will you dine with me to night I kept this evening for you But when he saw her his sense of discomfort only increased Their dining together was natural enough It was not even faintly clandestine But the new restraint he put on himself made him reserved and unhappy He could not act a part And after a time Audrey left off acting too and he found her watching him On the surface he talked but underneath it he saw her unhappiness and her understanding of his I m going back too she said I came down to see what I can do but there is nothing for the untrained woman She s a cumberer of the earth I ll go home and knit I daresay I ought to be able to learn to do that well anyhow Have you forgiven me for this afternoon I wasn t angry I understood That was it in a nutshell Audrey understood She was that sort She never held small resentments He rather thought she never felt them Don t talk about me she said Tell me about you and why you are here It s the war of course So rather reluctantly he told her He shrank from seeming to want her approval but at the same time he wanted it His faith in himself had been shaken He needed it restored And some of the exaltation which had led him to make his proffer to the government came back when he saw how she flushed over it It s very big she said softly It s like you Clay And that s the best thing I can say I am very proud of you I would rather have you proud of me than anything in the world he said unsteadily They drifted somehow to talking of happiness And always carefully veiled it was their own happiness they discussed I don t think she said glancing away from him that one finds it by looking for it That is selfish and the selfish are never happy It comes oh in queer ways When you re trying to give it to somebody else mostly There is happiness of a sort in work Their eyes met That was what they had to face she dedicated to service he to labor It s never found by making other people unhappy Clay No And yet if the other people are already unhappy Never she said And the answer was to the unspoken question in both their hearts It was not until they were in the taxicab that Clayton forced the personal note and then it came as a cry out of the very depths of him She had slipped her hand into his and the comfort of even that small touch broke down the barriers he had so carefully erected I need you so he said And he held her hand to his face She made no movement to withdraw it I need you too she replied I never get over needing you But we are going to play the game Clay We may have our weak hours and this is one of them but always please God we ll play the game The curious humility he felt with her was in his voice I ll need your help even in that And that touch of boyishness almost broke down her reserve of strength She wanted to draw his head down on her shoulder and comfort him She wanted to smooth back his heavy hair and put her arms around him and hold him There was a great tenderness in her for him There were times when she would have given the world to have gone into his arms and let him hold her there protected and shielded But that night she was the stronger and she knew it I love you Audrey I love you terribly And that was the word for it It was terrible She knew it To have gone through all the world he said brokenly and then to find the Woman when it is too late Forever too late He turned toward her You know it don t you That you are my woman I know it she answered steadily But I know too Let me say it just once Then never again I ll bury it but you will know it is there You are my woman I would go through all of life alone to find you at the end And if I could look forward dear to going through the rest of it with you beside me so I could touch you like this I know If I could only protect you and shield you oh how tenderly I could care for you my dear my dear The strength passed to him then Audrey had a clear picture of what life with him might mean of his protection his tenderness She had never known it Suddenly every bit of her called out for his care his quiet strength Don t make me sorry for myself There were tears in her eyes Will you kiss me Clay We might have that to remember But they were not to have even that for the taxicab drew up before her hotel It was one of the absurd anti climaxes of life that they should part with a hand clasp and her formal Thank you for a lovely evening Audrey was the better actor of the two She went in as casually as though she had not put the only happiness of her life away from her But Clayton Spencer stood on the pavement watching her in and all the tragedy of the empty years ahead was in his eyes CHAPTER XXXV Left alone in her untidy room after Graham s abrupt departure Anna Klein was dazed She stood where he left her staring ahead What had happened meant only one thing to her that Graham no longer cared about her and if that was true she did not care to live It never occurred to her that he had done rather a fine thing or that he had protected her against herself She felt no particular shame save the shame of rejection In her small world of the hill if a man gave a girl valuable gifts or money there was generally a quid pro quo If the girl was unwilling she did not accept such gifts If the man wanted nothing he did not make them And men who made love to girls either wanted to marry them or desired some other relationship with them She listened to his retreating footsteps and then began automatically to unbutton her thin white blouse But with the sound of the engine of his car below she ran to the window She leaned out elbows on the sill and watched him go without a look up at her window So that was the end of that Then all at once she was fiercely angry He had got her into this scrape and now he had left her He had pretended to love her and all the time he had meant to do just this to let her offer herself so he might reject her He had been playing with her She had lost her home because of him had been beaten almost insensible had been ill for weeks and now he had driven away without even looking back She jerked her blouse off still standing by the window and when the sleeve caught on her watch she jerked that off too She stood for a moment with it in her hand her face twisted with shame and anger Then recklessly and furiously she flung it through the open window In the stillness of the street far below she heard it strike and rebound That for him she muttered Almost immediately she wanted it again He had given it to her It was all she had left now and in a curious way it had through long wearing come to mean Graham to her She leaned out of the window She thought she saw it gleaming in the gutter and already attracted by the crash a man was crossing the street to where it lay You let that alone she called down desperately The figure was already stooping over it Entirely reckless now she ran bare armed and bare bosomed down the stairs and out into the street She had thought to see its finder escaping but he was still standing where he had picked it up It s mine she began I dropped it out of the window I You threw it out of the window I saw you It was Rudolph You He snarled and stood with menacing eyes fixed on her bare neck Rudolph Get into the house he said roughly You re half naked Give me my watch I ll give it to you all right What s left of it When we get in He followed her into the hail but when she turned there and held out her hand he only snarled again We ll talk up stairs I can t take you up The landlady don t allow it She don t eh You had that Spencer skunk up there His face frightened her and she lied vehemently That s not so and you know it Rudolph Klein He came inside just like this and we stood and talked Then he went away He wasn t inside ten minutes Her voice rose hysterically but Rudolph caught her by the arm and pushing her ahead of him forced her up the stairs We re going to have this out he muttered viciously Half way up she stopped You re hurting my arm You be glad I m not breaking it for you He climbed in a mounting fury He almost threw her into her room and closing the door he turned the key in it His face reminded her of her father s the night he had beaten her and her instinct of self preservation made her put the little table between them You lay a hand on me she panted and I ll yell out the window The police would be glad enough to have something on you Rudolph Klein and you know it They arrest women like you too Don t you dare say that And as he took a step or two toward her she retreated to the window You stay there or I ll jump out of the window She looked desperate enough to do it and Rudolph hesitated He was up here I saw him at the window I ve been trailing you all evening Keep off that window sill you little fool I m not going to kill you But I m going to get him all right and don t you forget it His milder tone and the threat frightened her more than ever He would get Graham he was like that Get him in some cruel helpless way that was the German blood in him She began to play for time with instinctive cunning Listen Rudolph she said I ll tell you all about it He did come up but he left right away We quarreled He threw me over Rudolph That s what he did Her own words reminded her of her humiliation and tears came into her eyes He threw me over Honest he did That s why I threw his watch out of the window That s straight Rudolph That s straight goods I m not lying now God said Rudolph The dirty pup Then then you re through with him eh I m through all right Her tone carried conviction Rudolph s face relaxed and seeing that she remembered her half dressed condition Throw me that waist she said Come around and get it Aw Rudolph throw it Please Getting modest all at once he jeered But he picked it up and advanced to the table with it As she held out her hand for it he caught her and drew her forward toward him across the table You little devil he said and kissed her She submitted because she must but she shivered If she was to save Graham she must play the game And so far she was winning She was feminine enough to know that already the thing he thought she had done was to be forgiven her More than that she saw a half reluctant admiration in Rudolph s eyes as though she had gained value if she had lost virtue by the fact that young Spencer had fancied her And Rudolph s morals were the morals of many of his kind He admired chastity in a girl but he did not expect it But she was watchful for the next move he might make That it was not what she expected did not make it the less terrifying You get your hat and coat on I ll not do anything of the kind D you think I m going to leave you here where he can come back whenever he wants to You think again Where are you going to take me I m going to take you home When pleading made no impression on him and when he refused to move without her she threw her small wardrobe into the suitcase and put her hat and coat on She was past thinking quite hopeless She would go back and her father would kill her which would be the best thing anyhow she didn t care to live Rudolph had relapsed into moody silence Down the stairs and on the street he preceded her contemptuously letting her trail behind He carried her suitcase however and once being insecurely fastened it opened and bits of untidy apparel littered the pavement He dropped the suitcase and stood by while she filled it again The softness of that moment when lured by her bare arms he had kissed her was gone The night car jolted and swayed After a time he dozed and Anna watching him made an attempt at flight He caught her on the rear platform however with a clutch that sickened her The conductor eyed them with the scant curiosity of two o clock in the morning when all the waking world is awry At last they were climbing the hill to the cottage while behind and below them the Spencer furnaces sent out their orange and violet flames and the roar of the blast sounded like the coming of a mighty wind The cottage was dark Rudolph put down the suitcase and called Herman softly through his hands Above they could hear him moving and his angry voice came through the open window What you want Come down It s Rudolph But when he turned Anna was lying in a dead faint on the garden path a crumpled little heap of blissful forgetfulness When Herman came down it was to find Rudolph standing over her the suitcase still in his hand and an ugly scowl on his face Well I got her he said She s scared that s all He prodded her with his foot but she did not move and Herman bent down with his candle He straightened Bring her in he said and led the way into the house When Rudolph staggered in with Anna in his arms he found Herman waiting and fingering the leather strap CHAPTER XXXVI Audrey had found something to do at last It was Captain Sloane who had given her the idea You would make a great hit Audrey he had said It s your voice you know There s something about it well you know the effect it always has on me No All right I ll be good But she had carried the idea home with her and had proceeded with her customary decision to act on it Then one day in May she was surprised by a visit from Delight Haverford She had come home tired and rather depressed to find the Haverford car at the door and Delight waiting for her in her sitting room Audrey s acquaintance with Delight had been rather fragmentary but it had covered a long stretch of time So if she was surprised it was not greatly when Delight suddenly kissed her She saw then that the girl had brought her some spring flowers and the little tribute touched her What a nice child you are she said and standing before the mirror proceeded to take off her hat Before her she could see the reflection of Delight s face and her own tired slightly haggard eyes And how unutterably old you make me look she added smiling You are too lovely for words missus Valentine Audrey patted her hair into order and continued her smiling inspection of the girl s face And now we have exchanged compliments she said we will have some tea and then you shall tell me what you are so excited about I am excited I Let s have the tea first Audrey s housekeeping was still rather casual Tidiness of Natalie s meticulous order would always be beyond her but after certain frantic searches for what was needed she made some delicious tea Order was left out of me somehow she complained Or else things move about when I m away I m sure it is that because I certainly never put the sugar behind my best hat Now let s have it Delight was only playing with her tea She flushed delicately and put the cup down I was in the crowd this morning she said In the crowd Oh my crowd Yes I see said Audrey thoughtfully I make a dreadful speech you know I thought you were wonderful And when those men promised to enlist I cried I was horribly ashamed But you were splendid I wonder said Audrey growing grave Delight was astonished to see that there were tears in her eyes I do it because it is all I can do and of course they must go But some times at night you see my dear some of them are going to be killed I am urging them to go but the better the day I have had the less I sleep at night There was a little pause Delight was thinking desperately of something to say But you didn t come to talk about me did you Partly And partly about myself I want to do something missus Valentine I can drive a car but not very well I don t know a thing about the engine And I can nurse a little I like nursing Audrey studied her face It seemed to her sad beyond words that this young girl who should have had only happiness was facing the horrors of what would probably be a long war It was the young who paid the price of war in death in empty years Already the careless gayety of their lives was gone For the dream futures they had planned they had now to substitute long waiting for happiness service The Red Cross is going to send canteen workers to France You might do that If I only could But I can t leave mother Not entirely Father is going He wants to go and fight but I m afraid they won t take him He ll go as a chaplain anyhow But he s perfectly helpless you know Mother says she is going to tie his overshoes around his neck I ll see if I can think of something for you Delight There s one thing in my mind There are to be little houses built in all the new training camps for officers and they are to be managed by women They are to serve food sandwiches and coffee I think They may be even more pretentious I don t know but I ll find out I ll do anything said Delight and got up It was then that Audrey realized that there was something more to the visit than had appeared for Delight ready to go hesitated There is something else missus Valentine she said rather slowly What would you do if a young man wanted to go into the service and somebody held him back His own people His mother And a girl I would think the army is well off without him Delight flushed painfully Perhaps she admitted But is it right just to let it go at that If you like people it seems wrong just to stand by and let others ruin their lives for them Only very weak men let women ruin their lives But already she began to understand the situation There s a weakness that is only a sort of habit It may come from not wanting to hurt somebody Delight was pulling nervously at her gloves And there is this to be said too If there is what you call weakness wouldn t the army be good for it It makes men some times doesn t it For a sickening moment Audrey thought of Chris War had made Chris but it had killed him too Have you thought of one thing she asked That in trying to make this young man whoever it is he may be hurt or even worse He would have to take his chance like the rest She went a little pale however Audrey impulsively put an arm around her And this woman is the little long legged girl who used to give signals to her father when the sermon was too long Now what can I do about this youth who can t make up his own mind You can talk to his mother If I know his mother and I think I do it won t do the slightest good Then his father You are great friends aren t you Even this indirect mention of Clayton made Audrey s hands tremble She put them behind her We are very good friends she said But Delight was too engrossed to notice the deeper note in her voice I ll see what I can do But don t count on me too much You spoke of a girl I suppose I know who it is Probably It is Marion Hayden He is engaged to her And again Audrey marveled at her poise for Delight s little tragedy was clear by that time Clear and very sad I can t imagine his really being in love with her But he must be They are engaged Audrey smiled at the simple philosophy of nineteen smiled and was extremely touched How brave the child was Audrey s own courageous heart rather swelled in admiration But after Delight had gone she felt depressed again and very tired How badly these things were handled How strange it was that love so often brought suffering Great loves were almost always great tragedies Perhaps it was because love was never truly great until the element of sacrifice entered into it Her own high courage failed her somewhat During these recent days when struggling against very real stage fright she made her husky wholly earnest but rather nervous little appeals to the crowds before the enlisting stations she got along bravely enough during the day But the night found her sad unutterably depressed At these times she was haunted by a fear that persisted against all her arguments In Washington Clayton had not looked well He had been very tired and white and some of his natural buoyancy seemed to have deserted him He needed caring for she would reflect bitterly There should be some one to look after him He was tired and anxious but it took the eyes of love to see it Natalie would never notice and would consider it a grievance if she did The fiercely maternal tenderness of the childless woman for the man she loves kept her awake at night staring into the darkness and visualizing terrible things Clayton ill and she unable to go to him Ill and wanting her and unable to ask for her She was she knew not quite normal but the fear gripped and held her These big strong men no one ever looked after them They spent their lives caring for others and were never cared for There were times when a sort of exaltation of sacrifice kept her head high when the thing she was forced to give up seemed trifling compared with the men and boys who some determinedly some sheepishly left the crowd around the borrowed car from which she spoke and went into the recruiting station There was sacrifice and sacrifice and there was some comfort in the thought that both she and Clayton were putting the happiness of others above their own They had both somehow somewhere missed the path But they must never go back and try to find it Delight s visit left her thoughtful There must be some way to save Graham She wondered how much of Clayton s weariness was due to Graham And she wondered too if he knew of the talk about Natalie and Rodney Page There was a great deal of talk Somehow such talk cheapened his sacrifice and hers Not that she believed it or much of it She knew how little such gossip actually meant Practically every woman she knew herself included had at one time or another laid herself open to such invidious comment They had all been idle and they sought amusement in such spurious affairs as this harmless in the main but taking on the appearance of evil That was part of the game to appear worse than one really was The older the woman the more eager she was often in her clutch at the vanishing romance of youth Only it was part of the game too to avoid scandal A fierce pride for Clayton s name sent the color to her face On the evening after Delight s visit she had promised to speak at a recruiting station far down town in a crowded tenement district and tired as she was she took a bus and went down at seven o clock She was uneasy and nervous She had not spoken in the evening before and in all her sheltered life she had never seen the milling of a night crowd in a slum district There was a wagon drawn up at the curb and an earnest eyed young clergyman was speaking The crowd was attentive mildly curious The clergyman was emphatic without being convincing Audrey watched the faces about her standing in the crowd herself and a sense of the futility of it all gripped her All these men and only a feeble cheer as a boy still in his teens agreed to volunteer All this effort for such scant result and over on the other side such dire need But one thing cheered her Beside her in the crowd a portly elderly Jew was standing with his hat in his hand and when a man near him made some jeering comment the Jew brought his hand down on his shoulder Be still and listen he said Or else go away and allow others to listen This is our country which calls It s amusing isn t it Audrey heard a woman s voice near her carefully inflected slightly affected It s rather stunning in a way It s decorative the white faces and that chap in the wagon and the gasoline torch I d enjoy it more if I d had my dinner The man laughed You are a most brazen combination of the mundane and the spiritual Natalie You are all soul after you are fed Come on It s near here Audrey s hands were very cold By the movement of the crowd behind her she knew that Natalie and Rodney were making their escape toward food and a quiet talk in some obscure restaurant in the neighborhood Fierce anger shook her For this she and Clayton were giving up the only hope they had of happiness that Natalie might carry on a cheap and stealthy flirtation She made a magnificent appeal that night and a very successful one The lethargic crowd waked up and pressed forward There were occasional cheers and now and then the greater tribute of convinced silence And on a box in the wagon the young clergyman eyed her almost wistfully What a woman she was With such a woman a man could live up to the best in him Then he remembered his salary in a mission church of twelve hundred a year and sighed He gained courage later on and asked Audrey if she would have some coffee with him or something to eat She looked tired Tired said Audrey I am only tired these days when I am not working You must not use yourself up You are too valuable to the country She was very grateful After all what else really mattered In a little glow she accepted his invitation Only coffee she said I have had dinner Is there any place near He piloted her through the crowd now rapidly dispersing Here and there some man often in halting English thanked her for what she had said A woman slightly the worse for drink but with friendly rather humorous eyes put a hand on her arm You re all right m dear she said You re the stuff Give it to them I wish to God I could talk I d tell em something The clergyman drew her on hastily In a small Italian restaurant almost deserted they found a table and the clergyman ordered eggs and coffee He was a trifle uneasy In the wagon Audrey s plain dark clothes had deceived him But the single pearl on her finger was very valuable He fell to apologizing for the place I often come here he explained The food is good if you like Italian cooking And it is near my work I But Audrey was not listening At a corner far back Natalie and Rodney were sitting engrossed in each other Natalie s back was carefully turned to the room but there was no mistaking her Audrey wanted madly to get away but the coffee had come and the young clergyman was talking gentle platitudes in a rather sweet but monotonous voice Then Rodney saw her and bowed Almost immediately afterward she heard the soft rustle that was Natalie and found them both beside her Can we run you up town Natalie asked That is unless She glanced at the clergyman Thank you no Natalie I m going to have some supper first Natalie was uneasy Audrey made no move to present the clergyman whose name she did not know Rodney was looking slightly bored Odd little place isn t it Natalie offered after a second s silence Rather quaint I think Natalie made a desperate effort to smooth over an awkward situation She turned to the clergyman We heard you speaking It was quite thrilling He smiled a little Not so thrilling as this lady She carried the crowd absolutely Natalie turned and stared at Audrey who was flushed with annoyance You she said Do you mean to say you have been talking from that wagon I haven t said it But I have For heaven s sake Then she laughed and glanced at Rodney Well if you won t tell on me I ll not tell on you And then seeing Audrey straighten I don t mean that of course Clay s at a meeting to night so I am having a holiday She moved on always with the soft rustle leaving behind her a delicate whiff of violets and a wide eyed clergyman who stared after her admiringly What a beautiful woman he said There was a faint regret in his voice that Audrey had not presented him and he did not see that her coffee cup trembled as she lifted it to her lips At ten o clock the next morning Natalie called her on the phone Natalie s morning voice was always languid but there was a trace of pleading in it now It s a lovely day she said What are you doing I ve been darning You Darning I rather like it Heavens how you ve changed I suppose you wouldn t do anything so frivolous as to go out with me to the new house Audrey hesitated Evidently Natalie wanted to talk to try to justify herself But the feeling that she was the last woman in the world to be Natalie s father confessor was strong in her On the other hand there was the question of Graham On that before long she and Natalie would have in one of her own occasional lapses into slang to go to the mat I ll come of course if that s an invitation I ll be around in an hour then Natalie was unusually prompt She was nervous and excited and was even more carefully dressed than usual Over her dark blue velvet dress she wore a loose motor coat with a great chinchilla collar but above it Audrey who would have given a great deal to be able to hate her found her rather pathetic a little droop to her mouth dark circles which no veil could hide under her eyes The car was in its customary resplendent condition There were orchids in the flower holder and the footman light rug over his arm stood rigidly waiting at the door What a tone you and your outfit do give my little street Audrey said as they started We have more milk wagons than limousines you know I don t see how you can bear it Audrey smiled It s really rather nice she said For one thing I haven t any bills I never lived on a cash basis before It s a sort of emancipation Oh bills said Natalie and waved her hands despairingly If you could see my desk And the way I watch the mail so Clay won t see them first They really ought to send bills in blank envelopes But you have to give them to him eventually don t you I can choose my moment And it is never in the morning He s rather awful in the morning Awful Oh not ugly Just quiet I hate a man who doesn t talk in the mornings But then for months he hasn t really talked at all That s why she was rather breathless that s why I went out with Rodney last night I don t think Clayton would mind if you told him first It s your own affair of course but it doesn t seem quite fair to him Oh of course you d side with him Women always side with the husband I don t side with any one Audrey protested But I am sure if he realized that you are lonely Suddenly she realized that Natalie was crying Not much but enough to force her to dab her eyes carefully through her veil I m awfully unhappy Audrey she said Everything s wrong and I don t know why What have I done I try and try and things just get worse Audrey was very uncomfortable She had a guilty feeling that the whole situation with Natalie pouring out her woes beside her was indelicate unbearable But if Clay she began Clay He s absolutely ungrateful He takes me for granted and the house for granted Everything And if he knows I want a thing he disapproves at once I think sometimes he takes a vicious pleasure in thwarting me But as she did not go on Audrey said nothing Natalie had raised her veil and from a gold vanity case was repairing the damages around her eyes Why don t you find something to do something to interest you Audrey suggested finally But Natalie poured out a list of duties that lasted for the last three miles of the trip ending with the new house Even that has ceased to be a satisfaction she finished Clayton wants to stop work on it and cut down all the estimates It s too awful First he told me to get anything I liked and now he says to cut down to nothing I could just shriek about it Perhaps that s because we are in the war now War or no war we have to live don t we And he thinks I ought to do without the extra man for the car and the second man in the house and heaven alone knows what I m at the end of my patience Audrey made a resolution After all what mattered was that things should be more tolerable for Clayton She turned to Natalie Why don t you try to do what he wants Natalie He must have a reason for asking you And it would please him a lot If I start making concession I can just keep it up He s like that He s so awfully fine Natalie He s well he s rather big And sometimes I think if you just tried he wouldn t be so hard to please He probably wants peace and happiness Happiness Natalie s voice was high That sounds like Clay Happiness Don t you suppose I want to be happy Not enough to work for it said Audrey evenly Natalie turned and stared at her I believe you re half in love with Clay yourself Perhaps I am But she smiled frankly into Natalie s eyes I know if I were married to him I d try to do what he wanted You d try it for a year Then you d give it up It s one thing to admire a man It s quite different being married to him and having to put up with all sorts of things Her voice trailed off before the dark vision of her domestic unhappiness And again as with Graham and his father it was what she did not say that counted Audrey came close to hating her just then So far the conversation had not touched on Graham and now they were turning in the new drive Already the lawns Were showing green and extensive plantings of shrubbery were putting out their pale new buds Audrey bending forward in the car found it very lovely and because it belonged to Clay was to be his home it thrilled her just as the towering furnaces of his mill thrilled her the lines of men leaving at nightfall It was his therefore it was significant The house amazed her Even Natalie s enthusiasm had not promised anything so stately or so vast Moving behind her through great empty rooms to the sound of incessant hammering over which Natalie s voice was raised shrilly she was forced to confess that between them Natalie and Rodney had made a lovely thing She felt no jealousy when she contrasted it with her own small apartment She even felt that it was the sort of house Clayton should have For although it had been designed as a setting for Natalie although every color scheme almost every chair had been bought with a view to forming a background for her it was too big too massive It dwarfed her Out of doors Audrey lost that feeling In the formal garden Natalie was charmingly framed It was like her beautifully exact carefully planned already with its spring borders faintly glowing Natalie cheered in her approval You re so comforting she said Clay thinks it isn t homelike He says it s a show place which it ought to be It cost enough and he hates show places He really ought to have a cottage Now let s see the swimming pool But at the pool she lost her gayety The cement basin still empty gleamed white in the sun and Natalie suddenly brooding stood beside it staring absently into it It was for Graham she said at last We were going to have week end parties and all sorts of young people But now What about now Natalie raised tragic eyes to hers He s probably going into the army He d have never thought of it but Clayton shows in every possible way that he thinks he ought to go What is the boy to do His father driving him to what may be his death I don t think he d do that Natalie Natalie laughed her little mirthless laugh Much you know what his father would do I ll tell you this Audrey If Graham goes and anything happens to him I ll never forgive Clay Never Audrey had not suspected such depths of feeling as Natalie s eyes showed under their penciled brows They were desperate vindictive eyes Suddenly Natalie was pleading with her You ll talk to Clay won t you He ll listen to you He has a lot of respect for your opinion I want you to go to him Audrey I brought you here to ask you I m almost out of my mind Why do you suppose I play around with Rodney I ve got to forget that s all And I ve tried everything I know and failed He ll go and I ll lose him and if I do it will kill me It doesn t follow that because he goes he won t come back He ll be in danger I shall be worrying about him every moment She threw out her hands in what was as unrestrained a gesture as she ever made Look at me she cried I m getting old under it I have lines about my eyes already I hate to look at myself in the morning And I m not old I ought to be at my best now Natalie s anxiety was for Graham but her pity was for herself Audrey s heart hardened I m sorry she said I can t go to Clay I feel as I think he does If Graham wants to go he should be free to do it You re only hurting him and your influence on him by holding him back You ve never had a child If I had and he wanted to go I should be terrified but I should be proud You and Clay You even talk alike It s all a pose this exalted attitude Even this war is a pose It s a national attitude we ve struck a great nation going to rescue humanity while the rest of the world looks on and applauds It makes me ill She turned and went back to the house leaving Audrey by the swimming pool She sat on the edge of one of the stone benches feeling utterly dreary and sad To make a sacrifice for a worthy object was one thing To throw away a life s happiness for a spoiled petulant woman was another It was too high a price to pay Mingled with her depression was pity for Clayton for all the years that he had lived with this woman and pride in him that he had never betrayed his disillusion After a time she saw the car waiting and she went slowly back to the house Natalie was already inside and she made no apologies whatever The drive back was difficult Natalie openly sulked replied in monosyllables made no effort herself until they were in the city again Then she said I m sorry I asked you to speak to Clay Of course you needn t do it Not if it is to do what you said But I wish you wouldn t misunderstand me Natalie I m awfully sorry We just think differently We certainly do said Natalie briefly And that was her good by CHAPTER XXXVII When Clayton had returned from Washington one of the first problems put up to him had been Herman Klein s application to be taken on again He found Hutchinson in favor of it He doesn t say much he said Never did But I gather things are changed now we are in the war ourselves I suppose we need him You bet we need him For the problem of skilled labor was already a grave one Clayton was doubtful If he could have conferred with Dunbar he would have felt more comfortable but Dunbar was away on some mysterious errand connected with the Military Intelligence Department He sat considering tapping on his desk with the handle of his pen Of course things were different now A good many Germans whose sympathies had as between the Fatherland and the Allies been with Germany were now driven to a decision between the land they had left and the land they had adopted And behind Herman there were thirty years of good record Where is the daughter I don t know She left some weeks ago It s talk around the plant that he beat her up and she got out Those Germans don t know the first thing about how to treat women Then she is not in Weaver s office There was more talk in the offices than Hutchinson repeated Graham s fondness for Anna her slavish devotion to him had been pretty well recognized He wondered if Clayton knew anything about it or the further gossip that Graham knew where Anna Klein had been hiding What about Rudolph Klein He was a nephew wasn t he Fired said Hutchinson laconically Got to spreading the brotherhood of the world idea sweat brothers he calls them But he was mighty careful never to get in a perspiration himself We might try Herman again But I d keep an eye on him So Herman was taken on at the new munition plant He was a citizen he owned property he had a record of long service behind him And at first he was minded to preserve that record intact While he had by now added to his rage against the Fatherland s enemies a vast and sullen fury against invested capital his German caution still remained He would sit through fiery denunciations of wealth nodding his head slowly in agreement He was perfectly aware that in Gus s little back room dark plots were hatched Indeed on a certain April night Rudolph had come up and called him onto the porch In about fifteen minutes he said consulting his watch in the doorway I m going to show you something pretty And in fifteen minutes to the dot the great railroad warehouses near the city wharf had burst into flames Herman had watched without comment while Rudolph talked incessantly boasting of his share in the enterprise About a million dollars worth of fireworks there he said as the glare dyed their faces red All stuff for the Allies And he boasted When the cat sits on the pickhandle brass buttons must go By that time Herman knew that the cat meant sabotage He had nodded slowly But it is dangerous was his later comment Sometimes they will learn and then His caution had exasperated Rudolph almost to frenzy And as time went on and one man after another of the organization was ferreted out at the new plant and dismissed the sole remaining hope of the organization was Herman With his reinstatement their hopes had risen again but to every suggestion so far he had been deaf He would listen approvingly but at the end when he found the talk veering his way and a circle of intent faces watching him he would say It is too dangerous And it is a young man s work I am not young Then he would pay his score but never by any chance Rudolph s or the others and go home to his empty house But recently the plant had gone on double turn and Herman was soon to go on at night Here was the gang s opportunity Everything was ready but Herman himself He continued interested but impersonal For the sake of the Fatherland he was willing to have the plant go and to lose his work He was not at all daunted by the thought of the deaths that would follow That was war Anything that killed and destroyed was fair in war But he did not care to place himself in danger Let those young hot heads do the work Rudolph watching him bided his time The ground was plowed and harrowed ready for the seed and Rudolph had only to find the seed The night he had carried Anna into the cottage on the hill he had found it Herman had not beaten Anna Rudolph had carried her up to her bed and Herman following slowly strap in hand had been confronted by the younger man in the doorway of the room where Anna lay conscious but unmoving on the bed You can use that thing later Rudolph said She s sick now Better let her alone I will teach her to run away Herman muttered thickly She left me her father and threw away a good job I You come down stairs I ve something to say to you And after a time Herman had followed him down but he still clung doggedly to the strap Rudolph led the way outside and here in the darkness he told Anna s story twisted and distorted through his own warped mind but convincing and partially true Herman s silence began to alarm him however and when at last he rose and made for the door Rudolph was before him What are you going to do Herman said nothing but he raised the strap and held it menacingly Get out of my way Don t be a fool Rudolph entreated You can beat her to death and what do you get out of it She ll run away again if you touch her Put that strap down I m not afraid of you Their voices raised and angry penetrated through Anna s haze of fright and faintness She sat up in the bed ready to spring to the window if she heard steps on the stairs When none came but the voices lowered now went on endlessly below she slipped out of her bed and crept to the doorway Sounds traveled clearly up the narrow enclosed stairway She stood there swaying slightly until at last her legs would no longer support her She crouched on the floor a hand clutching her throat lest she scream And listened She did not sleep at all The night had been too full of horrors And she was too ill to attempt a second flight Besides where could she go Katie was not there She could see her empty little room across with its cot bed and tawdry dresser Before too she had had Grahams protection to count on Now she had nothing And the voices went on When she went back to bed it was almost dawn She heard Herman come up heard the heavy thump of his shoes on the floor and the creak immediately following that showed he had lain down without undressing By the absence of his resonant snoring she knew he was not sleeping either She pictured him lying there his eyes on the door in almost unwinking espionage At half past six she got up and went down stairs Almost immediately she heard his stockinged feet behind her She turned and looked up at him What are you going to do Going to make myself some coffee He came down and sat down in the sitting room From where he sat he could survey the kitchen and she knew his eyes were on her His very quiet terrified her but although the strap lay on the table he made no move toward it She built a fire and put on the kettle and after a time she brought him some coffee and some bread He took it without a word Sick as she was she fell to cleaning up the dirty kitchen She went outside for a pail to find him behind her in the doorway Then she knew what he intended to do He was afraid for some reason to beat her again but he was going to watch her lest again she make her escape The silence under his heavy gaze was intolerable All day she worked and only once did Herman lose sight of her That was when he took a ladder and outside the house nailed all the upper windows shut He did it with German thoroughness hammering deliberately placing his nails carefully After that he went to the corner grocery but before he went he spoke the first words of the day You will go to your room She went and he locked her in She knew then that she was a prisoner When he was at the mill at night while he slept during the day she was to be locked up in her stuffy airless room When he was about she would do the housework always under his silent contemptuous gaze She made one appeal to him and only one and that was to his cupidity I ve been sick but I m able to work now father He paid no attention to her If you lock me up and don t let me work she persisted you ll only be cutting off your nose to spite your face I make good money and you know it She thought he was going to speak then but he did not She put his food on the table and he ate gluttonously as he always did She did not sit down She drank a little coffee standing at the stove and watched the back of his head with hate in her eyes He could eat like that when he stood committed to a terrible thing It was not until late in the day that it began to dawn on her how she was responsible She was getting stronger then and more able to think She followed as best she could the events of the last months and she saw that as surely as though a malevolent power had arranged it the thing was the result of her infatuation for Graham She was in despair and she began to plan how to get word to Graham of what was impending She scrawled a note to Graham telling him where she was and to try to get in touch with her somehow If he would come around four o clock Herman was generally up and off to the grocer s or to Gus s saloon for his afternoon beer I ll break a window and talk to you she wrote I m locked in when he s out My window is on the north side Don t lose any time There s something terrible going to happen But several days went by and the postman did not appear Herman had put a padlock on the outside of her bedroom door and her hope of finding a second key to fit the door lock died then It had become a silent bitter contest between the two of them with two advantages in favor of the girl She was more intelligent than Herman and she knew the thing he was planning to do She made a careful survey of her room and she saw that with a screw driver she could unfasten the hinge of her bedroom door Herman however always kept his tools locked up She managed apparently by accident to break the point off a knife and when she went up to her room one afternoon to be locked in while Herman went to Gus s saloon she carried the knife in her stocking It was a sorry tool however Driven by her shaking hand there was a time when she almost despaired And time was flying The postman when he came came at five and she heard the kitchen clock strike five before the first screw fell out into her hand She got them all out finally and the door hung crazily held only by the padlock She ran to the window The postman was coming along the street and she hammered madly at the glass When he saw her he turned in at the gate and she got her letter and ran down the stairs She heard his step on the porch outside and called to him Is that you Briggs The postman was Briggs to the hill Yes If I slide a letter out under the door will you take it to the post office for me It s important All right Slide She had put it partially under the door when a doubt crept into her mind That was not Briggs s voice She made a frantic effort to draw the letter back but stronger fingers than hers had it beyond the door She clutched held tight Then she heard a chuckle and found herself with a corner of the envelope in her hand There were voices outside Briggs s and Rudolph s Guess that s for me Like hell it is She ran madly up the stairs again and tried with shaking fingers to screw the door hinges into place again She fully expected that they would kill her She heard Briggs go out and after a time she heard Rudolph trying to kick in the house door Then when the last screw was back in place she heard Herman s heavy step outside and Rudolph s voice high furious and insistent Had Herman not been obsessed with the thing he was to do he might have beaten her to death that night But he did not She remained in her room without food or water She had made up her mind to kill herself with the knife if they came up after her but the only sounds she heard were of high voices growing lower and more sinister After that for days she was a prisoner Herman moved his bed down stairs and slept in the sitting room the five or six hours of day light sleep which were all he required And at night while he was at the mill Rudolph sat and dozed and kept watch below Twice a day some meager provisions were left at the top of the stairs and her door was unlocked She would creep out and get them not because she was hungry but because she meant to keep up her strength Let their vigilance slip but once and she meant to be ready She learned to interpret every sound below There were times when the fumes from burning food came up the staircase and almost smothered her And there were times she fancied when Herman weakened and Rudolph talked for hours inciting and inflaming him again She gathered too that Gus s place was under surveillance and more than once in the middle of the night stealthy figures came in by the garden gate and conferred with Rudolph down stairs Then one evening in the dusk of the May twilight she saw three of them come one rather tall and military of figure and one of them carried very carefully a cheap suitcase She knew what was in that suitcase CHAPTER XXXVIII One morning in his mail Clayton Spencer received a clipping It had been cut from a so called society journal and it was clamped to the prospectus of a firm of private detectives who gave information for divorce cases as their specialty First curiously then with mounting anger Clayton read that the wife of a prominent munition manufacturer was being seen constantly in out of the way places with the young architect who was building a palace for her out of the profiteer s new wealth It is quite probable ended the notice that the episode will end in an explosion louder than the best shell the husband in the case ever turned out Clayton did not believe the thing for a moment He was infuriated but mostly with the journal and with the insulting inference of the prospectus He had a momentary clear vision however of Natalie of her idle days of perhaps a futile last clutch at youth He had no more doubt of her essential integrity than of his own But he had a very distinct feeling that she had exposed his name to cheap scandal and that for nothing Had there been anything real behind it he might have understood in his new humility in his new knowledge of impulses stronger than any restraints of society he would quite certainly have made every allowance But for a whim an indulgence of her incorrigible vanity To get along to save Natalie herself he was stifling the best that was in him while Natalie That was one view of it The other was that Natalie was as starved as he was If he got nothing from her he gave her nothing How was he to blame her She was straying along dangerous paths but he himself had stood at the edge of the precipice and looked down Suddenly it occurred to him that perhaps for once Natalie was in earnest Perhaps Rodney was too Perhaps each of them had at last found something that loomed larger than themselves In that case But everything he knew of Natalie contradicted that She was not a woman to count anything well lost for love She was playing with his honor with Rodney with her own vanity Going up town that night he pondered the question of how to take up the matter with her It would be absurd under the circumstances to take any virtuous attitude He was still undetermined when he reached the house He found Marion Hayden there for dinner and Graham and a spirited three corner discussion going on which ceased when he stood in the doorway Natalie looked irritated Graham determined and Marion was slightly insolent and unusually handsome Hurry and change Clay Natalie said Dinner is waiting As he went away he had again the feeling of being shut out of something which concerned Graham Dinner was difficult Natalie was obviously sulking and Graham was rather taciturn It was Marion who kept the conversation going and he surmised in her a repressed excitement a certain triumph At last Natalie roused herself The meal was almost over and the servants had withdrawn I wish you would talk sense to Graham Clay she said fretfully I think he has gone mad I don t call it going mad to want to enlist father I do With your father needing you and with all the men there are who can go I don t understand If he wants to enter the army that s up to him isn t it There was a brief silence Clayton found Natalie s eyes on him uneasy resentful That s just it I ve promised mother not to unless she gives her consent And she won t give it I certainly will not Clayton saw her appealing glance at Marion but that young lady was lighting a cigaret her eyelids lowered He felt as though he were watching a play in which he was the audience It s rather a family affair isn t it he asked Suppose we wait until we are alone After all there is no hurry Marion looked at him and he caught a resentment in her glance The two glances struck fire Say something Marion Natalie implored her I don t think my opinion is of any particular importance As mister Spencer says it s really a family matter Her insolence was gone Marion was easy She knew Natalie s game it was like her own But this big square jawed man at the head of the table frightened her And he hated her He hardly troubled to hide it for all his civility Even that civility was contemptuous In the drawing room things were little better Natalie had counted on Marion s cooperation and she had failed her She pleaded a headache and went up stairs leaving Clayton to play the host as best he could Marion wandered into the music room with its bare polished floor its lovely painted piano and played a little gay charming little things clever and artful Except when visitors came the piano was never touched but now and then Clayton had visualized Audrey there singing in her husky sweet voice her little French songs Graham moved restlessly about the room and Clayton felt that he had altered lately He looked older and not happy He knew the boy wanted to talk about Natalie s opposition but was hoping that he would broach the subject And Clayton rather grimly refused to do it Those next weeks would show how much of the man there was in Graham but the struggle must be between his mother and himself He paused finally Marion was singing Give me your love for a day A night an hour If the wages of sin are Death I m willing to pay She sang it in her clear passionless voice Brave words Clayton thought but there were few who would pay such wages This girl at the piano what did she know of the thing she sang about What did any of the young know They always construed love in terms of passion But passion was ephemeral Love lived on Passion took but love gave He roused himself Have you told Marion about the new arrangement I didn t know whether you cared to have it told Don t you think she ought to know If she intends to enter the family she has a right to know that she is not marrying into great wealth I don t suggest he added as Graham colored hotly that it will make any difference I merely feel she ought to know your circumstances He was called to the telephone and when he came back he found them in earnest conversation The girl turned toward him smiling Graham has just told me You are splendid mister Spencer And afterward Clayton was forced to admit an element of sincerity in her voice She had had a disappointment but she was very game Her admiration surprised him He was nearer to liking her than he had ever been Even her succeeding words did not quite kill his admiration for her And I have told Graham that he must not let you make all the sacrifices Of course he is going to enlist She had turned her defeat into a triumph against Natalie Clayton knew then that she would never marry Graham As she went out he followed her with a faint smile of tribute The smile died as he turned to go up the stairs Natalie was in her dressing room She had not undressed but was standing by a window She made no sign that she heard him enter and he hesitated Why try to talk things out with her Why hurt her Why not let things drift along There was no hope of bettering them One of two things he must do either tear open the situation between them or ignore it Can I get anything for your head my dear I haven t any headache Then I think I ll go to bed I didn t sleep much last night He was going out when she spoke again I came up stairs because I saw how things were going Do you really want to go into that to night Why not to night We ll have to go into it soon enough Yet when she turned to him he saw the real distress in her face and his anger died I didn t want to hurt you Natalie I honestly tried But you know how I feel about that girl Even the servants know it It is quite evident We parted quite amiably I dare say You were relieved that she was going If you would only be ordinarily civil to her oh don t you see She could keep Graham from going into this idiotic war You can t I can t I ve tried everything I know And she knows she can She s hateful about it And you would marry him to that sort of a girl I d keep him from being blinded or mutilated or being killed You can kill his soul His soul She burst into hysterical laughter You to talk about souls That s that s funny Natalie dear He was very grave very gentle Has it occurred to you that we are hitting it off rather badly lately She looked at him quickly How Because I don t think as you do We got on well enough before this war came along Do you think it is only that If it s the house just remember you gave me carte blanche there He made a little gesture of despair I just thought perhaps you are not as happy as you might be Happiness again Did you come up stairs to night with this thing hanging over us to talk about happiness That s funny too But her eyes were suddenly suspicious There was something strange in his voice Let s forget that for a moment Graham will make his own decision But before we leave that let me tell you that I love him as much as you do His going means exactly as much It s only Another point we differ on she finished for him Go on You are suddenly concerned about my happiness I m touched Clay You have left me all winter to go out alone or with anybody who might be sorry enough for me to pick me up and now Suddenly her eyes sharpened and she drew her breath quickly You ve seen that scandalous thing in the paper It was sent to me Who sent it A firm of private detectives She was frightened and the terror in her face brought him to her quickly Natalie Don t look like that I don t believe it of course It s stupid I wasn t going to tell you You don t think I believe it do you She let him put an arm around her and hold her as he would a scared child There was no love for her in it but a great pity and acute remorse that he could hold her so and care for her so little Oh Clay she gasped I ve been perfectly sick about it His conviction of his own failure to her made him very tender He talked to her as she stood with her face buried in the shoulder of his coat of the absurdity of her fear of his own understanding and when she was calmer he made a futile effort to make his position clear I am not angry he said And I m not fudging you in any way But you know how things are between us We have been drifting apart for rather a long time It s not your fault Perhaps it is mine Probably it is I know I don t make you happy And sometimes I think things have either got to be better or worse If I m willing to go along as we are I think you should be Then let s try to get a little happiness out of it all Natalie Oh happiness You are always raving about happiness There isn t any such thing Peace then Let s have peace Natalie She drew back regarding him What did you mean by things having to be better or worse When he found no immediate answer she was uneasy The prospect of any change in their relationship frightened her Like all weak women she was afraid of change Her life suited her Even her misery she loved and fed on She had pitied herself always Not love but fear of change lay behind her shallow anxious eyes Yet he could not hurt her She had been foolish but she had not been wicked In his new humility he found her infinitely better than himself I spoke without thinking Then it must have been in your mind Let me see the clipping Clay I ve tried to forget what it said She took it still pinned to the prospectus and bent over them both When she had examined them she continued to stand with lowered eyelids turning and crumpling them Then she looked up So that is what you meant It was a well a sort of a threat I had no intention of threatening you my dear You ought to know me better That clipping was sent me attached to the slip The only reason I let you see it was because I think you ought to know how the most innocent things are misconstrued You couldn t divorce me if you wanted to Then her defiance faded in a weak terror She began to cry shameless frightened tears that rolled down her cheeks She reminded him that she was the mother of his child that she had sacrificed her life to both of them and that now they would both leave her and turn her adrift She had served her purpose now let her go Utter hopelessness kept him dumb He knew of old that she would cry until she was ready to stop or until she had gained her point And he knew too that she expected him to put his arms around her again in token of his complete surrender The very fact hardened him He did not want to put his arms around her He wanted indeed to get out into the open air and walk off his exasperation The scent in the room stifled him When he made no move toward her she gradually stopped crying and gave way to the rage that was often behind her tears Just try to divorce me and see Good God I haven t even mentioned divorce I only said we must try to get along better To agree Which means I dare say that I am to agree with you But she had one weapon still Suddenly she smiled a little wistfully and made the apparently complete surrender that always disarmed him I ll be good from now on Clay I ll be very very good Only don t be always criticizing me She held up her lips and after a second s hesitation he kissed her He knew he was precisely where he had been when he started and he had a hopeless sense of the futility of the effort he had made Natalie had got by with a bad half hour and would proceed to forget it as quickly as she always forgot anything disagreeable Still she was in a more receptive mood than usual and he wondered if that would not be as good a time as any to speak about his new plan as to the mill He took an uneasy turn or two about the room feeling her eyes on him There is something else Natalie She had relaxed like a kitten in her big chair and was lighting one of the small gilt tipped cigarets she affected About Graham It affects Graham It affects us all Yes He hesitated To talk to Natalie about business meant reducing it to its most elemental form Have you ever thought that this war of ours means more than merely raising armies I haven t thought about this war at all It s too absurd A lot of politicians She shrugged her shoulders It means a great deal of money Well the country is rich isn t it The country That means the people I knew we d get to money sooner or later she observed resignedly All right We ll be taxed so we ll cut down on the country house go on I can say it before you do But don t say we ll have to do without the greenhouses because we can t We may have to go without more than greenhouses His tone made her sit bolt upright Then she laughed a little Poor old Clay she said with the caressing tone she used when she meant to make no concession I do spend money don t I But I do make you comfortable you know And what is what I spend compared with what you are making It s just that I don t think I can consistently go on making a profit on this war now that we are in it He explained then what he meant and watched her face set into the hard lines he knew so well But she listened to the end and when he had finished she said nothing Well he said I don t think you have the remotest idea of doing it You like to play at the heroic You can see yourself doing it and every one pointing to you as the man who threw away a fortune But you are humbugging yourself You ll never do it I give you credit for too much sense He went rather white She knew the weakness in his armor his hatred of anything theatrical and with unfailing accuracy she always pierced it Suppose I tell you I have already offered the plant to the government at a nominal profit Suddenly she got up and every vestige of softness was gone I don t think you would be such a fool I have done it Then you are insane There is no other possible explanation She passed him moving swiftly and went into her bedroom He heard her lock the door behind her CHAPTER XXXIX Audrey had made a resolution and with characteristic energy had proceeded to carry it out She was no longer needed at the recruiting stations After a month s debate the conscription law was about to be passed made certain by the frank statement of the British Commission under Balfour as to the urgency of the need of a vast new army in France For the first time the Allies laid their cards face up on the table and America realized to what she was committed Almost overnight a potential army of hundreds of thousands was changing to one of millions The situation was desperate Germany had more men than the Allies and had vast eastern resources to draw on for still more To the Allies only the untapped resources of America remained In private conference with the President mister Balfour had urged haste and yet more haste Audrey reading her newspapers faithfully felt with her exaltation a little stirring of regret Her occupation such as it was was gone For the thin stream of men flowing toward the recruiting stations there was now to be a vast movement of the young manhood of the nation And she could have no place in it Almost immediately she set to work to find herself a new place At first there seemed to be none She went to a hospital and offered her strong body and her two willing hands for training I could learn quickly she pleaded and surely there will not be enough nurses for such an army as we are to have Our regular course is three years But a special course Surely I may have that There are so many things one won t need in France The head of the training school smiled rather wistfully They came to her so often now these intelligent untrained women all eagerness to help to forget and unlive if they could their wasted lives You want to go to France of course If I can My husband was killed over there But she did not intend to make capital of Chris s death Of course that has nothing to do with my going I simply want to work It s hard work Not romantic I am not looking for romance In the end however she had to give it up In some hospitals they were already training nurses helpers but they were to relieve trained women for France She went home to think it over She had felt that by leaving the country she would solve Clayton s problem and her own To stay on seeing him now and then was torture for them both But there was something else She had begun that afternoon to doubt whether she was fitted for nursing after all The quiet of the hospital the all pervading odor of drugs the subdued voice and quiet eyes of the head of the training school as of one who had looked on life and found it infinitely sad depressed her She had walked home impatient with herself disappointed in her own failure She thought dismally I am of no earthly use I ve played all my life and now I m paying for it I ought to And she ran over her pitiful accomplishments golf bridge ride shoot swim sing a little dance tennis some French what a sickening list She was glad that day to find Clare Gould waiting for her As usual the girl had brought her tribute this time some early strawberries Audrey found her in the pantry arranging their leaves in a shallow dish Clare she said Aren t you working I ve gone on night turn now The girl s admiration salved her wounded pride in herself Then she saw on a table an envelope with her name on it Clare s eyes followed hers That s the rest of the money missus Valentine She colored but Audrey only smiled at her Fine she said Are you sure you can spare it I couldn t rest until it was all paid up And I m getting along fine I make a lot really Tell me about the night work We ve gone on double turn I rather like it at night It s well it s like something on the stage The sparks fly from the lathes and they look like fireworks And when they hammer on hot metal it s lovely She talked on incoherent but glowing She liked her big turret lathe It gave her a sense of power She liked to see the rough metal growing smooth and shining like silver under her hands She was naively pleased that she was doing a man s work and doing it well Audrey leaned back in her chair and listened All this that Clare was talking about was Clayton s doing He at least had dreamed true He was doing a man s part too in the war Even this girl whose hand Natalie Spencer would not have touched this girl was dreaming true Clare was still talking The draft would be hard on the plant They were short handed now There was talk of taking in more girls to replace the men who would be called Do you think I could operate a lathe Clare You Why missus Valentine it s not work for a lady Look at my hands But Audrey made an impatient gesture I don t care about my hands The question is could I do it I don t seem able to do anything else Why yes Clare was reluctant I can and you re a lot cleverer than I am But it s hard It s rough and some of the talk oh I hope you don t mean it missus Valentine Audrey however was meaning it It seemed to her all at once the way out Here was work needed work Work that she could do For the first time in months she blessed the golf and riding that had kept her fit mister Spencer is a friend of yours He ll never let you do it He is not to know Clare Audrey said briskly You are quite right He would probably be very mannish about it So we won t tell him And now how shall I go about getting in Will they teach me or shall I have to lust learn And whatever shall I wear Clare explained while for she was determined not to lose a minute Audrey changed into her plainest clothes They would be in time if they hurried before the employment department closed There were women in charge there They card indexed you and then you were investigated by the secret service and if you were all right well that was all Mercy It s enough said Audrey impatiently Do you mean to say they ll come here She glanced around her rooms littered with photographs of people well known to the public through the society journals with its high bright silver vases its odd gifts of porcelain its grand piano taking up more than its share of room If they come here she deliberated they won t take me Clare They ll be thinking I m living on German money So in the end she did not go to the munition works She went room hunting instead with Clare beside her very uncomfortable on the street for fear Audrey would be compromised by walking with her And at six o clock that evening a young woman with a softly inflected voice and an air of almost humorous enjoyment of something the landlady failed to grasp was the tenant for one month s rent in advance of a room on South Perry Street Clare was almost in tears I can t bear to think of your sleeping in that bed missus Valentine she protested It dips down so I shan t have much time to sleep anyhow And when I do so I shall be so tired What was the name I gave her Clare Thompson Mary Thompson She surprised me or I d have thought of a prettier one She was absurdly high spirited although the next day s ordeal rather worried her when she thought about it She had oddly enough no trepidation about the work itself It was passing the detectives in the employment department that worried her As a matter of fact however there was no ordeal Her card was carried to the desk in the corner where the two men sat on whose decisions might so easily rest the safety of the entire plant and they surveyed her carefully Audrey looked ahead and waited They would come over and question her and the whole fabric she had built would be destroyed But nothing happened She was told she would be notified in a day or two if she would be taken on and with that she was forced to be content She had a bad moment however for Graham came through the office on his way out and stopped for a moment directly in front of her Her heart almost stopped beating and she dropped her glove and stooped to pick it up When she sat erect again he was moving on But even her brief glance had showed her that the boy looked tired and depressed She went to her rented room at once for she must be prepared for inquiries about her During the interval she arranged for the closing of her apartment and the storing of her furniture With their going would depart the last reminders of the old life and she felt a curious sense of relief They had little happiness to remind her of and much suffering The world had changed since she had gathered them together and she had changed with it She was older and sadder But she would not have gone back Not for anything would she have gone back She had one thing to do however before she disappeared She had promised to try to find something for Delight and she did it with her usual thoroughness and dispatch She sent for her that last day in the apartment when in the morning she had found at the Perry Street room a card telling her to report the following night When Delight came in she found the little apartment rather bare and rather dreary but Audrey was cheerful almost gay Going away for a little while she explained I ve stored a lot of stuff And now my dear do you really want to work I just must do something All right That s settled I ve got the thing I spoke about in one of the officers training camps But remember Delight this is not going to be a romantic adventure It s to be work I don t want a romantic adventure missus Valentine Poor little thing Audrey reflected to herself And aloud Good Of course I know you re sincere about working I I understand awfully well Delight was pleased but Audrey saw that she was not happy Even when the details had been arranged she still sat in her straight chair and made no move to go And Audrey felt that the next move was up to her What s the news about Graham Spencer she inquired He ll be drafted I suppose Not if they claim exemption He s making shells you know She lifted rather heavy eyes to Audrey s His mother is trying that now she said Ever since his engagement was broken Oh it was broken was it Yes I don t know why But it s off Anyhow missus Spencer is telling everybody he can t be spared And his father I don t know He doesn t talk about it I think Perhaps he wants him to make his own decision Delight rose and drew down her veil with hands that Audrey saw were trembling a little How can he make his own decision she asked He may think it s his own but it s hers missus Spencer s She s always talking always And she s plausible She can make him think black is white if she wants to Why don t you talk to him I He d think I d lost my mind Besides that isn t it If you like a man you want him to do the right thing because he wants to not because a girl asks him to I wonder Audrey said slowly if he s worth it Delight Worth what She was startled Worth your worth our worrying about him But she did not need Delight s hasty and flushed championship of Graham to tell her what she already knew After she had gone Audrey sat alone in her empty rooms and faced a great temptation She was taking herself out of Clayton s life She knew that she would be as lost to him among the thousands of workers in the munition plant as she would have been in Russia According to Clare he rarely went into the shops themselves and never at night Of course out of his life was a phrase They would meet again But not now not until they had had time to become resigned to what they had already accepted The war would not last forever And then she thought of their love which had been born and had grown always with war at its background They had gone along well enough until this winter and then everything had changed Chris Natalie Clayton herself none of them were quite what they had been Was that one of the gains of war that sham fell away and people revealed either the best or the worst in them War destroyed but it also revealed The temptation was to hear Clayton s voice again She went to the telephone and stood with the instrument in her hands thinking Would it comfort him Or would it only bring her close for a moment to emphasize her coming silence She put it down and turned away When some time later the taxicab came to take her to Perry Street she was lying on her bed in the dusk face down and arms outstretched a lonely and pathetic figure all her courage dead for the moment dead but for the desire to hear Clayton s voice again before the silence closed down She got up and pinned on her hat for the last time before the mirror of the little inlaid dressing table And she smiled rather forlornly at her reflection in the glass Well I ve got the present anyhow she considered I m not going either to wallow in the past or peer into the future I m going to work The prospect cheered her After all work was the great solution It was the great healer too That was why men bore their griefs better than women They could work She took a final glance around her stripped and cheerless rooms How really little things mattered All her life she had been burdened with things Now at last she was free of them The shabby room on Perry Street called her Work called beckoned to her with calloused useful hands She closed and locked the door and went quietly down the stairs CHAPTER XL One day late in May Clayton walking up town in lieu of the golf he had been forced to abandon met Doctor Haverford on the street and found his way barred by that rather worried looking gentleman I was just going to see you Clayton he said About two things I ll walk back a few blocks with you He was excited rather exalted I m going in he announced Regimental chaplain I ve got a year s leave of absence I m rather vague about what a chaplain does but I rather fancy he can be useful You ll get over of course You re lucky And you ll find plenty to do I ve been rather anxious Doctor Haverford confided I ve been a clergyman so long that I don t know just how I ll measure up as a man You know what I mean I am making no reflection on the church But I ve been sheltered and well I ve been looked after I don t think I am physically brave It would be a fine thing he said wryly if the chaplain were to turn and run under fire I shouldn t worry about that My salary is to go on But I don t like that either If I hadn t a family I wouldn t accept it Delight thinks I shouldn t anyhow As a matter of fact there ought to be no half way measures about our giving ourselves If I had a son to give it would be different Clayton looked straight ahead He knew that the rector had for the moment forgotten that he had a son to give and that he had not yet given Why don t you accept a small allowance he inquired quietly Or better still why don t you let me know how much it will take and let me do it I d like to feel that I was represented in France by you he added And suddenly the rector remembered He was most uncomfortable and very flushed Thanks I can t let you do that of course Why not Because hang it all Clayton I m not a parasite I took the car because it enabled me to do my parish work better But I m not going to run off to war and let you keep my family Clayton glanced at him at his fine erect old figure his warmly flushed face War did strange things There was a new light in the rector s once worldly if kindly eyes He had the strained look of a man who sees great things as yet far away and who would hasten toward them Insensibly he quickened his pace But I can t go myself so why can t I send a proxy Clayton asked smiling I ve an idea I d be well represented That s a fine way to look at it but I can t do it I ve saved something not much but it will do for a year or two I m glad you made the offer though It was like you and it showed me the way I can t let any man or any group of men finance my going And he stuck to it Clayton having in mind those careful canvasses of the congregation of Saint Luke s which had every few years resulted in raising the rector s salary was surprised and touched After all war was like any other grief It brought out the best or the worst in us It roused or it crushed us The rector had been thinking I m a very fortunate man he said suddenly They re standing squarely behind me at home It s the women behind the army that will make it count Clayton Clayton said nothing Which reminds me went on the rector that I find missus Valentine has gone away I called on her to day and she has given up her apartment Do you happen to know where she is She has left no address Gone away Clayton repeated Why no I hadn t heard of it There in the busy street he felt a strange sense of loneliness Always although he did not see her he felt her presence She walked the same streets For the calling if his extremity became too great he could hear her voice over the telephone There was always the hope too of meeting her Not by design She had forbidden that But some times perhaps God would be good to them both if they earned it and they could touch hands for a moment But gone You are certain she left no address Quite certain She has stored her furniture I believe There was a sense of hurt then too She had made this decision without telling him It seemed incredible A dozen decisions a day he made and when they were vital there was always in his mind the question as to whether she would approve or not He could not go to her with them but mentally he was always consulting with her earning her approbation And she had gone without a word Do you think she has gone to France He knew his voice sounded stiff and constrained I hope not She was being so useful here Of course the draft law amazing thing the draft law Never thought we d come to it But it threw her out in a way of course What has the draft law to do with missus Valentine Why you know what she was doing don t you I haven t seen her recently The rector half stopped Well he said Let me tell you Clayton that that girl has been recruiting men night after night and day after day She s done wonders Standing in a wagon mind you in the slums or anywhere I heard her one night By George I went home and tore up a sermon I had been working on for days Why hadn t he known Why hadn t he realized that that was exactly the sort of thing she would do There was bitterness in his heart too He might easily have stood unseen in the crowd and have watched and listened and been proud of her Then these last weeks when he had been working or dining out or sitting dreary and bored in a theater she had been out in the streets Ah she lived did Audrey Others worked and played but she lived Audrey Audrey in the rain the rector was saying But she didn t mind it I remember her saying to the crowd It s raining over here and maybe it s raining on the fellows in the trenches But I tell you I d rather be over there up to my waist in mud and water than scurrying for a doorway here They had started to run out of the shower but at that they grinned and stopped She was wonderful Clayton In the rain And after it was over she would go home in some crowded bus or car to her lonely rooms while he rolled about the city in a limousine It was cruel of her not to have told him not to have allowed him at least to see that she was warm and dry I ve been very busy I hadn t heard he said slowly Is it was it generally known Had Natalie known and kept it from him I think not Delight saw her and spoke to her I believe And you have no idea where she is now None whatever He learned that night that Natalie had known and he surprised a little uneasiness in her face I heard about it she said I can t imagine her making a speech She s not a bit oratorical We might have sent out one of the cars for her if I d known Oh she was looked after well enough Looked after Natalie had made an error and knew it I heard that a young clergyman was taking her round she said and changed the subject But he knew that she was either lying or keeping something from him In those days of tension he found her half truths more irritating than her rather childish falsehoods In spite of himself however the thought of the young clergyman rankled That night stretched in the low chair in his dressing room under the reading light he thought over things carefully If he loved her as he thought he did he ought to want her to be happy Things between them were hopeless and wretched If this clergyman or Sloane or any other man loved her and he groaned as he thought how lovable she was then why not want for her such happiness as she could find He slept badly that night and for some reason Audrey wove herself into his dreams of the new plant The roar of the machinery took on the soft huskiness of her voice the deeper note he watched for and loved CHAPTER XLI Anna Klein stood in her small room and covered her mouth with her hands lest she shriek aloud She knew quite well that the bomb in the suit case would not suffice to blow up the whole great plant But she knew what the result of its explosion would be The shells were not loaded at the Spencer plant They were shipped away for that But the fuses were loaded there and in the small brick house at the end of the fuse building there were stored masses of explosive enough to destroy a town It was there of course that Herman was to place the bomb She knew how he would do it carefully methodically and with what a lumbering awkward gait he would make his escape Her whole mind was bent on giving the alarm On escaping first and then on arousing the plant But when the voices below continued long after Herman had gone she was entirely desperate Herman had not carried out the suit case He had looked indeed much as usual as he walked out the garden path and closed the gate behind him He had walked rather slowly but then he always walked slowly She seemed to see however a new caution in his gait as of one who dreaded to stumble She dressed herself with shaking fingers and pinned on her hat The voices still went on below monotonous endless the rasping of Rudolph s throat irritated by cheap cigarets the sound of glasses on the table once a laugh guttural and mirthless It was ten o clock when she knew by the pushing back of their chairs that they were preparing to depart Ten o clock She was about to commence again the feverish unscrewing of the door hinges when she heard Rudolph s step on the stairs She had only time to get to the back of her room beside the bed when she heard him try the knob Anna She let him call her again Anna What is it You in bed Yes Go away and let me alone I ve got a right to sleep anyhow I m going out but I ll be back in ten minutes You try any tricks and I ll get you See You make me sick she retorted She heard him turn and run lightly down the stairs Only when she heard the click of the gate did she dare to begin again at the door She got down stairs easily but she was still a prisoner However she found the high little window into the coal shed open and crawled through it to stand listening The street was quiet Once outside the yard she started to run They would let her telephone from the drug store even without money She had no money But the drug store was closed and dark and the threat of Rudolph s return terrified her She must get off the hill somehow There were still paths down the steep hill side dangerous things that hugged the edge of small rocky precipices or sloped steeply to sudden turns But she had played over the hill all her young life She plunged down slipping and falling a dozen times and muttering some times an oath some times a prayer Oh God let me be in time Oh God hold him up a while until I then a slip If I fall now Only when she was down in the mill district did she try to make any plan It was almost eleven then and her ears were tense with listening for the sound she dreaded She faced her situation then She could not telephone from a private house either to the mill or to the Spencer house what she feared and the pay booths of the telephone company demanded cash in advance She was incapable of clear thought or she would have found some way out undoubtedly What she did in the end was to board an up town car and throw herself on the mercy of the conductor I ve got to get up town she panted I ll not go in See I ll stand here and you take me as far as you can Look at me I don t look as though I m just bumming a ride do I The conductor hesitated He had very little faith in human nature but Anna s eyes were both truthful and desperate He gave the signal to go on What s up he said Police after you Yes Anna replied briefly There is in certain ranks a tacit conspiracy against the police The conductor hated them They rode free on his car and sometimes kept an eye on him in the rush hours They had a way too of letting him settle his own disputes with inebriated gentlemen who refused to pay their fares Looks as though they d come pretty close to grabbing you he opened by way of conversation But ten of em aren t a match for one smart girl They can t run All got flat feet Anna nodded She was faint and dizzy and the car seemed to creep along It was twenty minutes after eleven when she got out The conductor leaned down after her hanging to the handrail Good luck to you he said And you d better get a better face on you than that It s enough to send you up on suspicion She hardly heard him She began to run and again she said over and over her little inarticulate prayer She knew the Spencer house More than once she had walked past it on Sunday afternoons for the sheer pleasure of seeing Graham s home Well all that was over now Everything was over unless The Spencer house was dark save for a low light in the hall A new terror seized her Suppose Graham saw her He might not believe her story He might think it a ruse to see his father But as it happened Clayton had sent the butler to bed and himself answered the bell from the library He recognized her at once and because he saw the distress on her face he brought her in at once In the brief moment that it required to turn on the lights he had jumped to a sickening conviction that Graham was at the bottom of her visit and her appearance in full light confirmed this Come into the library he said We can talk in there He led the way and drew up a chair for her But she did not sit down She steadied herself by its back instead You think it s about Graham she began It isn t not directly that is And my coming is terrible because it s my own father They re going to blow up the munition plant mister Spencer When To night I think I came as fast as I could I was locked in Locked in He was studying her face Yes Don t bother about that now I m not crazy or hysterical I tell you I heard them I ve been a prisoner or I d have come sooner To day they brought something dynamite or a bomb in a suit case and it s gone to night He took it my father He was already at the telephone as she spoke He called the mill first and got the night superintendent Then he called a number Anna supposed was the police station and at the same time he was ringing the garage signal steadily for his car By the time he had explained the situation to the police his car was rolling under the porte cochere beside the house He was starting out forgetful of the girl when she caught him by the arm You mustn t go she cried You ll be killed too It will all go all of it You can t be spared mister Spencer You can build another mill but He shook her off gently Of course I m going he said We ll get it in time Don t you worry You sit down here and rest and when it s all straightened out I ll come back I suppose you can t go home after this No she said dully He ran out hatless and a moment later she heard the car rush out into the night Five minutes passed Ten Anna Klein stood staring ahead of her When nothing happened she moved around and sat down in the chair She was frightfully tired She leaned her head back and tried to think of something to calm her shaking nerves that this was Graham s home that he sometimes sat in that very chair But she found that Graham meant nothing to her Nothing mattered except that her warning had been in time So intent was she on the thing that she was listening for that smaller near by sounds escaped her So she did not hear a door open up stairs and the soft rustle of a woman s negligee as it swept from stair to stair But as the foot steps outside the door she stood up quickly and looked back over her shoulder Natalie stood framed in the doorway staring at her Well she said And on receiving no answer from the frightened girl What are you doing here The ugly suspicion in her voice left Anna speechless for a moment Don t move please said Natalie s cold voice Stay just where you are She reached behind the curtain at the doorway and Anna heard the far away ringing of a bell insistent and prolonged The girl roused herself with an effort I came to see mister Spencer That is a likely story Who let you in mister Spencer mister Spencer is not in But he did I m telling you the truth Indeed I am I rang the bell and he came to the door I had something to tell him What could you possibly have to tell my husband at this hour But Anna Klein did not answer From far away there came a dull report followed almost immediately by a second one The windows rattled and the house seemed to rock rather gently on its foundation Then silence Anna Klein picked up her empty pocket book from the table and looked at it I was too late she said dully and the next moment she was lying at Natalie s feet CHAPTER XLII It was not until dawn that the full extent of the disaster was revealed All night by the flames from the sheds in the yard which were of wood and still burning rescue parties had worked frantically Two of the long buildings nearest to the fuse department had collapsed entirely Above the piles of fallen masonry might be seen here and there the black mass of some machine or lathe and it was there the search parties were laboring Luckily the fuse department had not gone double turn and the night shift in the machine shop was not a full one The fuse department was a roaring furnace and repeated calls had brought in most of the fire companies of the city Running back and forth in the light of the flames were the firemen and such volunteer rescuers as had been allowed through the police cordon Outside that line of ropes and men were gathered a tragic crowd begging imploring to be allowed through to search for some beloved body Now and then a fresh explosion made the mob recoil only to press close again importuning tragic hopeless The casualty list ran high All night long ambulances stood in a row along the street backed up to the curb and waiting and ever so often a silent group in broken step carried out some quiet covered thing that would never move again With the dawn Graham found his father He had thrown off his coat and in his shirt sleeves was with other rescuers digging in the ruins Graham himself had been working He was nauseated weary and unutterably wretched for he had seen the night superintendent and had heard of his father s message Klein he said You don t mean Herman Klein That was what he said I was to find him and hold him until he got here But I couldn t find him He may have got out There s no way of telling now Waves of fresh nausea swept over Graham He sat down on a pile of bricks and wiped his forehead clammy with sweat I hope to God he was burned alive muttered the other man surveying the scene His eyes were reddened with smoke from the fire his clothing torn I was knocked down myself he said I was out in the yard looking for Klein and I guess I lay there quite a while If I hadn t gone out He shrugged his shoulders How many women were on the night shift Not a lot Twenty perhaps If I had my way I d take every German in the country and boil em in oil I didn t want Klein back but he was a good workman Well he s done a good job now It was after that that Graham saw his father a strange wild eyed Clayton who drove his pick with a sort of mad strength and at the same time gave orders in an unfamiliar voice Graham himself a disordered figure watched him for a moment He was divided between fear and resolution Some place in that debacle there lay his own responsibility He was still bewildered but the fact that Anna s father had done the thing was ominous The urge to confession was stronger than his fears Somehow during the night he had become a man But now he only felt that somehow during the night he had become a murderer Clayton looked up and he moved toward him Yes I ve had some coffee made at a house down the street Won t you come and have it Clayton straightened He was very tired and the yard was full of volunteers now each provided at the gate with a pick or shovel A look at the boy s face decided him I ll come he said and turned his pick over to a man beside him He joined Graham and for a moment he looked into the boy s eyes Then he put a hand on his shoulder and together they walked out past the line of ambulances into a street where the scattered houses showed not a single unshattered window and the pavements were littered with glass His father s touch comforted the boy but it made even harder the thing he had to do For he could not go through life with this thing on his soul There had been a moment after he learned of Herman s implication when he felt the best thing would be to kill himself but he had put that aside It was too easy If Herman Klein had done this thing because of Anna and himself then he was a murderer If he had done it because he was a German then he Graham had no right to die He would live to make as many Germans as possible pay for this night s work I ve got something to tell you father he said as they paused before the house where the coffee was ready Clayton nodded and together they went inside Even this house was partially destroyed A piece of masonry had gone through the kitchen and standing on fallen bricks and plaster a cheerful old woman was cooking over a stove which had somehow escaped destruction It s bad she said to Graham as she poured the coffee into cups but it might have been worse mister Spencer We re all alive And I guess I ll understand what my boy s writing home about now They ve sure brought the war here this night Graham carried the coffee into the little parlor where Clayton sat dropped on a low chair his hands between his knees He was a strange disheveled figure gray of face and weary and the hand he held out for the cup was blistered and blackened Graham did not touch his coffee He put it on the mantel and stood waiting while Clayton finished his Shall I tell you now sir Clayton drew a long breath It was Herman Klein who did it Probably I had a warning last night but it was too late I should have known of course but somehow I didn t He d been with us a long time I d have sworn he was loyal For the first time in his life Graham saw his father weaken the pitiful ashamed weakness of a strong man His voice broke his face twitched The boy drew himself up they couldn t both go to pieces He could not know that Clayton had worked all that night in that hell with the conviction that in some way his own son was responsible that he knew already what Graham was about to tell him If Herman Klein did it father it was because he was the tool of a gang And the reason he was a tool was because he thought I was living with Anna I wasn t I don t know why I wasn t There was every chance I suppose I meant to some time Anyhow he thought I was If he had expected any outbreak from Clayton he met none Clayton sat looking ahead and listening Inside of the broken windows the curtains were stirring in the fresh breeze of early morning and in the kitchen the old woman was piling the fallen bricks noisily I had been flirting with her a little it wasn t much more than that and I gave her a watch at Christmas He found it out and he beat her Awfully She ran away and sent for me and I met her She had to hide for days Her face was all bruised Then she got sick from it She was sick for weeks Did he know where she was I think not or he d have gone to get her But Rudolph Klein knew something I took her out to dinner to a roadhouse a few days ago and she said she saw him there I didn t All that time weeks I d never I d never gone to her room That night I did I don t know why I Go on Well I went but I didn t stay I couldn t I guess she thought I was crazy I went away that s all And the next day I felt that she might be feeling as though I d turned her down or something And I felt responsible Maybe you won t understand I don t quite myself Anyhow I went back to let her know I wasn t quite a brute even if But she was gone I m not trying to excuse myself It s a rotten story for I was engaged to Marion then Suddenly he sat down beside Clayton and buried his face in his hands For some reason or other Clayton found himself back in the hospital that night when Joey lay still and quiet and Graham was sobbing like a child prostrate on the white covering of the bed With the incredible rapidity of thought in a mental crisis he saw the last months the boy s desire to go to France thwarted his attempt to interest himself in the business the tool Marion Hayden had made of him Anna s doglike devotion all leading inevitably to catastrophe And through it all he saw Natalie holding Graham back from war providing him with extra money excusing him using his confidences for her own ends insidiously sapping the boy s confidence in his father and himself We ll have to stand up to this together Graham The boy looked up Then you re not going to throw me over altogether No But all this If Herman Klein had not done it there were others who would probably It looks as though you had provided them with a tool but I suppose we were vulnerable in a dozen ways He rose and they stood eyes level father and son in the early morning sunlight And suddenly Graham s arms were around his shoulders and something tight around Clayton s heart relaxed Once again and now for good he had found his boy the little boy who had not so long ago stood on a chair for this very embrace Only now the boy was a man I m going to France father he said I m going to pay them back for this And out of every two shots I fire one will be for you Perhaps he had found his boy only to lose him but that would have to be as God willed At ten o clock he went up to the house to change his wet and draggled clothing The ruins were being guarded by soldiers and the work of rescue was still going on more slowly now since there was little or no hope of finding any still living thing in that flame swept wreckage He found Natalie in bed with Madeleine in attendance and he learned that her physician had just gone He felt that he could not talk to her just then She had a morbid interest in horrors and with the sights of that night fresh in his mind he could not discuss them He stopped however in her doorway I m glad you are resting he said Better stay in bed to day It s been a shock Resting I ve been frightfully ill I m sorry my dear I ll come in again on my way out Clay He turned in the doorway Is it all gone Everything Practically Yes But you were insured I ll tell you about that later I haven t given it much thought yet I don t know just how we stand I shall never let Graham go back to it again I warn you I ve been lying here for hours thinking that it might have happened as easily as not while he was there He hardly listened He had just remembered Anna I left a girl here last night Natalie he said Do you happen to know what became of her Natalie stirred on her pillows I should think I do She fainted or pretended to faint The servants looked after her Has she gone I hope so It is almost noon Oh by the way she called as he moved off there is a message for you A woman named Gould from the Central Hospital She wants to see you at once They have kept the telephone ringing all the morning Clare Gould That was odd He had seen her taken out a bruised and moaning creature her masses of fair hair over her shoulders her eyes shut The surgeons had said she was not badly hurt She might be worse than they thought The mention of her name brought Audrey before him He hoped wherever she was she would know that he was all right As soon as he had changed he called the hospital The message came back promptly and clearly We have a woman named Gould here She is not badly hurt but she is hysterical She wants to see you but if you can t come at once I am to give you a message Wait a moment She has written it but it s hardly legible Clayton waited It s about somebody you know who had gone on night turn recently at your plant I can t read the name It looks like Ballantine It isn t Valentine is it Perhaps it is It s just a scrawl But the first name is clear enough Audrey Afterward he did not remember hanging up the receiver or getting out of the house He seemed to come to himself somewhat at the hospital and at the door to Clare s ward his brain suddenly cleared He did not need Clare s story It seemed that he knew it all had known it long ages before Her very words sounded like infinite repetitions of something he had heard over and over She was right beside me and I was showing her about the lathe They d told me I could teach her She was picking it up fast too And she liked it She liked it The fact that Audrey had liked it broke down his scanty reserve of restraint Clayton found himself looking down at her from a great distance She was very remote Clare pulled herself together When the first explosion came it didn t touch us But I guess she knew it meant more She said something about the telephone and getting help and there d be more and she started to run I just stood there watching her run and waiting And then the second one came and Suddenly Clare seemed to disappear altogether He felt something catch his arm and the nurse s voice very calm and quiet Sit down I ll get you something Then he was swallowing a fluid that burned his throat and Clare was crying with the sheet drawn to her mouth and somewhere Audrey He got up and the nurse followed him out You might look for the person here she suggested We have had several brought in He was still dazed but he followed her docilely Audrey was not there He seemed to have known that too That there would be a long search and hours of agony and at the end the one thing he did not know was what was to be at the end All that afternoon he searched going from hospital to hospital And at each one as he stopped that curious feeling of inner knowledge told him she was not there But the same instinct told him she was not dead He would have known it if she was dead There was no reasoning in it He could not reason But he knew somehow Then late in the afternoon he found her He knew that he had found her It was as though at the entrance of the hospital some sixth sense had told him this was right at last He was quite steady all at once She was here waiting for him to come And now he had come and it would be all right Yet for a time it seemed all wrong She was not conscious had not roused since she was brought it There were white screens around her bed and behind them she lay alone They had braided her hair in two long dark braids and there was a bandage on one of her arms She looked very young and very tired but quite peaceful His arrival had caused a small stir of excitement his own prominence the disaster with which the country was ringing But for a few minutes before the doctors arrived he was alone with her behind the screen It was like being alone with his dead Bent over her his face pressed to one of her quiet hands he whispered to her all the little tendernesses the aching want of her that so long he had buried in his heart Things he could not have told her waking he told her then It seemed too that she must rouse to them that she must feel him there beside her calling her back But she did not move It was then for the first time that he wondered what he would do if she should die The doctors coming behind the screen found him sitting erect and still staring ahead of him with a strange expression on his face He had just decided that he could not under any circumstances live if she died It was rather a good thing for Clayton s sanity that they gave him hope He was completely unnerved tired and desperate Indeed when they came in he had been picturing Audrey and himself wandering hand in hand very quietly and contentedly in some strange world which was his rather hazy idea of the Beyond It seemed to him quite sane and extraordinarily happy The effort of meeting the staff roused him and with hope came a return to normality There was much to be done special nurses a private room and rather reluctantly friends and relatives to be notified Only for a few minutes out of all of life had she been his He must give her up now Life had become one long renunciation He did not go home at all that night He divided his time between the plant and the hospital going back and forward Each time he found the report good She was still strong no internal injuries had manifested themselves and the concussion would probably wear off before long He wanted to be there when she first opened her eyes He was afraid she might be frightened and there would be a bad minute when she remembered if she did remember At midnight going into the room he found missus Haverford beside Audrey s bed knitting placidly She seemed to accept his being there as perfectly natural and she had no sick room affectations She did not whisper for one thing The nurse thinks she is coming round Clayton she said I waited because I thought she ought to see a familiar face when she does missus Haverford was eminently good for him Her cheerful matter of factness her competent sanity restored his belief in a world that had seemed only chaos and death How much he wondered later had missus Haverford suspected He had not been in any condition to act a part But whatever she suspected he knew was locked in her kindly breast Audrey moved slightly and he went over to her When he glanced up again missus Haverford had gone out So it was that Audrey came back to him and to him alone She asked no questions She only lay quite still on her white pillows and looked at him Even when he knelt beside her and drew her toward him she said nothing but she lifted her uninjured hand and softly caressed his bent head Clayton never knew whether missus Haverford had come back and seen that or not He did not care for that matter It seemed to him just then that all the world must know what was so vitally important so transcendently wonderful Not until Audrey s eyes closed again and he saw that she was sleeping did he loosen his arms from around her When at last he went out to the stiffly furnished hospital parlor he found missus Haverford sitting there alone still knitting But he rather thought she had been crying There was an undeniably moist handkerchief on her knee She roused a little while ago he said trying to speak quietly and as though Audrey s rousing were not the wonder that it was She seemed very comfortable And now she s sleeping The dear child said missus Haverford If she had died after everything Her plump face quivered Things have never been very happy for her Clayton I m afraid not He went to a window and stood looking out The city was not quiet but its mighty roar of the day was lowered to a monotonous drowsy humming From the east reflected against low hanging clouds was the dull red of his own steel mills looking like the reflection of a vast conflagration Not very happy he repeated Some times missus Haverford was saying I wonder about things People go along missing the best things in life and I suppose there is a reason for it but some times I wonder if He ever meant us to go on crucifying our own souls So she did know What would you have us do I don t know I suppose there isn t any answer Afterward Clayton found that that bit of conversation with missus Haverford took on the unreality of the rest of that twenty four hours But one part of it stood out real and hopelessly true There wasn t any answer CHAPTER XLIII Anna Klein had gone home at three o clock that terrible morning a trembling white faced girl She had done her best and she had failed Unlike Graham she had no feeling of personal responsibility but she felt she could never again face her father with the thing that she knew between them There were other reasons too Herman would be arrested and she would be called to testify She had known She had warned mister Spencer The gang Rudolph s gang would get her for that She knew where they were now They would be at Gus s in the back room drinking to the success of their scheme and Gus who was a German too would be with them offering a round of drinks on the house now and then as his share of the night s rejoicing Gus who was already arranging to help draft dodgers by sending them over the Mexican border She would have to go back to get in and out again if she could before Herman came back She had no clothes except what she stood up in and those in her haste that night were only her print house dress with a long coat She would have to find a new position and she would have to have her clothing to get about in She dragged along singularly unmolested Once or twice a man eyed her but her white face and vacant eyes were unattractive almost sodden She was barely able to climb the hill and as she neared the house her trepidation increased What if Herman had come back If he suspected her he would kill her He must have been half mad to have done the thing anyhow He would surely be half mad now And because she was young and strong and life was still a mystery to be solved she did not want to die Strangely enough face to face with danger there was still in the back of her head an exultant thrill in her very determination to live She would start over again and she would work hard and make good You bet I ll make good she resolved Just give me a chance and I ll work my fool head off Which was by way of being a prayer It was the darkest hour before the dawn when she reached the cottage It was black and very still and outside the gate she stooped and slipped off her shoes The window into the shed by which she had escaped was still open and she crouched outside listening When the stillness remained unbroken she climbed in tense for a movement or a blow Once inside however she drew a long breath The doors were still locked and the keys gone So Herman had not returned But as she stood there hurried stealthy footsteps came along the street and turned in at the gate In a panic she flew up the stairs and into her room where the door still hung crazily on its hinges She stood there listening her heart pounding in her ears and below she distinctly heard a key in the kitchen door She did the only thing she could think of She lifted the door into place and stood against it bracing it with her body Whoever it was was in the kitchen now moving however more swiftly than Herman She heard matches striking Then Hsst She knew that it was Rudolph and she braced herself mentally Rudolph was keener than Herman If he found her door in that condition and she herself dressed Working silently and still holding the door in place she flung off her coat She even unpinned her hair and unfastened her dress When his signal remained unanswered a second time he called her by name and she heard him coming up Anna he repeated Yes He was startled to hear her voice so close to the door In the dark she heard him fumbling for the knob He happened on the padlock instead and he laughed a little By that she knew that he was not quite sober Locked you in has he What do you want Has Herman come home yet He doesn t get home until seven Hasn t he been back at all to night She hesitated How do I know I ve been asleep Some sleep he said and suddenly lurched against the door In spite of her it yielded and although she braced herself with all her strength his weight against it caused it to give way It was a suspicious crafty Rudolph who picked himself up and made a clutch at her in the dark You little liar he said thickly And struck a match She cowered away from him I was going to run away Rudolph she cried He hasn t any business locking me in I won t stand for it You ve been out No Out after him Honest to God Rudolph no I hate him I don t ever want to see him again He put a hand out into the darkness and finding her tried to draw her to him She struggled and he released her All at once she knew that he was weak with fright The bravado had died out of him The face she had touched was covered with a clammy sweat I wish to God Herman would come What d you want with him Have you got any whisky You ve had enough of that stuff Some one was walking along the street outside She felt that he was listening crouched ready to run but the steps went on Look here Anna he said when he had pulled himself together again I m going to get out of this I m going away All right You can go for all of me D you mean to say you ve been asleep all night You didn t hear anything Hear what He laughed You ll know soon enough Then he told her hurriedly that he was going away He d come back to get her to promise to follow him He wasn t going to stay here and And what And be drafted he finished rather lamely Gus has a friend in a town on the Mexican border he said He s got maps of the country to Mexico City and the Germans there fix you up all right I ll get rich down there and some day I ll send for you What s that He darted to the window faintly outlined by a distant street lamp Three men were standing quietly outside the gate and a fourth was already in the garden silently moving toward the house She felt Rudolph brush by her and the trembling hand he laid on her arm Now lie he whispered fiercely You haven t seen me I haven t been here to night Then he was gone She ran to the window The other three men were coming in moving watchfully and slowly and Rudolph was at Katie s window cursing If she was a prisoner so was Rudolph He realized that instantly and she heard him breaking out the sash with a chair At the sound the three figures broke into a run and she heard the sash give way Almost instantly there was firing The first shot was close and she knew it was Rudolph firing from the window Some wild design of braining him from behind with a chair flashed into her desperate mind but when she had felt her way into Katie s room he had gone The garden below was quiet but there was yelling and the crackling of underbrush from the hill side Then a scattering of shots again and silence The yard was empty The hill paid but moderate attention to shots They were usually merely pyrotechnic and indicated rejoicing rather than death But here and there she heard a window raised and then lowered again The hill had gone back to bed Anna went into her room and dressed For the first time it had occurred to her that she might be held by the police and the thought was unbearable It was when she was making her escape that she found a prostrate figure in the yard and knew that one of Rudolph s shots had gone home She could not go away and leave that not unless A terrible hatred of Herman and Rudolph and all their kind suddenly swept over her She would not run away She would stay and tell all the terrible truth It was her big moment and she rose to it She would see it through What was her own safety to letting this band of murderers escape And all that in the few seconds it took to reach the fallen figure It was only when she was very close that she saw it was moving Tell Dunbar he went to the left a voice was saying The left They ll lose him yet Joey Hello said Joey s voice He considered that he was speaking very loud but it was hardly more than a whisper That wasn t your father was it The old boy couldn t jump and run like that Are you hurt He coughed a little a gurgling cough that rather startled himself But he was determined to be a man No I just lay down here for a nap Who was it that jumped My cousin Rudolph Do you think I can help you into the house I ll walk there myself in a minute Unless your cousin Rudolph His head dropped back on her arm I feel sort of all in His voice trailed off Joey Lemme alone he muttered I m the first casualty in the American army I He made a desperate effort to speak in a man s voice but the higher boyish notes of sixteen conquered They certainly gave us hell to night But we re going to build again me and Clayton Spen All at once he was very still Anna spoke to him and that failing gave him a frantic little shake But Joey had gone to another partnership beyond the stars CHAPTER XLIV The immediate outstanding result of the holocaust at the munitions works was the end of Natalie s dominion aver Graham She never quite forgave him the violence with which he threw off her shackles If I d been half a man I d have been over there long ago he said standing before her tall and young and flushed I d have learned my job by now and I d be worth something now I m needed And broken my heart Hearts don t break that way mother Well you say you are going now I should think you d be satisfied There s plenty of time for you to get the glory you want Glory I don t want any glory And as for plenty of time that s exactly what there isn t During the next few days she preserved an obstinate silence on the subject She knew he had been admitted to one of the officers training camps and that he was making rather helpless and puzzled purchases Going into his room she would find a dressing case of khaki leather perhaps or flannel shirts of the same indeterminate hue She would shed futile tears over them and order them put out of sight But she never offered to assist him Graham was older in many ways He no longer ran up and down the stairs whistling and he sought every opportunity to be with his father They spent long hours together in the library when after a crowded day filled with the thousand problems of reconstructions Clayton smoked a great deal talked a little rather shame facedly after the manner of men of personal responsibility in the war and quietly watched the man who was Graham Out of those quiet hours with Natalie at the theater or reading up stairs in bed Clayton got the greatest comfort of his life He would neither look back nor peer anxiously ahead The past with its tragedy was gone The future might hold even worse things But just now he would live each day as it came working to the utmost and giving his evenings to his boy The nights were the worst He was not sleeping well and in those long hours of quiet he tried to rebuild his life along stronger sterner lines Love could have no place in it but there was work left He was strong and he was still young The country should have every ounce of energy in him He would re build the plant on bigger lines than before and when that was done he would build again The best he could do was not enough He scarcely noticed Natalie s withdrawal from Graham and himself When she was around he was his old punctilious self gravely kind more than ever considerate Beside his failure to her her own failure to him faded into insignificance She was as she was and through no fault of hers But he was what he had made himself Once or twice he had felt an overwhelming remorse toward her and on one such occasion he had made a useless effort to break down the barrier of her long silence Don t go up stairs Natalie he had begged I am not very amusing I know but I ll try my best I ll promise not to touch on anything disagreeable He had been standing in the hail looking up at her on the stair case and he smiled There was pleading behind the smile an inarticulate feeling that between them there might at least be friendship You are never disagreeable she had said looking down with hostile eyes You are quite perfect Then won t you wait Perfection bores me to tears she said and went on up the stairs On the morning of Graham s departure however he found her prepared to go to the railway station She was red eyed and pale and he was very sorry for her Do you think it is wise he asked I shall see him off of course I may never see him again And his own tautened nerves almost gave way Don t say that he cried Don t even think that And for God s sake Natalie send him off with a smile That s the least we can do I can t take it as casually as you do He gave up then in despair He saw that Graham watched her uneasily during the early breakfast and he surmised that the boy s own grip on his self control was weakened by the tears that dropped into her coffee cup He reflected bitterly that all over the country strong women good women were sending their boys away to war giving them with prayer and exaltation What was wrong with Natalie What was wrong with his whole life When Graham was up stairs he turned to her Why do you persist in going Natalie I intend to go That s enough Don t you think you ve made him unhappy enough He has made me unhappy enough You It is always yourself Natalie Why don t you ever think of him He went to the door Countermand the order for the limousine he said to the butler and order the small car for mister Graham and myself How dare you do that I am not going to let you ruin the biggest day in his life She saw that he meant it She was incredulous reckless angry and thwarted for the first time in her self indulgent life I hate you she said slowly I hate you She turned and went slowly up the stairs Graham knocking at her door a few minutes later heard the sound of hysterical sobbing within but received no reply Good by mother he called Good by Don t worry I ll be all right When he saw she did not mean to open the door or to reply he went rather heavily down the stairs I wish she wouldn t he said It makes me darned unhappy But Clayton surmised a relief behind his regret and in the train the boy s eyes were happier than they had been for months I don t know how I ll come out dad he said But if I don t get through it won t be because I didn t try And he did try The enormous interest of the thing gripped him from the start There was romance in it too He wore his first uniform too small for him as it was with immense pride He rolled out in the morning at reveille with the feeling that he had just gone to bed ate hugely at breakfast learned to make his own cot bed and lined up on a vast dusty parade ground for endless evolutions in a boiling sun It was rather amusing to find himself being ordered about in a stentorian voice by Jackson And when in off moments that capable ex chauffeur condescended to a few moments of talk and relaxation the boy was highly gratified Do you think I ve got anything in me he would inquire anxiously And Jackson always said heartily Sure you have There were times when Graham doubted himself however There was one dreadful hour when Graham in the late afternoon and under the eyes of his commanding officer and a group of ladies conducting the highly formal and complicated ceremony of changing the guard tied a lot of grinning men up in a knot which required the captain of the company and two sergeants to untangle I m no earthly good he confided to Jackson that night sitting on the steps of his barracks I know it like a b c and then I get up and try it and all at once I m just a plain damned fool Don t give up like that son Jackson said I ve seen em march a platoon right into the C O s porch before now And once I just saved a baby buggy and a pair of twins Clayton wrote him daily and now and then there came a letter from Natalie cheerful on the surface but its cheerfulness obviously forced And once to his great surprise Marion Hayden wrote him I just want you to know she said that I am still interested in you even if it isn t going to be anything else And that I am ridiculously proud of you Isn t it queer to look back on last Winter and think what a lot of careless idiots we were I suppose war doesn t really change us but it does make us wonder what we ve got in us I am surprised to find that I am a great deal better than I ever thought I was There was comfort in the letter but no thrill He was far away from all that now like one on the first stage of a long journey with his eyes ahead Then one day he saw a familiar but yet strange figure striding along the country road Graham was map sketching that day and the strange but familiar figure was almost on him when he looked up It was extremely military and looked like a general at least Also it was very red in the face and was clutching doggedly in its teeth an old briar pipe But what had appeared from the front to be an ultra military figure on closer inspection turned out to be a procession Pulling back hard on a rope behind was the company goat Elinor The ultra military figure paused by Graham s sketching stool and said Young man do you know where this creature belongs I found her trying to commit suicide on the rifle range why Graham It was Doctor Haverford He grew a trifle less military then and borrowed some pipe tobacco He looked oddly younger Graham thought and rather self conscious of his uniform Every inch a soldier Graham he chuckled Still have to use a hook and eye at the bottom of the coat blouse he corrected himself But I m getting my waist line again How s the whoa he called as Elinor wrapped the rope around his carefully putted legs Infernal animal he grumbled I just paid a quarter to have these puttees shined How s the family Mother has gone to Linndale The house is finished Have you been here long sir Two weeks Hang it all Graham I wish I d let this creature commit suicide She s do you know Delight is here Here Why no At the hostess house said the chaplain proudly Doing her bit too missus Haverford wanted to come too and sew buttons on or something But I told her two out of three was a fair percentage I hear that Washington has sent for your father I hadn t heard He s a big man Graham We re going to hear from him Only I thought he looked tired when I saw him last Somebody ought to look after him a bit He was patiently untangling himself from Elinor s rope You know there are two kinds of people in the world those who look after themselves and those who look after others That s your father the last Graham s face clouded How true that was He knew now as he had not known before He was thinking clearly those days Hard work and nothing to drink had clarified his mind and he saw things at home as they really were Clayton s infinite patience his strength and his gentleness But he only said He has had a hard year He raised his eyes and looked at the chaplain I didn t help him any you know sir Well well that s all over now We ve just one thing to think of and that s to beat those German devils back to Berlin And then burn Berlin he added militantly The last Graham saw of him he was dragging Elinor down the road and a faint throaty humming came back which sounded suspiciously like Where do we go from here boys Where do we go from here Candidate Spencer took great pains with his toilet that afternoon He polished his shoes and shaved and he spent a half hour on some ten sadly neglected finger nails At retreat he stood at attention in the long line and watched the flag moving slowly and majestically to the stirring bugle notes Something swelled almost to bursting in his throat That was his flag He was going to fight for it And after that was done he was going to find some girl some nice girl the sort for instance that would leave her home to work in a hostess house And having found her he would marry her and love and cherish her all his life Unless of course she wouldn t have him He was inclined to think she wouldn t He ate very little supper that night little being a comparative term of course And then he went to discover Delight It appeared however that she had been already discovered She was entirely surrounded by uniforms and Graham furiously counted a colonel two majors and a captain Pulling rank of course he muttered and retired to a corner where he had at least the mild gratification of seeing that even the colonel could not keep Delight from her work Silly asses said Graham again and then she saw him There was no question about her being pleased She was quite flushed with it but a little uncomfortable too at Graham s attitude He was oddly humble and yet he had a look of determination that was almost grim She filled in a rather disquieting silence by trying to let him know without revealing that she had ever been anything else how proud she was of him Then she realized that he was not listening and that he was looking at her with an almost painful intensity When can you get away Delight he asked abruptly From here She cast an appraising glance over the room Right away I think Why Because I want to talk to you and I can t talk to you here She brought a bright colored sweater and he helped her into it still with his mouth set and his eyes a trifle sunken All about there were laughing groups of men in uniform Outside the parade glowed faintly in the dusk and from the low barrack windows there came the glow of lights the movement of young figures voices the thin metallic notes of a mandolin How strange it all is Delight said Here we are you and father and myself and even Jackson I saw him to day All here living different lives doing different things even thinking different thoughts It s as though we had all moved into a different world He walked on beside her absorbed in his own thoughts which were yet only of her I didn t know you were here he brought out finally That s because you ve been burying yourself I knew you were here Why didn t you send me some word She stiffened somewhat in the darkness I didn t think you would be greatly interested Graham And again struggling with his new humility he was silent It was not until they had crossed the parade ground and were beyond the noises of the barracks that he spoke again Do you mind if I talk to you Delight I mean about myself I since you re here we re likely to see each other now and then if you are willing And I d like to start straight Do you really want to tell me No But I ve got to That s all He told her He made no case for himself Indeed some of it Delight understood far better than he did himself He said nothing against Marion on the contrary he blamed himself rather severely And behind his honest halting sentences Delight read his own lack of understanding She felt infinitely older than this tall honest eyed boy in his stained uniform older and more sophisticated But if she had understood the Marion Hayden situation she was totally at a loss as to Anna But I don t understand she cried How could you make love to her if you didn t love her I don t know Fellows do those things It s just mischief some sort of a devil in them I suppose When he reached the beating and Anna s flight however she understood a little better Of course you had to stand by her she agreed You haven t heard it all he said quietly When I m through if you get up and leave me I ll understand Delight and I won t blame you He told her the rest of the story in a voice strained with anxiety It was as though he had come to a tribunal for judgment He spared her nothing the dinner at the road house with Rudolph at the window his visit to Anna s room and her subsequent disappearance She told the Department of Justice people that Rudolph found her that night and took her home She was a prisoner then poor little kid But she overheard her father and Rudolph plotting to blow up the mill That s where I came in Delight He was crazy at me He was a German of course and he might have done it anyhow But Rudolph told him a lot of lies about me and he did it When I think about it all and about Joey I m crazy She slipped her hand over his Of course they would have done it anyhow she said softly You aren t going to get up and go away Why should I she asked I only feel oh Graham how wretched you must have been Something in her voice made him sit up straighter He knew now that it had always been Delight always Only she had been too good for him She had set a standard he had not hoped to reach But now things were different He hadn t amounted to much in other things but he was a soldier now He meant to be a mighty good soldier And when he got his commission You won t mind then if I come in to see you now and then Mind Why Graham And you don t think I m quite hopeless do you There were tears in her eyes but she answered bravely I believe in you every minute But then I think I always have Like fun you have But although he laughed it was a shaky laugh Suddenly he stood up and shook himself He felt young and strong and extremely happy There had been a bad time but it was behind him now Ahead there lay high adventure and here beside him in the dusk was the girl of his heart She believed in him Work to do and a woman who believed in a fellow that was life Aren t you cold he asked and drew the gaudy sweater tenderly around her shoulders CHAPTER XLV The fact that Audrey Valentine conspicuous member of a conspicuous social group that she was had been working in the machine shop of the Spencer munitions works at the time of the explosion was in itself sufficient to rouse the greatest interest When a young reporter gathering human interest stories about the event from the pitiful wreckage in the hospitals happened on Clare Gould he got a feature story for the Sunday edition that made Audrey s own world reading it in bed or over its exquisite breakfast tables gasp with amazement For following up Clare s story he found that Audrey had done much more than run toward the telephone She had reached it had found the operator gone and had succeeded before the roof fell in on her in calling the fire department and in sending in a general alarm to all the hospitals The reporter found the night operator who had received the message He got a photograph of her too and from the society file an old one of Audrey very delicate and audacious and not greatly resembling the young woman who lay in her bed and read the article aloud between dismay and laughter to old Terry Mackenzie Good heavens Terry she said Listen I had heard the explosion but did not of course know what it was And then I got a signal and it was the Spencer plant A sweet Southern voice said very calmly Operator this is important Listen carefully There has been an explosion at the Spencer plant and the ruins are on fire There will probably be more explosions in a minute Send in a general fire alarm and then get all the ambulances and doctors Then there was another explosion and their lines went out of commission I am glad she is not dead She certainly had her nerve Fame at last Audrey said old Terry very gently It s shameless But she was a little pleased nevertheless Not at the publicity That was familiar enough But that when her big moment came she had met it squarely Terry was striding about the room His visits were always rather cyclonic He moved from chair to chair leaving about each one an encircling ring of cigaret ashes and carefully inspecting each new vase of flowers He stopped in front of a basket of exquisite small orchids Who sent this he demanded Rodney Page Doesn t it look like him He turned and stared at her What s come over Clayton Spencer Is he blind Blind About Rodney He s head over heels in love with Natalie Spencer God alone knows why I daresay it isn t serious He is always in love with somebody There s a good bit of talk I don t give a hang for either of them but I m fond of Clayton So are you Natalie s out in the country now and Rodney is there every week end It s a scandal that s all As for Natalie herself she ought to be interned as a dangerous pacifist She s a martyr in her own eyes Thank heaven there aren t many like her Audrey leaned back against her pillows I wonder Terry she said if you haven t shown me what to do next I might be able to reach some of the women like Natalie There are some of them and they ve got to learn that if they don t stand behind the men we re lost Fine he agreed Get em to knit less and write more letters cheerful letters Tell em to remember that by the time their man gets the letter the baby s tooth will be through There are a good many men in the army camps to day vicariously cutting teeth Get after em Audrey A worried man is a poor soldier After he had gone she had the nurse bring her paper and pencil and she wrote rather incoherently it is true her first appeal to the women of the country It was effective too Audrey was an effective person When Clayton came for his daily visit she had just finished it and was reading it over with considerable complacency I ve become an author Clay she said I think myself I m terribly good at it May I read it to you He listened gravely but with a little flicker of amusement in his eyes How like her it was to refuse to allow herself even time to get entirely well But when she finished he was thoughtful She had called it Slacker Women That was what Natalie was he had never put it into words before Natalie was a slacker He had never discussed Natalie s attitude toward the war with Audrey He rather thought she was entirely ignorant of it But her little article glowing with patriotism frank simple and convincing might have been written to Natalie herself It is very fine he said I rather think you have found yourself at last There aren t a lot of such women and I daresay they will be fewer all the time But they exist of course She glowed under his approval There was in all their meetings a sub current of sadness that they must be so brief that before long they must end altogether that they could not put into words the things that were in their eyes and their hearts After that first hour of her return to consciousness there had been no expressed tenderness between them The nurse sat in the room eternally knitting and Clayton sat near Audrey or read to her or like Terry wandered about the room But now and then Audrey enthroned like a princess on her pillows would find his eyes on her and such a hungry look in them that she would clench her hands And after such times she always said Now tell me about the mill Or about Washington where he was being summoned with increasing frequency Or about Graham Anything to take that look out of his eyes He told her all his plans he even brought the blue prints of the new plant and spread them out on the bed He was dreaming a great dream those days and Audrey knew it He was building again this time not for himself but for the nation After he had gone looking boyish and reluctant she would lie for a little while watching the door Perhaps he had forgotten something and would come back One day he did and was surprised to find her suddenly in tears You came back she said half hysterically You came back That was the only time in all those weeks that he kissed her The nurse had gone out and suddenly he caught her in his arms and held her to him He put her back very gently and she saw that he was pale I think I d better go now and not come back he said And for two long and endless days he did not come Then on the third he came very stiff and formal and with himself well in hand Audrey leaning back and watching him felt what a boy he was after all so determined to do the right thing so obvious with his blue prints and so self conscious In June she left the hospital and went to the country She had already made a little market for her work and she wanted to carry it on By that time too she knew that the break must come between Clayton and herself if it came at all No letters no anything Clay she said and he acquiesced quietly But the night she left the butler coming downstairs to investigate a suspicious sound found him restlessly pacing the library floor In August he went abroad and some time about the middle of the month while he was in London he received a cable from Graham He had been commissioned a first lieutenant in the infantry Clayton had been seeing war at first hand then and for a few moments he was fairly terrified On that first of August the Germans had used liquid fire for the first time thus adding a new horror Men in the trenches swept by it had been practically annihilated Attacks against it were practically suicide Already the year had seen the last of Kitchener s army practically destroyed and the British combing the country for new divisions In the deadly give and take of that summer where gains and losses were measured by yards the advantage was steadily on the German side and it would be a year before the small force of American regulars could be augmented to any degree by the great new army It was the darkest hour Following on the heels of Graham s cable came a hysterical one from Natalie Graham probably ordered abroad Implore you use influence with Washington He resorted to his old remedy when he was in trouble He walked the streets He tried to allow for Natalie s lack of exaltation by the nature of her life If she could have seen what he had seen surely she would have felt as he did that no sacrifice could be too great to end this cancer of the world But deep in his heart he knew that Natalie was Natalie Nothing would change her As it happened he passed Graham on the Atlantic There was a letter for him at the office a boyish exultant letter Dad dear I m married it began Married and off for France It is Delight of course It always was Delight altho I know that sounds queer And now I m off to kill a Hun or two More than that I hope I want two Germans for every poor devil they got at the works That s the minimum The maximum You ll look after Delight I know She has been perfectly bully but it s hard on her We were married two days ago and already I feel as though I ve always been married She s going on with the canteen work and I shall try not to be jealous She s popular And if you d seen the General when we were married you d have thought he was losing a daughter I wired Mother but she was too cut up about my leaving to come I wish she had for it was a strange sort of wedding The division was about to move and at the last minute five girls turned up to be married to fellows who were leaving They came from all over and believe me there was some excitement All day the General and Chaplain Haverford were fussing about licenses and those girls sat around and waited and looked droopy but sort of happy you know what I mean It was nine o clock in the evening before everything was ready Delight had trimmed up the little church which is in the camp and had a flag over the altar Then we had a multiple wedding Honestly The organ played a squeaky wedding march and we went in six couples The church was full of soldiers and I don t mind saying I was ready to shed tears We lined up and Doctor Haverford married us Delight says she is sure we are only one sixth married Quiet You never heard such quiet except for the General blowing his nose I think myself he was weeping and there was a rumor about the camp to that effect You know the flag over the altar and all that I tell you it made a fellow think Well I m going over now Quick work isn t it And to think that a few months ago I was hanging around the club and generally making a mess of life That s all over now thank God I m going to make good Try to buck mother up It s pretty hard for her It s hard for all women just waiting And while I know I m coming back safe and sound I d like to feel that you are going to keep an eye on Delight She s the most important thing in the world to me now Then scrawled in a corner he had added You ve been mighty fine with me always dad I was a good bit of a pup last winter If I make anything of myself at all it will be because I want to be like you Clayton sat for a long time with the letter in his hand The happiness and hope that fairly radiated from it cheered and warmed him He was nearly happy And it came to him then that while every man had the right to happiness only those achieved it who craved it for others and having craved it for them at last saw the realization of their longing CHAPTER XLVI Natalie had had a dull Spring With Graham s departure for camp she moved to the country house carrying with her vast amounts of luggage the innumerable thing large and small which were necessary for her comfort The installing of herself in her new and luxurious rooms gave her occupation for several days She liked her new environment She liked herself in it The rose colored taffetas of her bedroom brought out the delicacy of her skin The hangings of her bed small and draped reflected a faint color into her face and the morning inspection with a hand mirror which always followed her coffee showed her at her best instead of her worst Of her dressing room she was not so sure It s ivory paneled walls behind whose sliding panels were hung her gowns her silk and satin chiffon negligees her wraps and summer furs all the vast paraphernalia with which she armed herself as a knight with armor the walls seemed cold She hated old blue but old blue Rodney had insisted upon He had held a bit of the taffeta to her cheek It is delicious Natalie he said It makes your eyes as blue as the sea Always a decorator she had replied smiling And standing in her blue room the first day of her arrival and frowning at her reflection she remembered his reply Because I have no right with you to be anything else He had stopped for a moment and had absently folded and refolded the bit of blue silk Suddenly he said What do you think I am going to do now that our work together is done Have you ever thought about that Natalie You are coming often to enjoy your handiwork He had made an impulsive gesture I m not coming I ve been seeing too much of you as it is If you want the truth I m just wretchedly unhappy Natalie You know I m in love with you don t you I believe you think you are Don t laugh He almost snarled I may laugh at my idiocy but you haven t any right to I know I m ridiculous I ve known it for months But it s pretty serious for me He had meant it There could be no doubt of that It is the curious quality of very selfish women that they inspire a certain sort of love They are likely to be loved often even tho the devotion they inspire is neither deep nor lasting Big and single hearted women are loved by one man and that forever Natalie had not laughed but she had done what was almost as bad She had patted him on the arm Don t talk like that she said gently You are all I have now Rodney and I don t want to lose you I m suffering horribly these days You re my greatest comfort I ve heard you say that of a chair As for loving me you must not talk like that Under the circumstances it s indelicate Oh he had said and looked at her quickly I can love you but it s indelicate to tell you about it I am married Rodney Good God do you think I ever forget it There was a real change in their relationship but neither of them understood it The change was that Rodney was no longer playing Little by little he had dropped his artistic posing for her benefit his cynical cleverness his adroit simulation of passion He no longer dramatized himself because rather often he forgot himself entirely His passion had ceased to be spurious and it was none the less real because he loved not a real woman but one of his own artistic creation He saw in Natalie a misunderstood and suffering woman bearing the burdens he knew of with dignity and a certain beauty And behind her slightly theatrical silences he guessed at other griefs nobly borne and only gently intimated He developed after a time a certain suspicion of Clayton not of his conduct but of his character These big men were often hard It was that quality which made them successful They married tender gentle girls and then repressed and trampled on them Natalie became in his mind a crushed and broken thing infinitely lonely and pathetic And without in the least understanding Natalie instinctively knew it was when she was wistful and dependent that he found her most attractive and became wistful and dependent to a point that imposed even on herself I ve been very selfish with you Rodney dear she said lifting sad eyes to his I am going to be better You must come often this summer and I ll have some nice girls for you to play with Thank you he said stiffly We ll have to be as gay as we can she sighed I m just a little dreary these days you know It was rather absurd that they were in a shop and that the clerk should return just then with curtain cords and that the discussion of certain shades of yellow made an anti climax to it all But in the car later he turned to her roughly You needn t ask any girls for me he said I only want one woman and if I can t have her I don t want any one At first the very fact that he could not have her had been unconsciously the secret of her attraction She was a perfect thing and unattainable He could sigh for her with longing and perfect safety But as time went on with that incapacity of any human emotion to stand still but either to go on or to go back his passion took on a more human and less poetic aspect She satisfied him less and he wanted more For one thing he dreamed that strange dream of mankind of making ice burn of turning snow to fire The old chimera of turning the cold woman to warmth through his own passion began to obsess him Sometimes he watched Natalie and had strange fancies He saw her lit from within by a fire which was not the reflection of his but was recklessly her own How wonderful she would be he thought And at those times he had wild visions of going away with her into some beautiful wilderness and there teaching her what she had missed in life But altho now he always wanted her he was not always thinking of a wilderness It was in his own world that he wanted her to fit beautifully into his house to move exquisitely dressed through ball rooms beside him He wanted her at those times as the most perfect of all his treasures He was still a collector The summer only served to increase his passion During the long hot days when Clayton was abroad or in Washington or working late at night as he frequently did how they were much together Natalie s plans for gayety had failed dismally The city and the country houses near were entirely lacking in men She found it a real grievance I don t know what we are coming to she complained The country club is like a girl s boarding school I wish to heaven the war was over and things were sensible again So during his week end visits they spent most of the time together There were always girls there and now and then a few men who always explained immediately that they had been turned down for the service or were going in the fall I m sure somebody has to stay home and attend to things here she said to him one August night But even when they are in America they are rushing about pretending to do things One would think to see Clayton that he is the entire government It s absurd I wish I could go he said unexpectedly Don t be idiotic You re much too old Not as old as Clay Oh Clay He s in a class by himself She laughed lightly Where is he now In France I think Probably telling them how to run the war When is he coming back I don t know What do you mean by wishing you could go Do you want me to tell you the truth Not if it s disagreeable Well I will and it s not very agreeable I can t keep this up Natalie I can t keep on coming here being in Clayton s house and eating his bread while I m in love with his wife It isn t decent He flung away his cigaret and bent forward Don t you see that he asked gently Not while he is working for the country and Graham is abroad I don t see why war needs to deprive me of my friends I ve lost everything else His morals were matters of his private life and they had been neither better nor worse than the average But he had breeding and a sure sense of the fitness of things and this present week end visit with the ostentatious care the younger crowd took to allow him time to see Natalie alone was galling to him It put him in a false position what hurt more perhaps in an unfavorable light The war had changed standards too Men were being measured especially by women and those who failed to measure up were being eliminated with cruel swiftness especially the men who stayed at home With all this too there was a growing admiration for Clayton Spencer in their small circle His name had been mentioned in connection with an important position in Washington In the clubs there was considerable praise and some envy And Rodney knew that his affair with Natalie was the subject of much invidious comment Do you love him he asked suddenly I why of course I do Do you mean that I don t see what that has to do with our friendship Oh friendship You know how I feel and yet you go on bringing up that silly word If you love him you don t love me and yet you ve let me hang around all these months knowing I am mad about you You don t play the game Natalie What do you want to say If you don t love Clayton why don t you tell him so He s honest enough And I miss my guess if he wants a wife who cares for somebody else She sat in the dusk thinking and he watched her She looked very lovely in the setting which he himself had designed for her She hated change she loathed trouble of any sort And she was those days just a little afraid of that strange quiet Clayton who seemed eternally engrossed in war and the things of war She glanced about at the white trellises that gleamed in the garden at the silvery fleur de lis which was the fountain at all the lovely things with which Clayton s wealth had allowed her to surround herself And suddenly she knew she could not give them up I don t see why you have to spoil everything she said fretfully It had been so perfect Of course I m not going to say anything to Clay He has enough to worry him now she added virtuously Suddenly Rodney stooped and kissed her almost savagely Then I m going he said And to her great surprise he went Alone in his room up stairs Rodney had in his anger a glimpse of insight He saw her her life filled with small emotions lacking the courage for big ones He saw her like a child clutching one piece of cake and holding out a hand for another He saw her taking always giving never She s not worth it he muttered On the way to the station he reflected bitterly over the past year He did not blame her so much as he blamed himself He had been playing a game an attractive game During the first months of it his interest in Natalie had been subordinate to his interest in her house He had been creating a beautiful thing and he had had a very real joy in it But lately he knew that his work on the house had been that he might build a background for Natalie He had put into it the best of his ability and she was not worth it For some days he neither wrote nor called her up He was not happy but he had a sense of relief He held his head a trifle higher was his own man again and he began to make tentative inquiries as to whether he could be useful in the national emergency or not He was half hearted at first but he found out something The mere fact that he wanted to work in some capacity brought back some of his old friends They had seemed to drop away before but they came back heartily and with hands out Work said Terry Mackenzie at the club one day looking up from the billiard table where he was knocking balls about rather at haphazard Why of course you can work What about these new cantonments we re building all over the country You ought to be useful there They don t want em pretty tho And Terry had laughed But he put down his cue and took Rodney by the arm Let s ask Nolan about it he said He s in the reading room tearing the British strategy to pieces He knows everything these days from the draft law to the month s shipping losses Come along It was from Nolan however that Rodney first realized how seriously Clayton s friends were taking his affair with Natalie and that not at first from anything he said It was an indefinable aloofness of manner a hostility of tone Nolan never troubled himself to be agreeable unless it suited his inclination and apparently Terry found nothing unusual in his attitude But Rodney did Something he could build said Nolan repeating Terry s question How do I know There s a lot of building going on Page but it s not exactly your sort And there was a faint note of contempt in his voice Who would be the man to see in Washington Rodney inquired I ll look it up and let you know You might call me up to morrow Old Terry having got them together went back to his billiards and left them Nolan sat down and picked up his paper with an air of ending the interview But he put it down again as Rodney turned to leave the room Page Yes D you mind having a few minutes talk Rodney braced himself Not at all But Nolan was slow to begin He sat newspaper on his knee his deep set eyes thoughtful When he began it was slowly I am one of Clay Spencer s oldest friends he said He s a white man the whitest man I know Naturally anything that touches him touches me in a way Well The name stands for a good bit too His father and his grandfather were the same sort It s not often in this town that we have three generations without a breath of scandal against them Rodney flushed angrily What has that got to do with me he demanded I don t know I don t want to know I simply wanted to tell you that there are a good many of us who take a peculiar pride in Clayton Spencer and who resent anything that reflects on a name we respect rather highly That sounds like a threat Not at all I was merely calling your attention to something I thought perhaps you had forgotten Then he got up and his tone changed became brisk almost friendly Now about this building thing If you re in earnest I think it can be managed You won t get any money to speak of you know I don t want any money sullenly Fine You ll probably have to go west somewhere and you ll be set down in the center of a hundred corn fields and told to make them overnight into a temporary town I suppose you ve thought of all that I ll go wherever I m sent Come along to the telephone then Rodney hesitated He felt cheap and despicable and his anger was still hot They wanted to get him out of town He saw that They took little enough trouble to hide it Well he would go He wanted to go anyhow and he would show them something too if he got a chance He would show them that he was as much a man as Clayton Spencer He eyed Nolan s insolently slouching figure with furious eyes But he followed him Had he secured an immediate appointment things might have been different for him Like Chris Valentine he had had one decent impulse and like Chris too there was a woman behind it But Chris had been able to act on his impulse at once and Rodney was compelled to wait while the mills of the government ground slowly Then on the fourteenth of August Natalie telegraphed him Have had bad news about Graham Can you come He thought of Graham ill possibly dead and he took the next train late in the evening It was mid week and Natalie was alone He had thought of that possibility in the train and he was miserably uncomfortable with all his joy at the prospect of seeing her again He felt that the emergency must be his justification Clayton was still abroad and even his most captious critics would admit that Natalie should have a friend by if she were in trouble Visions of Graham wounded filled his mind He was anxious restless and in a state of the highest nervous tension And there was no real emergency He found Natalie in the drawing room pacing the floor She was still in her morning dress and her eyes were red and swollen She gave him both her hands and he was surprised to find them cold as ice I knew you would come she said I am so alone so terrified He could hardly articulate What is it Graham has been ordered abroad He stood still staring at her and then he dropped her hands Is that all he asked dully No Good heavens Natalie Tell me I ve been frantic with anxiety about you He was married to night to Delight Haverford And still he stared at her Then he s not hurt or ill I didn t say he was Good gracious Rodney isn t that bad enough But what did you expect He would have to go abroad some time You knew that I m sorry but why in God s name didn t you say in your wire what the trouble was You sound exactly like Clay She was entirely incapable of understanding She stood before him straight and resentful and yet strangely wistful and appealing I send you word that my only son is going to France that he has married without so much as consulting me that he is going to war and may never come back I needed you and you said once that when I needed you wherever you were you would come So I sent for you and now you act like like Clay Have you any one here The servants Good gracious Rodney are you worrying about that Only for you Natalie We resent anything that reflects on a name we respect rather highly That was what Nolan had said I m sorry about Graham dearest I am sorry about any trouble that comes to you You know that Natalie I m only regretful that you have let me place you in an uncomfortable position If my being here is known Look here Natalie dear I hate to bother you but I ll have to take one of the cars and go back to the city to night Aren t you being rather absurd He hesitated He could not tell her of that awkward talk with Nolan There were many things he would not tell her his own desire to rehabilitate himself among the men he knew his own new born feeling that to take advantage of Clayton s absence on business connected with the war was peculiarly indefensible I shall order the car at once she said and touched a bell When she turned he was just behind her but altho he held out his arms she evaded them her eyes hard and angry I wish you would try to understand he said I do very thoroughly Too thoroughly You are afraid for yourself not for me I am in trouble but that is a secondary consideration Don t bother about me Rodney I have borne a great deal alone in my life and I can bear this She turned and went with considerable dignity out of the door Natalie he called But he heard her with a gentle rustle of silks going up the staircase It did not add to his comfort that she had left him to order the car All through the night Rodney rode and thought He was angry at Natalie but he was angrier at himself He felt that he had been brutal unnecessarily callous After all her only son was on his way to war It was on the cards that he might not come back And he had let his uneasiness dominate his sympathy He had lost her but then he had never had her He never could have her Half way to town on a back road the car broke down and after vainly endeavoring to start it the chauffeur set off on foot to secure help Rodney slept uncomfortably and wakened with the movement of the machine to find it broad day That was awkward for Natalie s car was conspicuous marked too with her initials He asked to be set down at a suburban railway station and was dismayed to find it crowded with early commuters who stared at the big car with interest On the platform eyeing him with unfriendly eyes was Nolan Rodney made a movement toward him The situation was intolerable absurd But Nolan turned his back and proceeded to read his newspaper Perhaps not in years had Rodney Page faced the truth about himself so clearly as he did that morning riding into the city on the train which carried somewhere ahead that quietly contemptuous figure that was Denis Nolan Faced the truth saw himself for what he was and loathed the thing he saw For a little time too it was given him to see Natalie for what she was for what she would always be her sole contribution to life the web of her selfishness carefully woven floating apparently aimlessly and yet snaring and holding relentlessly whatever it touched Killing freedom He saw Clayton and Graham and himself feeders for her monstrous complacency and vanity and he made a definite determination to free himself I m through he reflected savagely I ll show them something too I ll He hesitated How lovely she was And she cared for him She was small and selfish and unspeakably vain but she cared for him The war had done something for Rodney Page He no longer dreamed the old dream of turning her ice to fire But he dreamed for a moment something finer He saw Natalie his and growing big and fine through love He saw himself and Natalie like cards in the game of life re dealt A new combination a winning hand CHAPTER XLVII Very quietly Audrey had taken herself out of Clayton s life She sent him a little note of farewell We have had ten very wonderful months Clay she wrote We ought to be very happy So few have as much And we both know that this can t go on I am going abroad I have an opportunity to go over and see what Englishwomen are doing in the way of standing behind their men at war Then I am to tell our women at home Not that they need it now bless them I believe you will be glad to know that I am to be on the same side of the ocean with Graham I could get to him I think if anything should go wrong Will you send him the enclosed address But my dear the address is for him not for you You must not write to me I have used up every particle of moral courage I possess as it is And I am holding this in my mind as you must Time is a great healer of all wounds We could have been happy together oh my dear so very happy together Now that I am going let me be frank for once I have given you the finest thing I am capable of I am better for caring for you as I have as I do But those days in the hospital told me we couldn t go on Things like that don t stand still Maybe we are only human Clay maybe if the old days were still here we might have compromised with life I don t know But I do know that we never will now After all we have had a great deal and we still have It is a wonderful thing to know that somewhere in the world is some one person who loves you To waken up in the morning to it To go to sleep remembering it And to have kept that love fine and clean is a wonderful thing too I am not always on a pinnacle There have been plenty of times when the mere human want of you has sent me to the dust Is it wrong to tell you that But of course not You know it But you and I know this Clay dear Love that is hopeless that can not end in marriage does one of two things Either it degrades or it exalts It leaves its mark always but that mark does not need to be a stain Clayton lived for a time after that in a world very empty and very full The new plant was well under way Not only was he about to make shells for the government at a nominal profit but Washington was asking him to assume new and wide responsibilities He accepted He wanted so to fill the hours that there would be no time to remember But more than that he was actuated by a fine and glowing desire to serve Perhaps underlying it all was the determination to be in every way the man Audrey thought him to be And there was too a square jawed resolution to put behind Graham and other boys like Graham all the shells and ammunition they needed He worked hard more than hard Old Terry meeting him one day in the winter that followed was shocked at his haggard face Better take a little time off Clay he suggested We re going to Miami next week How about ten days or so Fishing is good this year Can t very well take a holiday just now Too much to do Terry Old Terry went home and told his wife Looks like the devil he said He ll go down sick one of these days I suppose it s no use telling Natalie None whatever said missus Terry And anyhow it s a thing I shouldn t care to tell Natalie What do you mean not care to tell Natalie Hard work doesn t make a man forget how to smile Oh come now He s cheerful enough If you mean because Graham s fighting That s only part of it said missus Terry sagely and relapsed into one of the poignant silences that drove old Terry to a perfect frenzy of curiosity Then in January of nineteen eighteen a crisis came to Clayton and Natalie Spencer Graham was wounded Clayton was at home when the news came Natalie had been having one of her ill assorted meticulously elaborate dinner parties and when the guests had gone they were for a moment alone in the drawing room of their town house Clayton was fighting in himself the sense of irritation Natalie s dinners always left especially the recent ones She was serving he knew too much food In the midst of the agitation on conservation her dinners ran their customary seven courses There was too much wine too But it occurred to him that only the wine had made the dinner endurable Then he tried to force himself into better humor Natalie was as she was and if in an unhappy struggling dying world she found happiness in display God knew there was little enough happiness He was not at home very often He could not spoil her almost childish content in the small things that made up her life I think it was very successful she said surveying herself in one of the corner mirrors Do you like my gown Clay It s very lovely It s new I ve been getting some clothes Clay You ll probably shriek at the bills But all this talk about not buying clothes is nonsense you know The girls who work in the shops have to live Naturally Of course there is other work open to them now In munition plants I daresay To be blown up He winced The thought of that night the year before when the plant went still turned him sick Don t buy too many things my dear he said gently You know how things are I know it s your fault that they are as they are she persisted Oh I know it was noble of you and all that The country s crazy about you But still I think it was silly Every one else is making money out of things and you a lot of thanks you ll get when the war s over I don t particularly want thanks Then the door bell rang in the back of the house and Buckham answered it He was conscious at once that Natalie stiffened and that she was watchful and a trifle pale Buckham brought in a telegram on a tray Give it to me Buckham Natalie said in a strained voice And held out her hand for it When she saw it was for Clayton however she relaxed As he tore it open Clayton was thinking Evidently Natalie had been afraid of his seeing some message for her Was it possible that Natalie He opened it After what seemed a long time he looked up Her eyes were on him Don t be alarmed my dear he said It is not very bad But Graham has been slightly wounded Sit down he said sharply as he saw her sway You are lying to me she said in a dreadful voice He s dead He is not dead Natalie He tried to put her into a chair but she resisted him fiercely Let me alone I want to see that telegram And very reluctantly at last he gave it to her Graham was severely wounded It was from a man in his own department at Washington who had just seen the official list The nature of his wounding had not been stated Natalie looked up from the telegram with a face like a painted mask This is your doing she said You wanted him to go You sent him into this He will die and you will have murdered him The thought came to him in that hour of stress that she was right Pitifully damnably right He had not wanted Graham to go but he had wanted him to want to go A thousand thoughts flashed through his mind of Delight sleeping somewhere quietly after her day s work at the camp of Graham himself of that morning after the explosion and his frank pitiful confession And again of Graham suffering perhaps dying and with none of his own about him And through it all was the feeling that he must try to bring Natalie to reason that it was incredible that she should call him his own son s murderer We must not think of his dying he said We must only think that he is going to live and to come back to us Natalie dear She flung off the arm he put around her And that he went on feeling for words out of the dreadful confusion in his mind if the worst comes that he has done a magnificent thing There is no greater thing Natalie That won t bring him back to us she said still in that frozen voice And suddenly she burst into hard terrible crying All that night he sat outside her door for she would not allow him to come in He had had Washington on the telephone but when at last he got the connection it was to learn that no further details were known Toward dawn there came the official telegram from the War Department but it told nothing more Natalie was hysterical He had sent for a doctor and with Madeleine in attendance the medical man had worked over her for hours Going out toward morning he had found Clayton in the hall and had looked at him sharply Better go to bed mister Spencer he advised It may not be as bad as you think And they re doing fine surgery over there And as Clayton shook his head missus Spencer will come round all right She s hysterical naturally She ll be sending for you before long With the dawn Clayton s thoughts cleared If he and Natalie were ever to get together at all it should be now with this common grief between them Perhaps after all it was not too late to re build his house of life He had failed Perhaps they had both failed but the real responsibility was his Inside the room he could hear her moaning a low monotonous heart breaking moan He was terribly sorry for her She had no exaltation to help her no strength of soul no strength of any sort And as men will under stress he tried to make a bargain with his God Let him live he prayed Bring him back to us and I will try again I ll do better I ve been a rotten failure as far as she is concerned But I ll try He felt somewhat better after that altho he felt a certain ignominy too that always until such a time he had gone on his own as it were and that now when he no longer sufficed for himself he should beseech the Almighty Natalie had had a sleeping powder and at last he heard her moaning cease and the stealthy movements of her maid as she lowered the window shades It was dawn During the next two days Clayton worked as he never had worked before still perhaps with that unspoken pact in mind Worked too to forget He had sent several cables but no reply came until the third day He did not sleep at night He did not even go to bed He sat in the low chair in his dressing room dozing occasionally to waken with a start at some sound in the hall Now and again as the trained nurse who was watching Natalie at night moved about the hallways he would sit up expecting a summons that did not come She still refused to see him It depressed and frightened him for how could he fulfill his part of the compact when she so sullenly shut him out of her life He was singularly simple in his fundamental beliefs There was a Great Power somewhere call it what one might and it dealt out justice or mercy as one deserved it On that of course had been built an elaborate edifice of creed and dogma but curiously enough it all fell away now He was in those night hours again the boy who had prayed for fair weather for circus day and had promised in return to read his Bible through during the next year And had done it In the daytime however he was a man suffering terribly and facing the complexities of his life alone One thing he knew This was decisive Either under the stress of a common trouble he and Natalie would come together to make the best they could of the years to come or they would be hopelessly alienated But that was secondary to Graham Everything was secondary to Graham indeed He had cabled Audrey and he drew a long breath when on the third day a cable came from her She had located Graham at last He had been shot in the chest and there were pneumonia symptoms Shall stay with him she ended and shall send daily reports Next to his God he put his faith in Audrey Almost he prayed to her Dunbar now a captain in the Military Intelligence Bureau visiting him in his office one day found Clayton s face an interesting study Old lines of repression new ones of anxiety marked him deeply The boy of course he thought And then reflected that it takes time to carve such lines as were written in the face of the man across the desk from him Time and a woman he considered shrewdly His mind harked back to that dinner in the Spencer house when diplomatic relations had been broken off with Germany and war seemed imminent It was the wife probably He remembered that she had been opposed to war and to the boy s going There were such women in the country There were fewer of them all the time but they existed women who saw in war only sacrifice Women who counted no cost too high for peace If they only hurt themselves it did not matter but they could and did do incredible damage Clayton was going through some papers he had brought and Dunbar had time to consider what to him was an interesting problem missus Spencer had kept the boy from immediate enlistment He had wanted to go Dunbar knew that If she had allowed him to go the affair with Anna Klein would have been ended He knew all that story now Then if there had been no affair Herman would not have blown up the munition works and a good many lives valuable to themselves at least might have been saved Curious he reflected One woman And she probably sleeps well at nights and goes to church on Sundays Clayton passed back his papers and ran a hand over his heavy hair They seem to be all right he said Dunbar rose Hope the next news will be better mister Spencer I hope so I haven t told you I think that we have traced Rudolph Klein Clayton s face set He s got away unfortunately Over the border into Mexico They have a regular system there the Germans an underground railway to Mexico City They have a paymaster on our side of the line They even bank in one of our banks Oh we ll get them yet of course but they re damnably clever I suppose there is no hope of getting Rudolph Klein Not while the Germans are running Mexico Captain Dunbar replied dryly He s living in a Mexican town just over the border We re watching him If he puts a foot on this side we ll grab him Clayton sat back after he had gone He was in his old office at the mill where Joey had once formed his unofficial partnership with the firm Outside in the mill yard there was greater activity than ever but many of the faces were new The engineer who had once run the yard engine was building bridges in France Hutchinson had heard the call and was learning to fly in Florida The service flag over his office door showed hundreds of stars and more were being added constantly Joey dead Graham wounded his family life on the verge of disruption and Audrey Then out of the chaos there came an exaltation He had given himself his son the wealth he had hoped to have but thank God he had had something to give There were men who could give nothing like old Terry Mackenzie knocking billiard balls around at the club and profanely wistful that he had had no son to go His mind ranged over those pathetic prosperous sonless men who filed into the club late in the afternoons and over the last editions and whisky and sodas fought their futile warfare their battle ground a newspaper map their upraised voices their only weapons On parade days when the long lines of boys in khaki went by they were silent heavy inutile They were too old to fight The biggest thing in their lives was passing them by as passed the lines of marching boys and they had no part in it They were feeding their hungry spirits on the dregs of war on committee meetings and public gatherings and they were being useful But the great exaltation of offering their best was not for them He was living a tragedy but a greater tragedy was that of the childless And back of that again was the woman who had not wanted children There were many men to day who were feeling the selfishness of a woman at home men who had lost somehow their pride their feeling of being a part of great things Men who went home at night to comfortable dwellings with no vacant chair at the table and dined in a peace they had not earned Natalie had at least given him a son He took that thought home with him in the evening He stopped at a florist s and bought a great box of flowers for her and sent them into her room with a little note Won t you let me come in and try to comfort you But Madeleine brought the box out again and there was pity in her eyes missus Spencer can not have them in the room sir She says the odor of flowers makes her ill He knew Madeleine had invented the excuse that Natalie had simply rejected his offering He went down stairs and made a pretense of dining alone in the great room It was there that Audrey s daily cable found him Buckham brought it in in shaking fingers and stood by white and still while he opened it Clayton stood up He was very white but his voice was full and strong He is better Buckham Better Suddenly Buckham was crying His austere face was distorted his lean body trembling Clayton put his arm around the bowed old shoulders And in that moment as they stood there master and man Clayton Spencer had a flash of revelation There was love and love The love of a man for a woman and of a woman for a man of a mother for the child at her knee of that child for its mother But that the great actuating motive of a man s maturity of the middle span was vested along with his dreams his pride and his love in his son his man child Buckham carrying his coffee into the library somewhat later found him with his head down on his desk and the cablegram clutched in his outstretched hands He tip toed out very quietly CHAPTER XLVIII Clayton s first impulse was to take the cable to Natalie to brush aside the absurd defenses she had erected and behind which she cowered terrified but obstinate To say to her He is living He is going to live But this war is not over yet If we want him to come through we must stand together We must deserve to have him come back to us But by the time he reached the top of the stairs he knew he could not do it She would not understand She would think he was using Graham to further a reconciliation and after her first joy was over he knew that he would see again that cynical smile that always implied that he was dramatizing himself Nothing could dim his strong inner joy but something of its outer glow faded He would go to her later Not now Nothing must spoil this great thankfulness of his He gave Madeleine the cable and went down again to the library After a time he began to go over the events of the past eighteen months His return from the continent and that curious sense of unrest that had followed it the opening of his eyes to the futility of his life His failure to Natalie and her failure to him Graham made a man by war and by the love of a good woman Chris ending his sordid life in a blaze of glory and forever forgiven his tawdry sins because of his one big hour War took but it gave also It had taken Joey for instance but Joey had had his great moment It was better to have one great moment and die than to drag on through useless years And it was the same way with a nation A nation needed its hour It was only in a crisis that it could know its own strength How many of them who had been at that dinner of Natalie s months before had met their crisis bravely Nolan was in France now Doctor Haverford was at the front Audrey was nursing Graham Marion Hayden was in a hospital training School Rodney Page was still building wooden barracks in a cantonment in Indiana and was making good He himself They could never go back none of them to the old smug complacent luxurious days They could no more go back than Joey could return to life again War was the irrevocable step as final as death itself And he remembered something Nolan had said just before he sailed We have had one advantage Clay Or maybe it is not an advantage after all Do you realize that you and I have lived through the Golden Age We have seen it come and seen it go The greatest height of civilization since the world began the greatest achievements the most opulent living And we saw it all crash It will be a thousand years before the world will be ready for another And later I suppose every life has its Golden Age Generally we think it is youth I m not so sure Youth is looking ahead It has its hopes and its disappointments The Golden Age in a man s life ought to be the age of fulfillment It s nearer the forties than the twenties Have you reached it I m going to on the other side And Clayton had smiled You are going to reach it he said We are always going to find it Nolan It is always just ahead And Nolan had given him one of his quick understanding glances There could be no Golden Age for him For the Golden Age for a man meant fulfillment The time came to every man when he must sit at the west window of his house of life and look toward the sunset If he faced that sunset alone He heard Madeleine carrying down Natalie s dinner tray and when she left the pantry she came to the door of the library missus Spencer would like to see you sir Thank you Madeleine I ll go up very soon Suddenly he knew that he did not want to go up to Natalie s scented room She had shut him out when she was in trouble She had not cared that he too was in distress She had done her best to invalidate that compact he had made She had always invalidated him To go back to the old way to the tribute she enforced to feed her inordinate vanity to the old hypocrisy of their relationship to live again the old lie was impossible He got up He would not try to buy himself happiness at the cost of turning her adrift But he must some way buy his self respect He heard her then on the staircase that soft rustle which it seemed to him had rasped the silk of his nerves all their years together with its insistence on her dainty helplessness her femininity her right to protection The tap of her high heels came closer He drew a long breath and turned determinedly smiling to face the door Almost at once he saw that she was frightened She had taken pains to look her best but then she always did that She was rouged to the eyes and the floating white chiffon of her negligee gave to her slim body the illusion of youth that last illusion to which she so desperately clung But she was frightened She stood in the doorway one hand holding aside the heavy velvet curtain and looked at him with wide penciled eyes Clay Yes Come in Shall I have Buckham light a fire She came in slowly Do you suppose that cable is reliable I should think so He may have a relapse We mustn t worry about what may come He is better now The chances are that he ll stay better Probably I suppose because I have been so ill He felt the demand for sympathy but he had none to give And he felt something else Natalie was floundering an odd word for her always so sure of herself She was frightened unsure of herself and floundering Why Are you going to be in to night Yes She gave a curious little gesture Then she evidently made up her mind and she faced him defiantly Of course if I had known he was going to be better I d Clay I wired yesterday for Rodney Page He arrives to night Rodney Yes I don t think I quite understand Natalie Why did you wire for him You wouldn t understand of course I was in trouble He has been my best friend I tried to bear it alone but I couldn t I Alone You wouldn t see me I couldn t Clay Why Because if Graham had died Her mouth trembled She put her hand to her throat You would have blamed me for his death Yes Then even now if Yes The sheer cruelty of it sent him pale Yet it was not so much deliberate as unconscious She was forcing herself to an unwonted honesty It was her honest conviction that he was responsible for Graham s wounding and danger Let me get to the bottom of this he said quietly You hold me responsible Very well How far does that take us How far does that take you To Rodney You needn t be brutal Rodney understands me He he cares for me Clay I see And since you sent for him I take it you care for Rodney I don t know I Isn t it time you do know For God s sake Natalie make up your mind to some course and stick to it But accustomed as he was to the curious turns of her mind he was still astounded to have her turn on him and accuse him of trying to get rid of her It was not until later that he realized in that attitude of hers her old instinct of shifting the responsibility from her own shoulders And then Rodney was announced The unreality of the situation persisted Rodney s strained face and uneasy manner his uniform the blank pause when he had learned that Graham was better and when the ordinary banalities of greeting were over Beside Clayton he looked small dapper and wretchedly uncomfortable and yet even Clayton had to acknowledge a sort of dignity in the man He felt sorry for him for the disillusion that was to come And at the same time he felt an angry contempt for him that he should have forced so theatrical a situation That the night which saw Graham s beginning recovery should be tarnished by the wild clutch after happiness of two people who had done so little to earn it He saw another totally different scene for a moment He saw Graham in his narrow bed that night in some dimly lighted hospital ward and he saw Audrey beside him watching and waiting and praying A wild desire to be over there one of that little group almost overcame him And instead Natalie has not been well Rodney he said I rather think if you have anything to say to me we would better talk alone Natalie went out her draperies trailing behind her Clayton listened as she moved slowly up the stairs For the last time he heard that soft rustling which had been the accompaniment to so many of the most poignant hours of his life He listened until it had died away CHAPTER XLIX For months Rudolph Klein had been living in a little Mexican town on the border There were really two towns but they were built together with only a strip of a hundred feet between Along this strip ran the border itself with a tent pitched on the American side and patrols of soldiers guarding it The American side was bright and clean orderly and self respecting but only a hundred feet away unkempt dusty with adobe buildings and a notorious gambling hell in plain view was Mexico itself leisurely improvident not overscrupulous Mexico At first Rudolph was fairly contented It amused him He liked the idleness of it He liked kicking the innumerable Mexican dogs out of his way He liked baiting the croupiers in the Owl He liked wandering into that notorious resort and shoving Hindus Chinamen and Mexicans out of the way while he flung down a silver dollar and watched the dealers with cunning avaricious eyes He liked his own situation too It amused him to think that here he was safe while only a hundred feet away he was a criminal fugitive from the law He liked to go to the very border itself and jeer at the men on guard there If I was on that side he would say you d have me in one of those rotten uniforms wouldn t you Come on over fellows The liquor s fine Then one day a Chinaman he had insulted gave him an unexpected shove and he had managed to save himself by a foot from the clutch of a quiet faced man in plain clothes who spent a certain amount of time lounging on the other side of the border That had sobered him He kept away from the border itself after that although the temptation of it drew him After a few weeks when the novelty had worn off he began to hunger for the clean little American town across the line He wanted to talk to some one He wanted to boast to be candid These Mexicans only laughed when he bragged to them But he dared not cross There was a high fenced enclosure behind the Owl the segregated district of the town There in tiny one roomed houses built in rows like barracks were the girls and women who had drifted to this jumping off place of the world In the daytime they slept or sat on the narrow ramshackle porches untidy noisy unspeakably wretched At night however they blossomed forth in tawdry finery in the dancing space behind the gambling tables Some of them were fixtures They had drifted there from New Orleans perhaps or southern California and they lacked the initiative or the money to get away But most of them came in stayed a month or two found the place a nightmare with its shootings and stabbings and then disappeared At first Rudolph was popular in this hell of the underworld He spent money easily he danced well he had audacity and a sort of sardonic humor They asked no questions those poor wretches who had themselves slid over the edge of life They took what came grateful for little pleasures glad even to talk their own tongue And then one broiling August day late in the afternoon when the compound was usually seething with the first fetid life of the day Rudolph found it suddenly silent when he entered it and hostile contemptuous eyes on him A girl with Anna Klein s eyes a girl he had begun to fancy suddenly said Draft dodger There was a ripple of laughter around the compound They commenced to bait him those women he would not have wiped his feet on at home They literally laughed him out of the compound He went home to his stifling windowless adobe room with its sagging narrow bed its candle its broken crockery and he stood in the center of the room and chewed his nails with fury After a time he sat down and considered what to do next He would have to move on some time As well now as ever He was sick of the place He began preparations to move on gathering up the accumulation of months of careless living for destruction He picked up some newspapers preparatory to throwing them away and a name caught his attention Standing there inside his doorway in the Mexican dusk he read of Graham s recent wounding his mending and the fact that he had won the Croix de Guerre Supreme bitterness was Rudolph s then Stage stuff he muttered But in the depths of his warped soul there was bitter envy He knew well with what frightened yet adoring eyes Anna Klein had devoured that news of Graham Spencer While for him there was the girl in the compound back of the Owl with Anna Klein s eyes filled when she looked at him with that bitterest scorn of all the contempt of the wholly contemptible That night he went to the Owl He had shaved and had his hair cut and he wore his only remaining decent suit of clothes He passed through the swinging gate in the railing which separated the dancing floor from the tables and went up to the line of girls sitting in that saddest waiting of all the world along the wall There was an ominous silence at his approach He planted himself in front of the girl with eyes like Anna Klein Are you going to dance Not with you she replied evenly And again the ripple of laughter spread Why not Because you re a coward she said I d rather dance with a Chinaman If you think I m here because I m afraid to fight you can think again Not that I care what you think He had meant to boast a little to intimate that he had pulled off a big thing but he saw that he was ridiculous The situation infuriated him Suddenly he burst into foul mouthed invective until one of the girls said wearily Oh cut that out you slacker And he knew that no single word he had used against them out of a vocabulary both extensive and horrible was to them so degraded as that single one applied to him Late that night he received a tip from a dealer at one of vingt et un tables There were inquiries being made for him across the border That very evening he the dealer had gone across for a sack of flour and he had heard about it You d better get out said the dealer I m as safe here as I d be in Mexico City Don t be too sure son You re not any too popular here There s such a thing as being held up and carried over the border It s been done before now I m sick of this hole anyhow Rudolph muttered and moved away in the crowd The mechanical piano was banging in the dance hall as he slipped out into the darkness under the clear starlight of the Mexican night and the gate of the compound stood open He passed it with an oath Long before he had provided for such a contingency By the same agency which had got him to the border he could now be sent further on At something after midnight clad in old clothes and carrying on his back a rough outfit of a blanket and his remaining wardrobe he knocked at the door of a small adobe house on the border of the town An elderly German with a candle admitted him Well I m off Rudolph said roughly And time enough too said the German gruffly Rudolph was sullenly silent He was in this man s power and he knew it But the German was ready enough to do his part For months he had been doing this very thing starting through the desert toward the south slackers and fugitives of all descriptions He gathered together the equipment a map with water holes marked a canteen covered with a dirty plaid cloth casing a small supply of condensed foods in tins mostly and a letter to certain Germans in Mexico City who would receive hospitably any American fugitives and ask no questions How about money Rudolph inquired The German shrugged his shoulders You will not need money in the desert he said And you haf spent much money here on the women You should have safed it I was told you would give me money But the German shook his head You viii find money in Mexico City if you get there he said cryptically And Rudolph found neither threats nor entreaties of any avail He started out of the town turning toward the south and west Before him there stretched days of lonely traveling through the sand and cactus of the desert of blistering sun and cold nights of anxious searches for water holes It was because of the water holes that he headed southwest for such as they were they lay in tiny hidden oases in the canyons Almost as soon as he left the town he was in the desert a detached ranch a suggestion of a road a fenced in cotton field or two an irrigation ditch and then sand He was soft from months of inaction from the cactus whisky of Mexico too that ate into a man like a corrosive acid But he went on steadily putting behind him as rapidly as possible the border and the girls who had laughed at him He traveled by a pointed mountain which cut off the stars at the horizon and as the miles behind him increased in spite of his growing fatigue his spirits rose Before him lay the fulness of life again Mexico City was a stake worth gambling for He was gambling he knew He had put up his life and his opponent was thirst He knew that well enough too and the figure rather amused him Playing against that all right he muttered He paused and turned around The sun had lifted over the rim of the desert a red disc which turned the gleaming white alkali patches to rose By God he said that s the ante is it A red chip A caravan of mules was coming up from the head of the Gulf of California It moved in a cloud of alkali dust and sand its ore sacks coated white The animals straggled along wandering out of the line incessantly and thrust back into place by muleteers who cracked long whips and addressed them vilely At a place where a small rock placed on another marked a side trail to water the caravan turned and moved toward the mountains Close as they appeared the outfit was three hours getting to the foot hills There was a low meadow now covered with pale green grass Quail scurried away under the mesquite bushes stealthily whistling and here and there the two stones still marked the way With the instinct of desert creatures the mules hurried their pace Pack saddles creaked spurs jingled Life insistent thirsty life quickened the dead plain A man rode ahead He dug his spurs into his horse and cantered elbows flapping broad brimmed hat drawn over his eyes For hours he had been fighting the demon of thirst His tongue was dry his lips cracking The trail continued to be marked with its double stones but it did not enter the cool canyon ahead It turned and skirted the base of the bare mountain slope The man s eyes sharpened He knew very definitely what he was looking for and at last he saw it a circle of flat stones some twenty feet across the desert sign for a buried spring But there was something inside the circle something which lay still The man put his horse to the gallop again There was a canteen lying in the trail a canteen covered with a dirty plaid casing The horse s hoof struck it and it gave out a dry metallic sound Poor devil muttered the rider He dismounted and turned the figure over God he said And water under him all the time Then he dragged the quiet figure outside the ring of stones and getting a spade from his saddle fell to digging in the center A foot below the surface water began to appear clear cold water He lay down flat and drank out of the pool Clayton Spencer was alone in his house In the months since Natalie had gone he had not been there a great deal He had been working very hard He had not been able to shoulder arms but he had nevertheless fought a good fight He was very tired During the day a sort of fierce energy upheld him Because in certain things he had failed he was the more determined to succeed in others Not for himself ambition of that sort had died of the higher desire to serve his country But because the sense of failure in his private life haunted him The house was very quiet Buckham came in to mend the fire issuing from the shadows like a lean old ghost and eyeing him with tender faded old eyes Is there anything else sir Thanks no Buckham Yes mister Spencer I have not spoken about it but I think you have understood missus Spencer is not coming back Yes mister Spencer I had meant to close the house but certain things Captain Spencer s wife expects a child I would rather like to have her come here for the birth After that if the war is over I shall turn the house over to them You would stay on I hope Buckham I ll stay sir I His face worked nervously I feel toward the Captain as I would to my own son sir I have already thought that perhaps the old nursery has been cleaned and aired for weeks mister Spencer Clayton felt a thrill of understanding for the old man through all the years he had watched and served them He had reflected their joys and their sorrows He had suffered the family destiny without having shaped it He had lived vicariously their good hours and their bad And now in his old age he was waiting again for the vicarious joy of Graham s child But you ll not be leaving the house sir I don t know I shall keep my rooms But I shall probably live at the club The young people ought to be alone for a while There are readjustments You never married Buckham No mister Spencer I intended to at one time I came to this country to make a home and as I was rather a long time about it she married some one else Clayton caught the echo of an old pain in Buckham s repressed voice Buckham too Was there in the life of every man some woman tragedy Buckham sitting alone in his west window and looking toward the sunset Buckham had his memories She lost her only son at Neuve Chapelle Buckham was saying quietly In a way it was as tho I had lost a boy She never cared for the man she married He was a fine boy sir I you may remember the night I was taken ill in the pantry Is her husband still living No mister Spencer Do you ever think of going back and finding her I have sir But I don t know I like to remember her as she used to be I have some beautiful memories And I think sometimes it is better to live on memories They are more real than well than reality sir Long after Buckham had withdrawn Clayton paced the floor of the library Was Buckham right Was the real life of a man his mental life Was any love so great as a man s dream of love Peace was on the way Soon this nightmare of war would be over and in the great awakening love would again take the place of hate Love of man for man of nation for nation Peace and the things of peace Time to live Time to hope with the death cloud gone Time to work and time to play Time to love a woman and cherish her for the rest of life if only His failure with Natalie had lost him something She had cost him his belief in himself Her last words had crystallized his own sense of failure I admit all your good qualities Clay Heaven knows they are evident enough But you are the sort people admire They don t love you They never will Yet that night he had had a curious sense that old Buckham loved him Maybe he was the sort men loved and women admired He sat down and leaned back in his chair watching the fire logs He felt very tired What was that Buckham had said about memories But Buckham was old He was young young and strong There would be many years and even his most poignant memories would grow dim Audrey Audrey From the wall over the mantel Natalie s portrait still surveyed the room with its delicate complacence He looked up at it Yes Natalie had been right he was not the sort to make a woman happy There were plenty of men young men men still plastic men who had not known shipwreck and some such man Audrey would marry Perhaps already in France He got up His desk was covered with papers neatly endorsed by his secretary He turned out all the lights but his desk lamp Natalie s gleaming flesh tones died into the shadows and he stood for a moment looking up at it a dead thing remote flat without significance Then he sat down at his desk and took up a bundle of government papers There was still work Thank God for work CHAPTER L Audrey was in Paris on the eleventh of November Now and then she got back there and reveled for a day or two in the mere joy of paved streets and great orderly buildings She liked the streets and the crowds She liked watching the American boys swaggering along smoking innumerable cigarets and surveying the city with interested patronizing eyes And always walking briskly along the Rue Royale or the Avenue de l Opera or in the garden of the Tuileries where the school boys played their odd French games her eyes were searching the faces of the men she met Any tall man in civilian clothes set her heart beating faster She was quite honest with herself she knew that she was watching for Clay and she had a magnificent shamelessness in her quest And now at last The Daily Mail had announced his arrival in France and at first every ring of her telephone had sent her to it somewhat breathless but quite confident He would she considered call up the Red Cross at the Hotel Regina and they would by her instructions give her hotel Then on that Monday morning which was the eleventh she realized that he would not call her up She knew it suddenly and absolutely She sat down when the knowledge came to her with a sickening feeling that if he did not come to her now he never would come Yet even then she did not doubt that he cared Cared as desperately as she did The bond still held She tried very hard sitting there by her wood fire in the orderly uniform which made her so quaintly young and boyish to understand the twisted mental processes that kept him away from her now that he was free And in the end she came rather close to the truth his sense of failure his loss of confidence in himself where his love life was concerned the strange twisting and warping that were Natalie s sole legacy from their years together For months she had been tending broken bodies and broken spirits But the broken pride of a man was a strange and terrible thing She did not know where he was stopping and in the congestion of the Paris hotels it would be practically impossible to trace him And there too her own pride stepped in He must come to her He knew she cared She had been honest with him always with a sort of terrible honesty Surveying the past months she wondered not for the first time what had held them apart so long against the urge that had become the strongest thing in life to them both The strength in her had come from him She knew that But where had Clay got his strength Men were not like that often Failing final happiness they so often took what they could get Like Chris Perhaps for the first and last time she saw Clayton Spencer that morning with her mind as well as with her heart She saw him big and generous and fine but she saw him also not quite so big as his love conventional bound by tradition and early training somewhat rigid Calvinistic and dominated still by a fierce sex pride At once the weaknesses of the middle span and its safety And woman fashion she loved him for both his weakness and his strength A bigger man might have taken her A smaller man would have let her go Clay was just Clay single hearted intelligent but not shrewd blundering honest Clay She was one great ache for the shelter of his arms She had a small sense of shame that on that day of all others she should be obsessed with her own affairs This was a great day That morning if all went well the war was to cease The curtain was to fall on the great melodrama and those who had watched it and those who had played in it would with the drop of the curtain turn away from the illusion that is war to the small and quiet things of home Home she repeated She had no home But it was a great day nevertheless Only that morning the white capped femme de chambre had said with exaltation in her great eyes So It is finished Madame or soon it will be in an hour or two It will be finished Suzanne And Madame will go back to the life she lived before Her eyes had turned to where on the dressing table lay the gold fittings of Audrey s dressing case She visualized Audrey back in rich opulent America surrounded by the luxury the gold trinkets would indicate Madame must be lovely in the costume for a ball she said and sighed For her a farm in Brittany the endless round of small duties for the American Sitting there alone Audrey felt already the reactions of peace The war had torn up such roots as had held her She was terribly aware too that she had outgrown her old environment The old days were gone The old Audrey was gone and in her place was a quiet woman whose hands had known service and would never again be content to be idle Yet she knew that with the war the world call would be gone Not again for her detached impersonal service She was not of the great of the earth What she wanted quite simply was the service of love To have her own and to care for them She hoped very earnestly that she would be able to look beyond her own four walls to see distress and to help it but she knew as she knew herself that the real call to her would always be love She felt a certain impatience at herself This was to be the greatest day in the history of the world and while all the earth waited for the signal guns she waited for a man who had apparently determined not to take her back into his life She went out onto her small stone balcony on the Rue Danou and looked out to where on the Rue de la Paix the city traffic moved with a sort of sporadic expectancy Men stopped and consulted their watches A few stood along the curb and talked in low voices Groups of men in khaki walked by or stopped to glance into the shop windows They too were waiting She could see far below her valet de chambre in his green felt apron and the concierge in his blue frock coat and brass buttons unbending in the new democracy of hope to talk to a cabman Suddenly Audrey felt the same exaltation that had been in Suzanne s eyes Those boys below in uniform they were not tragic now They were the hope of the world not its sacrifice They were going to live They were going to live She went into her bedroom and put on her service hat And as she opened the door Suzanne was standing outside one hand upraised Into the quiet hallway there came the distant sound of the signal guns C est l armistice cried Suzanne and suddenly broke into wild hysterical sobbing All the way down stairs Audrey was praying not articulately but in her heart that this was indeed the end that the grapes of wrath had all been trampled that the nations of the world might again look forward instead of back And because she was not of the great of the earth but only a loving woman that somewhere Clay was hearing the guns as she was and would find hope in them and a future When a great burden is lifted the relief is not always felt at once The galled places still ache The sense of weight persists And so with Paris Not at once did the city rejoice openly It prayed first and then it counted the sore spots and they were many And it was dazed too There had been no time to discount peace in advance The streets filled at once but at first it was with a chastened people Audrey herself felt numb and unreal She moved mechanically with the shifting crowd looking overhead as a captured German plane flew by trying to comprehend the incomprehensible But by mid day the sober note of the crowds had risen to a higher pitch A file of American doughboys led by a corporal with a tin trumpet and officered by a sergeant with an enormous American cigar goose stepped down the Avenue de l Opera gaining recruits at every step It snake danced madly through the crowd singing that one lyric stand by of Young America Hail hail the gang s all here But the gang was not all there and they knew it Some of them lay in the Argonne or at Chateau Thierry and for them peace had come too late But the Americans like the rest of the world had put the past behind them Here was the present the glorious present and Paris on a sunny Monday And after that would be home Hail hail the gang s all here What the hell do we care What the hell do we care Hail hail the gang s all here What the hell do we care now Gradually the noise became uproarious There were no bands in Paris and any school boy with a tin horn or a toy drum could start a procession Bearded little poilus arm in arm from curb to curb marched grinning down the center of the streets capturing and kissing pretty midinettes or surrounding officers and dancing madly Audrey saw an Algerian ragged and dirty from the battle fields kiss on both cheeks a portly British Admiral of the fleet and was herself kissed by a French sailor with extreme robustness and a slight tinge of vin ordinaire She went on smiling If only Clay were seeing all this He had worked so hard He had a right to this wonderful hour at least If he had gone to the front to see Graham but then it must be rather wonderful at the front too She tried to visualize it the guns quiet and the strained look gone from the faces of the men with the wonderful feeling that as there was to day now there would also be to morrow She felt a curious shrinking from the people she knew For this one day she wanted to be alone This peace was a thing of the soul and of the soul alone She knew what it would be with the people she knew best in Paris hastily arranged riotous parties a great deal of champagne and noise and overlying the real sentiment much sentimentality She realized with a faint smile that the old Audrey would have welcomed that very gayety She was even rather resentful with herself for her own aloofness She quite forgot luncheon and early afternoon found her on the balcony of the Crillon Hotel overlooking the Place de la Concorde Paris was truly awake by that time and going mad The long quiet fountains were playing Poilus and American soldiers had seized captured German cannon and were hauling them wildly about If in the morning the crowd had been largely khaki now the French blue predominated Flags and confetti were everywhere and every motor as it pushed slowly through the crowd carried on roof and running board and engine hood crowds of self invited passengers A British band was playing near the fountain A line of helmets above the mass and wild cheers revealed French cavalry riding through and heralded by jeers and much applause came a procession of the proletariat of odds and ends soldiers and shop girls mechanics and street sweepers and cabmen and students carrying an effigy of the Kaiser on a gibbet As the sun went down the outlines of the rejoicing city took on the faint mist blue of a dream city It softened the outlines of the Eiffel tower to strange and fairy like beauty and gave to the trees in the Tuileries gardens the lack of definition of an old engraving And as if to remind the rejoicing of the price of their happiness there came limping through the crowd a procession of the mutilees They stumped along on wooden legs or on crutches they rode in wheeled chairs they were led who could not see And they smiled and cheered None of them was whole but every one was a full man for all that Audrey cried shamelessly like Suzanne but quietly And not for the first time that day she thought of Chris She had never loved him but it was pitiful that he could not have lived He had so loved life He would have so relished all this the pageantry of it and the gayety and the night s revelry that was to follow Poor Chris He had thrown everything away even life The world perhaps was better that these mutilees below had given what they had But Chris had gone like a pebble thrown into a lake He had made his tiny ripple and had vanished Then she remembered that she was not quite fair Perhaps she had never been fair to Chris He had given all he had He had not lived well but he had died well And there was something to be said for death For the first time in her healthy life she wondered about death standing here on the Crillon balcony with the city gone mad with life below her Death was quiet It might be rather wonderful She thought if Clay did not want her that perhaps it would be very comforting just to die and forget about everything From beneath the balcony there came again lustily the shouts of a dozen doughboys hauling a German gun Hail hail the gang s all here What the hell do we care What the hell do we care Hail hail the gang s all here What the hell do we care now Then that night Clay came The roistering city outside had made of her little sitting room a sort of sanctuary into which came only faintly the blasts of horns hoarse strains of the Marseillaise sung by an un vocal people the shuffling of myriad feet the occasional semi hysterical screams of women mister Spencer is calling said the concierge over the telephone in his slow English And suddenly a tight band snapped which had seemed to bind Audrey s head all day She was calm She was herself again Life was very wonderful peace was very wonderful The dear old world The good old world The kind loving tender old world which separated people that they might know the joy of coming together again She wanted to sing she wanted to hang over her balcony and teach the un vocal French the Marseillaise Yet when she had opened the door she could not even speak And Clay too after one long look at her only held out his arms It was rather a long time indeed before they found any words at all Audrey was the first and what she said astounded her For she said What a dreadful noise outside And Clay responded with equal gravity Yes isn t it Then he took off his overcoat and put it down and placed his hat on the table and said very simply I couldn t stay away I tried to You hadn t a chance in the world Clay when I was willing you to come Then there was one of those silences which come when words have shown their absolute absurdity It seemed a long time before he broke it I m not young Audrey And I have failed once It takes two to make a failure she said dauntlessly I wouldn t let you fail again Clay Not if you love me If I love you Then he was somehow in that grotesque position that is only absurd to the on looker on his knees beside her His terrible self consciousness was gone He only knew that somehow some way he must prove to her his humility his love his terrible fear of losing her again his hope that together they might make up for the wasted years of their lives I worship you he said The little room was a sanctuary The war lay behind them Wasted and troubled years lay behind them Youth first youth was gone with its illusions and its dreams But before them lay the years of fulfilment years of understanding Youth demanded everything and was discontented that it secured less than its demands Now they asked but three things work and peace and love And the greatest of these was love Something like that he said to her when the first inarticulateness had passed and when as is the way of a man with the woman who loves him he tried to lay his soul as well as his heart at her feet The knowledge that the years brought That love in youth was a plant of easy growth springing up in many soils But that the love of the middle span of a man s life whether that love be the early love purified by fire or a new love sowed in sacrifice and watered with tears the love that was to carry a man and a woman through to the end the last love was God s infinitely precious gift A gift to take the place of the things that had gone with youth of high adventure and the lilt of the singing heart The last gift End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dangerous Days by Mary Roberts Rinehart END OF THIS
