Smith s Hotel ten Dovermarle Street Here we are in London again Francesca Salemina and I Salemina is a philanthropist of the Boston philanthropists limited I am an artist Francesca is It is very difficult to label Francesca She is at her present stage of development just a nice girl that is about all the sense of humanity hasn t dawned upon her yet she is even unaware that personal responsibility for the universe has come into vogue and so she is happy Francesca is short of twenty years old Salemina short of forty I short of thirty Francesca is in love Salemina never has been in love I never shall be in love Francesca is rich Salemina is well to do I am poor There we are in a nutshell We are not only in London again but we are again in Smith s private hotel one of those deliciously comfortable and ensnaring hostelries in Mayfair which one enters as a solvent human being and which one leaves as a bankrupt no matter what may be the number of ciphers on one s letter of credit since the greater one s apparent supply of wealth the greater the demand made upon it I never stop long in London without determining to give up my art for a private hotel There must be millions in it but I fear I lack some of the essential qualifications for success I never could have the heart for example to charge a struggling young genius eight shillings a week for two candles and then eight shillings the next week for the same two candles which the struggling young genius by dint of vigorous economy had managed to preserve to a decent height No I could never do it not even if I were certain that she would squander the sixteen shillings in Bond Street fripperies instead of laying them up against the rainy day It is Salemina who always unsnarls the weekly bill Francesca spends an evening or two with it first of all because since she is so young we think it good mental training for her and not that she ever accomplishes any results worth mentioning She begins by making three columns headed respectively F S and P These initials stand for Francesca Salemina and Penelope but they resemble the signs for pounds shillings and pence so perilously that they introduce an added distraction She then places in each column the items in which we are all equal such as rooms attendance fires and lights Then come the extras which are different for each person more ale for one more hot baths for another more carriages for one more lemon squashes for another Francesca s column is principally filled with carriages and lemon squashes You would fancy her whole time was spent in driving and drinking if you judged her merely by this weekly statement at the hotel When she has reached the point of dividing the whole bill into three parts so that each person may know what is her share she adds the three together expecting not unnaturally to get the total amount of the bill Not at all She never comes within thirty shillings of the desired amount and she is often three or four guineas to the good or to the bad One of her difficulties lies in her inability to remember that in English money it makes a difference where you place a figure whether in the pound shilling or pence column Having been educated on the theory that a six is a six the world over she charged me with sixty shillings worth of Apollinaris in one week I pounced on the error and found that she had jotted down each pint in the shilling instead of in the pence column After Francesca had broken ground on the bill in this way Salemina on the next leisure evening draws a large armchair under the lamp and puts on her eye glasses We perch on either arm and after identifying our own extras we summon the butler to identify his There are a good many that belong to him or to the landlady of that fact we are always convinced before he proves to the contrary We can never see until he makes us see why the breakfasts on the eighth should be four shillings each because we had strawberries if on the eighth we find strawberries charged in the luncheon column and also in the column of desserts and ices And then there are the peripatetic lemon squashes Dawson calls them still lemon squashes because they are made with water not with soda or seltzer or vichy but they are particularly badly named Still forsooth when one of them will leap from place to place appearing now in the column of mineral waters and now in the spirits now in the suppers and again in the sundries We might as well drink Chablis or Pommery by the time one of these still squashes has ceased wandering and charging itself at each station The force of Dawson s intellect is such that he makes all this moral turbidity as clear as crystal while he remains in evidence His bodily presence has a kind of illuminating power and all the errors that we fancy we have found he traces to their original source which is always in our suspicious and inexperienced minds As he leaves the room he points out some proof of unexampled magnanimity on the part of the hotel as for instance the fact that the management has not charged a penny for sending up Miss Monroe s breakfast trays Francesca impulsively presses two shillings into his honest hand and remembers afterwards that only one breakfast was served in our bedrooms during that particular week and that it was mine not hers The Paid Out column is another source of great anxiety Francesca is a person who is always buying things unexpectedly and sending them home C O D always taking a cab and having it paid at the house always sending telegrams and messages by hansom and notes by the Boots I should think were England on the brink of a war that the Prime Minister might expect in his office something of the same hubbub uproar and excitement that Francesca manages to evolve in this private hotel Naturally she cannot remember her expenditures or extravagances or complications of movement for a period of seven days and when she attacks the Paid Out column she exclaims in a frenzy Just look at this On the eleventh they say they paid out three shillings in telegrams and I was at Maidenhead Then because we love her and cannot bear to see her charming forehead wrinkled we approach from our respective corners and the conversation is something like this Salemina You were not at Maidenhead on the eleventh Francesca it was the twelfth Francesca Oh so it was but I sent no telegrams on the eleventh Penelope Wasn t that the day you wired mister Drayton that you couldn t go to the Zoo Francesca Oh yes so I did and to mister Godolphin that I could I remember now but that s only two Salemina How about the hairdresser whom you stopped coming from Kensington Francesca Yes she s the third that s all right then but what in the world is this twelve shillings Penelope The foolish amber beads you were persuaded into buying in the Burlington Arcade Francesca No those were seven shillings and they are splitting already Salemina Those soaps and sachets you bought on the way home the day that you left your purse in the cab Francesca No they were only five shillings Oh perhaps they lumped the two things if seven and five are twelve then that is just what they did Here she takes a pencil Yes they are twelve so that s right what a comfort Now here s two and six on the thirteenth That was yesterday and I can always remember yesterdays they are my strong point I didn t spend a penny yesterday oh yes I did pay half a crown for a potted plant but it was not two and six and it was a half crown because it was the first time I had seen one and I took particular notice I ll speak to Dawson about it but it will make no difference Nobody but an expert English accountant could find a flaw in one of these bills and prove his case By this time we have agreed that the weekly bill as a whole is substantially correct and all that Salemina has to do is to estimate our several shares in it so Francesca and I say good night and leave her toiling like Cicero in his retirement at Tusculum By midnight she has generally brought the account to a point where a half hour s fresh attention in the early morning will finish it Not that she makes it come out right to a penny She has been treasurer of the Boston Band of Benevolence of the Saturday Morning Sloyd Circle of the Club for the Reception of Russian Refugees and of the Society for the Brooding of Buddhism but none of these organisations carries on its existence by means of pounds shillings and pence or Salemina s resignation would have been requested long ago However we are not disposed to be captious we are too glad to get rid of the bill If our united thirds make four or five shillings in excess we divide them equally if it comes the other way about we make it up in the same manner always meeting the sneers of masculine critics with doctor Holmes s remark that a faculty for numbers is a sort of detached lever arrangement that can be put into a mighty poor watch Chapter II The powdered footman smiles Salemina is so English I can t think how she manages She had not been an hour on British soil before she asked a servant to fetch in some coals and mend the fire she followed this Anglicism by a request for a grilled chop a grilled chump chop waiter please and so on from triumph to triumph She now discourses of methylated spirits as if she had never in her life heard of alcohol and all the English equivalents for Americanisms are ready for use on the tip of her tongue She says conserv t ry and observ t ry she calls the chambermaid Mairy which is infinitely softer to be sure than the American Mary with its over long a she ejaculates Quite so in all the pauses of conversation and talks of smoke rooms and camisoles and luggage vans and slip bodies and trams and mangling and goffering She also eats jam for breakfast as if she had been reared on it when every one knows that the average American has to contract the jam habit by patient and continuous practice This instantaneous assimilation of English customs does not seem to be affectation on Salemina s part nor will I wrong her by fancying that she went through a course of training before she left Boston From the moment she landed you could see that her foot was on her native heath She inhaled the fog with a sense of intoxication that the east winds of New England had never given her and a great throb of patriotism swelled in her breast when she first met the Princess of Wales in Hyde Park As for me I get on charmingly with the English nobility and sufficiently well with the gentry but the upper servants strike terror to my soul There is something awe inspiring to me about an English butler If they would only put him in livery or make him wear a silver badge anything in short to temper his pride and prevent one from mistaking him for the master of the house or the bishop within his gates When I call upon Lady DeWolfe I say to myself impressively as I go up the steps You are as good as a butler as well born and well bred as a butler even more intelligent than a butler Now simply because he has an unapproachable haughtiness of demeanour which you can respectfully admire but can never hope to imitate do not cower beneath the polar light of his eye assert yourself be a woman be an American citizen All in vain The moment the door opens I ask for Lady DeWolfe in so timid a tone that I know Parker thinks me the parlour maid s sister who has rung the visitors bell by mistake If my lady is within I follow Parker to the drawing room my knees shaking under me at the prospect of committing some solecism in his sight Lady DeWolfe s husband has been noble only four months and Parker of course knows it and perhaps affects even greater hauteur to divert the attention of the vulgar commoner from the newness of the title Dawson our butler at Smith s private hotel wields the same blighting influence on our spirits accustomed to the soft solicitations of the negro waiter or the comfortable indifference of the free born American We never indulge in ordinary democratic or frivolous conversation when Dawson is serving us at dinner We talk up to him so far as we are able and before we utter any remark we inquire mentally whether he is likely to think it good form Accordingly I maintain throughout dinner a lofty height of aristocratic elegance that impresses even the impassive Dawson towards whom it is solely directed To the amazement and amusement of Salemina who always takes my cheerful inanities at their face value I give an hypothetical account of my afternoon engagements interlarding it so thickly with countesses and marchionesses and lords and honourables that though Dawson has passed soup to duchesses and scarcely ever handed a plate to anything less than a baroness he dilutes the customary scorn of his glance and makes it two parts condescending approval as it rests on me Penelope Hamilton of the great American working class unlimited Apropos of the servants it seems to me that the British footman has relaxed a trifle since we were last here or is it possible that he reaches the height of his immobility at the height of the London season and as it declines does he decline and become flesh At all events I have twice seen a footman change his weight from one leg to the other as he stood at a shop entrance with his lady s mantle over his arm twice have I seen one stroke his chin and several times have I observed others during the month of July conduct themselves in many respects like animate objects with vital organs Lest this incendiary statement be challenged levelled as it is at an institution whose stability and order are but feebly represented by the eternal march of the stars in their courses I hasten to explain that in none of these cases cited was it a powdered footman who to use a Delsartean expression withdrew will from his body and devitalised it before the public eye I have observed that the powdered personage has much greater control over his muscles than the ordinary footman with human hair and is infinitely his superior in rigidity Dawson tells me confidentially that if a footman smiles there is little chance of his rising in the world He says a sense of humour is absolutely fatal in that calling and that he has discharged many a good footman because of an intelligent and expressive face I tremble to think of what the powdered footman may become when he unbends in the bosom of the family When in the privacy of his own apartments the powder is washed off the canary seed pads removed from his aristocratic calves and his scarlet and buff magnificence exchanged for a simple neglige I should think he might be guilty of almost any indiscretion or violence I for one would never consent to be the wife and children of a powdered footman and receive him in his moments of reaction Chapter III Eggs a la coque Is it to my credit or to my eternal dishonour that I once made a powdered footman smile and that too when he was handing a buttered muffin to an earl s daughter It was while we were paying a visit at Marjorimallow Hall Sir Owen and Lady Marjorimallow s place in Surrey This was to be our first appearance in an English country house and we made elaborate preparations Only our freshest toilettes were packed and these were arranged in our trunks with the sole view of impressing the lady s maid who should unpack them We each purchased dressing cases and new fittings Francesca s being of sterling silver Salemina s of triple plate and mine of celluloid as befitted our several fortunes Salemina read up on English politics Francesca practised a new way of dressing her hair and I made up a portfolio of sketches We counted therefore on representing American letters beauty and art to that portion of the great English public staying at Marjorimallow Hall I must interject a parenthesis here to the effect that matters did not move precisely as we expected for at table where most of our time was passed Francesca had for a neighbour a scientist who asked her plump whether the religion of the American Indian was or was not a pure theism Salemina s partner objected to the word politics in the mouth of a woman while my attendant squire adored a good bright coloured chromo But this is anticipating Three days before our departure I remarked at the breakfast table Dawson being absent My dear girls you are aware that we have ordered fried eggs scrambled eggs buttered eggs and poached eggs ever since we came to Dovermarle Street simply because we do not know how to eat boiled eggs prettily from the shell English fashion and cannot break them into a cup or a glass American fashion on account of the effect upon Dawson Now there will certainly be boiled eggs at Marjorimallow Hall and we cannot refuse them morning after morning it will be cowardly which is unpleasant and it will be remarked which is worse Eating them minced in an egg cup in a baronial hall with the remains of a drawbridge in the grounds is equally impossible if we do that Lady Marjorimallow will be having our luggage examined to see if we carry wigwams and war whoops about with us No it is clearly necessary that we master the gentle art of eating eggs tidily and daintily from the shell I have seen English women very dull ones too do it without apparent effort I have even seen an English infant do it and that without soiling her apron or as Salemina would say messing her pinafore I propose therefore that we order soft boiled eggs daily that we send Dawson from the room directly breakfast is served and that then and there we have a class for opening eggs lowest grade object method Any person who cuts the shell badly or permits the egg to leak over the rim or allows yellow dabs on the plate or upsets the cup or stains her fingers shall be fined tuppence and locked into her bedroom for five minutes The first morning we were all in the bedroom together and there being no blameless person to collect fines the wildest civil disorder prevailed On the second day Salemina and I improved slightly but Francesca had passed a sleepless night and her hand trembled the love letter mail had come in from America We were obliged to tell her as we collected tuppence twice on the same egg that she must either remain at home or take an oilcloth pinafore to Marjorimallow Hall But ease is the lovely result of forgotten toil and it is only a question of time and desire with Americans we are so clever Other nations have to be trained from birth but as we need only an ounce of training where they need a pound we can afford to procrastinate Sometimes we procrastinate too long but that is a trifle On the third morning success crowned our efforts Salemina smiled and I told an anecdote during the operation although my egg was cracked in the boiling and I question if the Queen s favourite maid of honour could have managed it prettily Accordingly when eggs were brought to the breakfast table at Marjorimallow Hall we were only slightly nervous Francesca was at the far end of the long table and I do not know how she fared but from various Anglicisms that Salemina dropped as she chatted with the Queen s Counsel on her left I could see that her nerve was steady and circulation free We exchanged glances there was the mistake and with an embarrassed laugh she struck her egg a hasty blow Her egg cup slipped and lurched a top fraction of the egg flew in the direction of the Q C and the remaining portion oozed in yellow confusion rapidly into her plate Alas for that past mistress of elegant dignity Salemina If I had been at Her Majesty s table I should have smiled even if I had gone to the Tower the next moment but as it was I became hysterical My neighbour a portly member of Parliament looked amazed Salemina grew scarlet the situation was charged with danger and rapidly viewing the various exits I chose the humorous one and told as picturesquely as possible the whole story of our school of egg opening in Dovermarle Street the highly arduous and encouraging rehearsals conducted there and the stupendous failure incident to our first public appearance Sir Owen led the good natured laughter and applause lords and ladies Q C s and M P s joined in with a will poor Salemina raised her drooping head opened and ate a second egg with the repose of a Vere de Vere and the footman smiled Chapter IV The English sense of humour I do not see why we hear that the Englishman is deficient in a sense of humour His jokes may not be a matter of daily food to him as they are to the American he may not love whimsicality with the same passion nor inhale the aroma of a witticism with as keen a relish but he likes fun whenever he sees it and he sees it as often as most people It may be that we find the Englishman more receptive to our bits of feminine nonsense just now simply because this is the day of the American woman in London and having been assured that she is an entertaining personage young John Bull is willing to take it for granted so long as she does not try to marry him and even this pleasure he will allow her on occasion if well paid for it The longer I live the more I feel it an absurdity to label nations with national traits and then endeavour to make individuals conform to the required standard It is possible I suppose to draw certain broad distinctions though even these are subject to change but the habit of generalising from one particular that mainstay of the cheap and obvious essayist has rooted many fictions in the public mind Nothing for instance can blot from my memory the profound searching and exhaustive analysis of a great nation which I learned in my small geography when I was a child namely The French are a gay and polite people fond of dancing and light wines One young Englishman whom I have met lately errs on the side of over appreciation He laughs before during and after every remark I make unless it be a simple request for food or drink This is an acquaintance of Willie Beresford the Honourable Arthur Ponsonby who was the whip on our coach drive to Dorking dear delightful adorable Dorking of hen celebrity Salemina insisted on my taking the box seat in the hope that the Honourable Arthur would amuse me She little knew him He sapped me of all my ideas and gave me none in exchange Anything so unspeakably heavy I never encountered It is very difficult for a woman who doesn t know a nigh horse from an off one nor the wheelers from the headers or is it the fronters to find subjects of conversation with a gentleman who spends three fourths of his existence on a coach It was the more difficult for me because I could not decide whether Willie Beresford was cross because I was devoting myself to the whip or because Francesca had remained at home with a headache This state of affairs continued for about fifteen miles when it suddenly dawned upon the Honourable Arthur that however mistaken my speech and manner I was trying to be agreeable This conception acted on the honest and amiable soul like magic I gradually became comprehensible and finally he gave himself up to the theory that though eccentric I was harmless and amusing so we got on famously so famously that Willie Beresford grew ridiculously gloomy and I decided that it could not be Francesca s headache The names of these English streets are a never failing source of delight to me In that one morning we drove past Pie Pudding and Petticoat Lanes and later on we found ourselves in a Prudent Passage which opened very inappropriately into Huggin Lane Willie Beresford said it was the first time he had ever heard of anything so disagreeable as prudence terminating in anything so agreeable as huggin When he had been severely reprimanded by his mother for this shocking speech I said to the Honourable Arthur I don t understand your business signs in England this Company Limited and that Company Limited That one of course is quite plain pointing to the front of a building on the village street Goat s Milk Company Limited I suppose they have but one or two goats and necessarily the milk must be Limited Salemina says that this was not in the least funny that it was absolutely flat but it had quite the opposite effect upon the Honourable Arthur He had no command over himself or his horses for some minutes and at intervals during the afternoon the full felicity of the idea would steal upon him and the smile of reminiscence would flit across his ruddy face The next day at the Eton and Harrow games at Lord s cricket ground he presented three flowers of British aristocracy to our party and asked me each time to tell the goat story which he had previously told himself and probably murdered in the telling Not content with this arrant flattery he begged to be allowed to recount some of my international episodes to a literary friend who writes for Punch I demurred decidedly but Salemina said that perhaps I ought to be willing to lower myself a trifle for the sake of elevating Punch This home thrust so delighted the Honourable Arthur that it remained his favourite joke for days and the overworked goat was permitted to enjoy that oblivion from which Salemina insists it should never have emerged Chapter V A Hyde Park Sunday The Honourable Arthur Salemina and I took a stroll in Hyde Park one Sunday afternoon not for the purpose of joining the fashionable throng of pretty people at Stanhope Gate but to mingle with the common herd in its special precincts precincts not set apart indeed by any legal formula but by a natural law of classification which seems to be inherent in the universe It was a curious and motley crowd a little dull perhaps but orderly well behaved and self respecting with here and there part of the flotsam and jetsam of a great city a ragged sodden hopeless wretch wending his way about with the rest thankful for any diversion Under the trees each in the centre of his group large or small according to his magnetism and eloquence stood the park shouter airing his special grievance playing his special part preaching his special creed pleading his special cause anything probably for the sake of shouting We were plainly dressed and did not attract observation as we joined the outside circle of one of these groups after another It was as interesting to watch the listeners as the speakers I wished I might paint the sea of faces eager anxious stolid attentive happy and unhappy histories written on many of them others blank unmarked by any thought or aspiration I stole a sidelong look at the Honourable Arthur He is an Englishman first and a man afterwards I prefer it the other way but he does not realise it he thinks he is just like all other good fellows although he is mistaken He and Willie Beresford speak the same language but they are as different as Malay and Eskimo He is an extreme type but he is very likeable and very well worth looking at with his long coat his silk hat and the white Malmaison in his buttonhole He is always so radiantly fascinatingly clean the Honourable Arthur simple frank direct sensible and he bores me almost to tears The first orator was edifying his hearers with an explanation of the drama of The Corsican Brothers and his eloquence unlike that of the other speakers was largely inspired by the hope of pennies It was a novel idea and his interpretation was rendered very amusing to us by the wholly original Yorkshire accent which he gave to the French personages and places in the play An Irishman in black clerical garb held the next group together He was in some trouble owing to a pig headed and quarrelsome Scotchman in the front rank who objected to each statement that fell from his lips thus interfering seriously with the effect of his peroration If the Irishman had been more convincing I suppose the crowd would have silenced the scoffer for these little matters of discipline are always attended to by the audience but the Scotchman s points were too well taken he was so trenchant in fact at times that a voice would cry Coom up Sandy an ave it all your own w y boy The discussion continued as long as we were within hearing distance for the Irishman though amiable and ignorant was firm the unconquered Scot was on his native heath of argument and the listeners were willing to give them both a hearing Under the next tree a fluent Cockney lad of sixteen or eighteen years was declaiming his bitter experiences with the Salvation Army He had been sheltered in one of its beds which was not to his taste and it had found employment for him which he had to walk twenty two miles to get and which was not to his liking when he did get it A meeting of the Salvation Army at a little distance rendered his speech more interesting as its points were repeated and denied as fast as made Of course there were religious groups and temperance groups and groups devoted to the tearing down or raising up of most things except the Government for on that day there were no Anarchist or Socialist shouters as is ordinarily the case As we strolled down one of the broad roads under the shade of the noble trees we saw the sun setting in a red gold haze a glory of vivid colour made indescribably tender and opalescent by the kind of luminous mist that veils it a wholly English sunset and an altogether lovely one And quite away from the other knots of people there leaned against a bit of wire fence a poor old man surrounded by half a dozen children and one tired woman with a nursing baby He had a tattered book which seemed to be the story of the Gospels and his little flock sat on the greensward at his feet as he read It may be that he too had been a shouter in his lustier manhood and had held a larger audience together by the power of his belief but now he was helpless to attract any but the children Whether it was the pathos of his white hairs his garb of shreds and patches or the mild benignity of his eye that moved me I know not but among all the Sunday shouters in Hyde Park it seemed to me that that quavering voice of the past spoke with the truest note Chapter VI The English Park Lover The English Park Lover loving his love on a green bench in Kensington Gardens or Regent s Park or indeed in any spot where there is a green bench so long as it is within full view of the passer by this English public lover male or female is a most interesting study for we have not his exact counterpart in America He is thoroughly respectable I should think my urban Colin He does not have the air of a gay deceiver roving from flower to flower stealing honey as he goes he looks on the contrary as if it were his intention to lead Phoebe to the altar on the next bank holiday there is a dead calm in his actions which bespeaks no other course If Colin were a Don Juan surely he would be a trifle more ardent for there is no tropical fervour in his matter of fact caresses He does not embrace Phoebe in the park apparently because he adores her to madness because her smile is like fire in his veins melting down all his defences because the intoxication of her nearness is irresistible because in fine he cannot wait until he finds a more secluded spot nay verily he embraces her because tell me infatuated fruiterers poulterers soldiers haberdashers limited what is your reason For it does not appear to the casual eye Stormy weather does not vex the calm of the Park Lover for the rains of Marly do not wet when one is in love By a clever manipulation of four arms and four hands they can manage an umbrella and enfold each other at the same time though a feminine macintosh is well known to be ill adapted to the purpose and a continuous drizzle would dampen almost any other lover in the universe The park embrace as nearly as I can analyse it seems to be one part instinct one part duty one part custom and one part reflex action I have purposely omitted pleasure which in the analysis of the ordinary embrace reduces all the other ingredients to an almost invisible faction because I fail to find it but I am willing to believe that in some rudimentary form it does exist because man attends to no purely unpleasant matter with such praiseworthy assiduity Anything more fixedly stolid than the Park Lover when he passes his arm round his chosen one and takes her crimson hand in his I have never seen unless indeed it be the fixed stolidity of the chosen one herself I had not at first the assurance even to glance at them as I passed by blushing myself to the roots of my hair though the offenders themselves never changed colour Many a time have I walked out of my way or lowered my parasol for fear of invading their Sunday Eden but a spirit of inquiry awoke in me at last and I began to make psychological investigations with a view to finding out at what point embarrassment would appear in the Park Lover I experimented it was a most arduous and unpleasant task with upwards of two hundred couples and it is interesting to record that self consciousness was not apparent in a single instance It was not merely that they failed to resent my stopping in the path directly opposite them or my glaring most offensively at them nor that they even allowed me to sit upon their green bench and witness their chaste salutes but it was that they did fail to perceive me at all There is a kind of superb finish and completeness about their indifference to the public gaze which removes it from ordinary immodesty and gives it a certain scientific value Chapter VII A ducal tea party Among all my English experiences none occupies so important a place as my forced meeting with the Duke of Cimicifugas There can be no harm in my telling the incident so long as I do not give the right names which are very well known to fame The Duchess of Cimicifugas who is charming unaffected and lovable so report says has among her chosen friends an untitled woman whom we will call missus Apis Mellifica I met her only daughter Hilda in America and we became quite intimate It seems that missus Apis Mellifica who has an income of twenty thousand pounds a year often exchanges presents with the duchess and at this time she had brought with her from the Continent some rare old tapestries with which to adorn a new morning room at Cimicifugas House These tapestries were to be hung during the absence of the duchess in Homburg and were to greet her as a birthday surprise on her return Hilda Mellifica who is one of the most talented amateur artists in London and who has exquisite taste in all matters of decoration was to go down to the ducal residence to inspect the work and she obtained permission from Lady Veratrum the confidential companion of the duchess to bring me with her I started on this journey to the country with all possible delight little surmising the agonies that lay in store for me in the mercifully hidden future The tapestries were perfect and Lady Veratrum was most amiable and affable though the blue blood of the Belladonnas courses in her veins and her great grandfather was the celebrated Earl of Rhus Tox who rendered such notable service to his sovereign We roamed through the splendid apartments inspected the superb picture gallery where scores of dead and gone Cimicifugases most of them very plain were glorified by the art of Van Dyck Sir Joshua or Gainsborough and admired the priceless collections of marbles and cameos and bronzes It was about four o clock when we were conducted to a magnificent apartment for a brief rest as we were to return to London at half past six As Lady Veratrum left us she remarked casually His Grace will join us at tea The door closed and at the same moment I fell upon the brocaded satin state bed and tore off my hat and gloves like one distraught Hilda I gasped you brought me here and you must rescue me for I absolutely decline to drink tea with a duke Nonsense Penelope don t be absurd she replied I have never happened to see him myself and I am a trifle nervous but it cannot be very terrible I should think Not to you perhaps but to me impossible I said I thought he was in Homburg or I would never have entered this place It is not that I fear nobility I could meet Her Majesty the Queen at the Court of saint James without the slightest flutter of embarrassment because I know I could trust her not to presume on my defencelessness to enter into conversation with me But this duke whose dukedom very likely dates back to the hour of the Norman Conquest is a very different person and is to be met under very different circumstances He may ask me my politics Of course I can tell him that I am a Mugwump but what if he asks me why I am a Mugwump He will not Hilda answered Englishmen are not wholly devoid of feeling And how shall I address him I went on Does one call him your Grace or your Royal Highness Oh for a thousandth part of the unblushing impertinence of that countrywoman of mine who called your future king Tummy but she was a beauty and I am not pretty enough to be anything but discreetly well mannered Shall you sit in his presence or stand and grovel alternately Does one have to curtsy Very well then make any excuses you like for me Hilda say I m eccentric say I m deranged say I m a Nihilist I will hide under the scullery table fling myself in the moat lock myself in the keep let the portcullis fall on me die any appropriate early English death anything rather than curtsy in a tailor made gown I can kneel beautifully Hilda if that will do you remember my ancestors were brought up on kneeling and yours on curtsying and it makes a great difference in the muscles Hilda smiled benignantly as she wound the coil of russet hair round her shapely head He will think whatever you do charming and whatever you say brilliant she said that is the advantage in being an American woman Just at this moment Lady Veratrum sent a haughty maid to ask us if we would meet her under the trees in the park which surrounds the house I hailed this as a welcome reprieve to the dreaded function of tea with the duke and made up my mind while descending the marble staircase that I would slip away and lose myself accidentally in the grounds appearing only in time for the London train This happy mode of issue from my difficulties lent a springiness to my step as we followed a waxwork footman over the velvet sward to a nook under a group of copper beeches But there to my dismay stood a charmingly appointed tea table glittering with silver and Royal Worcester with several liveried servants bringing cakes and muffins and berries to Lady Veratrum who sat behind the steaming urn I started to retreat when there appeared walking towards us a simple man with nothing in the least extraordinary about him That cannot be the Duke of Cimicifugas thought I a man in a corduroy jacket without a sign of a suite probably it is a Banished Duke come from the Forest of Arden for a buttered muffin But it was the Duke of Cimicifugas and no other Hilda was presented first while I tried to fire my courage by thinking of the Puritan Fathers and Plymouth Rock and the Boston Tea Party and the battle of Bunker Hill Then my turn came I murmured some words which might have been anything and curtsied in a stiff necked self respecting sort of way Then we talked at least the duke and Lady Veratrum talked Hilda said a few blameless words such as befitted an untitled English virgin in the presence of the nobility while I maintained the probationary silence required by Pythagoras of his first year s pupils My idea was to observe this first duke without uttering a word to talk with the second if I should ever meet a second to chat with the third and to secure the fourth for Francesca to take home to America with her Of course I know that dukes are very dear but she could afford any reasonable sum if she found one whom she fancied the principal obstacle in the path is that tiresome American lawyer with whom she considers herself in love I have never gone beyond that first experience however for dukes in England are as rare as snakes in Ireland I can t think why they allow them to die out so the dukes not the snakes If a country is to have an aristocracy let there be enough of it say I and make it imposing at the top where it shows most especially since as I understand it all that Victoria has to do is to say Let there be dukes and there are dukes Chapter VIII Tuppenny travels in London If one really wants to know London one must live there for years and years 
4667-92220-0001	train-other-500	This sounds like a reasonable and sensible statement yet the moment it is made I retract it as quite misleading and altogether too general
none	none	 We have a charming English friend who has not been to the Tower since he was a small boy 
4667-92220-0002	train-other-500	and begs us to conduct him there on the very next Saturday Another has not seen Westminster Abbey for fifteen years because he attends church at saint Dunstan s in the East Another says that he should like to have us read up London in the red covered Baedeker
4667-92220-0003	train-other-500	and then show it to him properly and systematically
none	none	 Another a flower of the nobility confesses that he never mounted the top of an omnibus in the evening for the sake of seeing London after dark 
4667-92220-0004	train-other-500	but that he thinks it would be rather jolly
none	none	 and that he will join us in such a democratic journey at any time we like 
4667-92220-0005	train-other-500	We think we get a kind of vague apprehension of what London means from the top of a bus better than anywhere else and this vague apprehension is as much as the thoughtful or imaginative observer will ever arrive at in a lifetime
4667-92220-0006	train-other-500	It is too stupendous to be comprehended The mind is dazed by its distances confused by its contrasts tossed from the spectacle of its wealth to the contemplation of its poverty
4667-92220-0007	train-other-500	the brilliancy of its extravagances to the stolidity of its miseries the luxuries that blossom in Mayfair to the brutalities that lurk in Whitechapel
none	none	 We often set out on a fine morning 
4667-92220-0008	train-other-500	Salemina and I and travel twenty miles in the day
none	none	 though we have to double our twopenny fee several times to accomplish that distance 
4667-92220-0009	train-other-500	We never know whither we are going and indeed it is not a matter of great moment I mean to a woman where everything is new and strange and where the driver
none	none	 if one is fortunate enough to be on a front seat 
4667-92220-0010	train-other-500	tells one everything of interest along the way
none	none	 and instructs one regarding a different route back to town 
4667-92220-0011	train-other-500	We have our favourite buses of course but when one appears and we jump on while it is still in motion as the conductor seems to prefer and pull ourselves up the cork screw stairway not a simple matter in the garments of sophistication
none	none	 we have little time to observe more than the colour of the lumbering vehicle 
4667-92220-0012	train-other-500	We like the Cadbury s Cocoa bus very much it takes you by saint Mary le Strand Bow Bells the Temple
none	none	 Mansion House saint Paul s and the Bank If you want to go and lunch or dine frugally at the Cheshire Cheese 
4667-92220-0013	train-other-500	eat black pudding and drink pale ale sit in doctor Johnson s old seat and put your head against the exact spot on the wall where his rested
none	none	 although the traces of this form of worship are all too apparent then you jump on a Lipton s Tea bus and are deposited at the very door 
4667-92220-0014	train-other-500	All is novel and all is interesting
none	none	 whether it be crowded streets of the East End 
4667-92220-0015	train-other-500	traversed by the Davies Pea Fed Bacon buses or whether you ride to the very outskirts of London through green fields and hedgerows by the Ridge s Food or Nestle s Milk route There are trams too which take one to delightful places
4667-92220-0016	train-other-500	though the seats on top extend lengthwise after the old knifeboard pattern and one does not get so good a view of the country as from the garden seats on the roof of the omnibus
4667-92220-0017	train-other-500	still there is nothing we like better on a warm morning than a good outing on the Vinolia tram that we pick up in Shaftesbury Avenue
none	none	 There is a street running from Shaftesbury Avenue into Oxford Street which was once the village of saint Giles 
4667-92220-0018	train-other-500	one of the dozens of hamlets swallowed up by the great maw of London and it still looks like a hamlet although it has been absorbed for many years We constantly happen on these absorbed villages from which not a century ago people drove up to town in their coaches
4667-92220-0019	train-other-500	If you wish to see another phase of life go out on a Saturday evening from nine o clock on to eleven starting on a Beecham s Pill bus and keep to the poorer districts
none	none	 alighting occasionally to stand with the crowd in the narrower thoroughfares 
4667-92220-0020	train-other-500	It is a market night and the streets will be a moving mass of men and women buying at the hucksters stalls Everything that can be sold at a stall is there fruit vegetables meat fish crockery tin ware children s clothing cheap toys
4667-92220-0021	train-other-500	boots shoes and sun bonnets all in reckless confusion The vendors cry their wares in stentorian tones vying with one another to produce excitement and induce patronage while gas jets are streaming into the air from the roofs
4667-92220-0022	train-other-500	and flaring from the sides of the stalls children crying children dancing to the strains of an accordion children quarrelling children scrambling for the refuse fruit In the midst of this spectacle this din and uproar
4667-92220-0023	train-other-500	the women are chaffering and bargaining quite calmly watching the scales to see that they get their full pennyworth or sixpennyworth of this or that
4667-92220-0024	train-other-500	To the student of faces of manners of voices of gestures to the person who sees unwritten and unwritable stories in all these groups of men women and children the scene reveals many things some comedies many tragedies a few plain narratives
4667-92220-0025	train-other-500	thank God and now and then only now and then a romance As to the dark alleys and tenements on the fringe of this glare and brilliant confusion this Babel of sound and ant bed of moving life one can only surmise and pity and shudder
none	none	 close one s eyes and ears to it a little 
4667-92220-0026	train-other-500	or one could never sleep for thinking of it yet not too tightly lest one sleep too soundly and forget altogether the seamy side of things
none	none	 One can hardly believe that there is a seamy side when one descends from his travelling observatory a little later 
4667-92220-0027	train-other-500	and stands on Westminster Bridge or walks along the Thames Embankment The lights of Parliament House gleam from a hundred windows and in the dark shadows by the banks thousands of coloured discs of light twinkle and dance and glow like fairy lamps
4667-92220-0028	train-other-500	and are reflected in the silver surface of the river That river as full of mystery and contrast in its course as London itself where is such another
4667-92220-0029	train-other-500	It has ever been a river of pageants a river of sighs a river into whose placid depths kings and queens princes and cardinals have whispered state secrets
none	none	 and poets have breathed immortal lines a stream of pleasure bearing daily on its bosom such a freight of youth and mirth and colour and music 
4667-92220-0030	train-other-500	as no other river in the world can boast Sometimes we sally forth in search of adventures in the thick of a London particular mister Guppy s phrase for a fog When you are once ensconced in your garden seat by the driver
4667-92220-0031	train-other-500	you go lumbering through a world of bobbing shadows where all is weird vague grey dense and where great objects loom up suddenly in the mist and then disappear where the sky heavy and leaden seems to descend bodily upon your head
4667-92220-0032	train-other-500	and the air is full of a kind of luminous yellow smoke A Lipton s Tea bus is the only one we can see plainly in this sort of weather and so we always take it
none	none	 I do not wish however to be followed literally in these modest suggestions for omnibus rides 
4667-92220-0033	train-other-500	because I am well aware that they are not sufficiently specific for the ordinary tourist who wishes to see London systematically and without any loss of time If you care to go to any particular place or reach that place by any particular time
none	none	 you must not of course look at the most conspicuous signs on the tops 
4667-92220-0034	train-other-500	and ends of the chariots as we do you must stand quietly at one of the regular points of departure and try to decipher in a narrow horizontal space along the side certain little words that show the route and destination of the vehicle
none	none	 They say that it can be done and I do not feel like denying it on my own responsibility 
4667-92220-0035	train-other-500	Old Londoners assert that they are not blinded or confused by Pears Soap in letters two feet high scarlet on a gold ground but can see below in fine print and with the naked eye such legends as Tottenham Court Road Westbourne Grove saint Pancras
none	none	 Paddington or Victoria 
4667-92220-0036	train-other-500	It is certainly reasonable that the omnibuses should be decorated to suit the inhabitants of the place rather than foreigners and it is perhaps better to carry a few hundred stupid souls to the wrong station daily than to allow them to cleanse their hands with the wrong soap
4667-92220-0037	train-other-500	or quench their thirst with the wrong which is to say the unadvertised beverage The conductors do all in their power to mitigate the lot of unhappy strangers
none	none	 and it is only now and again that you hear an absent minded or logical one call out Castoria all the w y for a penny 
4667-92220-0038	train-other-500	We claim for our method of travelling not that it is authoritative but that it is simple suitable to persons whose desires are flexible and whose plans are not fixed It has its disadvantages which may indeed be said of almost anything
4667-92220-0039	train-other-500	For instance we had gone for two successive mornings on a Cadbury s Cocoa bus to Francesca s dressmaker in Kensington On the third morning deceived by the ambitious and unscrupulous Cadbury
4667-92220-0040	train-other-500	we mounted it and journeyed along comfortably three miles to the east of Kensington before we discovered our mistake It was a pleasant and attractive neighbourhood where we found ourselves but unfortunately Francesca s dressmaker did not reside there
4667-92220-0041	train-other-500	If you have determined to take a certain train from a certain station and do not care for any other no matter if it should turn out to be just as interesting then never take a Lipton s Tea bus
none	none	 for it is the most unreliable of all If it did not sound so learned 
4667-92220-0042	train-other-500	and if I did not feel that it must have been said before it is so apt I should quote Horace and say
none	none	 Omnibus hoc vitium est 
4667-92220-0043	train-other-500	There is no bus unseized by the Napoleonic Lipton Do not ascend one of them supposing for a moment that by paying fourpence and going to the very end of the route you will come to a neat tea station
none	none	 where you will be served with the cheering cup 
4667-92220-0044	train-other-500	Never nor with a draught of Cadbury s cocoa or Nestle s milk
none	none	 although you have jostled along for nine weary miles in company with their blatant recommendations to drink nothing else 
4667-92220-0045	train-other-500	and though you may have passed other buses with the same highly coloured names glaring at you until they are burned into the grey matter of your brain to remain there as long as the copy book maxims you penned when you were a child
none	none	 These pictorial methods doubtless prove a source of great financial gain 
4667-92220-0046	train-other-500	of course it must be so or they would never be prosecuted but although they may allure millions of customers they will lose two in our modest persons When Salemina and I go into a cafe for tea we ask the young woman if they serve Lipton s
4667-92220-0047	train-other-500	and if they say yes we take coffee This is self punishment indeed in London
none	none	 yet we feel that it may have a moral effect 
4667-92220-0048	train-other-500	perhaps not commensurate with the physical effect of the coffee upon us but these delicate matters can never be adjusted with absolute exactitude Sometimes when we are to travel on a Pears Soap bus we buy beforehand a bit of pure white Castile
4667-92220-0049	train-other-500	cut from a shrinking reserved exclusive bar with no name upon it
none	none	 and present it to some poor woman when we arrive at our journey s end We do not suppose that so insignificant a protest does much good but at least it preserves one s individuality and self respect Chapter IX A Table of Kindred and Affinity On one of our excursions Hilda Mellifica accompanied us and we alighted to see the place where the Smithfield martyrs were executed and to visit some of the very old churches in that vicinity We found hanging in the vestibule of one of them something quite familiar to Hilda but very strange to our American eyes A Table of Kindred and Affinity wherein whosoever are related are forbidden in Scripture and our Laws to Marry Together Salemina was very quiet that afternoon and we accused her afterwards of being depressed because she had discovered that added to the battalions of men in England who had not thus far urged her to marry them there were thirty persons whom she could not legally espouse even if they did ask her I cannot explain it but it really seemed in some way that our chances of a sweet safe corner of the household fire had materially decreased when we had read the table It only goes to prove what Salemina remarked yesterday I said that we can go on doing a thing quite properly until we have seen the rule for it printed in black and white The moment we read the formula we fail to see how we could ever have followed it we are confused by its complexities and we do not feel the slightest confidence in our ability to do consciously the thing we have done all our lives unconsciously Like the centipede quoted Salemina The centipede was happy quite Until the toad for fun Said Pray which leg goes after which Which wrought his mind to such a pitch He lay distracted in a ditch Considering how to run The Table of Kindred and Affinity is all too familiar to me sighed Hilda because we had a governess who made us learn it as a punishment I suppose I could recite it now although I haven t looked at it for ten years We used to chant it in the nursery schoolroom on wet afternoons I well remember that the vicar called one day to see us and the governess hearing our voices uplifted in a pious measure drew him under the window to listen This is what he heard you will see how admirably it goes And do not imagine it is wicked it is merely the Law not the Gospel and we framed our own musical settings so that we had no associations with the Prayer Book Here Hilda chanted softly there being no one in the old churchyard A woman may not marry with her Grandfather Grandmother s Husband Husband s Grandfather Father s Brother Mother s Brother Father s Sister s Husband Mother s Sister s Husband Husband s Father s Brother Husband s Mother s Brother Father Step Father Husband s Father Son Husband s Son Daughter s Husband Brother Husband s Brother Sister s Husband Son s Son Daughter s Son Son s Daughter s Husband Daughter s Daughter s Husband Husband s Son s Son Husband s Daughter s Son Brother s Son Sister s Son Brother s Daughter s Husband Sister s Daughter s Husband Husband s Brother s Son Husband s Sister s Son It seems as if there were nobody left I said disconsolately save perhaps your Second Cousin s Uncle or your Enemy s Dearest Friend That s just the effect it has on one answered Hilda We always used to conclude our chant with the advice And if there is anybody after this in the universe left to marry marry him as expeditiously as you possibly can Because there are very few husbands omitted from this table of Kindred and Affinity And it behoveth a maiden to snap them up without any delay willing or unwilling whenever and wherever found We were also required to learn by heart the form of Prayer with Thanksgiving to be used Yearly upon the Fifth Day of November for the happy deliverance of King James I and the Three Estates of England from the most traitorous and bloody intended Massacre by Gunpowder also the prayers for Charles the Martyr and the Thanksgiving for having put an end to the Great Rebellion by the Restitution of the King and Royal Family after many Years interruption which unspeakable Mercies were wonderfully completed upon the twenty ninth of May in the year sixteen sixty sixteen sixty We had been forty years in America then soliloquised Francesca and isn t it odd that the long thanksgivings in our country must all have been for having successfully run away from the Gunpowder Treason King Charles the Martyr and the Restituted Royal Family yet here we are you and I the best of friends talking it all over As we jog along or walk by turns we come to Buckingham Street and looking up at Alfred Jingle s lodgings say a grateful word of mister Pickwick We tell each other that much of what we know of London and England seems to have been learned from Dickens Deny him the right to sit among the elect if you will talk of his tendency to farce and caricature call his humour low comedy and his pathos bathos although you shall say none of these things in my presence unchallenged the fact remains that every child in America at least knows more of England its almshouses debtors prisons and law courts its villages and villagers its beadles and cheap jacks and hostlers and coachmen and boots its streets and lanes its lodgings and inns and landladies and roastbeef and plum pudding its ways manners and customs knows more of these things and a thousand others from Dickens s novels than from all the histories geographies biographies and essays in the language Where is there another novelist who has so peopled a great city with his imaginary characters that there is hardly room for the living population as one walks along the ways O these streets of London There are other more splendid shades in them shades that have been there for centuries and will walk beside us so long as the streets exist One can never see these shades save as one goes on foot or takes that chariot of the humble the omnibus I should like to make a map of literary London somewhat after Leigh Hunt s plan as projected in his essay on the World of Books for to the book lover the poet s hand is always on the place blessing it One can no more separate the association from the particular spot than one can take away from it any other beauty Fleet Street is always Johnson s Fleet Street so Leigh Hunt says the Tower belongs to Julius Caesar and Blackfriars to Suckling Vandyke and the Dunciad I can no more pass through Westminster without thinking of Milton or the Borough without thinking of Chaucer and Shakespeare or Gray s Inn without calling Bacon to mind or Bloomsbury Square without Steele and Akenside than I can prefer brick and mortar to wit and poetry or not see a beauty upon it beyond architecture in the splendour of the recollection Chapter X Apropos of advertisements Francesca wishes to get some old hall marked silver for her home tea tray and she is absorbed at present in answering advertisements of people who have second hand pieces for sale and who offer to bring them on approval The other day when Willie Beresford and I came in from Westminster Abbey where we had been choosing the best locations for our memorial tablets we thought Francesca must be giving a small and early but it transpired that all the silver sellers had called at the same hour and it took the united strength of Dawson and mister Beresford together with my diplomacy to rescue the poor child from their clutches She came out alive but her safety was purchased at the cost of a George IV cream jug an Elizabethan sugar bowl and a Boadicea tea caddy which were I doubt not manufactured in Wardour Street towards the close of the nineteenth century Salemina came in just then cold and tired Tower and National Gallery the same day It s so much more work to go to the Tower nowadays than it used to be We had intended to take a sail to Richmond on a penny steamboat but it was drizzling so we had a cosy fire instead slipped into our tea gowns and ordered tea and thin bread and butter a basket of strawberries with their frills on and a jug of Devonshire cream Willie Beresford asked if he might stay otherwise he said he should have to sit at a cold marble table on the corner of Bond Street and Piccadilly and take his tea in bachelor solitude Yes I said severely we will allow you to stay though as you are coming to dinner I should think you would have to go away some time if only in order that you might get ready to come back You ve been here since breakfast time I know he answered calmly and my only error in judgment was that I didn t take an earlier breakfast in order to begin my day here sooner One has to snatch a moment when he can nowadays for these rooms are so infested with British swells that a base born American stands very little chance Now I should like to know if Willie Beresford is in love with Francesca What shall I do that is what shall we do if he is when she is in love with somebody else To be sure she may want one lover for foreign and another for domestic service He is too old for her but that is always the way When Alcides having gone through all the fatigues of life took a bride in Olympus he ought to have selected Minerva but he chose Hebe I wonder why so many people call him Willie Beresford at his age Perhaps it is because his mother sets the example but from her lips it does not seem amiss I suppose when she looks at him she recalls the past and is ever seeing the little child in the strong man mother fashion It is very beautiful that feeling and when a girl surprises it in any mother s eyes it makes her heart beat faster as in the presence of something sacred which she can understand only because she is a woman and experience is foreshadowed in intuition The Honourable Arthur had sent us a dozen London dailies and weeklies and we fell into an idle discussion of their contents over the teacups I had found an exchange column which was as interesting as it was novel and I told Francesca it seemed to me that if we managed wisely we could rid ourselves of all our useless belongings and gradually amass a collection of the English articles we most desired Here is an opportunity for instance I said and I read aloud S G of Kensington will post Woman three days old regularly for a box of cut flowers Rather young said mister Beresford or I d answer that advertisement myself I wanted to tell him I didn t suppose that he could find anything too young for his taste but I didn t dare Salemina adores cats I went on How is this Sally dear A handsome orange male Persian cat also a tabby immense coat brushes and frills is offered in exchange for an electro plated revolving covered dish or an Allen s Vapour Bath I should like the cat but alas I have no covered dish sighed Salemina Buy one suggested mister Beresford Even then you d be getting a bargain Do you understand that you receive the male orange cat for the dish and the frilled tabby for the bath or do you get both in exchange for either of these articles Read on Miss Hamilton Very well here is one for Francesca A harmonium with seven stops is offered in exchange for a really good Plymouth cockerel hatched in May I should want to know when the harmonium was hatched said Francesca prudently Now you cannot usurp the platform entirely my dear Pen Listen to an English marriage notice from the Times It chances to be the longest one to day but there were others just as remarkable in yesterday s issue On the seventeenth instant at Emmanuel Church Countess of Padelford s connection Weston super Mare by the reverend Canon Vernon B D Rector of saint Edmund the King and Martyr Suffolk Street uncle of bride assisted by the reverend Otho Pelham M A Vicar of All Saints Upper Norwood doctor Philosophial Konrad Rasch of Koetzsenbroda Saxony to Evelyn Whitaker Rake widow of the late Richard Balaclava Rake Barrister at law of the Inner Temple and Bombay and third surviving daughter of George Frederic Goldspink C B of Sydenham House Craig Hill Commissioner of Her Majesty s Customs and formerly of the War Office By the time this was finished we were all quite exhausted but we revived like magic when Salemina read us her contribution A NAME ENSHRINED IN LITERATURE AND RENOWNED IN COMMERCE Miss Willard Waddington Essex Deal with her whenever you possibly can When you want to purchase ask her for anything under the canopy of heaven from jewels bijouterie and curios to rare books and high class articles of utility When you want to sell consign only to her from choice gems to mundane objects All transactions embodying the germs of small profits are welcome As a sample of her stock please note A superlatively exquisite essentially beautiful and important lace flounce for sale at a reasonable price Also a bargain of peerlessly choice character Six grandly glittering paste cluster buttons of important size emitting dazzling rays of incomparable splendour and lustre Don t readily forget this or her name and address Clara Miss Willard the Lady Trader Waddington Essex Immaculate promptitude and scrupulous liberality observed therefore on these credentials ye must deal with her it is the duty of intellect to be reciprocal Just here Dawson entered evidently to lay the dinner cloth but seeing that we had a visitor he took the tea tray and retired discreetly It is five and thirty minutes past six mister Beresford I said Do you think you can get to the Metropole and array yourself and return in less than an hour Because even if you can remember that we ladies have elaborate toilets in prospect toilets intended for the complete prostration of the British gentry Francesca has a yellow gown which will drive Bertie Godolphin to madness Salemina has laid out a soft dovelike grey and steel combination directed towards the Church of England for you may not know that Sally has a vicar in her train mister Beresford and he will probably speak to night As for me Before these shocking personalities were finished Salemina and Francesca had fled to their rooms and mister Beresford took up my broken sentence and said As for you Miss Hamilton whatever gown you wear you are sure to make one man speak if you care about it but I suppose you would not listen to him unless he were English and with that shot he departed I really think I shall have to give up the Francesca hypothesis and alas I am not quite ready to adopt any other We discussed international marriages while we were at our toilets Salemina and I prinking by the light of one small candle end while Francesca as the youngest and prettiest illuminated her charms with the six sitting room candles and three filched from the little table in the hall I gave it as my humble opinion that for an American woman an English husband was at least an experiment Salemina declared that for that matter a husband of any nationality was an experiment Francesca ended the conversation flippantly by saying that in her judgment no husband at all was a much more hazardous experiment Chapter XI The ball on the opposite side We are all three rather tired this morning Salemina Francesca and I for we went to one of the smartest balls of the London season last night and were robbed of half our customary allowance of sleep in consequence It may be difficult for you to understand our weariness when I confess that the ball was not quite of the usual sort that we did not dance at all and what is worse that we were not asked either to tread a measure or sit out a polka or take one last turn To begin at the beginning there is a large vacant house directly opposite Smith s Private Hotel and there has been hanging from its balcony until very lately a sign bearing the following notice THESE COMMANDING PREMISES WITH A SUPERFICIAL AREA OF ten thousand fort AND fifty fort FRONTAGE TO DOVERMARLE saint WILL BE SOLD BY AUCTION ON TUESDAY JUNE twenty eightTH BY MESSRS SKIDDY YADDLETHORPE AND SKIDDY LAND AGENTS AND SURVEYORS twenty seven HASTINGS PLACE PALL MALL A few days ago just as we were finishing a late breakfast an elderly gentleman drove up in a private hansom and alighted at this vacant house on the opposite side Behind him in a cab came two men who unlocked the front door went in came out on the balcony cut the wires supporting the sign took it down opened all the inside shutters and disappeared through some rear entrance The elderly gentleman went upstairs for a moment came down again and drove away The house has been sold I suppose said Salemina and for my part I envy the new owner his bargain He is close to Piccadilly has that bit of side lawn with the superb oak tree and the duke s beautiful gardens so near that they will seem virtually his own when he looks from his upper windows At tea time the same elderly gentleman drove up in a victoria with a very pretty young lady The plot thickens said Francesca who was nearest the window Do you suppose she is his bride elect and is he showing her their future home or is she already his wife If so I fear me she married him for his title and estates for he is more than a shade too old for her Don t be censorious child I remonstrated taking my cup idly across the room to be nearer the scene of action Oh dear there is a slight discrepancy I confess but I can explain it This is how it happened The girl had never really loved and did not know what the feeling was She did know that the aged suitor was a good and worthy man and her mother and nine small brothers and sisters very much out at the toes urged the marriage The father too had speculated heavily in consorts or consuls or whatever you call ems and besought his child not to expose his defalcations and losses She dutiful girl did as she was bid especially as her youngest sister came to her in tears and said Unless you consent we shall have to sell the cow So she went to the altar with a heart full of palpitating respect but no love to speak of that always comes in time to heroines who sacrifice themselves and spare the cows It sounds strangely familiar remarked mister Beresford who was with us as usual Didn t a fellow turn up in the next chapter a young nephew of the old husband who fell in love with the bride unconsciously and against his will Wasn t she obliged to take him into the conservatory at the end of a week and say G go I beseech you for b both our sakes Didn t the noble fellow wring her hand silently and leave her looking like a broken lily on the How can you be so cynical mister Beresford It isn t like you exclaimed Salemina For my part I don t think the girl is either his bride or his fiancee Probably the mother of the family is dead and the father is bringing his eldest daughter to look at the house that s my idea of it This theory being just as plausible as ours we did not discuss it hoping that something would happen to decide the matter in one way or another She is not married I am sure went on Salemina leaning over the back of my chair You notice that she hasn t given a glance at the kitchen or the range although they are the most important features of the house I think she may have just put her head inside the dining room door but she certainly didn t give a moment to the butler s pantry or the china closet You will find that she won t mount to the fifth floor to see how the servants are housed not she careless pretty creature she will go straight to the drawing room And so she did and at the same instant a still younger and prettier creature drove up in a hansom and was out of it almost before the admiring cabby could stop his horse or reach down for his fare She flew up the stairway and danced into the drawing room like a young whirlwind flung open doors pulled up blinds with a jerk letting in the sunlight everywhere and tiptoed to and fro over the dusty floors holding up her muslin flounces daintily This must be the daughter of his first marriage I remarked Who will not get on with the young stepmother finished mister Beresford It is his youngest daughter corrected Salemina the youngest daughter of his only wife and the image of her deceased mother who was in her time the belle of Dublin She might well have been that we all agreed for this young beauty was quite the Irish type such black hair grey blue eyes and wonderful lashes and such a merry arch winsome face that one loved her on the instant She was delighted with the place and we did not wonder for the sunshine streaming in at the back and side windows showed us rooms of noble proportions opening into one another She admired the balcony although we thought it too public to be of any use save for flowering plants she was pleased with a huge French mirror over the marble mantle she liked the chandeliers which were in the worst possible taste all this we could tell by her expressive gestures and she finally seized the old gentleman by the lapels of his coat and danced him breathlessly from the fireplace to the windows and back again while the elder girl clapped her hands and laughed Isn t she lovely sighed Francesca a little covetously although she is something of a beauty herself I am sorry that her name is Bridget said mister Beresford For shame I cried indignantly It is Norah or Veronica or Geraldine or Patricia yes it is Patricia I know it as well as if I had been at the christening Dawson take the tea things please and do you know the name of the gentleman who has bought the house on the opposite side It is Lord Brighton miss You would never believe it but we find the name is spelled Brighthelmston He hasn t bought the ouse he has taken it for a week and is giving a ball there on the Tuesday evening He has four daughters miss and two h orphan nieces that generally spends the season with im It s the youngest daughter he is bringing out that lively one you saw cutting about just now They ave no ballroom I expect in their town ouse which accounts for their renting one for this occasion They stopped a month in this otel last year so I have the honour of m luds acquaintance Lady Brighthelmston is not living I should judge remarked Salemina in the tone of one who thinks it hardly worth while to ask Oh yes miss she s alive and earty but the daughters manages everythink and what they down t manage the h orphan nieces does The ouse is run for the young ladies but m ludanlady seems to enjoy it Dovermarle Street was so interesting during the next few days that we could scarcely bear to leave it lest something exciting should happen in our absence A ball is so confining said Francesca who had come back from the corner of Piccadilly to watch the unloading of a huge van and found that it had no intention of stopping at Number Nine on the opposite side First came a small army of charwomen who scrubbed the house from top to bottom Then came men with canvas for floors bronzes and jardinieres and somebody s family portraits from an auction room chairs and sofas and draperies from an upholsterer s The night before the event itself I announced my intention of staying in our own drawing room the whole of the next day I am more interested in Patricia s debut I said than anything else that can possibly happen in London What if it should be wet and won t it be annoying if it is a cold night and they draw the heavy curtains close together But it was beautiful day almost too warm for a ball and the heavy curtains were not drawn The family did not court observation it was serenely unconscious of such a thing As to our side of the street I think we may have been the only people at all interested in the affair now so imminent The others had something more sensible to do I fancy than patching up romances about their neighbours At noon the florists decorated the entrance with palms covered the balcony with a gay awning and hung the railing with brilliant masses of scarlet and yellow flowers At two the caterers sent silver tables linen and dishes and a Broadwood grand piano was installed but at half past seven when we sat down to dinner we were a trifle anxious because so many things seemed yet to do before the party could be a complete success mister Beresford and his mother were dining with us and we had sent invitations to our London friends the honorable Arthur Ponsonby and Bertie Godolphin to come later in the evening These read as follows Private View The pleasure of your company is requested at the coming out party of The honorable Patricia Brighthelmston July one hundred eighty nine On the opposite side of the street Dancing about ten thirty nine Dovermarle Street At eight o clock as we were finishing our fish course which chanced to be fried sole the ball began literally to roll and it required the greatest ingenuity on Francesca s part and mine to be always down in our seats when Dawson entered with the dishes and always at the window when he was absent An enormous van had appeared with half a dozen men walking behind it In a trice two of them had stretched a wire trellis across one wall of the drawing room and two more were trailing roses from floor to ceiling Others tied the dark wood of the stair railing with tall Madonna lilies then they hung garlands of flowers from corner to corner and alas could not refrain from framing the mirror in smilax nor from hanging the chandeliers with that same ugly funereal and artificial looking vine this idea being the principal stock in trade of every florist in the universe We could not catch even a glimpse of the supper rooms but we saw a man in the fourth story front room filling dozens of little glass vases each with its single malmaison rose or camellia and despatching them by an assistant to another part of the house so we could imagine from this the scheme of decoration at the tables No not new perhaps but simple and effective By the time we had finished our entree which happened to be lamb cutlets and green peas and had begun our roast which was chicken and ham I remember they had put wreaths at all the windows hung Japanese lanterns on the balcony and in the oak tree and transformed the house into a blossoming bower At this exciting juncture Dawson entered unexpectedly with our sweet and for the first and only time caught us literally red handed Let British subjects be interested in their neighbours if they will and when they refrain I am convinced that it is as much indifference as good breeding but let us never bring our country into disrepute with an English butler As there was not a single person at the table when Dawson came in we were obliged to say that we had finished dinner thank you and would take coffee no sweet to night thank you Willie Beresford was the only one who minded but he rather likes cherry tart It simply chanced to be cherry tart for our cook at Smith s Private Hotel is a person of unbridled fancy and endless repertory She sometimes for example substitutes rhubarb for cherry tart quite out of her own head and when balked of both these dainties and thrown absolutely on her own boundless resources will create a dish of stewed green gooseberries and a companion piece of liquid custard These unrelated concoctions when eaten at the same moment as is her intention always remind me of the lying down together of the lion and the lamb and the scheme is well nigh as dangerous under any other circumstances than those of the digestive millennium I tremble to think what would ensue if all the rhubarb and gooseberry bushes in England should be uprooted in a single night I believe that thousands of cooks those not possessed of families or Christian principles would drown themselves in the Thames forthwith but that is neither here nor there and the Honourable Arthur denies it He says Why commit suicide Ain t there currants I had forgotten to say that we ourselves were all en grande toilette down to satin slippers feeling somehow that it was the only proper thing to do and when Dawson had cleared the table and ushered in the other visitors we ladies took our coffee and the men their cigarettes to the three front windows which were open as usual to our balcony We seated ourselves there quite casually as is our custom somewhat hidden by the lace draperies and potted hydrangeas and whatever we saw was to be seen by any passer by save that we held the key to the whole story and had made it our own by right of conquest Just at this moment it was quarter past nine although it was still bright daylight came a little procession of servants who disappeared within the doors and as they donned caps and aprons would now and then reappear at the windows Presently the supper arrived We did not know the number of invited guests there are some things not even revealed to the Wise Woman but although we were a trifle nervous about the amount of eatables we were quite certain that there would be no dearth of liquid refreshment Contemporaneously with the supper came a four wheeler with a man and a woman in it Sal I wonder if that is Lord and Lady Brighthelmston missus B Nonsense my dear look at the woman s dress W B It is probably the butler and I have a premonition that that is good old Nurse with him She has been with family ever since the birth of the first daughter twenty four years ago Look at her cap ribbons note the fit of the stiff black silk over her comfortable shoulders you can almost hear her creak in it B G My eye but she s one to keep the goody pot open for the youngsters She ll be the belle of the ball so far as I m concerned Fran It s impossible to tell whether it s the butler or paterfamilias Yes it s the butler for he has taken off his coat and is looking at the flowers with the florist s assistant B G And the florist s assistant is getting slated like one o clock The butler doesn t like the rum design over the piano no more do I Whatever is the matter with them now They were standing with their faces towards us gesticulating wildly about something on the front wall of the drawing room a place quite hidden from our view They could not decide the matter although the butler intimated that it would quite ruin the ball while the assistant mopped his brow and threw all the blame on somebody else Nurse came in and hated whatever it was the moment her eye fell on it She couldn t think how anybody could abide it and was of the opinion that his ludship would have it down as soon as he arrived Our attention was now distracted by the fact that his ludship did arrive It was ten o clock but barely dark enough yet to make the lanterns effective although they had just been lighted There were two private carriages and two four wheelers from which paterfamilias and one other gentleman alighted followed by a small feminine delegation One young chap to brace up the gov nor said Bertie Godolphin Then the eldest daughter is engaged to be married that s right only three daughters and two h orphan nieces to work off now As the girls scampered in hidden by their long cloaks we could not even discover the two we already knew While they were divesting themselves of their wraps in an upper chamber Nurse hovering over them with maternal solicitude we were anxiously awaiting their criticisms of our preparations Chapter XII Patricia makes her debut For three days we had been overseeing the details Would they approve the result Would they think the grand piano in the proper corner Were the garlands hung too low 
4667-92224-0001	train-other-500	Was the balcony scheme effective Was our menu for the supper satisfactory Were there too many lanterns
none	none	 Lord and Lady Brighthelmston had superintended so little 
4667-92224-0002	train-other-500	and we so much that we felt personally responsible Now came musicians with their instruments The butler sent four melancholy Spanish students to the balcony
none	none	 where they began to tune mandolins and guitars while an Hungarian band took up its position 
4667-92224-0003	train-other-500	we conjectured on some extension or balcony in the rear the existence of which we had not guessed until we heard the music later Then the butler turned on the electric light and the family came into the drawing rooms They did admire them as much as we could wish
4667-92224-0004	train-other-500	and we on our part thoroughly approved of the family We had feared it might prove dull plain dowdy though wellborn with only dear Patricia to enliven it but it was well dressed merry and had not a thought of glancing at the windows or pulling down the blinds bless its simple heart
4667-92224-0005	train-other-500	The mother entered first wearing a grey satin gown and a diamond crown that quite established her position in the great world Then girls and more girls a rose pink girl a pale green a lavender a yellow and our Patricia in a cloud of white
4667-92224-0006	train-other-500	with a sparkle of silver and a diamond arrow in her lustrous hair What an English nosegay they made to be sure as they stood in the back of the room while paterfamilias approached and calling each in turn gave her a lovely bouquet
4667-92224-0007	train-other-500	from a huge basket held by the butler Everybody s flowers matched everybody s frock to perfection those of the h orphan nieces were just as beautiful as those of the daughters
4667-92224-0008	train-other-500	and it is no wonder that the English nosegay descended upon paterfamilias bore him into the passage and if they did not kiss him soundly why did he come back all rosy and crumpled smoothing his dishevelled hair and smiling at Lady Brighthelmston
4667-92224-0009	train-other-500	We speedily named the girls Rose Mignonette Violet and Celandine each after the colour of her frock But there are only five and there ought to be six whispered Salemina as if she expected to be heard across the street
4667-92224-0010	train-other-500	One two three four five you are right said mister Beresford The plainest of the lot must be staying in Wales with a maiden aunt who has a lot of money to leave The old lady isn t so ill that they can t give the ball
none	none	 but just ill enough so that she may make her will wrong if left alone 
4667-92224-0011	train-other-500	poor girl to be plain and then to miss such a ball as this hello the first guest He is on time to be sure I hate to be first don t you The first guest was a strikingly handsome fellow irreproachably dressed and unmistakably nervous
4667-92224-0012	train-other-500	He is afraid he is too early He is afraid that if he waits he ll be too late He doesn t want the driver to stop directly in front of the door He has something beside him on the seat of the hansom The tissue paper has blown off it is flowers
4667-92224-0013	train-other-500	It is a piece Jove this IS a rum ball What IS the thing No wonder he doesn t drive up to the door and go in with it It is a HARP as sure as I am alive Then electrically from Francesca
4667-92224-0014	train-other-500	It is Patricia s Irish lover I forget his name Rory Shamus Michael Patrick Terence Hush she exclaimed at this chorus of Hibernian Christian names
4667-92224-0015	train-other-500	it is Patricia s undeclared impecunious lover He is afraid that she won t know his gift is a harp and afraid that the other girls will He feared to send it lest one of the sisters or h orphan nieces should get it it is frightful to love one of six
none	none	 and the cards are always slipping off and the wrong girl is always receiving your love token or your offer of marriage 
4667-92224-0016	train-other-500	And if it is an offer and the wrong woman gets it she always accepts somehow said mister Beresford It s only the right one who declines and here he certainly looked at me pointedly He hoped to arrive before any one else Francesca went on
none	none	 and put the harp in a nice place and lead Patricia up to it and make her wonder who sent it 
4667-92224-0017	train-other-500	Now poor dear yes his name is sure to be Terence he is too late and I am sure he will leave it in the hansom he will be so embarrassed And so he did but alas the driver came back with it in an instant
4667-92224-0018	train-other-500	the butler ran down the long path of crimson carpet that covered the sidewalk the first footman assisted the second footman pursued Terence and caught him on the staircase and he descended reluctantly only to receive the harp in his arms and send a tip to the cabman
4667-92224-0019	train-other-500	whom of course he was cursing in his heart I can t think why he should give her a harp mused Bertie Godolphin Such a rum thing a harp isn t it It s too heavy for her to tote as you say in the States
4667-92224-0020	train-other-500	Yes we always say tote particularly in the North
none	none	 I replied but perhaps it is Patricia s favourite instrument 
4667-92224-0021	train-other-500	Perhaps Terence first saw her at the harp and loved her from the moment he heard her sing the Minstrel Boy and the Meeting of the Waters Perhaps he merely brought it as a sort of symbol suggested mister Beresford
4667-92224-0022	train-other-500	a kind of flowery metaphor signifying that all Ireland in his person is at her disposal only waiting to be played upon If that is what he means he must be a jolly muff remarked the Honourable Arthur
4667-92224-0023	train-other-500	I should think he d have to send a guidebook with the bloomin thing We never knew how Terence arranged about the incubus we only saw that he did not enter the drawing room with it in his arms He was well received
4667-92224-0024	train-other-500	although there was no special enthusiasm over his arrival but the first guest is always at a disadvantage He greeted the young ladies as if he were in the habit of meeting them often but when he came to Patricia
none	none	 well he greeted her as if he could never meet her often enough there was a distinct difference and even missus Beresford who had been incredulous succumbed to our view of the case Patricia took him over to the piano to see the arrangement of some lilies 
4667-92224-0025	train-other-500	He said they were delicious but looked at her She asked him if he did not think the garlands lovely He said Perfectly charming but never lifted his eyes higher than her face
none	none	 Do you like my dress 
4667-92224-0026	train-other-500	her glance seemed to ask Wonderful his seemed to reply as he stealthily put out his hand and touched a soft fold of its white fluffiness I could hear him think as she leaned into the curve of the Broadwood and bent over the flowers
4667-92224-0027	train-other-500	Have you seen but a bright lily grow Before rude hands have touched it Have you marked but the fall of the snow Before the soil hath smutched it Have you felt the wool of beaver Or swan s down ever Or have smelt o the bud o the brier Or
none	none	 the nard i the fire Or have tasted the bag of the bee Oh so white oh so soft oh so sweet is she 
4667-92224-0028	train-other-500	A footman entered bearing the harp which he placed on a table in the corner He disclaimed all knowledge of it having probably been well paid to do so
none	none	 and the unoccupied girls gathered about it like bees about a honeysuckle while Patricia and Terence stayed by the piano 
4667-92224-0029	train-other-500	To think it may never be a match sighed Francesca and they are such an ideal pair But it is easy to see that the mother will oppose it and although Patricia is her father s darling he cannot allow her to marry a handsome young pauper like Terence
4667-92224-0030	train-other-500	Cheer up said Bertie Godolphin reassuringly
none	none	 Perhaps some unrelenting beggar of an uncle will die of old age next and leave him the title and estates I hope she will accept him to night if she loves him 
4667-92224-0031	train-other-500	estates or no estates said Salemina who like many ladies who have elected to remain single is distinctly sentimental and has not an ounce of worldly wisdom Well I think a fellow deserves some reward remarked mister Beresford
none	none	 when he has the courage to drive up in a hansom bearing a green harp with yellow strings in his arms 
4667-92224-0032	train-other-500	It shows that his passion has quite eclipsed his sense of humour By the way I am not sure but I should choose Rose after all there s something very attractive about Rose It is the fact that she is promised to another laughed Francesca somewhat pertly
4667-92224-0033	train-other-500	She would make an admirable wife missus Beresford interjected absent mindedly and so of course Terence will not choose her and similarly neither would you if you had the chance
none	none	 At this missus Beresford s son glances up at me with twinkling eyes 
4667-92224-0034	train-other-500	and I can hardly forbear smiling so unconscious is she that his choice is already made However he replies Who ever loved a woman for her solid virtues mother Who ever fell a victim to punctuality patience or frugality
none	none	 It is other and different qualities which colour the personality and ensnare the heart though the stodgy and reliable traits hold it 
4667-92224-0035	train-other-500	I dare say when once captured Don t you know Berkeley says
none	none	 D n it madam who falls in love with attributes 
4667-92224-0036	train-other-500	Meantime Violet and Celandine have come out on the balcony and seeing the tinkling musicians there have straightway banished them to another part of the house A good thing too murmured Bertie Godolphin making a beastly row in that nailing little corner
4667-92224-0037	train-other-500	collecting a crowd sooner or later don t you know and putting a dead stop to the jolly little flirtations The Honourable Arthur glanced critically at Celandine I should make up to her he said thoughtfully She s the best groomed one of the whole stud
4667-92224-0038	train-other-500	though why you call her Celandine I can t think It s a flower and her dress is yellow can t you see man
none	none	 You ve got no sense of colour 
4667-92224-0039	train-other-500	said the candid Bertie I believe you d just as soon be a green parrot with a red head as not And now the guests began to arrive so many of them and so near together that we hardly had time to label them as they said good evening and told dear Lady Brighthelmston
4667-92224-0040	train-other-500	how pretty the decorations were and how prevalent the influenza had been
none	none	 and how very sultry the weather and how clever it was of her to give her party in a vacant house and what a delightful marriage Rose was making and how well dear Patricia looked 
4667-92224-0041	train-other-500	The sound of the music drifted into the usually quiet street and by half past eleven the ball was in full splendour Lady Brighthelmston stood alone now greeting all the late arrivals
4667-92224-0042	train-other-500	and we could catch a glimpse now and then of Violet dancing with a beautiful being in a white uniform and of Rose followed about by her accepted lover
none	none	 both of them content with their lot but with feet quite on the solid earth 
4667-92224-0043	train-other-500	Celandine was a bit of a flirt no doubt She had many partners walked in the garden with them impartially divided her dances sat on the stairs Wherever her yellow draperies moved nonsense merriment and chatter followed in her wake
4667-92224-0044	train-other-500	Patricia danced often with Terence We could see the dark head darker and a bit taller than the others move through the throng the diamond arrow gleaming in its lustrous coils She danced like a flower blown by the wind
none	none	 Nothing could have been more graceful more stately 
4667-92224-0045	train-other-500	The bend of her slender body at the waist the pose of her head the line of her shoulder the suggestion of dimple in her elbow all were so many separate allurements to the kindling eye of love
none	none	 Terence certainly added little to the general brilliancy and gaiety of the occasion 
4667-92224-0046	train-other-500	for he stood in a corner and looked at Patricia whenever he was not dancing with her
none	none	 all eye when one was present all memory when one was gone Chapter XIII A Penelope secret Shortly after midnight our own little company broke up loath to leave the charming spectacle The guests departed with the greatest reluctance having given Dawson a half sovereign for waiting up to lock the door missus Beresford said that it seemed unendurable to leave matters in such an unfinished condition and her son promised to come very early next morning for the latest bulletins I leave all the romances in your hands he whispered to me do let them turn out happily do Salemina also retired to her virtuous couch remembering that she was to visit infant schools with a great educational dignitary on the morrow Francesca and I turned the gas entirely out although we had been sitting all the evening in a kind of twilight and slipping on our dressing gowns sat again at the window for a farewell peep into the past present and future of the Brighthelmston set At midnight the dowager duchess arrived She must at least have been a dowager duchess and if there is anything greater within the bounds of a reasonable imagination she was that Long streamers of black tulle floated from a diamond soup tureen which surmounted her hair Narrow puffings of white traversed her black velvet gown in all directions making her look somewhat like a railway map and a diamond fan chain defined or attempted to define what was in its nature neither definable nor confinable to wit her waist or what had been in early youth her waist The entire company was stirred by the arrival of the dowager duchess and it undoubtedly added new eclat to what was already a fashionable event for we counted three gentlemen who wore orders glittering on ribbons that crossed the white of their immaculate linen and there was an Indian potentate with a jewelled turban who divided attention with the dowager duchess s diamond soup tureen At twelve thirty Lord Brighthelmston chided Celandine for flirting too much At twelve forty Lady Brighthelmston reminded Violet who was a h orphan niece that the beautiful being in the white uniform was not the eldest son At twelve fifty there arrived an elderly gentleman before whom the servants bowed low Lord Brighthelmston went to fetch Patricia who chanced to be sitting out a dance with Terence The three came out on the balcony which was deserted in the near prospect of supper and the personage whom we suspected to be Patricia s godfather took from his waistcoat pocket a string of pearls and clasping it round her white throat stooped gently and kissed her forehead Then at one o clock came supper Francesca and I had secretly provided for that contingency and curling up on a sofa we drew toward us a little table which Dawson had spread with a galantine of chicken some cress sandwiches and a jug of milk At one thirty we were quite overcome with sleep and retired to our beds where of course we speedily grew wakeful It is giving a ball not going to one that is so exhausting yawned Francesca How many times have I danced all night with half the fatigue that I am feeling now The sound of music came across the street through the closed door of our sitting room Waltz after waltz a polka a galop then waltzes again until our brains reeled with the rhythm As if this were not enough when our windows at the back were opened wide we were quite within reach of Lady Durden s small dance where another Hungarian band discoursed more waltzes and galops Dancing dancing everywhere and not a turn for us grumbled Francesca I simply cannot sleep can you We must make a determined effort I advised don t speak again and perhaps drowsiness will overtake us It finally did overtake Francesca but I had too much to think about my own problems as well as Patricia s After what seemed to be hours of tossing I was helplessly drawn back into the sitting room just to see if anything had happened and if the affair was ever likely to come to an end It was half past two and yes the ball was decidedly thinning out The attendants in the lower hall when they were not calling carriages yawned behind their hands and stood first on one foot and then on the other Women in beautiful wraps their heads flashing with jewels descended the staircase and drove or even walked away into the summer night Lady Brighthelmston began to look tired although all the world as it said good night was telling her that it was one of the most delightful balls of the season The English nosegay had lost its white flower for Patricia was not in the family group I looked everywhere for the gleam of her silvery scarf everywhere for Terence while the waltz music having ceased the Spanish students played Love s Young Dream I hummed the words as the sweet old tune strummed by the tinkling mandolins vibrated clearly in the maze of other sounds Oh the days have gone when Beauty bright My heart s chain wove When my dream of life from morn till night Was Love still Love New hope may bloom and days may come Of milder calmer beam But there s nothing half so sweet in life As Love s Young Dream At last in a quiet spot under the oak tree the lately risen moon found Patricia s diamond arrow and discovered her to me The Japanese lanterns had burned out she was wrapped like a young nun in a cloud of white that made her eyelashes seem darker I looked once because the moonbeam led me into it before I realised then I stole away from the window and into my own room closing the door softly behind me We had so far been looking only at conventionalities preliminaries things that all who had eyes to see might see but this was different quite quite different They were as beautiful under the friendly shadow of their urban oak tree as were ever Romeo and Juliet on the balcony of the Capulets I may not tell you what I saw in my one quickly repented of glance That would be vulgarising something that was already a little profaned by my innocent participation I do not know whether Terence was heir even ever so far removed to any title or estates and I am sure Patricia did not care he may have been vulgarly rich or aristocratically poor I only know that they loved each other in the old yet ever new way without any ifs or ands or buts that he worshipped she honoured he asked humbly she gave gladly How do I know Ah that s a Penelope secret as Francesca says Perhaps you doubt my intuitions altogether Perhaps you believe in your heart that it was an ordinary ball where a lot of stupid people arrived danced supped and departed Perhaps you do not think his name was Terence or hers Patricia and if you go so far as that in blindness and incredulity I should not expect you to translate properly what I saw last night under the oak tree the night of the ball on the opposite side when Patricia made her debut Chapter XIV Love and lavender How well I remember our last evening in Dovermarle Street At one of our open windows behind the potted ferns and blossoming hydrangeas sat Salemina Bertie Godolphin missus Beresford the Honourable Arthur and Francesca at another as far off as possible sat Willie Beresford and I missus Beresford had sanctioned a post prandial cigar for we were not going out till ten to see for the second time an act of John Hare s Pair of Spectacles They were talking and laughing at the other end of the room mister Beresford and I were rather quiet Why is it that the people with whom one loves to be silent are also the very ones with whom one loves to talk The room was dim with the light of a single lamp the rain had ceased the roar of Piccadilly came to us softened by distance A belated vendor of lavender came along the sidewalk and as he stopped under the windows the pungent fragrance of the flowers was wafted up to us with his song Who ll buy my pretty lavender Sweet lavender Who ll buy my pretty lavender Sweet bloomin lavender The tune comes to me laden with odours Is it not strange that the fragrances of other days steal in upon the senses together with the sights and sounds that gave them birth Presently a horse and cart drew up before an hotel a little further along on the opposite side of the way By the light of the street lamp under which it stopped we could see that it held a piano and two persons beside the driver The man was masked and wore a soft felt hat and a velvet coat He seated himself at the piano and played a Chopin waltz with decided sentiment and brilliancy then touching the keys idly for a moment or two he struck a few chords of prelude and turned towards the woman who sat beside him She rose and laying one hand on the corner of the instrument began to sing one of the season s favourites The Song that reached my Heart She also was masked and even her figure was hidden by a long dark cloak the hood of which was drawn over her head to meet the mask She sang so beautifully with such style and such feeling it seemed incredible to hear her under circumstances like these She followed the ballad with Handel s Lascia ch io pianga which rang out into the quiet street with almost hopeless pathos When she descended from the cart to undertake the more prosaic occupation of passing the hat beneath the windows I could see that she limped slightly and that the hand with which she pushed back the heavy dark hair under the hood was beautifully moulded They were all mystery that couple not to be confounded for an instant with the common herd of London street musicians With what an air of the drawing room did he of the velvet coat help the singer into the cart and with what elegant abandon and ultra dilettantism did he light a cigarette reseat himself at the piano and weave Scots ballads into a charming impromptu I confess I wrapped my shilling in a bit of paper and dropped it over the balcony with the wish that I knew the tragedy behind this little street drama Willie Beresford was in a royal mood that night You know the mood in which the heart is so full so full it overruns the brim He bought the entire stock of the lavender seller and threw a shilling to the mysterious singer for every song she sung He even offered to give himself to me And oh I would have taken him as gladly as ever the lavender boy took the half crown had I been quite quite sure of myself A woman with a vocation ought to be still surer than other women that it is the very jewel of love she is setting in her heart and not a sparkling imitation I gave myself wholly or believed that I gave myself wholly to art or what I believed to be art And is there anything more sacred than art Yes one thing It happened something in this wise The singing had put us in a gentle mood and after a long peroration from mister Beresford which I do not care to repeat I said very softly blessing the Honourable Arthur s vociferous laughter at one of Salemina s American jokes But I thought perhaps it was Francesca Are you quite sure He intimated that if there were any fact in his repertory of which he was particularly and absolutely sure it was this special fact It is too sudden I objected Plants that blossom on shipboard This plant was rooted in American earth and you know it Penelope If it chanced to blossom on the ship it was because it had already budded on the shore it has borne transplanting to a foreign soil and it grows in beauty and strength every day so no slurs please concerning ocean steamer hothouses I cannot say yes yet I dare not say no it is too soon I must go off into the country quite by myself and think it over But urged mister Beresford you cannot think over a matter of this kind by yourself You ll continually be needing to refer to me for data don t you know on which to base your conclusions How can you tell whether you re in love with me or not if No I am not shouting at all it s your guilty conscience I m whispering How can you tell whether you re in love with me I repeat unless you keep me under constant examination That seems sensible though I dare say it is full of sophistry but I have made up my mind to go into the country and paint while Salemina and Francesca are on the Continent One cannot think in this whirl A winter season in Washington followed by a summer season in London one wants a breath of fresh air before beginning another winter season somewhere else Be a little patient please I long for the calm that steals over me when I am absorbed in my brushes and my oils Work is all very well said mister Beresford with determination but I know your habits You have a little way of taking your brush and with one savage sweep painting out a figure from your canvas Now if I am on the canvas of your heart I say if tentatively and modestly as becomes me I ve no intention of allowing you to paint me out therefore I wish to remain in the foreground where I can say Strike but hear me if I discover any hostile tendencies in your eye But I am thankful for small favours the no you do not quite dare say for instance and I ll talk it over with you to morrow if the British gentry will give me an opportunity and if you ll deign to give me a moment alone in any other place than the Royal Academy I was alone with you to day for a whole hour at least Yes first at the London and Westminster Bank second in Trafalgar Square and third on the top of a bus none of them congenial spots to a man in my humour Penelope you are not dull but you don t seem to understand that I am head over What are you two people quarrelling about cried Salemina Come Penelope get your wrap missus Beresford isn t she charming in her new Liberty gown If that New York wit had seen her he couldn t have said If that is Liberty give me Death Yes Francesca you must wear something over your shoulders Whistle for two four wheelers Dawson please Part Second In the country Chapter XV Penelope dreams West Belvern Holly House August one hundred eighty nine I am here alone Salemina has taken her little cloth bag and her notebook and gone to inspect the educational and industrial methods of Germany If she can discover anything that they are not already doing better in Boston she will take it back with her but her state of mind regarding the outcome of the trip might be described as one of incredulity tinged with hope Francesca has accompanied Salemina Not that the inspection of systems is much in her line but she prefers it to a solitude a deux with me when I am in a working mood and she comforts herself with the anticipation that the German army is very attractive Willie Beresford has gone with his mother to Aix les Bains like the dutiful son that he is They say that a good son makes a good But that subject is dismissed to the background for the present for we are in a state of armed neutrality He has agreed to wait until the autumn for a final answer and I have promised to furnish one by that time Meanwhile we are to continue our acquaintance by post which is a concession I would never have allowed if I had had my wits about me After paying my last week s bill in Dovermarle Street including fees to several servants whom I knew by sight and several others whose acquaintance I made for the first time at the moment of departure I glanced at my ebbing letter of credit and felt a season of economy setting in upon me with unusual severity accordingly I made an experiment of coming third class to Belvern I handed the guard a shilling and he gave me a seat riding backwards in a carriage with seven other women all very frumpish but highly respectable As he could not possibly have done any worse for me I take it that he considered the shilling a graceful tribute to his personal charms but as having no other bearing whatever The seven women stared at me throughout the journey When one is really of the same blood and when one does not open one s lips or wave the stars and stripes in any possible manner how do they detect the American These women looked at me as if I were a highly interesting anthropoidal ape It was not because of my attire for I was carefully dressed down to a third class level yet when I removed my plain Knox hat and leaned my head back against my travelling pillow an electrical shudder of intense excitement ran through the entire compartment When I stooped to tie my shoe another current was set in motion and when I took Charles Reade s White Lies from my portmanteau they glanced at one another as if to say Would that we could see in what language the book is written As a travelling mystery I reached my highest point at Oxford for there I purchased a small basket of plums from a boy who handed them in at the window of the carriage After eating a few I offered the rest to a dowdy elderly woman on my left who was munching dry biscuits from a paper bag What next was the facial expression of the entire company My neighbour accepted the plums but hid them in her bag plainly thinking them poisoned and believing me to be a foreign conspirator conspiring against England through the medium of her inoffensive person In the course of the four hours journey I could account for the strange impression I was making only upon the theory that it is unusual to comport oneself in a first class manner in a third class carriage All my companions chanced to be third class by birth as well as by ticket and the Englishwoman who is born third class is sometimes deficient in imagination Upon arriving at Great Belvern which must be pronounced Bevern I took a trap had my luggage put on in front and start on my quest for lodgings in West Belvern five miles distant Several addresses had been given me by Hilda Mellifica who has spent much time in this region and who begged me to use her name I told the driver that I wished to find a clean comfortable lodging with the view mentioned in the guide book and with a purple clematis over the door if possible The last point astounded him to such a degree that he had I think a serious idea of giving me into custody I should not be so eccentrically spontaneous with these people if they did not feed my sense of humour by their amazement We visited Holly House Osborne saint James Victoria and Albert houses Tank Villa Poplar Villa Rose Brake and Thorn Villas as well as Hawthorn Gorse Fern Shrubbery and Providence Cottages All had apartments but many were taken and many more had rooms either dark and stuffy or without view Holly House was my first stopping place Why will a woman voluntarily call her place by a name which she can never pronounce It is my landlady s misfortune that she is named Obbs and mine that I am called Amilton but missus Obbs must have rushed with eyes wide open on Olly Ouse I found sitting room and bedroom at Holly House for two guineas a week everything except roof extra This was more than in my new spirit of economy I desired to pay but after exhausting my list I was obliged to go back rather than sleep in the highroad missus Hobbs offered to deduct two shillings a week if I stayed until Christmas and said she should not charge me a penny for the linen Thanking her with tears of gratitude I requested dinner There was no meat in the house so I supped frugally off two boiled eggs a stodgy household loaf and a mug of ale after which I climbed the stairs and retired to my feather bed in a rather depressed frame of mind Visions of Salemina and Francesca driving under the linden trees in Berlin flitted across my troubled reveries with glimpses of Willie Beresford and his mother at Aix les Bains At this distance and in the dead of night my sacrifice in coming here seemed fruitless Why did I not allow myself to drift for ever on that pleasant sea which has been lapping me in sweet and indolent content these many weeks Of what use to labour to struggle to deny myself for an art to which I can never be more than the humblest handmaiden I felt like crying out as did once a braver woman s soul than mine Let me be weak I have been seeming to be strong so many years The woman and the artist in me have always struggled for the mastery So far the artist has triumphed and now all at once the woman is uppermost I should think the two ought to be able to live peaceably in the same tenement they do manage it in some cases but it seems a law of my being that I shall either be all one or all the other The question for me to ask myself now is Am I in love with loving and with being loved or am I in love with Willie Beresford How many women have confounded the two I wonder In this mood I fell asleep and on a sudden I found myself in a dear New England garden The pillow slipped away and my cheek pressed a fragrant mound of mignonette the self same one on which I hid my tear stained face and sobbed my heart out in childish grief and longing for the mother who would never hold me again The moon came up over the Belvern Hills and shone on my half closed lids but to me it was a very different moon the far away moon of my childhood with a river rippling beneath its silver rays And the wind that rustled among the poplar branches outside my window was in my dream stirring the pink petals of a blossoming apple tree that used to grow beside the bank of mignonette wafting down sweet odours and drinking in sweeter ones And presently there stole in upon this harmony of enchanting sounds and delicate fragrances in which childhood and womanhood pleasure and pain memory and anticipation seemed strangely intermingled the faint music of a voice growing clearer and clearer as my ear became familiar with its cadences And what the dream voice said to me was something like this If thou wouldst have happiness choose neither fame which doth not long abide nor power which stings the hand that wields it nor gold which glitters but never glorifies but choose thou Love and hold it for ever in thy heart of hearts for Love is the purest and the mightiest force in the universe and once it is thine all other gifts shall be added unto thee Love that is passionate yet reverent tender yet strong selfish in desiring all yet generous in giving all love of man for woman and woman for man of parent for child and friend for friend when this is born in the soul the desert blossoms as the rose Straightway new hopes and wishes sweet longings and pure ambitions spring into being like green shoots that lift their tender heads in sunny places and if the soil be kind they grow stronger and more beautiful as each glad day laughs in the rosy skies And by and by singing birds come and build their nests in the branches and these are the pleasures of life And the birds sing not often because of a serpent that lurketh in the garden And the name of the serpent is Satiety He maketh the heart to grow weary of what it once danced and leaped to think upon and the ear to wax dull to the melody of sounds that once were sweet and the eye blind to the beauty that once led enchantment captive And sometimes we know not why but we shall know hereafter for life is not completely happy since it is not heaven nor completely unhappy since it is the road thither sometimes the light of the sun is withdrawn for a moment and that which is fairest vanishes from the place that was enriched by its presence Yet the garden is never quite deserted Modest flowers whose charms we had not noted when youth was bright and the world seemed ours now lift their heads in sheltered places and whisper peace The morning song of the birds is hushed for the dawn breaks less rosily in the eastern skies but at twilight they still come and nestle in the branches that were sunned in the smile of love and watered with its happy tears And over the grave of each buried hope or joy stands an angel with strong comforting hands and patient smile and the name of the garden is Life and the angel is Memory Chapter XVI The decay of Romance I have changed my Belvern and there are so many others left to choose from that I might live in a different Belvern each week North South East and West Belvern New Belvern Old Belvern Great Belvern Little Belvern Belvern Link Belvern Common and Belvern Wells They are all nestled together in the velvet hollows or on the wooded crowns of the matchless Belvern Hills from which they look down upon the fairest plains that ever blessed the eye One can see from their heights a score of market towns and villages three splendid cathedrals each in a different county the queenly Severn winding like a silver thread among the trees with soft flowing Avon and gentle Teme watering the verdant meadows through which they pass All these hills and dales were once the Royal Forest and afterwards the Royal Chase of Belvern covering nearly seven thousand acres in three counties and from the lonely height of the Beacon no less than Twelve fair counties saw the blaze of signals when the country was threatened by a Spanish invasion As for me I mourn the decay of Romance with a great R we have it still among us but we spell it with a smaller letter It must be so much more interesting to be threatened with an invasion especially a Spanish invasion than with a strike for instance The clashing of swords and the flashing of spears in the sunshine are so much more dazzling and inspiring than a line of policemen with clubs Yes I wish it were the age of chivalry again and that I were looking down from these hills into the Royal Chase Of course I know that there were wicked and selfish tyrants in those days before the free press the jury system and the folding bed had wrought their beneficent influences upon the common mind and heart Of course they would have sneered at Browning Societies and improved tenements and of course they did not care a penny whether woman had the ballot or not so long as man had the bottle but I would that the other moderns were enjoying the modern improvements and that I were gazing into the cool depths of those deep forests where there were once good lairs for the wolf and wild boar I should like to hear the baying of the hounds and the mellow horns of the huntsman I should like to see the royal cavalcade emerging from one of those wooded glades monarch and baron bold proud prelate abbot and prior belted knight and ladye fair sweeping in gorgeous array under the arcades of the overshadowing trees silver spurs and jewelled trappings glittering in the sunlight princely forms bending low over the saddles of the court beauties Why oh why is it not possible to be picturesque and pious in the same epoch Why may not chivalry and charity go hand in hand It amuses me to imagine the amazement of the barons bold and belted knights could they be resuscitated for a sufficient length of time to gaze upon the hydropathic establishments which dot their ancient hunting grounds It would have been very difficult to interest the age of chivalry in hydropathy Such is the fascination of historic association that I am sure if I could drag my beloved but conscientious Salemina from some foreign soup kitchen which she is doubtless inspecting I could make even her mourn the vanished past with me this morning on the Beacon s towering head For Salemina wearies of the age of charity sometimes as every one does who is trying to make it a beautiful possibility Chapter XVII Short stops and long bills The manner of my changing from West to North Belvern was this When I had been two days at Holly House I reflected that my sitting room faced the wrong way for the view and that my bedroom was dark and not large enough to swing a cat in Not that there was the remotest necessity of my swinging cats in it but the figure of speech is always useful Neither did I care to occupy myself with the perennial inspection and purchase of raw edibles when I wished to live in an ideal world and paint a great picture missus Hobbs would come to my bedside in the morning and ask me if I would like to buy a fowl When I looked upon the fowl limp in death with its headless neck hanging dejectedly over the edge of the plate its giblets and kidneys lying in immodest confusion on the outside of itself and its liver tucked under its wing poor thing I never wanted to buy it But one morning in taking my walk I chanced upon an idyllic spot the front of the whitewashed cottage embowered in flowers bird cages built into these bowers a little notice saying Canaries for Sale and an English rose of a baby sitting in the path stringing hollyhock buds There was no apartment sign but I walked in ostensibly to buy some flowers I met missus Bobby loved her at first sight the passion was reciprocal and I wheedled her into giving me her own sitting room and the bedroom above it It only remained now for me to break my projected change of residence to my present landlady and this I distinctly dreaded Of course missus Hobbs said when I timidly mentioned the subject that she wished she had known I was leaving an hour before for she had just refused a lady and her husband most desirable persons who looked as if they would be permanent Can it be that lodgers radiate the permanent or transitory quality quite unknown to themselves I was very much embarrassed as she threatened to become tearful and as I was determined never to give up missus Bobby I said desperately I must leave you missus Hobbs I must indeed but as you seem to feel so badly about it I ll go out and find you another lodger in my place The fact is I had seen not long before a lady going in and out of houses as I had done on the night of my arrival and it occurred to me that I might pursue her and persuade her to take my place in Holly House and buy the headless fowl I walked for nearly an hour before I was rewarded with a glimpse of my victim s grey dress whisking round the corner of Pump Street I approached and with a smile that was intended to be a justification in itself I explained my somewhat unusual mission She was rather unreceptive at first she thought evidently that I was to have a percentage on her if I succeeded in capturing her alive and delivering her to missus Hobbs but she was very weary and discouraged and finally fell in with my plans She accompanied me home was introduced to missus Hobbs and engaged my rooms from the following day As she had a sister she promised to be a more lucrative incumbent than I she enjoyed ordering food in a raw state did not care for views and thought purple clematis vines only a shelter for insects so every one was satisfied and I most of all when I wrestled with missus Hobb s itemised bill for two nights and one day Her weekly account must be rolled on a cylinder I should think like the list of Don Juan s amours for the bill of my brief residence beneath her roof was quite three feet in length each of the following items being set down every twenty four hours Apartments Ale Bath Kidney beans Candles Vegetable marrow Tea Eggs Butter Bread Cut off joint Plums Potatoes Chops Kipper Rasher Salt Pepper Vinegar Sugar Washing towels Lights Kitchen fire Sitting room fire Attendance Boots The total was seventeen shillings and sixpence and as missus Hobbs wrote upon it in her neat English hand Received payment with respectful thanks she carefully blotted the wet ink and remarked casually that service was not included in attendance but that she would leave the amount to me Chapter XVIII I meet missus Bobby missus Bobby and I were born for each other though we have been a long time in coming together She is the pink of neatness and cheeriness and she has a broad comfortable bosom on which one might lay a motherless head if one felt lonely in a stranger land I never look at her without remembering what the poet Samuel Rogers said of Lady Parke She is so good that when she goes to heaven she will find no difference save that her ankles will be thinner and her head better dressed No raw fowls visit my bedside here food comes as I wish it to come when I am painting like manna from heaven missus Bobby brings me three times a day something to eat and though it is always whatever she likes I always agree in her choice and send the blue dishes away empty She asked me this morning if I enjoyed my h egg and remarked that she had only one fowl but it laid an egg for me every morning so I might know it was fresh as fresh It is certainly convenient the fowl lays the egg from seven to seven thirty I eat it from eight to eight thirty no haste no waste Never before have I seen such heavenly harmony between supply and demand Never before have I been in such visible and unbroken connection with the source of my food If I should ever desire two eggs or if the fowl should turn sulky or indolent I suppose missus Bobby would have to go half a mile to the nearest shop but as yet everything has worked to a charm The cow is milked into my pitcher in the morning and the fowl lays her egg almost literally in my egg cup One of the little Bobbies pulls a kidney bean or a tomato or digs a potato for my dinner about half an hour before it is served There is a sheep in the garden but I hardly think it supplies the chops those at least are not raised on the premises One grievance I did have at first but missus Bobby removed the thorn from the princess pillow as soon as it was mentioned Our next door neighbour had a kennel of homesick discontented and sleepless puppies of various breeds that were in the habit of howling all night until missus Bobby expostulated with missus Gooch in my behalf She told me that she found missus Gooch very snorty very snorty indeed because the pups were an obby of her usbants whereupon missus Bobby responded that if missus Gooch s usbant ad to ave an obby it was a shame it ad to be owling pups to keep h innocent people awake o nights The puppies were removed but I almost felt guilty at finding fault with a dog in this country It is a matter of constant surprise to me and it always give me a warm glow in the region of the heart to see the supremacy of the dog in England He is respected admired loved and considered as he deserves to be everywhere but as he frequently is not He is admitted on all excursions he is taken into the country for his health he is a factor in all the master plans in short the English dog is a member of the family in good and regular standing My interior surroundings are all charming My little sitting room out of which I turned missus Bobby is bright with potted ferns and flowering plants and on its walls besides the photographs of a large and unusually plain family I have two works of art which inspire me anew every time I gaze at them the first a scriptural subject treated by an enthusiastic but inexperienced hand Susanne dans le Bain surprise par les Deux Vieillards the second The White Witch of Worcester on her Way to the Stake at High Cross The unfortunate lady in the latter picture is attired in a white lawn wrapper with angel sleeves and is followed by an abbess with prayer book and eight surpliced choir boys with candles I have been long enough in England to understand the significance of the candles Doubtless the White Witch had paid four shillings a week for each of them in her prison lodging and she naturally wished to burn them to the end One has no need though of pictures on the walls here for the universe seems unrolled at one s very feet As I look out of my window the last thing before I go to sleep I see the lights of Great Belvern the dim shadows of the distant cathedral towers the quaint priory seven centuries old and just the outline of Holly Bush Hill a sacred seat of magic science when the Druids investigated the secrets of the stars and sought by auspices and sacrifices to forecast the future and to penetrate the designs of the gods It makes me feel very new very undeveloped to look out of that window If I were an Englishwoman say the fifty fifth duchess of something I could easily glow with pride to think that I was part and parcel of such antiquity the fortunate heiress not only of land and titles but of historic associations But as I am an American with a very recent background I blow out my candle with the feeling that it is rather grand to be making history for somebody else to inherit Chapter XIX The heart of the artist I am almost too comfortable with missus Bobby In fact I wished to be just a little miserable in Belvern so that I could paint with a frenzy Sometimes when I have been in a state of almost despairing loneliness and gloom the colours have glowed on my canvas and the lines have shaped themselves under my hand independent of my own volition Now tucked away in a corner of my consciousness is the knowledge that I need never be lonely again unless I choose When I yield myself fully to the sweet enchantment of this thought I feel myself in the mood to paint sunshine flowers and happy children s faces yet I am sadly lacking in concentration all the same The fact is I am no artist in the true sense of the word My hope flies ever in front of my best success and that momentary success does not deceive me in the very least I know exactly how much or rather how little I am worth that I lack the imagination the industry the training the ambition to achieve any lasting results I have the artistic temperament in so far that it is impossible for me to work merely for money or popularity or indeed for anything less than the desire to express the best that is in me without fear or favour It would never occur to me to trade on present approval and dash off unworthy stuff while I have command of the market I am quite above all that but I am distinctly below that other mental and spiritual level where art is enough where pleasure does not signify where one shuts oneself up and produces from sheer necessity where one is compelled by relentless law where sacrifice does not count where ideas throng the brain and plead for release in expression where effort is joy and the prospect of doing something enduring lures the soul on to new and ever new endeavour so I shall never be rich or famous What shall I paint to day Shall it be the bit of garden underneath my window with the tangle of pinks and roses and the cabbages growing appetisingly beside the sweet williams the woodbine climbing over the brown stone wall the wicket gate and the cherry tree with its fruit hanging red against the whitewashed cottage Ah if I could only paint it so truly that you could hear the drowsy hum of the bees among the thyme and smell the scented hay meadows in the distance and feel that it is midsummer in England That would indeed be truth and that would be art Shall I paint the Bobby baby as he stoops to pick the cowslips and the flax his head as yellow and his eyes as blue as the flowers themselves or that bank opposite the gate with its gorse bushes in golden bloom its mountain ash hung with scarlet berries its tufts of harebells blossoming in the crevices of rock and the quaint low clock tower at the foot Can I not paint all these in the full glow of summer time in my secret heart whenever I open the door a bit and admit its life giving warmth and beauty I think I can if I can only quit dreaming I wonder how the great artists worked and under what circumstances they threw aside the implements of their craft impatient of all but the throb of life itself Could Raphael paint Madonnas the week of his betrothal Did Thackeray write a chapter the day his daughter was born Did Plato philosophise freely when he was in love Were there interruptions in the world s great revolutions histories dramas reforms poems and marbles when their creators fell for a brief moment under the spell of the little blind tyrant who makes slaves of us all It must have been so Your chronometer heart on whose pulsations you can reckon as on the procession of the equinoxes never gave anything to the world unless it were a system of diet or something quite uncoloured and unglorified by the imagination Chapter XX A canticle to Jane There are many donkeys owned in these nooks among the hills and some of the thriftier families keep donkey chairs or cheers as they call them to let to the casual summer visitor This vehicle is a regular Bath chair into which the donkey is harnessed Some of them have a tiny driver s seat where a small lad sits beating and berating the donkey for the incumbent generally a decrepit dowager from London Other chairs are minus this absurd coachman s perch and in this sort I take my daily drives I hire the miniature chariot from an old woman who dwells at the top of Gorse Hill and who charges one and fourpence the hour It is a little more when she fetches the donkey to the door or when the weather is wet or the day is very warm or there is an unusual breeze blowing or I wish to go round the hills but under ordinary circumstances which may at any time occur but which never do one and four the hour It is only a shilling if you have the boy to drive you but of course if you drive yourself you throw the boy out of employment and have to pay extra It was in this fashion and on these elastic terms that I first met you Jane and this chapter shall be sacred to you Jane the long eared Jane the iron jawed Jane the stubborn Jane donkeyer than other donkeys in a word MULIER It may be that Jane has made her bow to the public before this If she has ever come into close relation with man or woman possessed of the instinct of self expression then this is certainly not her first appearance in print for no human being could know Jane and fail to mention her Pause Jane this you will do gladly I am sure since pausing is the one accomplishment to which you lend yourself with special energy pause Jane while I sing a canticle to your character Jane is a tiny person I was about to say for she has so strong an individuality that I can scarcely think of her as less than human Jane is a tiny solemn creature looking all docility and decorum with long hair of a subdued tan colour very much worn off in patches I fear by the offending toe of man I am a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and I hope that I am as tender hearted as most women nevertheless I can understand how a man of weak principle and violent temper or a man possessed of a desire to get to a particular spot not favoured by Jane or by a wish to reach any spot by a certain hour I can understand how such a man carried away by helpless wrath might possibly ruffle Jane s sad coloured hair with the toe of his boot Jane is small yet mighty She is multum in parvo she is the rock of Gibraltar in animate form she is cosmic obstinacy on four legs When following out the devices and desires of her own heart or resisting the devices and desires of yours she can put a pressure of five hundred tons on the bit She is further fortified by the possession of legs which have iron rods concealed in them these iron rods terminating in stout grip hooks with which she takes hold on mother earth with an expression that seems to say This rock shall fly From its firm base as soon as I When I start out in the afternoon missus Bobby frequently asks me where I am going I always answer that I have not made up my mind though what I really mean to say is that Jane has not made up her mind She never makes up her mind until after I have made up mine lest by some unhappy accident she might choose the very excursion that I desire myself Chapter XXI I remember I remember For example I wish to visit saint Bridget s Well concerning which there are some quaint old verses in a village history Out of thy famous hille There daylie springyeth A water passynge stille That alwayes bringyeth Grete comfort to all them That are diseased men And makes them well again To prayse the Lord Hast thou a wound to heale The wyche doth greve thee Come thenn unto this welle It will relieve thee Nolie me tangeries And other maladies Have there theyr remedies Prays d be the Lord saint Bridget s Well is a beautiful spot and my desire to see it is a perfectly laudable one In strict justice it is really no concern of Jane whether my wishes are laudable or not but it only makes the case more flagrant when she interferes with the reasonable plans of a reasonable being Never since the day we first met have I harboured a thought that I wished to conceal from Jane would that she could say as much nevertheless she treats me as if I were a monster of caprice As I said before I wish to visit saint Bridget s Well but Jane absolutely refuses to take me there After we pass Belvern churchyard we approach two roads the one to the right leads to the Holy Well the one to the left leads to Shady Dell Farm where Jane lived when she was a girl At the critical moment I pull the right rein with all my force In vain Jane is always overcome by sentiment when she sees that left hand road She bears to the left like a whirlwind and nothing can stop her mad career until she is again amid the scenes so dear to her recollection the beloved pastures where the mother still lives at whose feet she brayed in early youth Now this is all very pretty and touching Her action has in truth its springs in a most commendable sentiment that I should be the last to underrate Shady Dell Farm is interesting too for once if one can swallow one s wrath and dudgeon at being taken there against one s will and one feels that Jane s parents and Jane s early surroundings must be worth a single visit if they could produce a donkey of such unusual capacity Still she must know if she knows anything that a person does not come from America and pay one and fourpence the hour or thereabouts merely in order to visit the home of her girlhood which is neither mentioned in Baedeker nor set down in the local guide books as a feature of interest Whether in addition to her affection for Shady Dell Farm she has an objection to saint Bridget s Well and thus is strengthened by a double motive I do not know She may consider it a relic of popish superstition she may be a Protestant donkey she is a Dissenter there s no doubt about that But you ask have you tried various methods of bringing her to terms and gaining your own desires Certainly I have coaxed beaten prodded prayed I have tried leading her past the Shady Dell turn she walks all over my feet and then starts for home I running behind until I can catch up with her I have offered her one and tenpence the hour she remained firm One morning I had a happy inspiration I determined on conquering Jane by a subterfuge I said to myself I am going to start for saint Bridget s Well as usual several yards before we reach the two roads I shall begin pulling not the right but the left rein Jane will lift her ears suddenly and say to herself What has this girl fallen in love with my birthplace at last and does she now prefer it to saint Bridget s Well Then she shall not have it Whereupon Jane will race madly down the right hand road for the first time I pulling steadily at the left rein to keep up appearances and I shall at last realise my wishes This was my inspiration Would you believe that it failed utterly It should have succeeded and would with an ordinary donkey but Jane saw through it She obeyed my pull on the left rein and went to Shady Dell Farm as usual Another of Jane s eccentricities is a violent aversion to perambulators As Belvern is a fine healthy growing country with steadily increasing population the roads are naturally alive with perambulators or at least alive with the babies inside the perambulators These are the more alarming to the timid eye in that many of them are double barrelled so to speak and are loaded to the muzzle with babies for not only do Belvern babies frequently appear as twins but there are often two youngsters of a perambulator age in the same family at the same time To weave that donkey and that Bath cheer through the narrow streets of the various Belverns without putting to death any babies and without engendering the outspoken condemnation of the screaming mothers and nurserymaids is a task for a Jehu Of course Jane makes it more difficult by lunging into one perambulator in avoiding another but she prefers even that risk to the degradation of treading the path I wish her to tread I often wish that for one brief moment I might remove the lid of Jane s brain and examine her mental processes She would not exasperate me so deeply if I could be certain of her springs of action Is she old is she rheumatic is she lazy is she hungry Sometimes I think she means well and is only ignorant and dull but this hypothesis grows less and less tenable as I know her better Sometimes I conclude that she does not understand me that the difference in nationality may trouble her If an Englishman cannot understand an American woman all at once why should an English donkey Perhaps it takes an American donkey to comprehend an American woman Yet I cannot bring myself to drive any other donkey I am always hoping to impress myself on her imagination and conquer her will through her fancy Meanwhile I like to feel myself in the grasp of a nature stronger than my own and so I hold to Jane and buy a photograph of saint Bridget s Well Chapter XXII Comfort Cottage It was about two o clock in the afternoon and I suddenly heard a strange sound that of our fowl cackling Yesterday I heard her tell tale note about noon and the day before just as I was eating my breakfast I knew that it would be so The serpent has entered Eden That fowl has laid before eight in the morning for three weeks without interruption and she has now entered upon a career of wild and reckless uncertainty which compels me to eat eggs from twelve to twenty four hours old just as if I were in London Alas for the rarity Of regularity Under the sun A hen being of the feminine gender underestimates the majesty of order and system she resents any approach to the unimaginative monotony of the machine Probably the Confederated Fowl Union has been meddling with our little paradise where Labour and Capital have dwelt in heavenly unity until now Nothing can be done about it of course even if it were possible to communicate with the fowl she would say I suppose that she would lay when she was ready and not before at least that is what an American hen would say Just as I was brooding over these mysteries and trying to hatch out some conclusions missus Bobby knocked at the door and coming in curtsied very low before saying It s about namin the ouse miss Oh yes Pray don t stand missus Bobby take a chair I am not very busy I am only painting prickles on my gorse bushes so we will talk it over I shall not attempt to give you missus Bobby s dialect in reporting my various interviews with her for the spelling of it is quite beyond my powers Pray remove all the h s wherever they occur and insert them where they do not but there will be over and beyond this an intonation quite impossible to render missus Bobby bought her place only a few months ago for she lived in Cheltenham before mister Bobby died The last incumbent had probably been of Welsh extraction for the cottage had been named Dan y cefn missus Bobby declared however that she wouldn t have a heathenish name posted on her house and expect her friends to pronounce it when she couldn t pronounce it herself She seemed grieved when at first I could not see the absolute necessity of naming the cottage at all telling her that in America we named only grand places She was struck dumb with amazement at this piece of information and failed to conceive of the confusion that must ensue in villages where streets were scarcely named or houses numbered I confess it had never occurred to me that our manner of doing was highly inconvenient if not impossible and I approached the subject of the name with more interest and more modesty Well missus Bobby I began it is to be Cottage we ve decided that have we not It is to be Cottage not House Lodge Mansion or Villa We cannot name it after any flower that blows because they are all taken Have all the trees been used Thank you miss yes miss all but h ash tree and we ave no h ash Very good we must follow another plan Family names seem to be chosen such as Gower House Marston Villa and the like Bobby Cottage is not pretty What was your maiden name missus Bobby Buggins thank you miss Elizabeth Buggins Licensed to sell Poultry was my name and title when I met mister Bobby I m sorry but Buggins Cottage is still more impossible than Bobby Cottage Now here s another idea where were you born missus Bobby In Snitterfield thank you miss Dear dear how unserviceable Thank you miss Where was mister Bobby born He never mentioned miss mister Bobby must have been expansive for they were married twenty years There is always Victoria or Albert I said tentatively as I wiped my brushes Yes miss but with all respect to her Majesty them names give me a turn when I see them on the gates I am that sick of them True Can we call it anything that will suggest its situation Is there a Hill Crest Yes miss there is Ill Crest Ill Top Ill View Ill Side Ill End H under Ill Ill Bank and Ill Terrace I should think that would do for Hill Thank you miss Ow would The Edge do miss But we have no hedge She shall not have anything with an h in it if I can help it No miss but I thought I might set out a bit if worst come to worst And wait three or four years before people would know why the cottage was named Oh no missus Bobby Thank you miss We might have something quite out of the common like Providence Cottage down the bank I don t know why missus Jones calls it Providence Cottage unless she thinks it s a providence that she has one at all or because as it s just on the edge of the hill she thinks it s a providence that it hasn t blown off How would you like Peace or Rest Cottage Begging your pardon miss it s neither peace nor rest I gets in it these days with a twenty five pound debt anging over me and three children to feed and clothe I fear we are not very clever missus Bobby or we should hit upon the right thing with less trouble I know what I will do I will go down in the road and look at the place for a long time from the outside and try to think what it suggests to me Thank you miss and I m sure I m grateful for all the trouble you are taking with my small affairs Down I went and leaned over the wicket gate gazing at the unnamed cottage The brick pathway was scrubbed as clean as a penny and the stone step and the floor of the little kitchen as well The garden was a maze of fragrant bloom with never a weed in sight The fowl cackled cheerily still adding insult to injury the pet sheep munched grass contentedly and the canaries sang in their cages under the vines missus Bobby settled herself on the porch with a pan of peas in her neat gingham lap and all at once I cried Comfort Cottage It is the very essence of comfort missus Bobby even if there is not absolute peace or rest Let me paint the signboard for you this very day missus Bobby was most complacent over the name She had the greatest confidence in my judgment and the characterisation pleased her housewifely pride so much so that she flushed with pleasure as she said that if she ad er ealth she thought she could keep the place looking so that the passers by would easily h understand the name Chapter XXIII Tea served here It was some days after the naming of the cottage that missus Bobby admitted me into her financial secrets and explained the difficulties that threatened her peace of mind She still has twenty five pounds to pay before Comfort Cottage is really her own With her cow and her vegetable garden to say nothing of her procrastinating fowl she manages to eke out a frugal existence now that her eldest son is in a blacksmith s shop at Worcester and is sending her part of his weekly savings But it has been a poor season for canaries and a still poorer one for lodgers for people in these degenerate days prefer to be nearer the hotels and the mild gaieties of the larger settlements It is all very well so long as I remain with her and she wishes fervently that that may be for ever for never she says eloquently never in all her Cheltenham and Belvern experience has she encountered such a jewel of a lodger as her dear Miss Amilton so little trouble and always a bit of praise for her plain cooking and a pleasant word for the children to whom most lodgers object and such an interest in the cow and the fowl and the garden and the canaries and such kindness in painting the name of the cottage so that it is the finest thing in the village and nobody can get past the ouse without stopping to gape at it But when her American lodger leaves her she asks and who is she that can expect to keep a beautiful young lady who will be naming her own cottage and painting signboards for herself before long likely but when her American lodger is gone how is she missus Bobby to put by a few shillings a month towards the debt on the cottage These are some of the problems she presents to me I have turned them over and over in my mind as I have worked and even asked Willie Beresford in my weekly letter what he could suggest Of course he could not suggest anything men never can although he offered to come there and lodge for a month at twenty five pounds a week All at once one morning a happy idea struck me and I ran down to missus Bobby who was weeding the onion bed in the back garden missus Bobby I said sitting down comfortably on the edge of the lettuce frame I am sure I know how you can earn many a shilling during the summer and autumn months and you must begin the experiment while I am here to advise you I want you to serve five o clock tea in your garden But miss thanking you kindly nobody would think of stoppin ere for a cup of tea once in a twelvemonth You never know what people will do until you try them People will do almost anything missus Bobby if you only put it into their heads and this is the way we shall make our suggestion to the public I will paint a second signboard to hang below Comfort Cottage It will be much more beautiful than the other for it shall have a steaming kettle on it and a cup and saucer and the words Tea Served Here underneath the letters all intertwined with tea plants I don t know how tea plants look but then neither does the public You will set one round table on the porch so that if it threatens rain as it sometimes does you know in England people will not be afraid to sit down and the other you will put under the yew tree near the gate The tables must be immaculate no spotted rumpled cloths and chipped cups at Comfort Cottage which is to be a strictly first class tea station You will put vases of flowers on the tables and you will not mix red yellow purple and blue ones in the same vase It s the way the good Lord mixes em in the fields interjected missus Bobby piously Very likely but you will permit me to remark that the good Lord can manage things successfully which we poor humans cannot You will set out your cream jug that was presented to missus Martha Buggins by her friends and neighbours as a token of respect in eighteen twenty three and the bowl that was presented to mister Bobby as a sword and shooting prize in eighteen sixty and all your pretty little odds and ends You will get everything ready in the kitchen so that customers won t have to wait long but you will not prepare much in advance so that there ll be nothing wasted It sounds beautiful in your mouth miss and it surely wouldn t be any arm to make a trial of it Of course it won t There is no inn here where nice people will stop who would ever think of asking for tea at the Retired Soldier and the moment they see our sign in walking or driving past that moment they will be consumed with thirst You do not begin to appreciate our advantages as a tea station In the first place there is a watering trough not far from the gate and drivers very often stop to water their horses then we have the lovely garden which everybody admires and if everything else fails there is the baby Put that faded pink flannel slip on Jem showing his tanned arms and legs as usual tie up his sleeves with blue bows as you did last Sunday put my white tennis cap on the back of his yellow curls turn him loose in the hollyhocks and await results Did I not open the gate the moment I saw him though there was no apartment sign in the window missus Bobby was overcome by the magic of my arguments and as there were positively no attendant risks we decided on an early opening The very next day after the hanging of the second sign I superintended the arrangements myself It was a nice thirsty afternoon and as I filled the flower vases I felt such a desire for custom and such a love of trade animating me that I was positively ashamed At three o clock I went upstairs and threw myself on the bed for a nap for I had been sketching on the hills since early morning It may have been an hour later when I heard the sound of voices and the stopping of a heavy vehicle before the house I stole to the front window and peeping under the shelter of the vines saw a char a bancs on the way from Great Belvern to the Beacon It held three gentlemen two ladies and four children and everything had worked precisely as I intended The driver had seen the watering trough the gentlemen had seen the tea sign the children had seen the flowers and the canaries and the ladies had seen the baby I went to the back window to call an encouraging word to missus Bobby but to my horror I saw that worthy woman disappearing at the extreme end of the lane in full chase of our cow that had broken down the fence and was now at large with some of our neighbour s turnip tops hanging from her mouth Chapter XXIV An unlicensed victualler Ruin stared us in the face Were our cherished plans to be frustrated by a marauding cow who little realised that she was imperilling her own means of existence Were we to turn away three five nine thirsty customers at one fell swoop Never None of these people ever saw me before nor would ever see me again What was to prevent my serving them with tea I had on a pink cotton gown that was well enough I hastily buttoned on a clean painting apron and seizing a freshly laundered cushion cover lying on the bureau a square of lace and embroidery I pinned it on my hair for a cap while descending the stairs Everything was right in the kitchen for missus Bobby had flown in the midst of her preparations The loaf the bread knife the butter the marmalade all stood on the table and the kettle was boiling I set the tea to draw and then dashed to the door bowed appetisingly to the visitors showed them to the tables with a winning smile which was to be extra seated the children maternally on the steps and laid napkins before them dashed back to the kitchen cut the thin bread and butter and brought it with the marmalade asked my customers if they desired cream and told them it was extra went back and brought a tray with tea boiling water milk and cream Lowering my voice to an English sweetness and dropping a few h s ostentatiously as I answered questions I poured five cups of tea and four mugs for the children and cut more bread and butter for they were all eating like wolves They praised the butter I told them it was a specialty of the house They requested muffins With a smile of heavenly sweetness tinged with regret I replied that Saturday was our muffin day Saturday muffins Tuesday crumpets Thursday scones and Friday tea cakes This inspiration sprang into being full grown like Pallas from the brain of Zeus While they were regretting that they had come on a plain bread and butter day I retired to the kitchen and made out a bill for presentation to the oldest man of the party s d Nine teas three six Cream three Bread and butter one zero Marmalade six five three Feeling five and threepence to be an absurdly small charge for five adult and four infant teas I destroyed this immediately and made out another putting each item fourpence more and the bread and butter at one and six I also introduced ninepence for extra teas for the children who had had two mugs apiece very weak This brought the total to six shillings and tenpence and I was beset by a horrible temptation to add a shilling or two for candles there was one young man among the three who looked as if he would have understood the joke The father of the family looked at the bill and remarked quizzically Bond Street prices eh Bond Street service said I curtsying demurely He paid it without flinching and gave me sixpence for myself I was very much afraid he would chuck me under the chin they are always chucking barmaids under the chin in old English novels but I have never seen it done in real life As they strolled down to the gate the second gentleman gave me another sixpence and the nice young fellow gave me a shilling he certainly had read the old English novels and remembered them so I kept with the children One of the ladies then asked if we sold flowers Certainly I replied What do you ask for roses Fourpence apiece for the fine ones I answered glibly hoping it was enough thrippence for the small ones sixpence for a bunch of sweet peas tuppence apiece for buttonhole carnations Each of the ladies took some roses and mignonette and the gentlemen who did not care for carnations in the least weakened when I approached modestly to pin them in their coats a la barmaid At this moment one of the children began to tease for a canary Have you one for sale inquired the fond mother Certainly madam I was prepared to sell the cottage by this time What do you ask for them Rapid calculation on my part excessively difficult without pencil and paper A canary is three to five dollars in America that is from twelve shilling to a pound then at a venture From ten shillings to a guinea madam according to the quality of the bird Would you like one for your birthday Margaret and do you think you can feed it and take quite good care of it Oh yes mamma Have you a cage to me inquiringly Certainly madam it is not a new one but I shall only charge you a shilling for it Impromptu plan not knowing whether missus Bobby had any cages or if so where she kept them to remove the canary in missus Bobby s chamber from the small wooden cage it inhabited close the windows and leave it at large in the room then bring out the cage and sell it to the lady Very well then please select me a good singer for about twelve shillings a very yellow one please I did so I had no difficulty about the colour but as the birds all stopped singing when I put my hand into the cages I was somewhat at a loss to choose a really fine performer I did my best with the result that it turned out to be the mother of several fine families but no vocalist and the generous young man brought it back for an exchange some days afterwards not only that but he came three times during the next week and nearly ruined his nervous system with tea The party finally mounted the char a bancs just as I was about to offer the baby for twenty five pounds and dirt cheap at that Meanwhile I gave the driver a cup of lukewarm tea for which I refused absolutely to accept any remuneration I had cleared the tables before missus Bobby returned flushed and panting with the guilty cow Never shall I forget that good dame s astonishment her mild deprecations her smiles nay her tears as she inspected my truly English account and received the silver s d Nine teas three six Cream seven Bread and butter one six Extra teas nine Marmalade six Three tips two zero Four roses and mignonette one eight Three carnations six Canary twelve zero Cage one zero twenty four zero I told her I regretted deeply putting down the marmalade so low as sixpence but as they had not touched it it did not matter so much as the entire outlay for the entertainment had been only about a shilling On that modest investment I considered one pound three shillings a very fair sum to be earned by an inexperienced licensed victualler like myself particularly as I am English only by adoption and not by birth Chapter XXV Et ego in Arcadia vixit I essayed another nap after this exciting episode I heard the gate open once or twice but a single stray customer after my hungry and generous horde did not stir my curiosity and I sank into a refreshing slumber dreaming that Willie Beresford and I kept an English inn and that I was the barmaid This blissful vision had been of all too short duration when I was awakened by missus Bobby s apologetic voice It is too bad to disturb you miss but I ve got to go and patch up the fence and smooth over the matter of the turnips with missus Gooch who is that snorty I don t know ow ever I can pacify her There is nothing for you to do miss only if you ll kindly keep an eye on the customer at the yew tree table He s been here for alf an hour miss and I think more than likely he s a foreigner by his actions or may be he s not quite right in his ead though armless He has taken four cups of tea miss and Billy saw him turn two of them into the olly ocks He has been feeding bread and butter to the dog and now the baby is on his knee playing with his fine gold watch He gave me a alf a crown and refused to take a penny change but why does he stop so long miss I can t help worriting over the silver cream jug that was my mother s missus Bobby disappeared I rose lazily and approached the window to keep my promised eye on the mysterious customer I lifted back the purple clematis to get a better view It was Willie Beresford He looked up at my ejaculation of surprise and dropping the baby as if it had been a parcel strode under the window I gasping How did you come here He By the usual methods dear I You shouldn t have come without asking Where are all your fine promises What shall I do with you Do you know there isn t an hotel within four miles He That is nothing it was four hundred miles that I couldn t endure But give me a less grudging welcome than this though I am like a starving dog that will snatch any morsel thrown to him It is really autumn Penelope or it will be in a few days Say you are a little glad to see me The sight of him so near after my weeks of loneliness gave me a feeling so sudden so sweet and so vivid that it seemed to smite me first on the eyes and then in the heart and at the first note of his convincing voice Doubt picked up her trailing skirts and fled for ever I Yes if you must know it I am glad to see you so glad indeed that nothing in the world seems to matter so long as you are here He striding a little nearer and looking about involuntarily for a ladder Penelope do you know the penalty of saying such sweet things to me I Perhaps it is because I know the penalty that I m committing the offence Besides I feel safe in saying anything in this second story window He Don t pride yourself on your safety unless you wish to see me transformed into a nineteenth century Romeo to the detriment of missus Bobby s creepers I can look at you for ever dear in your pink gown and your purple frame unless I can do better Won t you come down I I like it very much up here He You would like it very much down here after a little So you didn t paint me out after all I No on the contrary I painted you in to every twig and flower every hill and meadow every sunrise and every sunset He You MUST come down The distance between Belvern and Aix when I was not sure that you loved me was nothing compared to having you in a second story when I know that you do Come down Pen Pretty Pen I Suppose we compromise My sitting room is just below will you walk in and look at my sketches until I come You needn t ring the bell is overgrown with honeysuckle and there is no one to answer it it might almost be an American hotel but it is Arcadia He It is Paradise and alas here comes the serpent I It isn t a serpent it is the kindest landlady in England missus Bobby this gentleman is a dear friend of mine from America mister Beresford this is missus Bobby the most comfortable hostess in the world and the owner of the cottage the canaries the tea tables and the baby The reason mister Beresford was so thirsty missus Bobby was that he has walked here from Great Belvern so we must give him some supper before he returns missus B Certainly miss he shall have the best in the ouse you can depend upon that He Don t let me interfere with your usual arrangements I am not hungry for food I shall do very well until I get back to the hotel I Indeed you will not sir Billy shall pull some tomatoes and lettuce Tommy shall milk the cow and missus Bobby shall make you a savory omelet that Delmonico might envy Hark Is that our fowl cackling It is at half past six She heard me mention omelet and she must be calling Now I lay me down to sleep But all that is many days ago and there are no more experiences to relate at present We are making history very fast Willie Beresford and I but much of it is sacred history and so I cannot chronicle it for any one s amusement missus Beresford is here or at least she is in Great Belvern a few miles distant I am not painting these latter days I have turned the artist side of my nature to the wall just for a bit and the woman side is having full play I do not know what the world will think about it if it stops to think at all but I feel as if I were right side out for the first time in my life and when I take up my brushes again I shall have a new world within from which to paint yes and a new world without Good bye dear Belvern Autumn and winter may come into my life but whenever I think of you it will be summer time in my heart I shall hear the tinkle of the belled sheep on the hillsides inhale the fragrance of the flowering vine that climbed in at my cottage window relive in memory the days when Love and I first walked together hand in hand Dear days of happy idleness of dreaming dreams and seeing visions of morning walks over the hills of bread and cheese and kisses at noon with kind missus Bobby hovering like a plump guardian angel over the simple feast afternoon tea under the friendly shades of the yew tree and parting at the wicket gate I can see him pass the clock tower the little greengrocer shop the old stocks the green pump then he is at the turn of the road where the stone wall and the hawthorn hedge will presently hide him from my view I fly up to my window push back the vines catch his last wave of the hand I would call him back if I dared but it would be no easier to let him go the second time and there is always to morrow Thank God for to morrow And if there should be no to morrow Then thank God for to day And so good bye again dear Belvern It was in the lap of your lovely hills that Penelope first knew das irdische Gluck that she first loved first lived forgot how to be artist in
