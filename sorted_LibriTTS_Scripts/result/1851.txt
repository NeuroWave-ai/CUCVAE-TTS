none	none	in another moment I knew He had seized my hands and love ardent love came pouring from his lips Could it be real Was I the object of all this feeling I If so then life had changed for me indeed Silent from rush of emotion I searched his face to see if this Paradise whose gates I was thus passionately bidden to enter was indeed a verity or only a dream born of the excitement of the dance and the charm of a scene exceptional in its splendor and picturesqueness even for so luxurious a city as New York But it was no mere dream Truth and earnestness were in his manner and his words were neither feverish nor forced I love you I I need you So I heard and so he soon made me believe You have charmed me from the first Your tantalizing trusting loyal self like no other sweeter than any other has drawn the heart from my breast I have seen many women admired many women but you only have I loved Will you be my wife I was dazzled moved beyond anything I could have conceived I forgot all that I had hitherto said to myself all that I had endeavored to impress upon my heart when I beheld him approaching intent as I believed in his search for another woman and confiding in his honesty trusting entirely to his faith I allowed the plans and purposes of years to vanish in the glamour of this new joy and spoke the word which linked us together in a bond which half an hour before I had never dreamed would unite me to any man His impassioned Mine mine filled my cup to overflowing Something of the ecstasy of living entered my soul which in spite of all I have suffered since recreated the world for me and made all that went before but the prelude to the new life the new joy Oh I was happy happy perhaps too happy As the conservatory filled and we passed back into the adjoining room the glimpse I caught of myself in one of the mirrors startled me into thinking so For had it not been for the odd color of my dress and the unique way in which I wore my hair that night I should not have recognized the beaming girl who faced me so naively from the depths of the responsive glass Can one be too happy I do not know I know that one can be too perplexed too burdened and too sad Thus far I have spoken only of myself in connection with the evening s elaborate function But though entitled by my old Dutch blood to a certain social consideration which I am happy to say never failed me I even in this hour of supreme satisfaction attracted very little attention and awoke small comment There was another woman present better calculated to do this A fair woman large and of a bountiful presence accustomed to conquest and gifted with the power of carrying off her victories with a certain lazy grace irresistibly fascinating to the ordinary man a gorgeously appareled woman with a diamond on her breast too vivid for most women almost too vivid for her I noticed this diamond early in the evening and then I noticed her She was not as fine as the diamond but she was very fine and had I been in a less ecstatic frame of mind I might have envied the homage she received from all the men not excepting him upon whose arm I leaned Later there was no one in the world I envied less The ball was a private and very elegant one There were some notable guests One gentleman in particular was pointed out to me as an Englishman of great distinction and political importance I thought him a very interesting man for his years but odd and a trifle self centered Though greatly courted he seemed strangely restless under the fire of eyes to which he was constantly subjected and only happy when free to use his own in contemplation of the scene about him Had I been less absorbed in my own happiness I might have noted sooner than I did that this contemplation was confined to such groups as gathered about the lady with the diamond But this I failed to observe at the time and consequently was much surprised to come upon him at the end of one of the dances talking With this lady in an animated and courtly manner totally opposed to the apathy amounting to boredom with which he had hitherto met all advances Yet it was not admiration for her person which he openly displayed During the whole time he stood there his eyes seldom rose to her face they lingered mainly and this was what aroused my curiosity on the great fan of ostrich plumes which this opulent beauty held against her breast Was he desirous of seeing the great diamond she thus unconsciously or was it consciously shielded from his gaze It was possible for as I continued to note him he suddenly bent toward her and as quickly raised himself again with a look which was quite inexplicable to me The lady had shifted her fan a moment and his eyes had fallen on the gem The next thing I recall with any definiteness was a tete a tete conversation which I held with my lover on a certain yellow divan at the end of one of the halls To the right of this divan rose a curtained recess highly suggestive of romance called the alcove As this alcove figures prominently in my story I will pause here to describe it It was originally intended to contain a large group of statuary which our host mister Ramsdell had ordered from Italy to adorn his new house He is a man of original ideas in regard to such matters and in this instance had gone so far as to have this end of the house constructed with a special view to an advantageous display of this promised work of art Fearing the ponderous effect of a pedestal large enough to hold such a considerable group he had planned to raise it to the level of the eye by having the alcove floor built a few feet higher than the main one A flight of low wide steps connected the two which following the curve of the wall added much to the beauty of this portion of the hall The group was a failure and was never shipped but the alcove remained and possessing as it did all the advantages of a room in the way of heat and light had been turned into a miniature retreat of exceptional beauty The seclusion it offered extended or so we were happy to think to the solitary divan at its base on which mister Durand and I were seated With possibly an undue confidence in the advantage of our position we were discussing a subject interesting only to ourselves when mister Durand interrupted himself to declare You are the woman I want you and you only And I want you soon When do you think you can marry me Within a week if Did my look stop him I was startled I had heard no incoherent phrase from him before A week I remonstrated We take more time than that to fit ourselves for a journey or some transient pleasure I hardly realize my engagement yet You have not been thinking of it for these last two months as I have No I replied demurely forgetting everything else in my delight at this admission Nor are you a nomad among clubs and restaurants No I have a home Nor do you love me as deeply as I do you This I thought open to argument The home you speak of is a luxurious one he continued I can not offer you its equal Do you expect me to I was indignant You know that I do not Shall I who deliberately chose a nurse s life when an indulgent uncle s heart and home were open to me shrink from braving poverty with the man I love We will begin as simply as you please No he peremptorily put in yet with a certain hesitancy which seemed to speak of doubts he hardly acknowledged to himself I will not marry you if I must expose you to privation or to the genteel poverty I hate I love you more than you realize and wish to make your life a happy one I can not give you all you have been accustomed to in your rich uncle s house but if matters prosper with me if the chance I have built on succeeds and it will fail or succeed tonight you will have those comforts which love will heighten into luxuries and and He was becoming incoherent again and this time with his eyes fixed elsewhere than on my face Following his gaze I discovered what had distracted his attention The lady with the diamond was approaching us on her way to the alcove She was accompanied by two gentlemen both strangers to me and her head sparkling with brilliants was turning from one to the other with an indolent grace I was not surprised that the man at my side quivered and made a start as if to rise She was a gorgeous image In comparison with her imposing figure in its trailing robe of rich pink velvet my diminutive frame in its sea green gown must have looked as faded and colorless as a half obliterated pastel A striking woman I remarked as I saw he was not likely to resume the conversation which her presence had interrupted And what a diamond The glance he cast me was peculiar Did you notice it particularly he asked Astonished for there was something very uneasy in his manner so that I half expected to see him rise and join the group he was so eagerly watching without waiting for my lips to frame a response I quickly replied It would be difficult not to notice what one would naturally expect to see only on the breast of a queen But perhaps she is a queen I should judge so from the homage which follows her His eyes sought mine There was inquiry in them but it was an inquiry I did not understand What can you know about diamonds he presently demanded Nothing but their glitter and glitter is not all the gem she wears may be a very tawdry one I flushed with humiliation He was a dealer in gems that was his business and the check which he had put upon my enthusiasm certainly made me conscious of my own presumption Yet I was not disposed to take back my words I had had a better opportunity than himself for seeing this remarkable jewel and with the perversity of a somewhat ruffled mood I burst forth as soon as the color had subsided from my cheeks No no It is glorious magnificent I never saw its like I doubt if you ever have for all your daily acquaintance with jewels Its value must be enormous Who is she You seem to know her It was a direct question but I received no reply mister Durand s eyes had followed the lady who had lingered somewhat ostentatiously on the top step and they did not return to me till she had vanished with her companions behind the long plush curtain which partly veiled the entrance By this time he had forgotten my words if he had ever heard them and it was with the forced animation of one whose thoughts are elsewhere that he finally returned to the old plea When would I marry him If he could offer me a home in a month and he would know by to morrow if he could do so would I come to him then He would not say in a week that was perhaps to soon but in a month Would I not promise to be his in a month What I answered I scarcely recall His eyes had stolen back to the alcove and mine had followed them The gentlemen who had accompanied the lady inside were coming out again but others were advancing to take their places and soon she was engaged in holding a regular court in this favored retreat Why should this interest me Why should I notice her or look that way at all Because mister Durand did Possibly I remember that for all his ardent love making I felt a little piqued that he should divide his attentions in this way Perhaps I thought that for this evening at least he might have been blind to a mere coquette s fascinations I was thus doubly engaged in listening to my lover s words and in watching the various gentlemen who went up and down the steps when a former partner advanced and reminded me that I had promised him a waltz Loath to leave mister Durand yet seeing no way of excusing myself to mister Fox I cast an appealing glance at the former and was greatly chagrined to find him already on his feet Enjoy your dance he cried I have a word to say to missus Fairbrother and was gone before my new partner had taken me on his arm Was missus Fairbrother the lady with the diamond Yes as I turned to enter the parlor with my partner I caught a glimpse of mister Durand s tall figure just disappearing from the step behind the sage green curtains Who is missus Fairbrother I inquired of mister Fox at the end of the dance mister Fox who is one of society s perennial beaux knows everybody She is well she was Abner Fairbrother s wife You know Fairbrother the millionaire who built that curious structure on Eighty sixth Street At present they are living apart an amicable understanding I believe Her diamond makes her conspicuous It is one of the most remarkable stones in New York perhaps in the United States Have you observed it Yes that is at a distance Do you think her very handsome missus Fairbrother She s called so but she s not my style Here he gave me a killing glance I admire women of mind and heart They do not need to wear jewels worth an ordinary man s fortune I looked about for an excuse to leave this none too desirable partner Let us go back into the long hall I urged The ceaseless whirl of these dancers is making me dizzy With the ease of a gallant man he took me on his arm and soon we were promenading again in the direction of the alcove A passing glimpse of its interior was afforded me as we turned to retrace our steps in front of the yellow divan The lady with the diamond was still there A fold of the superb pink velvet she wore protruded across the gap made by the half drawn curtains just as it had done a half hour before But it was impossible to see her face or who was with her What I could see however and did was the figure of a man leaning against the wall at the foot of the steps At first I thought this person unknown to me then I perceived that he was no other than the chief guest of the evening the Englishman of whom I have previously spoken His expression had altered He looked now both anxious and absorbed particularly anxious and particularly absorbed so much so that I was not surprised that no one ventured to approach him Again I wondered and again I asked myself for whom or for what he was waiting For mister Durand to leave this lady s presence No no I would not believe that mister Durand could not be there still yet some women make it difficult for a man to leave them and realizing this I could not forbear casting a parting glance behind me as yielding to mister Fox s importunities I turned toward the supper room It showed me the Englishman in the act of lifting two cups of coffee from a small table standing near the reception room door As his manner plainly betokened whither he was bound with this refreshment I felt all my uneasiness vanish and was able to take my seat at one of the small tables with which the supper room was filled and for a few minutes at least lend an ear to mister Fox s vapid compliments and trite opinions Then my attention wandered I had not moved nor had I shifted my gaze from the scene before me the ordinary scene of a gay and well filled supper room yet I found myself looking as if through a mist I had not even seen develop at something as strange unusual and remote as any phantasm yet distinct enough in its outlines for me to get a decided impression of a square of light surrounding the figure of a man in a peculiar pose not easily imagined and not easily described It all passed in an instant and I sat staring at the window opposite me with the feeling of one who has just seen a vision Yet almost immediately I forgot the whole occurrence in my anxiety as to mister Durand s whereabouts Certainly he was amusing himself very much elsewhere or he would have found an opportunity of joining me long before this He was not even in sight and I grew weary of the endless menu and the senseless chit chat of my companion and finding him amenable to my whims rose from my seat at table and made my way to a group of acquaintances standing just outside the supper room door As I listened to their greetings some impulse led me to cast another glance down the hall toward the alcove A man a waiter was issuing from it in a rush Bad news was in his face and as his eyes encountered those of mister Ramsdell who was advancing hurriedly to meet him he plunged down the steps with a cry which drew a crowd about the two in an instant What was it What had happened Mad with an anxiety I did not stop to define I rushed toward this group now swaying from side to side in irrepressible excitement when suddenly everything swam before me and I fell in a swoon to the floor Some one had shouted aloud missus Fairbrother has been murdered and her diamond stolen Lock the doors II THE GLOVES I must have remained insensible for many minutes for when I returned to full consciousness the supper room was empty and the two hundred guests I had left seated at table were gathered in agitated groups about the hall This was what I first noted not till afterward did I realize my own situation I was lying on a couch in a remote corner of this same hall and beside me but not looking at me stood my lover mister Durand How he came to know my state and find me in the general disturbance I did not stop to inquire 
3923_153309_000028_000001	train-clean-360	It was enough 
none	none	for me at that moment to look up and see him so near Indeed the relief was so great the sense of his protection so comforting that I involuntarily stretched out my hand in gratitude toward him but failing to attract his attention slipped to the floor and took my stand at his side This roused him and he gave me a look which steadied me in spite of the thrill of surprise with which I recognized his extreme pallor and a certain peculiar hesitation in his manner not at all natural to it Meanwhile some words uttered near us were slowly making their way into my benumbed brain The waiter who had raised the first alarm was endeavoring to describe to an importunate group in advance of us what he had come upon in that murderous alcove I was carrying about a tray of ices he was saying and seeing the lady sitting there went up I had expected to find the place full of gentlemen but she was all alone and did not move as I picked my way over her long train The next moment I had dropped ices tray and all I bad come face to face with her and seen that she was dead She had been stabbed and robbed There was no diamond on her breast but there was blood A hubbub of disordered sentences seasoned with horrified cries followed this simple description Then a general movement took place in the direction of the alcove during which mister Durand stooped to my ear and whispered We must get out of this You are not strong enough to stand such excitement Don t you think we can escape by the window over there What without wraps and in such a snowstorm I protested Besides uncle will be looking for me He came with me you know An expression of annoyance or was it perplexity crossed mister Durand s face and he made a movement as if to leave me I must go he began but stopped at my glance of surprise and assumed a different air one which became him very much better Pardon me dear I will take you to your uncle This this dreadful tragedy interrupting so gay a scene has quite upset me I was always sensitive to the sight the smell even to the very mention of the word blood So was I but not to the point of cowardice But then I had not just come from an interview with the murdered woman Her glances her smiles the lift of her eyebrows were not fresh memories to me Some consideration was certainly due him for the shock he must be laboring under Yet I did not know how to keep back the vital question Who did it You must have heard some one say I have heard nothing was his somewhat fierce rejoinder Then as I made a move What you do not wish to follow the crowd there I wish to find my uncle and he is in that crowd mister Durand said nothing further and together we passed down the hall A strange mood pervaded my mind Instead of wishing to fly a scene which under ordinary conditions would have filled me with utter repugnance I felt a desire to see and hear everything Not from curiosity such as moved most of the people about me but because of some strong instinctive feeling I could not understand as if it were my heart which had been struck and my fate which was trembling in the balance We were consequently among the first to hear such further details as were allowed to circulate among the now well nigh frenzied guests No one knew the perpetrator of the deed nor did there appear to be any direct evidence calculated to fix his identity Indeed the sudden death of this beautiful woman in the midst of festivity might have been looked upon as suicide if the jewel had not been missing from her breast and the instrument of death removed from the wound So far the casual search which had been instituted had failed to produce this weapon but the police would be here soon and then something would be done As to the means of entrance employed by the assassin there seemed to be but one opinion The alcove contained a window opening upon a small balcony By this he had doubtless entered and escaped The long plush curtains which during the early part of the evening had remained looped back on either side of the casement were found at the moment of the crime s discovery closely drawn together Certainly a suspicious circumstance However the question was one easily settled If any one had approached by the balcony there would be marks in the snow to show it mister Ramsdell had gone out to see He would be coming back soon Do you think this a probable explanation of the crime I demanded of mister Durand at this juncture If I remember rightly this window overlooks the carriage drive it must therefore be within plain sight of the door through which some three hundred guests have passed to night How could any one climb to such a height lift the window and step in without being seen You forget the awning He spoke quickly and with unexpected vivacity The awning runs up very near this window and quite shuts it off from the sight of arriving guests The drivers of departing carriages could see it if they chanced to glance back But their eyes are usually on their horses in such a crowd The probabilities are against any of them having looked up His brow had cleared a weight seemed removed from his mind When I went into the alcove to see missus Fairbrother she was sitting in a chair near this window looking out I remember the effect of her splendor against the snow sifting down in a steady stream behind her The pink velvet the soft green of the curtains on either side her brilliants and the snow for a background Yes the murderer came in that way Her figure would be plain to any one outside and if she moved and the diamond shone Don t you see what a probable theory it is There must be ways by which a desperate man might reach that balcony I believe How eager he was and with what a look he turned when the word came filtering through the crowd that though footsteps had been found in the snow pointing directly toward the balcony there was none on the balcony itself proving as any one could see that the attack had not come from without since no one could enter the alcove by the window without stepping on the balcony mister Durand has suspicions of his own I explained determinedly to myself He met some one going in as he stepped out Shall I ask him to name this person No I did not have the courage not while his face wore so stern a look and was so resolutely turned away The next excitement was a request from mister Ramsdell for us all to go into the drawing room This led to various cries from hysterical lips such as We are going to be searched He believes the thief and murderer to be still in the house Do you see the diamond on me Why don t they confine their suspicions to the favored few who were admitted to the alcove They will remarked some one close to my ear But quickly as I turned I could not guess from whom the comment came Possibly from a much beflowered bejeweled elderly dame whose eyes were fixed on mister Durand s averted face If so she received a defiant look from mine which I do not believe she forgot in a hurry Alas it was not the only curious I might say searching glance I surprised directed against him as we made our way to where I could see my uncle struggling to reach us from a short side hall The whisper seemed to have gone about that mister Durand had been the last one to converse with missus Fairbrother prior to the tragedy In time I had the satisfaction of joining my uncle He betrayed great relief at the sight of me and encouraged by his kindly smile I introduced mister Durand My conscious air must have produced its impression for he turned a startled and inquiring look upon my companion then took me resolutely on his own arm saying There is likely to be some unpleasantness ahead for all of us I do not think the police will allow any one to go till that diamond has been looked for This is a very serious matter dear So many think the murderer was one of the guests I think so too said I But why I thought so or why I should say so with such vehemence I do not know even now My uncle looked surprised You had better not advance any opinions he advised A lady like yourself should have none on a subject so gruesome I shall never cease regretting bringing you here tonight I shall seize on the first opportunity to take you home At present we are supposed to await the action of our host He can not keep all these people here long I ventured No most of us will be relieved soon Had you not better get your wraps so as to be ready to go as soon as he gives the word I should prefer to have a peep at the people in the drawing room first was my perverse reply I don t know why I want to see them but I do and uncle I might as well tell you now that I engaged myself to mister Durand this evening the gentleman with me when you first came up You have engaged yourself to to this man to marry him do you mean I nodded with a sly look behind to see if mister Durand were near enough to hear He was not and I allowed my enthusiasm to escape in a few quick words He has chosen me I said the plainest most uninteresting puss in the whole city My uncle smiled And I believe he loves me at all events I know that I love him My uncle sighed while giving me the most affectionate of glances It s a pity you should have come to this understanding to night said he He s an acquaintance of the murdered woman and it is only right for you to know that you will have to leave him behind when you start for home All who have been seen entering that alcove this evening will necessarily be detained here till the coroner arrives My uncle and I strolled toward the drawing room and as we did so we passed the library It held but one occupant the Englishman He was seated before a table and his appearance was such as precluded any attempt at intrusion even if one had been so disposed There was a fixity in his gaze and a frown on his powerful forehead which bespoke a mind greatly agitated It was not for me to read that mind much as it interested me and I passed on chatting as if I had not the least desire to stop I can not say how much time elapsed before my uncle touched me on the arm with the remark The police are here in full force I saw a detective in plain clothes look in here a minute ago He seemed to have his eye on you There he is again What can he want No don t turn he s gone away now Frightened as I had never been in all my life I managed to keep my head up and maintain an indifferent aspect What as my uncle said could a detective want of me I had nothing to do with the crime not in the remotest way could I be said to be connected with it why then had I caught the attention of the police Looking about I sought mister Durand He had left me on my uncle s coming up but had remained as I supposed within sight But at this moment he was nowhere to be seen Was I afraid on his account Impossible yet Happily just then the word was passed about that the police had given orders that with the exception of such as had been requested to remain to answer questions the guests generally should feel themselves at liberty to depart The time had now come to take a stand and I informed my uncle to his evident chagrin that I should not leave as long as any excuse could be found for staying He said nothing at the time but as the noise of departing carriages gradually lessened and the great hall and drawing rooms began to wear a look of desertion he at last ventured on this gentle protest You have more pluck Rita than I supposed Do you think it wise to stay on here Will not people imagine that you have been requested to do so Look at those waiters hanging about in the different doorways Run up and put on your wraps mister Durand will come to the house fast enough as soon as he is released I give you leave to sit up for him if you will only let us leave this place before that impertinent little man dares to come around again he artfully added But I stood firm though somewhat moved by his final suggestion and being a small tyrant in my way at least with him I carried my point Suddenly my anxiety became poignant A party of men among whom I saw mister Durand appeared at the end of the hall led by a very small but self important personage whom my uncle immediately pointed out as the detective who had twice come to the door near which I stood As this man looked up and saw me still there a look of relief crossed his face and after a word or two with another stranger of seeming authority he detached himself from the group he had ushered upon the scene and approaching me respectfully enough said with a deprecatory glance at my uncle whose frown he doubtless understood Miss Van Arsdale I believe I nodded too choked to speak I am sorry Madam if you were expecting to go Inspector Dalzell has arrived and would like to speak to you Will you step into one of these rooms Not the library but any other He will come to you as quickly as he can I tried to carry it off bravely and as if I saw nothing in this summons which was unique or alarming But I succeeded only in dividing a wavering glance between him and the group of men of which he had just formed a part In the latter were several gentlemen whom I had noted in missus Fairbrother s train early in the evening and a few strangers two of whom were officials mister Durand was with the former and his expression did not encourage me The affair is very serious commented the detective on leaving me That s our excuse for any trouble we may be putting you to I clutched my uncle s arm Where shall we go I asked The drawing room is too large In this hall my eyes are for ever traveling in the direction of the alcove Don t you know some little room Oh what what can he want of me Nothing serious nothing important blustered my good uncle Some triviality such as you can answer in a moment A little room Yes I know one there under the stairs Come I will find the door for you Why did we ever come to this wretched ball I had no answer for this Why indeed My uncle who is a very patient man guided me to the place he had picked out without adding a word to the ejaculation in which he had just allowed his impatience to expend itself But once seated within and out of the range of peering eyes and listening ears he allowed a sigh to escape him which expressed the fullness of his agitation My dear he began and stopped I feel here he again came to a pause that you should know What I managed to ask That I do not like mister Durand and that others do not like him Is it because of something you knew about him before to night He made no answer Or because he was seen like many other gentlemen talking with that woman some time before a long time before she was attacked for her diamond and murdered Pardon me my dear he was the last one seen talking to her Some one may yet be found who went in after he came out but as yet he is considered the last mister Ramsdell himself told me so It makes no difference I exclaimed in all the heat of my long suppressed agitation I am willing to stake my life on his integrity and honor No man could talk to me as he did early this evening with any vile intentions at heart He was interested no doubt like many others in one who had the name of being a captivating woman but I paused in sudden alarm A look had crossed my uncle s face which assured me that we were no longer alone Who could have entered so silently In some trepidation I turned to see A gentleman was standing in the doorway who smiled as I met his eye Is this Miss Van Arsdale he asked Instantly my courage which had threatened to leave me returned and I smiled I am said I Are you the inspector Inspector Dalzell he explained with a bow which included my uncle Then he closed the door I hope I have not frightened you he went on approaching me with a gentlemanly air A little matter has come up concerning which I mean to be perfectly frank with you It may prove to be of trivial importance if so you will pardon my disturbing you mister Durand you know him I am engaged to him I declared before poor uncle could raise his hand You are engaged to him Well that makes it difficult and yet in some respects easier for me to ask a certain question It must have made it more difficult than easy for he did not proceed to put this question immediately but went on You know that mister Durand visited missus Fairbrother in the alcove a little while before her death I have been told so He was seen to go in but I have not yet found any one who saw him come out consequently we have been unable to fix the exact minute when he did so What is the matter Miss Van Arsdale You want to say something No no I protested reconsidering my first impulse Then as I met his look He can probably tell you that himself I am sure he would not hesitate We shall ask him later was the inspector s response Meanwhile are you ready to assure me that since that time he has not intrusted you with a little article to keep No no I do not mean the diamond he broke in in very evident dismay as I fell back from him in irrepressible indignation and alarm The diamond well we shall look for that later it is another article we are in search of now one which mister Durand might very well have taken in his hand without realizing just what he was doing As it is important for us to find this article and as it is one he might very naturally have passed over to you when he found himself in the hall with it in his hand I have ventured to ask you if this surmise is correct It is not I retorted fiercely glad that I could speak from my very heart He has given me nothing to keep for him He would not Why that peculiar look in the inspector s eye Why did he reach out for a chair and seat me in it before he took up my interrupted sentence and finished it would not give you anything to hold which had belonged to another woman Miss Van Arsdale you do not know men They do many things which a young trusting girl like yourself would hardly expect from them Not mister Durand I maintained stoutly Perhaps not let us hope not Then with a quick change of manner he bent toward me with a sidelong look at uncle and pointing to my gloves remarked You wear gloves Did you feel the need of two pairs that you carry another in that pretty bag hanging from your arm I started looked down and then slowly drew up into my hand the bag he had mentioned The white finger of a glove was protruding from the top Any one could see it many probably had What did it mean I had brought no extra pair with me This is not mine I began faltering into silence as I perceived my uncle turn and walk a step or two away The article we are looking for pursued the inspector is a pair of long white gloves supposed to have been worn by missus Fairbrother when she entered the alcove Do you mind showing me those a finger of which I see I dropped the bag into his hand The room and everything in it was whirling around me But when I noted what trouble it was to his clumsy fingers to open it my senses returned and reaching for the bag I pulled it open and snatched out the gloves They had been hastily rolled up and some of the fingers were showing Let me have them he said With quaking heart and shaking fingers I handed over the gloves missus Fairbrother s hand was not a small one he observed as he slowly unrolled them Yours is We can soon tell But that sentence was never finished As the gloves fell open in his grasp he uttered a sudden sharp ejaculation and I a smothered shriek An object of superlative brilliancy had rolled out from them The diamond the gem which men said was worth a king s ransom and which we all knew had just cost a life III ANSON DURAND With benumbed senses and a dismayed heart I stared at the fallen jewel as at some hateful thing menacing both my life and honor I have had nothing to do with it I vehemently declared I did not put the gloves in my bag nor did I know the diamond was in them I fainted at the first alarm and There there I know interposed the inspector kindly I do not doubt you in the least not when there is a man to doubt Miss Van Arsdale you had better let your uncle take you home I will see that the hall is cleared for you Tomorrow I may wish to talk to you again but I will spare you all further importunity tonight I shook my head It would require more courage to leave at that moment than to stay Meeting the inspector s eye firmly I quietly declared If mister Durand s good name is to suffer in any way I will not forsake him I have confidence in his integrity if you have not It was not his hand but one much more guilty which dropped this jewel into the bag So so do not be too sure of that little woman You had better take your lesson at once It will be easier for you and more wholesome for him Here he picked up the jewel Well they said it was a wonder he exclaimed in sudden admiration I am not surprised now that I have seen a great gem at the famous stories I have read of men risking life and honor for their possession If only no blood had been shed Uncle uncle I wailed aloud in my agony It was all my lips could utter but to uncle it was enough Speaking for the first time he asked to have a passage made for us and when the inspector moved forward to comply he threw his arm about me and was endeavoring to find fitting words with which to fill up the delay when a short altercation was heard from the doorway and mister Durand came rushing in followed immediately by the inspector His first look was not at myself but at the bag which still hung from my arm As I noted this action my whole inner self seemed to collapse dragging my happiness down with it But my countenance remained unchanged too much so it seems for when his eye finally rose to my face he found there what made him recoil and turn with something like fierceness on his companion You have been talking to her he vehemently protested Perhaps you have gone further than that What has happened here I think I ought to know She is so guileless Inspector Dalzell so perfectly free from all connection with this crime Why have you shut her up here and plied her with questions and made her look at me with such an expression when all you have against me is just what you have against some half dozen others that I was weak enough or unfortunate enough to spend a few minutes with that unhappy woman in the alcove before she died It might be well if Miss Van Arsdale herself would answer you was the inspector s quiet retort What you have said may constitute all that we have against you but it is not all we have against her I gasped not so much at this seeming accusation the motive of which I believed myself to understand but at the burning blush with which it was received by mister Durand What do you mean he demanded with certain odd breaks in his voice What can you have against her A triviality returned the inspector with a look in my direction that was I felt not to be mistaken I do not call it a triviality I burst out It seems that missus Fairbrother for all her elaborate toilet was found without gloves on her arms As she certainly wore them on entering the alcove the police have naturally been looking for them And where do you think they have found them Not in the alcove with her not in the possession of the man who undoubtedly carried them away with him but I know I know mister Durand hoarsely put in You need not say any more Oh my poor Rita what have I brought upon you by my weakness Weakness He started I started my voice was totally unrecognizable I should give it another name I added coldly For a moment he seemed to lose heart then he lifted his head again and looked as handsome as when he pleaded for my hand in the little conservatory You have that right said he besides weakness at such a time and under such an exigency is little short of wrong It was unmanly in me to endeavor to secrete these gloves more than unmanly for me to choose for their hiding place the recesses of an article belonging exclusively to yourself I acknowledge it Rita and shall meet only my just punishment if you deny me in the future both your sympathy and regard But you must let me assure you and these gentlemen also one of whom can make it very unpleasant for me that consideration for you much more than any miserable anxiety about myself lay at the bottom of what must strike you all as an act of unpardonable cowardice From the moment I learned of this woman s murder in the alcove where I had visited her I realized that every one who had been seen to approach her within a half hour of her death would be subjected to a more or less rigid investigation and I feared if her gloves were found in my possession some special attention might be directed my way which would cause you unmerited distress So yielding to an impulse which I now recognize as a most unwise as well as unworthy one I took advantage of the bustle about us and of the insensibility into which you had fallen to tuck these miserable gloves into the bag I saw lying on the floor at your side I do not ask your pardon My whole future life shall be devoted to winning that I simply wish to state a fact Very good It was the inspector who spoke I could not have uttered a word to save my life Perhaps you will now feel that you owe it to this young lady to add how you came to have these gloves in your possession missus Fairbrother handed them to me Handed them to you Yes I hardly know why myself She asked me to take care of them for her I know that this must strike you as a very peculiar statement It was my realization of the unfavorable effect it could not fail to produce upon those who beard it which made me dread any interrogation on the subject But I assure you it was as I say She put the gloves into my hand while I was talking to her saying they incommoded her And you Well I held them for a few minutes then I put them in my pocket but quite automatically and without thinking very much about it She was a woman accustomed to have her own way People seldom questioned it I judge Here the tension about my throat relaxed and I opened my lips to speak But the inspector with a glance of some authority forestalled me Were the gloves open or rolled up when she offered them to you They were rolled up Did you see her take them off Assuredly And roll them up Certainly After which she passed them over to you Not immediately She let them lie in her lap for a while While you talked mister Durand bowed And looked at the diamond mister Durand bowed for the second time Had you ever seen so fine a diamond before No Yet you deal in precious stones That is my business And are regarded as a judge of them I have that reputation mister Durand would you know this diamond if you saw it I certainly should The setting was an uncommon one I hear Quite an unusual one The inspector opened his hand Is this the article Good God Where Don t you know I do not The inspector eyed him gravely Then I have a bit of news for you It was hidden in the gloves you took from missus Fairbrother Miss Van Arsdale was present at their unrolling Do we live move breathe at certain moments It hardly seems so I know that I was conscious of but one sense that of seeing and of but one faculty that of judgment Would he flinch break down betray guilt or simply show astonishment I chose to believe it was the latter feeling only which informed his slowly whitening and disturbed features Certainly it was all his words expressed as his glances flew from the stone to the gloves and back again to the inspector s face I can not believe it I can not believe it And his hand flew wildly to his forehead Yet it is the truth mister Durand and one you have now to face How will you do this By any further explanations or by what you may consider a discreet silence I have nothing to explain the facts are as I have stated The inspector regarded him with an earnestness which made my heart sink You can fix the time of this visit I hope tell us I mean just when you left the alcove You must have seen some one who can speak for you I fear not Why did he look so disturbed and uncertain There were but few persons in the hall just then he went on to explain No one was sitting on the yellow divan You know where you went though Whom you saw and what you did before the alarm spread Inspector I am quite confused I did go somewhere I did not remain in that part of the hall But I can tell you nothing definite save that I walked about mostly among strangers till the cry rose which sent us all in one direction and me to the side of my fainting sweetheart Can you pick out any stranger you talked to or any one who might have noted you during this interval You see for the sake of this little woman I wish to give you every chance Inspector I am obliged to throw myself on your mercy I have no such witness to my innocence as you call for Innocent people seldom have It is only the guilty who take the trouble to provide for such contingencies This was all very well if it had been uttered with a straightforward air and in a clear tone But it was not I who loved him felt that it was not and consequently was more or less prepared for the change which now took place in the inspector s manner Yet it pierced me to the heart to observe this change and I instinctively dropped my face into my hands when I saw him move toward mister Durand with some final order or word of caution Instantly and who can account for such phenomena there floated into view before my retina a reproduction of the picture I had seen or imagined myself to have seen in the supper room and as at that time it opened before me an unknown vista quite removed from the surrounding scene so it did now and I beheld again in faint outlines and yet with the effect of complete distinctness a square of light through which appeared an open passage partly shut off from view by a half lifted curtain and the tall figure of a man holding back this curtain and gazing or seeming to gaze at his own breast on which he had already laid one quivering finger What did it mean In the excitement of the horrible occurrence which had engrossed us all I had forgotten this curious experience but on feeling anew the vague sensation of shock and expectation which seemed its natural accompaniment I became conscious of a sudden conviction that the picture which had opened before me in the supper room was the result of a reflection in a glass or mirror of something then going on in a place not otherwise within the reach of my vision a reflection the importance of which I suddenly realized when I recalled at what a critical moment it had occurred A man in a state of dread looking at his breast within five minutes of the stir and rush of the dreadful event which had marked this evening A hope great as the despair in which I had just been sunk gave me courage to drop my hands and advance impetuously toward the inspector Don t speak I pray don t judge any of us further till you have heard what I have to say In great astonishment and with an aspect of some severity he asked me what I had to say now which I had not had the opportunity of saying before I replied with all the passion of a forlorn hope that it was only at this present moment I remembered a fact which might have a very decided bearing on this case and detecting evidences as I thought of relenting on his part I backed up this statement by an entreaty for a few words with him apart as the matter I had to tell was private and possibly too fanciful for any ear but his own He looked as if he apprehended some loss of valuable time but touched by the involuntary gesture of appeal with which I supplemented my request he led me into a corner where with just an encouraging glance toward mister Durand who seemed struck dumb by my action I told the inspector of that momentary picture which I had seen reflected in what I was now sure was some window pane or mirror It was at a time coincident or very nearly coincident with the perpetration of the crime you are now investigating I concluded Within five minutes afterward came the shout which roused us all to what had happened in the alcove I do not know what passage I saw or what door or even what figure but the latter I am sure was that of the guilty man Something in the outline and it was the outline only I could catch expressed an emotion incomprehensible to me at the moment but which in my remembrance impresses me as that of fear and dread It was not the entrance to the alcove I beheld that would have struck me at once but some other opening which I might recognize if I saw it Can not that opening be found and may it not give a clue to the man I saw skulking through it with terror and remorse in his heart Was this figure when you saw it turned toward you or away the inspector inquired with unexpected interest Turned partly away He was going from me And you sat where Shall I show you The inspector bowed then with a low word of caution turned to my uncle I am going to take this young lady into the hall for a moment at her own request May I ask you and mister Durand to await me here Without pausing for reply he threw open the door and presently we were pacing the deserted supper room seeking the place where I had sat I found it almost by a miracle everything being in great disorder Guided by my bouquet which I had left behind me in my escape from the table I laid hold of the chair before which it lay and declared quite confidently to the inspector This is where I sat Naturally his glance and mine both flew to the opposite wall A window was before us of an unusual size and make Unlike any which had ever before come under my observation it swung on a pivot and though shut at the present moment might very easily when opened present its huge pane at an angle capable of catching reflections from some of the many mirrors decorating the reception room situated diagonally across the hall As all the doorways on this lower floor were of unusual width an open path was offered as it were for these reflections to pass making it possible for scenes to be imaged here which to the persons involved would seem as safe from any one s scrutiny as if they were taking place in the adjoining house As we realized this a look passed between us of more than ordinary significance Pointing to the window the inspector turned to a group of waiters watching us from the other side of the room and asked if it had been opened that evening The answer came quickly Yes sir just before the the I understand broke in the inspector and leaning over me he whispered Tell me again exactly what you thought you saw But I could add little to my former description Perhaps you can tell me this he kindly persisted Was the picture when you saw it on a level with your eye or did you have to lift your head in order to see it It was high up in the air as it were That seemed its oddest feature The inspector s mouth took a satisfied curve Possibly I might identify the door and passage if I saw them I suggested Certainly certainly was his cheerful rejoinder and summoning one of his men he was about to give some order when his impulse changed and he asked if I could draw I assured him in some surprise that I was far from being an adept in that direction but that possibly I might manage a rough sketch whereupon he pulled a pad and pencil from his pocket and requested me to make some sort of attempt to reproduce on paper my memory of this passage and the door My heart was beating violently and the pencil shook in my hand but I knew that it would not do for me to show any hesitation in fixing for all eyes what unaccountably to myself continued to be perfectly plain to my own So I endeavored to do as he bade me and succeeded to some extent for he uttered a slight ejaculation at one of its features and while duly expressing his thanks honored me with a very sharp look Is this your first visit to this house he asked No I have been here before In the evening or in the afternoon In the afternoon I am told that the main entrance is not in use to night No A side door is provided for occasions like the present Guests entering there find a special hall and staircase by which they can reach the upstairs dressing rooms without crossing the main hall Is that what you mean Yes that is what I mean I stared at him in wonder What lay back of such questions as these You came in as others did by this side entrance he now proceeded Did you notice as you turned to go up stairs an arch opening into a small passageway at your left I did not I began flushing for I thought I understood him now I was too eager to reach the dressing room to look about me Very well he replied I may want to show you that arch The outline of an arch backing the figure we were endeavoring to identify was a marked feature in the sketch I had shown him Will you take a seat near by while I make a study of this matter I turned with alacrity to obey There was something in his air and manner which made me almost buoyant Had my fanciful interpretation of what I had seen reached him with the conviction it had me If so there was hope hope for the man I loved who had gone in and out between curtains and not through any arch such as he had mentioned or I had described Providence was working for me I saw it in the way the men now moved about swinging the window to and fro under the instruction of the inspector manipulating the lights opening doors and drawing back curtains Providence was working for me and when a few minutes later I was asked to reseat myself in my old place at the supper table and take another look in that slightly deflected glass I knew that my effort had met with its reward and that for the second time I was to receive the impression of a place now indelibly imprinted on my consciousness Is not that it asked the inspector pointing at the glass with a last look at the imperfect sketch I had made him and which he still held in his hand Yes I eagerly responded All but the man He whose figure I see there is another person entirely I see no remorse or even fear in his looks Of course not You are looking at the reflection of one of my men Miss Van Arsdale do you recognize the place now under your eye I do not You spoke of an arch in the hall at the left of the carriage entrance and I see an arch in the window pane before me but You are looking straight through the alcove perhaps you did not know that another door opened at its back into the passage which runs behind it Farther on is the arch and beyond that arch the side hall and staircase leading to the dressing rooms This door the one in the rear of the alcove I mean is hidden from those entering from the main hall by draperies which have been hung over it for this occasion but it is quite visible from the back passageway and there can be no doubt that it was by its means the man whose reflected image you saw both entered and left the alcove It is an important fact to establish and we feel very much obliged to you for the aid you have given us in this matter Then as I continued to stare at him in my elation and surprise he added in quick explanation The lights in the alcove and in the several parlors are all hung with shades as you must perceive but the one in the hall beyond the arch is very bright which accounts for the distinctness of this double reflection Another thing and it is a very interesting point it would have been impossible for this reflection to be noticeable from where you sit if the level of the alcove flooring had not been considerably higher than that of the main floor But for this freak of the architect the continual passing to and fro of people would have prevented the reflection in its passage from surface to surface Miss Van Arsdale it would seem that by one of those chances which happen but once or twice in a lifetime every condition was propitious at the moment to make this reflection a possible occurrence even the location and width of the several doorways and the exact point at which the portiere was drawn aside from the entrance to the alcove It is wonderful I cried wonderful Then to his astonishment perhaps I asked if there was not a small door of communication between the passageway back of the alcove and the large central hall Yes he replied It opens just beyond the fireplace Three small steps lead to it I thought so I murmured but more to myself than to him In my mind I was thinking how a man if he so wished could pass from the very heart of this assemblage into the quiet passageway and so on into the alcove without attracting very much attention from his fellow guests I forgot that there was another way of approach even less noticeable that by the small staircase running up beyond the arch directly to the dressing rooms That no confusion may arise in any one s mind in regard to these curious approaches I subjoin a plan of this portion of the lower floor as it afterward appeared in the leading dailies And mister Durand I stammered as I followed the inspector back to the room where we had left that gentleman You will believe his statement now and look for this second intruder with the guiltily hanging head and frightened mien Yes he replied stopping me on the threshold of the door and taking my hand kindly in his if don t start my dear life is full of trouble for young and old and youth is the best time to face a sad experience if he is not himself the man you saw staring in frightened horror at his breast Have you not noticed that he is not dressed in all respects like the other gentlemen present That though he has not donned his overcoat he has put on somewhat prematurely one might say the large silk handkerchief lie presumably wears under it Have you not noticed this and asked yourself why I had noticed it I had noticed it from the moment I recovered from my fainting fit but I had not thought it a matter of sufficient interest to ask even of myself his reason for thus hiding his shirt front Now I could not My faculties were too confused my heart too deeply shaken by the suggestion which the inspector s words conveyed for me to be conscious of anything but the devouring question as to what I should do if by my own mistaken zeal I had succeeded in plunging the man I loved yet deeper into the toils in which he had become enmeshed The inspector left me no time for the settlement of this question Ushering me back into the room where mister Durand and my uncle awaited our return in apparently unrelieved silence he closed the door upon the curious eyes of the various persons still lingering in the hall and abruptly said to mister Durand The explanations you have been pleased to give of the manner in which this diamond came into your possession are not too fanciful for credence if you can satisfy us on another point which has awakened some doubt in the mind of one of my men mister Durand you appear to have prepared yourself for departure somewhat prematurely Do you mind removing that handkerchief for a moment My reason for so peculiar a request will presently appear Alas for my last fond hope mister Durand with a face as white as the background of snow framed by the uncurtained window against which he leaned lifted his hand as if to comply with the inspector s request then let it fall again with a grating laugh I see that I am not likely to escape any of the results of my imprudence he cried and with a quick jerk bared his shirt front A splash of red defiled its otherwise uniform whiteness That it was the red of heart s blood was proved by the shrinking look he unconsciously cast at it IV EXPLANATIONS My love for Anson Durand died at sight of that crimson splash or I thought it did In this spot of blood on the breast of him to whom I had given my heart I could read but one word guilt heinous guilt guilt denied and now brought to light in language that could be seen and read by all men Why should I stay in such a presence Had not the inspector himself advised me to go Yes but another voice bade me remain Just as I reached the door Anson Durand found his voice and I heard in the full sweet tones I loved so well Wait I am not to be judged like this I will explain But here the inspector interposed Do you think it wise to make any such attempt without the advice of counsel mister Durand The indignation with which mister Durand wheeled toward him raised in me a faint hope Good God yes he cried Would you have me leave Miss Van Arsdale one minute longer than is necessary to such dreadful doubts Rita Miss Van Arsdale weakness and weakness only has brought me into my present position I did not kill missus Fairbrother nor did I knowingly take her diamond though appearances look that way as I am very ready to acknowledge I did go to her in the alcove not once but twice and these are my reasons for doing so About three months ago a certain well known man of enormous wealth came to me with the request that I should procure for him a diamond of superior beauty He wished to give it to his wife and he wished it to outshine any which could now be found in New York This meant sending abroad an expense he was quite willing to incur on the sole condition that the stone should not disappoint him when he saw it and that it was to be in his hands on the eighteenth of March his wife s birthday Never before had I had such an opportunity for a large stroke of business Naturally elated I entered at once into correspondence with the best known dealers on the other side and last week a diamond was delivered to me which seemed to fill all the necessary requirements I had never seen a finer stone and was consequently rejoicing in my success when some one I do not remember who now chanced to speak in my hearing of the wonderful stone possessed by a certain missus Fairbrother a stone so large so brilliant and so precious altogether that she seldom wore it though it was known to connoisseurs and had a great reputation at Tiffany s where it had once been sent for some alteration in the setting Was this stone larger and finer than the one I had procured with so much trouble If so my labor had all been in vain for my patron must have known of this diamond and would expect to see it surpassed I was so upset by this possibility that I resolved to see the jewel and make comparisons for myself I found a friend who agreed to introduce me to the lady She received me very graciously and was amiable enough until the subject of diamonds was broached when she immediately stiffened and left me without an opportunity of proffering my request However on every other subject she was affable and I found it easy enough to pursue the acquaintance till we were almost on friendly terms But I never saw the diamond nor would she talk about it though I caused her some surprise when one day I drew out before her eyes the one I had procured for my patron and made her look at it Fine she cried fine But I failed to detect any envy in her manner and so knew that I had not achieved the object set me by my wealthy customer This was a woeful disappointment yet as missus Fairbrother never wore her diamond it was among the possibilities that he might be satisfied with the very fine gem I had obtained for him and influenced by this hope I sent him this morning a request to come and see it tomorrow Tonight I attended this ball and almost as soon as I enter the drawing room I hear that missus Fairbrother is present and is wearing her famous jewel What could you expect of me Why that I would make an effort to see it and so be ready with a reply to my exacting customer when he should ask me to morrow if the stone I showed him had its peer in the city But was not in the drawing room then and later I became interested elsewhere here he cast a look at me so that half the evening passed before I had an opportunity to join her in the so called alcove where I had seen her set up her miniature court What passed between us in the short interview we held together you will find me prepared to state if necessary It was chiefly marked by the one short view I succeeded in obtaining of her marvelous diamond in spite of the pains she took to hide it from me by some natural movement whenever she caught my eyes leaving her face But in that one short look I had seen enough This was a gem for a collector not to be worn save in a royal presence How had she come by it And could mister Smythe expect me to procure him a stone like that In my confusion I arose to depart but the lady showed a disposition to keep me and began chatting so vivaciously that I scarcely noticed that she was all the time engaged in drawing off her gloves Indeed I almost forgot the jewel possibly because her movements hid it so completely and only remembered it when with a sudden turn from the window where she had drawn me to watch the falling flakes she pressed the gloves into my hand with the coquettish request that I should take care of them for her I remember as I took them of striving to catch another glimpse of the stone whose brilliancy had dazzled me but she had opened her fan between us A moment after thinking I heard approaching steps I quitted the room This was my first visit As he stopped possibly for breath possibly to judge to what extent I was impressed by his account the inspector seized the opportunity to ask if missus Fairbrother had been standing any of this time with her back to him To which he answered yes while they were in the window Long enough for her to pluck off the jewel and thrust it into the gloves if she had so wished Quite long enough But you did not see her do this I did not And so took the gloves without suspicion Entirely so And carried them away Unfortunately yes Without thinking that she might want them the next minute I doubt if I was thinking seriously of her at all My thoughts were on my own disappointment Did you carry these gloves out in your hand No in my pocket I see And you met No one The sound I heard must have come from the rear hall And there was nobody on the steps No A gentleman was standing at their foot mister Grey the Englishman but his face was turned another way and he looked as if he had been in that same position for several minutes Did this gentleman mister Grey see you I can not say but I doubt it He appeared to be in a sort of dream There were other people about but nobody with whom I was acquainted Very good Now for the second visit you acknowledge having paid this unfortunate lady The inspector s voice was hard I clung a little more tightly to my uncle and mister Durand after one agonizing glance my way drew himself up as if quite conscious that he had entered upon the most serious part of the struggle I had forgotten the gloves in my hurried departure but presently I remembered them and grew very uneasy I did not like carrying this woman s property about with me I had engaged myself an hour before to Miss Van Arsdale and was very anxious to rejoin her The gloves worried me and finally after a little aimless wandering through the various rooms I determined to go back and restore them to their owner The doors of the supper room had just been flung open and the end of the hall near the alcove was comparatively empty save for a certain quizzical friend of mine whom I saw sitting with his partner on the yellow divan I did not want to encounter him just then for he had already joked me about my admiration for the lady with the diamond and so I conceived the idea of approaching her by means of a second entrance to the alcove unsuspected by most of those present but perfectly well known to me who have been a frequent guest in this house A door covered by temporary draperies connects as you may know this alcove with a passageway communicating directly with the hall of entrance and the up stairs dressing rooms To go up the main stairs and come down by the side one and so on through a small archway was a very simple matter for me If no early departing or late arriving guests were in that hall I need fear but one encounter and that was with the servant stationed at the carriage entrance But even he was absent at this propitious instant and I reached the door I sought without any unpleasantness This door opened out instead of in this I also knew when planning this surreptitious intrusion but after pulling it open and reaching for the curtain which hung completely across it I found it not so easy to proceed as I had imagined The stealthiness of my action held back my hand then the faint sounds I heard within advised me that she was not alone and that she might very readily regard with displeasure my unexpected entrance by a door of which she was possibly ignorant I tell you all this because if by any chance I was seen hesitating in face of that curtain doubts might have been raised which I am anxious to dispel Here his eyes left my face for that of the inspector It certainly had a bad look that I don t deny but I did not think of appearances then I was too anxious to complete a task which had suddenly presented unexpected difficulties That I listened before entering was very natural and when I heard no voice only something like a great sigh I ventured to lift the curtain and step in She was sitting not where I had left her but on a couch at the left of the usual entrance her face toward me and you know how Inspector It was her last sigh I had heard Horrified for I had never looked on death before much less crime I reeled forward meaning I presume to rush down the steps shouting for help when suddenly something fell splashing on my shirt front and I saw myself marked with a stain of blood This both frightened and bewildered me and it was a minute or two before I had the courage to look up When I did do so I saw whence this drop had come Not from her though the red stream was pouring down the rich folds of her dress but from a sharp needle like instrument which had been thrust point downward in the open work of an antique lantern hanging near the doorway What had happened to me might have happened to any one who chanced to be in that spot at that special moment but I did not realize this then Covering the splash with my hands I edged myself back to the door by which I had entered watching those deathful eyes and crushing under my feet the remnants of some broken china with which the carpet was bestrewn I had no thought of her hardly any of myself To cross the room was all to escape as secretly as I came before the portiere so nearly drawn between me and the main hall should stir under the hand of some curious person entering It was my first sight of blood my first contact with crime and that was what I did I fled The last word was uttered with a gasp Evidently he was greatly affected by this horrible experience I am ashamed of myself he muttered but nothing can now undo the fact I slid from the presence of this murdered woman as though she had been the victim of my own rage or cupidity and being fortunate enough to reach the dressing room before the alarm had spread beyond the immediate vicinity of the alcove found and put on the handkerchief which made it possible for me to rush down and find Miss Van Arsdale who somebody told me had fainted Not till I stood over her in that remote corner beyond the supper room did I again think of the gloves What I did when I happened to think of them you already know I could have shown no greater cowardice if I had known that the murdered woman s diamond was hidden inside them Yet I did not know this or even suspect it Nor do I understand now her reason for placing it there Why should missus Fairbrother risk such an invaluable gem to the custody of one she knew so little An unconscious custody too Was she afraid of being murdered if she retained this jewel The inspector thought a moment and then said You mention your dread of some one entering by the one door before you could escape by the other Do you refer to the friend you left sitting on the divan opposite No my friend had left that seat The portiere was sufficiently drawn for me to detect that If I had waited a minute longer he bitterly added I should have found my way open to the regular entrance and so escaped all this mister Durand you are not obliged to answer any of my questions but if you wish you may tell me whether at this moment of apprehension you thought of the danger you ran of being seen from outside by some one of the many coachmen passing by on the driveway No I did not even think of the window I don t know why but if any one passing by did see me I hope they saw enough to substantiate my story The inspector made no reply He seemed to be thinking I heard afterward that the curtains looped back in the early evening had been found hanging at full length over this window by those who first rushed in upon the scene of death Had he hoped to entrap mister Durand into some damaging admission Or was he merely testing his truth His expression afforded no clue to his thoughts and mister Durand noting this remarked with some dignity I do not expect strangers to accept these explanations which must sound strange and inadequate in face of the proof I carry of having been with that woman after the fatal weapon struck her heart But to one who knows me and knows me well I can surely appeal for credence to a tale which I here declare to be as true as if I had sworn to it in a court of justice Anson I passionately cried out loosening my clutch upon my uncle s arm My confidence in him had returned And then as I noted the inspector s businesslike air and my uncle s wavering look and unconvinced manner I felt my heart swell and flinging all discretion to the wind I bounded eagerly forward Laying my hands in those of mister Durand I cried fervently I believe in you Nothing but your own words shall ever shake my confidence in your innocence The sweet glad look I received was my best reply I could leave the room after that But not the house Another experience awaited me awaited us all before this full eventful evening came to a close V SUPERSTITION I had gone up stairs for my wraps my uncle having insisted on my withdrawing from a scene where my very presence seemed in some degree to compromise me Soon prepared for my departure I was crossing the hall to the small door communicating with the side staircase where my uncle had promised to await me when I felt myself seized by a desire to have another look below before leaving the place in which were centered all my deepest interests A wide landing breaking up the main flight of stairs some few feet from the top offered me an admirable point of view With but little thought of possible consequences and no thought at all of my poor patient uncle I slipped down to this landing and protected by the unusual height of its balustrade allowed myself a parting glance at the scene with which my most poignant memories were henceforth to be connected Before me lay the large square of the central hall Opening out from this was the corridor leading to the front door and incidentally to the library As my glance ran down this corridor I beheld approaching from the room just mentioned the tall figure of the Englishman He halted as he reached the main hall and stood gazing eagerly at a group of men and women clustered near the fireplace a group on which I no sooner cast my own eye than my attention also became fixed The inspector had come from the room where I had left him with mister Durand and was showing to these people the extraordinary diamond which he had just recovered under such remarkable if not suspicious circumstances Young heads and old were meeting over it and I was straining my ears to hear such comments as were audible above the general hubbub when mister Grey made a quick move and I looked his way again in time to mark his air of concern and the uncertainty he showed whether to advance or retreat Unconscious of my watchful eye and noting no doubt that most of the persons in the group on which his own eye was leveled stood with their backs toward him he made no effort to disguise his profound interest in the stone His eye followed its passage from hand to hand with a covetous eagerness of which he may not have been aware and I was not at all surprised when after a short interval of troubled indecision he impulsively stepped forward and begged the privilege of handling the gem himself Our host who stood not far from the inspector said something to that gentleman which led to this request being complied with The stone was passed over to mister Grey and I saw possibly because my heart was in my eyes that the great man s hand trembled as it touched his palm Indeed his whole frame trembled and I was looking eagerly for the result of his inspection when on his turning to hold the jewel up to the light something happened so abnormal and so strange that no one who was fortunate or unfortunate enough to be present in the house at that instant will ever forget it This something was a cry coming from no one knew where which unearthly in its shrillness and the power it had on the imagination reverberated through the house and died away in a wail so weird so thrilling and so prolonged that it gripped not only my own nerveless and weakened heart but those of the ten strong men congregated below me The diamond dropped from mister Grey s hand and neither he nor any one else moved to pick it up Not till silence had come again a silence almost as unendurable to the sensitive ear as the cry which had preceded it did any one stir or think of the gem Then one gentleman after another bent to look for it but with no success till one of the waiters who possibly had followed it with his eye or caught sight of its sparkle on the edge of the rug whither it had rolled sprang and picked it up and handed it back to mister Grey Instinctively the Englishman s hand closed on it but it was very evident to me and I think to all that his interest in it was gone If he looked at it he did not see it for he stood like one stunned all the time that agitated men and women were running hither and thither in unavailing efforts to locate the sound yet ringing in their ears Not till these various searchers had all come together again in terror of a mystery they could not solve did he let his hand fall and himself awake to the scene about him The words he at once gave utterance to were as remarkable as all the rest Gentlemen said he you must pardon my agitation This cry you need not seek its source is one to which I am only too well accustomed I have been the happy father of six children Five I have buried and before the death of each this same cry has echoed in my ears I have but one child left a daughter she is ill at the hotel Do you wonder that I shrink from this note of warning and show myself something less than a man under its influence I am going home but first one word about this stone Here he lifted it and bestowed or appeared to bestow on it an anxious scrutiny putting on his glasses and examining it carefully before passing it back to the inspector I have heard said he with a change of tone which must have been noticeable to every one that this stone was a very superior one and quite worthy of the fame it bore here in America But gentlemen you have all been greatly deceived in it no one more than he who was willing to commit murder for its possession The stone which you have just been good enough to allow me to inspect is no diamond but a carefully manufactured bit of paste not worth the rich and elaborate setting which has been given to it I am sorry to be the one to say this but I have made a study of precious stones and I can not let this bare faced imitation pass through my hands without a protest mister Ramsdell this to our host I beg you will allow me to utter my excuses and depart at once My daughter is worse this I know as certainly as that I am standing here The cry you have heard is the one superstition of our family Pray God that I find her alive After this what could be said Though no one who had heard him not even my own romantic self showed any belief in this interpretation of the remarkable sound that had just gone thrilling through the house yet in face of his declared acceptance of it as a warning and the fact that all efforts had failed to locate the sound or even to determine its source no other course seemed open but to let this distinguished man depart with the suddenness his superstitious fears demanded That this was in opposition to the inspector s wishes was evident enough Naturally he would have preferred mister Grey to remain if only to make clear his surprising conclusions in regard to a diamond which had passed through the hands of some of the best judges in the country without a doubt having been raised as to its genuineness With his departure the inspector s manner changed He glanced at the stone in his hand and slowly shook his head I doubt if mister Grey s judgment can be depended on to night said he and pocketed the gem as carefully as if his belief in its real value had been but little disturbed by the assertions of this renowned foreigner I have no distinct remembrance of how I finally left the house or of what passed between my uncle and myself on our way home I was numb with the shock and neither my intelligence nor my feelings were any longer active I recall but one impression and that was the effect made on me by my old home on our arrival there as of something new and strange so much had happened and such changes had taken place in myself since leaving it five hours before But nothing else is vivid in my remembrance till that early hour of the dreary morning when on waking to the world with a cry I beheld my uncle s anxious figure bending over me from the foot board Instantly I found tongue and question after question leaped from my lips He did not answer them he could not but when I grew feverish and insistent he drew the morning paper from behind his back and laid it quietly down within my reach I felt calmed in an instant and when after a few affectionate words he left me to myself I seized on the sheet and read what so many others were reading at that moment throughout the city I spare you the account so far as it coincides with what I had myself seen and heard the night before A few particulars which had not reached my ears will interest you The instrument of death found in the place designated by mister Durand was one of note to such as had any taste or knowledge of curios It was a stiletto of the most delicate type long keen and slender Not an American product not even of this century s manufacture but a relic of the days when deadly thrusts were given in the corners and by ways of medieval streets This made the first mystery The second was the as yet unexplainable presence on the alcove floor of two broken coffee cups which no waiter nor any other person in fact admitted having carried there The tray which had fallen from Peter Mooney s hand the waiter who had been the first to give the alarm of murder had held no cups only ices This was a fact proved But the handles of two cups had been found among the debris cups which must have been full from the size of the coffee stain left on the rug where they had fallen In reading this I remembered that mister Durand had mentioned stepping on some broken pieces of china in his escape from the fatal scene and struck with this confirmation of a theory which was slowly taking form in my own mind I passed on to the next paragraph with a sense of expectation The result was a surprise Others may have been told I was not that missus Fairbrother had received a communication from outside only a few minutes previous to her death A mister Fullerton who had preceded mister Durand in his visit to the alcove owned to having opened the window for her at some call or signal from outside and taken in a small piece of paper which he saw lifted up from below on the end of a whip handle He could not see who held the whip but at missus Fairbrother s entreaty he unpinned the note and gave it to her While she was puzzling over it for it was apparently far from legible he took another look out in time to mark a figure rush from below toward the carriage drive He did not recognize the figure nor would he know it again As to the nature of the communication itself he could say nothing save that missus Fairbrother did not seem to be affected favorably by it She frowned and was looking very gloomy when he left the alcove Asked if he had pulled the curtains together after closing the window he said that he had not that she had not requested him to do so This story which was certainly a strange one had been confirmed by the testimony of the coachman who had lent his whip for the purpose This coachman who was known to be a man of extreme good nature had seen no harm in lending his whip to a poor devil who wished to give a telegram or some such hasty message to the lady sitting just above them in a lighted window The wind was fierce and the snow blinding and it was natural that the man should duck his head but he remembered his appearance well enough to say that he was either very cold or very much done up and that he wore a greatcoat with the collar pulled up about his ears When he came back with the whip he seemed more cheerful than when he asked for it but had no thank you for the favor done him or if he had it was lost in his throat and the piercing gale The communication which was regarded by the police as a matter of the highest importance had been found in her hand by the coroner It was a mere scrawl written in pencil on a small scrap of paper The following facsimile of the scrawl was given to the public in the hope that some one would recognize the handwriting The first two lines overlapped and were confused but the last one was clear enough Expect trouble if If what Hundreds were asking the question and at this very moment I should soon be asking it too but first I must make an effort to understand the situation a situation which up to now appeared to involve mister Durand and mister Durand only as the suspected party This was no more than I expected yet it came with a shock under the broad glare of this wintry morning so impossible did it seem in the light of every day life that guilt could be associated in any one s mind with a man of such unblemished record and excellent standing But the evidence adduced against him was of a kind to appeal to the common mind we all know that evidence nor could I say after reading the full account that I was myself unaffected by its seeming weight Not that my faith in his innocence was shaken I had met his look of love and tender gratitude and my confidence in him had been restored but I saw with all the clearness of a mind trained by continuous study how difficult it was going to be to counteract the prejudice induced first by his own inconsiderate acts especially by that unfortunate attempt of his to secrete missus Fairbrother s gloves in another woman s bag and secondly by his peculiar explanations explanations which to many must seem forced and unnatural I saw and felt nerved to a superhuman task I believed him innocent and if others failed to prove him so I would undertake to clear him myself I the little Rita with no experience of law or courts or crime but with simply an unbounded faith in the man suspected and in the keenness of my own insight an insight which had already served me so well and would serve me yet better once I had mastered the details which must be the prelude to all intelligent action The morning s report stopped with the explanations given by mister Durand of the appearances against him Consequently no word appeared of the after events which had made such an impression at the time on all the persons present mister Grey was mentioned but simply as one of the guests and to no one reading this early morning issue would any doubt come as to the genuineness of the diamond which to all appearance had been the leading motive in the commission of this great crime The effect on my own mind of this suppression was a curious one I began to wonder if the whole event had not been a chimera of my disturbed brain a nightmare which had visited me and me alone and not a fact to be reckoned with But a moment s further thought served to clear my mind of all such doubts and I perceived that the police had only exercised common prudence in withholding mister Grey s sensational opinion of the stone till it could be verified by experts The two columns of gossip devoted to the family differences which had led to the separation of mister and missus Fairbrother I shall compress into a few lines They had been married three years before in the city of Baltimore He was a rich man then but not the multimillionaire he is to day Plain featured and without manner lie was no mate for this sparkling coquette whose charm was of the kind which grows with exercise Though no actual scandal was ever associated with her name he grew tired of her caprices and the conquests which she made no endeavor to hide either from him or from the world at large and at some time during the previous year they had come to a friendly understanding which led to their living apart each in grand style and with a certain deference to the proprieties which retained them their friends and an enviable place in society He was not often invited where she was and she never appeared in any assemblage where he was expected but with this exception little feeling was shown matters progressed smoothly and to their credit let it be said no one ever heard either of them speak otherwise than considerately of the other He was at present out or town having started some three weeks before for the southwest but would probably return on receipt of the telegram which had been sent him The comments made on the murder were necessarily hurried It was called a mystery but it was evident enough that mister Durand s detention was looked on as the almost certain prelude to his arrest on the charge of murder I had had some discipline in life Although a favorite of my wealthy uncle I had given up very early the prospects he held out to me of a continued enjoyment of his bounty and entered on duties which required self denial and hard work I did this because I enjoy having both my mind and heart occupied To be necessary to some one as a nurse is to a patient seemed to me an enviable fate till I came under the influence of Anson Durand Then the craving of all women for the common lot of their sex became my craving also a craving however to which I failed at first to yield for I felt that it was unshared and thus a token of weakness Fighting my battle I succeeded in winning it as I thought just as the nurse s diploma was put in my hands Then came the great surprise of my life Anson Durand expressed his love for me and I awoke to the fact that all my preparation had been for home joys and a woman s true existence One hour of ecstasy in the light of this new hope then tragedy and something approaching chaos Truly I had been through a schooling But was it one to make me useful in the only way I could be useful now I did not know I did not care I was determined on my course fit or unfit and in the relief brought by this appeal to my energy I rose and dressed and went about the duties of the day One of these was to determine whether mister Grey on his return to his hotel had found his daughter as ill as his fears had foreboded A telephone message or two satisfied me on this point Miss Grey was very ill but not considered dangerously so indeed if anything her condition was improved and if nothing happened in the way of fresh complications the prospects were that she would be out in a fortnight I was not surprised It was more than I had expected The cry of the banshee in an American house was past belief even in an atmosphere surcharged with fear and all the horror surrounding a great crime and in the secret reckoning I was making against a person I will not even name at this juncture I added it as another suspicious circumstance VI SUSPENSE To relate the full experiences of the next few days would be to encumber my narrative with unnecessary detail I did not see mister Durand again My uncle so amenable in most matters proved Inexorable on this point Till mister Durand s good name should be restored by the coroner s verdict or such evidence brought to light as should effectually place him beyond all suspicion I was to hold no communication with him of any sort whatever I remember the very words with which my uncle ended the one exhaustive conversation we had on the subject They were these You have fully expressed to mister Durand your entire confidence In his Innocence That must suffice him for the present If he Is the honest gentleman you think him It will As uncle seldom asserted himself and as he is very much in earnest when he does I made no attempt to combat this resolution especially as it met the approval of my better judgment But though my power to convey sympathy fell thus under a yoke my thoughts and feelings remained free and these were all consecrated to the man struggling under an imputation the disgrace and humiliation of which he was but poorly prepared by his former easy life of social and business prosperity to meet For mister Durand in spite of the few facts which came up from time to time in confirmation of his story continued to be almost universally regarded as a suspect This seemed to me very unjust What if no other clue offered no other clue I mean recognized as such by police or public Was he not to have the benefit of whatever threw a doubt on his own culpability For instance that splash of blood on his shirt front which I had seen and the shape of which I knew Why did not the fact that it was a splash and not a spatter and spatter it would have been had it spurted there instead of falling from above as he stated count for more in the minds of those whose business it was to probe into the very heart of this crime To me it told such a tale of innocence that I wondered how a man like the inspector could pass over it But later I understood A single word enlightened me The stain it was true was In the form of a splash and not a spurt but a splash would have been the result of a drop falling from the reeking end of the stiletto whether it dislodged itself early or late And what was there to prove that this drop had not fallen at the instant the stiletto was being thrust Into the lantern instead of after the escape of the criminal and the entrance of another man But the mystery of the broken coffee cups For that no explanation seemed to be forthcoming And the still unsolved one of the written warning found in the murdered woman s hand a warning which had been deciphered to read Be warned He means to be at the ball Expect trouble if Was that to be looked upon as directed against a man who from the nature of his projected attempt would take no one into his confidence Then the stiletto a photographic reproduction of which was in all the papers was that the kind of instrument which a plain New York gentleman would be likely to use In a crime of this nature It was a marked and unique article capable as one would think of being easily traced to its owner Had it been claimed by mister Ramsdell had it been recognized as one of the many works of art scattered about the highly decorated alcove its employment as a means of death would have gone only to prove the possibly unpremeditated nature of the crime and so been valueless as the basis of an argument in favor of mister Durand s innocence But mister Ramsdell had disclaimed from the first all knowledge of it consequently one could but feel justified in asking whether a man of mister Durand s judgment would choose such an extraordinary weapon in meditating so startling a crime which from its nature and circumstance could not fail to attract the attention of the whole civilized world Another argument advanced by himself and subscribed to by all his friends was this That a dealer in precious stones would be the last man to seek by any unlawful means to possess so conspicuous a jewel For he better than any one else would know the impossibility of disposing of a gem of this distinction in any market short of the Orient To which the unanswerable reply was made that no one attributed to him any such folly that if he had planned to possess himself of this great diamond it was for the purpose of eliminating it from competition with the one he had procured for mister Smythe an argument certainly which drove us back on the only plea we had at our command his hitherto unblemished reputation and the confidence which was felt In him by those who knew him But the one circumstance which affected me most at the time and which undoubtedly was the source of the greatest confusion to all minds whether official or otherwise was the unexpected confirmation by experts of mister Grey s opinion in regard to the diamond His name was not used indeed it had been kept out of the papers with the greatest unanimity but the hint he had given the inspector at mister Ramsdell s ball had been acted upon and the proper tests having been made the stone for which so many believed a life to have been risked and another taken was declared to be an imitation fine and successful beyond all parallel but still an imitation of the great and renowned gem which had passed through Tiffany s hands a twelve month before a decision which fell like a thunderbolt on all such as had seen the diamond blazing in unapproachable brilliancy on the breast of the unhappy missus Fairbrother only an hour or two before her death On me the effect was such that for days I lived in a dream a condition that nevertheless did not prevent me from starting a certain little inquiry of my own of which more hereafter Here let me say that I did not share the general confusion on this topic I had my own theory both as to the cause of this substitution and the moment when it was made But the time had not yet come for me to advance it I could only stand back and listen to the suppositions aired by the press suppositions which fomented so much private discussion that ere long the one question most frequently heard in this connection was not who struck the blow which killed missus Fairbrother this was a question which some seemed to think settled but whose juggling hand had palmed off the paste for the diamond and how and when and where had the jugglery taken place Opinions on this point were as I have said many and various Some fixed upon the moment of exchange as that very critical and hardly appreciable one elapsing between the murder and mister Durand s appearance upon the scene This theory I need not say was advanced by such as believed that while he was not guilty of missus Fairbrother s murder lie had been guilty of taking advantage of the same to rob the body of what in the terror and excitement of the moment he evidently took to be her great gem To others among whom were many eyewitnesses of the event it appeared to be a conceded fact that this substitution had been made prior to the ball and with missus Fairbrother s full cognizance The effectual way in which she had wielded her fan between the glittering ornament on her breast and the inquisitive glances constantly leveled upon it might at the time have been due to coquetry but to them it looked much more like an expression of fear lest the deception in which she was indulging should be discovered No one fixed the time where I did but then no one but myself had watched the scene with the eyes of love besides and this must be remembered most people among whom I ventured to count the police officials were mainly interested in proving mister Durand guilty while I with contrary mind was bent on establishing such facts as confirmed the explanations he had been pleased to give us explanations which necessitated a conviction on missus Fairbrother s part of the great value of the jewel she wore and the consequent advisability of ridding herself of it temporarily if as so many believed the full letter of the warning should read Be warned he means to be at the ball Expect trouble if you are found wearing the great diamond True she may herself have been deceived concerning it Unconsciously to herself she may have been the victim of a daring fraud on the part of some hanger on who had access to her jewels but as no such evidence had yet come to life as she had no recognized or so far as could be learned secret lover or dishonest dependent and moreover as no gem of such unusual value was known to have been offered within the year here or abroad in public or private market I could not bring myself to credit this assumption possibly because I was so ignorant as to credit another and a different one one which you have already seen growing in my mind and which presumptuous as it was kept my courage from failing through all those dreadful days of enforced waiting and suspense For I was determined not to intrude my suggestions valuable as I considered them till all hope was gone of his being righted by the judgment of those who would not lightly endure the interference of such an insignificant mote in the great scheme of justice as myself The inquest which might be trusted to bring out all these doubtful points had been delayed in anticipation of mister Fairbrother s return His testimony could not but prove valuable if not in fixing the criminal at least in settling the moot point as to whether the stone which the estranged wife had carried away with her on leaving the house had been the genuine one returned to him from Tiffany s or the well known imitation now in the hands of the police He had been located somewhere in the mountains of lower Colorado but strange to say It had been found impossible to enter into direct communication with him nor was it known whether he was aware as yet of his wife s tragic death So affairs went slowly in New York and the case seemed to come to a standstill when public opinion was suddenly reawakened and a more definite turn given to the whole matter by a despatch from Santa Fe to the Associated Press This despatch was to the effect that Abner Fairbrother had passed through that city some three days before on his way to his new mining camp the Placide that he then showed symptoms of pneumonia and from advices since received might be regarded as a very sick man Ill well that explained matters His silence which many had taken for indifference was that of a man physically disabled and unfit for exertion of any kind Ill a tragic circumstance which roused endless conjecture Was he aware or was he not aware of his wife s death Had he been taken ill before or after he left Colorado for New Mexico Was he suffering mainly from shock or as would appear from his complaint from a too rapid change of climate The whole country seethed with excitement and my poor little unthought of insignificant self burned with impatience which only those who have been subjected to a like suspense can properly estimate Would the proceedings which were awaited with so much anxiety be further delayed Would mister Durand remain indefinitely in durance and under such a cloud of disgrace as would kill some men and might kill him Should I be called upon to endure still longer the suffering which this entailed upon me when I thought I knew But fortune was less obdurate than I feared Next morning a telegraphic statement from Santa Fe settled one of the points of this great dispute a statement which you will find detailed at more length in the following communication which appeared a few days later in one of our most enterprising journals It was from a resident correspondent in New Mexico and was written as the editor was careful to say for his own eyes and not for the public He had ventured however to give It in full knowing the great interest which this whole subject had for his readers VII NIGHT AND A VOICE Not to be outdone by the editor I insert the article here with all its details the importance of which I trust I have anticipated SANTA FE N M April Arrived in Santa Fe I inquired where Abner Fairbrother could be found I was told that he was at his mine sick Upon inquiring as to the location of the Placide I was informed that it was fifteen miles or so distant in the mountains and upon my expressing an intention of going there immediately I was given what I thought very unnecessary advice and then directed to a certain livery stable where I was told I could get the right kind of a horse and such equipment as I stood in need of I thought I was equipped all right as it was but I said nothing and went on to the livery stable Here I was shown a horse which I took to at once and was about to mount when a pair of leggings was brought to me You will need these for your journey said the man Journey I repeated Fifteen miles The livery stable keeper a half breed with a peculiarly pleasant smile cocked up his shoulders with the remark Three men as willing but as inexperienced as yourself have attempted the same journey during the last week and they all came back before they reached the divide You will probably come back too but I shall give you as fair a start as if I knew you were going straight through But a woman has done it said I a nurse from the hospital went up that very road last week Oh women they can do anything women who are nurses But they don t start off alone You are going alone Yes I remarked grimly Newspaper correspondents make their journeys singly when they can Oh you are a newspaper correspondent Why do so many men from the papers want to see that sick old man Because he s so rich Don t you know I asked He did not seem to I wondered at his ignorance but did not enlighten him Follow the trail and ask your way from time to time All the goatherds know where the Placide mine is Such were his simple instructions as he headed my horse toward the canyon But as I drew off he shouted out If you get stuck leave it to the horse He knows more about it than you do With a vague gesture toward the northwest he turned away leaving me in contemplation of the grandest scenery I had yet come upon in all my travels Fifteen miles but those miles lay through the very heart of the mountains ranging anywhere from six to seven thousand feet high In ten minutes the city and all signs of city life were out of sight In five more I was seemingly as far removed from all civilization as if I had gone a hundred miles into the wilderness As my horse settled down to work picking his way now here and now there sometimes over the brown earth hard and baked as in a thousand furnaces and sometimes over the stunted grass whose needle like stalks seemed never to have known moisture I let my eyes roam to such peaks as were not cut off from view by the nearer hillsides and wondered whether the snow which capped them was whiter than any other or the blue of the sky bluer that the two together had the effect upon me of cameo work on a huge and unapproachable scale Certainly the effect of these grand mountains into which you leap without any preparation from the streets and market places of America s oldest city is such as is not easily described We struck water now and then narrow water courses which my horse followed in mid stream and more interesting yet goatherds with their flocks Mexicans all who seemed to understand no English but were picturesque enough to look at and a welcome break in the extreme lonesomeness of the way I had been told that they would serve me as guides if I felt at all doubtful of the trail and in one or two instances they proved to be of decided help They could gesticulate if they could not speak English and when I tried them with the one word Placide they would nod and point out which of the many side canyons I was to follow But they always looked up as they did so up up till I took to looking up too and when after miles multiplied indefinitely by the winding of the trail I came out upon a ledge from which a full view of the opposite range could be had and saw fronting me from the side of one of its tremendous peaks the gap of a vast hole not two hundred feet from the snowline I knew that inaccessible as it looked I was gazing up at the opening of Abner Fairbrother s new mine the Placide The experience was a strange one The two ranges approached so nearly that it seemed as if a ball might be tossed from one to the other But the chasm between was stupendous I grew dizzy as I looked downward and saw the endless zigzags yet to be traversed step by step before the bottom of the canyon could be reached and then the equally interminable zigzags up the acclivity beyond all of which I must trace still step by step before I could hope to arrive at the camp which from where I stood looked to be almost within hail of my voice I have described the mine as a hole That was all I saw at first a great black hole in the dark brown earth of the mountain side from which ran down a still darker streak into the waste places far below it But as I looked longer I saw that it was faced by a ledge cut out of the friable soil on which I was now able to descry the pronounced white of two or three tent tops and some other signs of life encouraging enough to the eye of one whose lot it was to crawl like a fly up that tremendous mountain side Truly I could understand why those three men probably newspaper correspondents like myself had turned back to Santa Fe after a glance from my present outlook But though I understood I did not mean to duplicate their retreat The sight of those tents the thought of what one of them contained inspired me with new courage and releasing my grip upon the rein I allowed my patient horse to proceed Shortly after this I passed the divide that is where the water sheds both ways then the descent began It was zigzag just as the climb had been but I preferred the climb I did not have the unfathomable spaces so constantly before me nor was my imagination so active It was fixed on heights to be attained rather than on valleys to roll into However I did not roll The Mexican saddle held me securely at whatever angle I was poised and once the bottom was reached I found that I could face with considerable equanimity the corresponding ascent Only as I saw how steep the climb bade fair to be I did not see how I was ever to come down again Going up was possible but the descent However as what goes up must in the course of nature come down I put this question aside and gave my horse his head after encouraging him with a few blades of grass which he seemed to find edible enough though they had the look and something of the feel of spun glass How we got there you must ask this good animal who took all the responsibility and did all the work I merely clung and balanced and at times when he rounded the end of a zigzag for instance I even shut my eyes though the prospect was magnificent At last even his patience seemed to give out and he stopped and trembled But before I could open my eyes on the abyss beneath he made another effort I felt the brush of tree branches across my face and looking up saw before me the ledge or platform dotted with tents at which I had looked with such longing from the opposite hillsides Simultaneously I heard voices and saw approaching a bronzed and bearded man with strongly marked Scotch features and a determined air The doctor I involuntarily exclaimed with a glance at the small and curious tent before which he stood guard Yes the doctor he answered in unexpectedly good English And who are you Have you brought the mail and those medicines I sent for No I replied with as propitiatory a smile as I could muster up in face of his brusk forbidding expression I came on my own errand I am a representative of the New York and I hope you will not deny me a word with mister Fairbrother With a gesture I hardly knew how to interpret he took my horse by the rein and led us on a few steps toward another large tent where he motioned me to descend Then he laid his hand on my shoulder and forcing me to meet his eye said You have made this journey I believe you said from New York to see mister Fairbrother Why Because mister Fairbrother is at present the most sought for man in America I returned boldly His wife you know about his wife No How should I know about his wife I know what his temperature is and what his respiration is but his wife What about his wife He don t know anything about her now himself he is not allowed to read letters But you read the papers You must have known before you left Santa Fe of missus Fairbrother s foul and most mysterious murder in New York It has been the theme of two continents for the last ten days He shrugged his shoulders which might mean anything and confined his reply to a repetition of my own words missus Fairbrother murdered he exclaimed but in a suppressed voice to which point was given by the cautious look he cast behind him at the tent which had drawn my attention He must not know it man I could not answer for his life if he received the least shock in his present critical condition Murdered When Ten days ago at a ball in New York It was after mister Fairbrother left the city He was expected to return after hearing the news but he seems to have kept straight on to his destination He was not very fond of his wife that is they have not been living together for the last year But he could not help feeling the shock of her death which he must have heard of somewhere along the route He has said nothing in his delirium to show that he knew it It is possible just possible that he didn t read the papers He could not have been well for days before he reached Santa Fe When were you called in to attend him The very night after he reached this place It was thought he wouldn t live to reach the camp But he is a man of great pluck He held up till his foot touched this platform Then he succumbed If he was as sick as that I muttered why did he leave Santa Fe He must have known what it would mean to be sick here I don t think he did This is his first visit to the mine He evidently knew nothing of the difficulties of the road But he would not stop He was determined to reach the camp even after he had been given a sight of it from the opposite mountain He told them that he had once crossed the Sierras in midwinter But he wasn t a sick man then Doctor they don t know who killed his wife He didn t I know but under such circumstances every fact bearing on the event is of immense importance There is one which mister Fairbrother only can make clear It can be said in a word The grim doctor s eye flashed angrily and I stopped Were you a detective from the district attorney s office in New York sent on with special powers to examine him I should still say what I am going to say now While mister Fairbrother s temperature and pulse remain where they now are no one shall see him and no one shall talk to him save myself and his nurse I turned with a sick look of disappointment toward the road up which I had so lately come Have I panted sweltered trembled for three mortal hours on the worst trail a man ever traversed to go back with nothing for my journey That seems to me hard lines Where is the manager of this mine The doctor pointed toward a man bending over the edge of the great hole from which at that moment a line of Mexicans was issuing each with a sack on his back which he flung down before what looked like a furnace built of clay That s he mister Haines of Philadelphia What do you want of him Permission to stay the night mister Fairbrother may be better to morrow I won t allow it and I am master here so far as my patient is concerned You couldn t stay here without talking and talking makes excitement and excitement is just what he can not stand A week from now I will see about it that is if my patient continues to improve I am not sure that he will Let me spend that week here I ll not talk any more than the dead Maybe the manager will let me carry sacks Look here said the doctor edging me farther and farther away from the tent he hardly let out of his sight for a moment You re a canny lad and shall have your bite and something to drink before you take your way back But back you go before sunset and with this message No man from any paper north or south will be received here till I hang out a blue flag I say blue for that is the color of my bandana When my patient is in a condition to discuss murder I ll hoist it from his tent top It can be seen from the divide and if you want to camp there on the lookout well and good As for the police that s another matter I will see them if they come but they need not expect to talk to my patient You may say so down there It will save scrambling up this trail to no purpose You may count on me said I trust a New York correspondent to do the right thing at the right time to head off the boys But I doubt if they will believe me In that case I shall have a barricade thrown up fifty feet down the mountain side said he But the mail and your supplies Oh the burros can make their way up We shan t suffer You are certainly master I remarked All this time I had been using my eyes There was not much to see but what there was was romantically interesting Aside from the furnace and what was going on there there was little else but a sleeping tent a cooking tent and the small one I had come on first which without the least doubt contained the sick man This last tent was of a peculiar construction and showed the primitive nature of everything at this height It consisted simply of a cloth thrown over a thing like a trapeze This cloth did not even come to the ground on either side but stopped short a foot or so from the flat mound of adobe which serves as a base or floor for hut or tent in New Mexico The rear of the simple tent abutted on the mountain side the opening was toward the valley I felt an intense desire to look into this opening so intense that I thought I would venture on an attempt to gratify it Scrutinizing the resolute face of the man before me and flattering myself that I detected signs of humor underlying his professional bruskness I asked somewhat mournfully if he would let me go away without so much as a glance at the man I had come so far to see A glimpse would satisfy me I assured him as the hint of a twinkle flashed in his eye Surely there will be no harm in that I ll take it instead of supper He smiled but not encouragingly and I was feeling very despondent indeed when the canvas on which our eyes were fixed suddenly shook and the calm figure of a woman stepped out before us clad in the simplest garb but showing in every line of face and form a character of mingled kindness and shrewdness She was evidently on the lookout for the doctor for she made a sign as she saw him and returned instantly into the tent mister Fairbrother has just fallen asleep he explained It isn t discipline and I shall have to apologize to Miss Serra but if you will promise not to speak nor make the least disturbance I will let you take the one peep you prefer to supper I promise said I Leading the way to the opening he whispered a word to the nurse then motioned me to look in The sight was a simple one but to me very impressive The owner of palaces a man to whom millions were as thousands to such poor devils as myself lay on an improvised bed of evergreens wrapped in a horse blanket and with nothing better than another of these rolled up under his head At his side sat his nurse on what looked like the uneven stump of a tree Close to her hand was a tolerably flat stone on which I saw arranged a number of bottles and such other comforts as were absolutely necessary to a proper care of the sufferer That was all In these few words I have told the whole story To be sure this simple tent perched seven thousand feet and more above sea level had one advantage which even his great house in New York could not offer This was the out look Lying as he did facing the valley he had only to open his eyes to catch a full view of the panorama of sky and mountain stretched out before him It was glorious whether seen at morning noon or night glorious But I doubt if he would not gladly have exchanged it for a sight of his home walls As I started to go a stir took place in the blanket wrapped about his chin and I caught a glimpse of the iron gray head and hollow cheeks of the great financier He was a very sick man Even I could see that Had I obtained the permission I sought and been allowed to ask him one of the many questions burning on my tongue I should have received only delirium for reply There was no reaching that clouded intelligence now and I felt grateful to the doctor for convincing me of it I told him so and thanked him quite warmly when we were well away from the tent and his answer was almost kindly though he made no effort to hide his impatience and anxiety to see me go The looks he cast at the sun were significant and having no wish to antagonize him and every wish to visit the spot again I moved toward my horse with the intention of untying him To my surprise the doctor held me back You can t go to night said he your horse has hurt himself It was true There was something the matter with the animal s left forefoot As the doctor lifted it the manager came up He agreed with the doctor I could not make the descent to Santa Fe on that horse that night Did I feel elated Rather I had no wish to descend Yet I was far from foreseeing what the night was to bring me I was turned over to the manager but not without a final injunction from the doctor Not a word to any one about your errand Not a word about the New York tragedy as you value mister Fairbrother s life Not a word said I Then he left me To see the sun go down and the moon come up from a ledge hung as it were in mid air The experience was novel but I refrain I have more important matters to relate I was given a bunk at the extreme end of the long sleeping tent and turned in with the rest I expected to sleep but on finding that I could catch a sight of the sick tent from under the canvas I experienced such fascination in watching this forbidden spot that midnight came before I had closed my eyes Then all desire to sleep left me for the patient began to moan and presently to talk and the stillness of the solitary height being something abnormal I could sometimes catch the very words Devoid as they were of all rational meaning they excited my curiosity to the burning point for who could tell if he might not say something bearing on the mystery But that fevered mind had recurred to early scenes and the babble which came to my ears was all of mining camps in the Rockies and the dicker of horses Perhaps the uneasy movement of my horse pulling at the end of his tether had disturbed him Perhaps But at the inner utterance of the second perhaps I found myself up on my elbow listening with all my ears and staring with wide stretched eyes at the thicket of stunted trees where the road debouched on the platform Something was astir there besides my horse I could catch sounds of an unmistakable nature A rider was coming up the trail Slipping back into my place I turned toward the doctor who lay some two or three bunks nearer the opening He had started up too and in a moment was out of the tent I do not think he had observed my action for it was very dark where I lay and his back had been turned toward me As for the others they slept like the dead only they made more noise Interested everything is interesting at such a height I brought my eye to bear on the ledge and soon saw by the limpid light of a full moon the stiff short branches of the trees on which my gaze was fixed give way to an advancing horse and rider Halloo saluted the doctor in a whisper which was in itself a warning Easy there We have sickness in this camp and it s a late hour for visitors I know The answer was subdued but earnest I m the magistrate of this district I ve a question to ask this sick man on behalf of the New York Chief of Police who is a personal friend of mine It is connected with Hush The doctor had seized him by the arm and turned his face away from the sick tent Then the two heads came together and an argument began I could not hear a word of it but their motions were eloquent My sympathy was with the magistrate of course and I watched eagerly while he passed a letter over to the doctor who vainly strove to read it by the light of the moon Finding this impossible he was about to return it when the other struck a match and lit a lantern hanging from the horn of his saddle The two heads came together again but as quickly separated with every appearance of irreconcilement and I was settling back with sensations of great disappointment when a sound fell on the night so unexpected to all concerned that with a common impulse each eye sought the sick tent Water will some one give me water a voice had cried quietly and with none of the delirium which had hitherto rendered it unnatural The doctor started for the tent There was the quickness of surprise in his movement and the gesture he made to the magistrate as he passed in reawakened an expectation in my breast which made me doubly watchful Providence was intervening in our favor and I was not surprised to see him presently reissue with the nurse whom he drew into the shadow of the trees where they had a short conference If she returned alone into the tent after this conference I should know that the matter was at an end and that the doctor had decided to maintain his authority against that of the magistrate But she remained outside and the magistrate was invited to join their council when they again left the shadow of the trees it was to approach the tent The magistrate who was in the rear could not have more than passed the opening but I thought him far enough inside not to detect any movement on my part so I took advantage of the situation to worm myself out of my corner and across the ledge to where the tent made a shadow in the moonlight Crouching close and laying my ear against the canvas I listened The nurse was speaking in a gently persuasive tone I imagined her kneeling by the head of the patient and breathing words into his ear These were what I heard You love diamonds I have often noticed that you look so long at the ring on your hand That is why I have let it stay there though at times I have feared it would drop off and roll away over the adobe down the mountain side Was I right Yes yes The words came with difficulty but they were clear enough It s of small value I like it because He appeared to be too weak to finish A pause during which she seemed to edge nearer to him We all have some pet keepsake said she But I should never have supposed this stone of yours an inexpensive one But I forget that you are the owner of a very large and remarkable diamond a diamond that is spoken of sometimes in the papers Of course if you have a gem like that this one must appear very small and valueless to you Yes this is nothing nothing And he appeared to turn away his head mister Fairbrother Pardon me but I want to tell you something about that big diamond of yours You have been in and have not been able to read your letters so do not know that your wife has had some trouble with that diamond People have said that it is not a real stone but a well executed imitation May I write to her that this is a mistake that it is all you have ever claimed for it that is an unusually large diamond of the first water I listened in amazement Surely this was an insidious way to get at the truth a woman s way but who would say it was not a wise one the wisest perhaps which could be taken under the circumstances What would his reply be Would it show that he was as ignorant of his wife s death as was generally believed both by those about him here and those who knew him well in New York Or would the question convey nothing further to him than the doubt in itself an insult of the genuineness of that great stone which had been his pride A murmur that was all it could be called broke from his fever dried lips and died away in an inarticulate gasp Then suddenly sharply a cry broke from him an intelligible cry and we heard him say No imitation no imitation It was a sun a glory No other like it It lit the air it blazed it burned I see it now I see There the passion succumbed the strength failed another murmur another and the great void of night which stretched over I might almost say under us was no more quiet or seemingly impenetrable than the silence of that moon enveloped tent Would he speak again I did not think so Would she even try to make him I did not think this either But I did not know the woman Softly her voice rose again There was a dominating insistence in her tones gentle as they were the insistence of a healthy mind which seeks to control a weakened one You do not know of any imitation then It was the real stone you gave her You are sure of it you would be ready to swear to it if say just yes or no she finished in gentle urgency Evidently he was sinking again into unconsciousness and she was just holding him back long enough for the necessary word It came slowly and with a dragging intonation but there was no mistaking the ring of truth with which he spoke Yes said he When I heard the doctor s voice and felt a movement in the canvas against which I leaned I took the warning and stole back hurriedly to my quarters I was scarcely settled when the same group of three I had before watched silhouetted itself again against the moonlight There was some talk a mingling and separating of shadows then the nurse glided back to her duties and the two men went toward the clump of trees where the horse had been tethered Ten minutes and the doctor was back in his bunk Was it imagination or did I feel his hand on my shoulder before he finally lay down and composed himself to sleep I can not say I only know that I gave no sign and that soon all stir ceased in his direction and I was left to enjoy my triumph and to listen with anxious interest to the strange and unintelligible sounds which accompanied the descent of the horseman down the face of the cliff and finally to watch with a fascination which drew me to my knees the passage of that sparkling star of light hanging from his saddle It crept to and fro across the side of the opposite mountain as he threaded its endless zigzags and finally disappeared over the brow into the invisible canyons beyond With the disappearance of this beacon came lassitude and sleep through whose hazy atmosphere floated wild sentences from the sick tent which showed that the patient was back again in Nevada quarreling over the price of a horse which was to carry him beyond the reach of some threatening avalanche When next morning I came to depart the doctor took me by both hands and looked me straight in the eyes You heard he said How do you know I asked I can tell a satisfied man when I see him he growled throwing down my hands with that same humorous twinkle in his eyes which had encouraged me from the first I made no answer but I shall remember the lesson One detail more When I stared on my own descent I found why the leggings with which I had been provided were so indispensable I was not allowed to ride indeed riding down those steep declivities was impossible No horse could preserve his balance with a rider on his back I slid so did my horse and only in the valley beneath did we come together again VIII ARREST The success of this interview provoked other attempts on the part of the reporters who now flocked into the Southwest Ere long particulars began to pour in of mister Fairbrother s painful journey south after his illness set in The clerk of the hotel in El Moro where the great mine owner s name was found registered at the time of the murder told a story which made very good reading for those who were more interested in the sufferings 
3928-153300-0000	train-other-500	and experiences of the millionaire husband of the murdered lady than in those of the unhappy but comparatively insignificant man upon whom public opinion had cast the odium of her death
3928-153300-0001	train-other-500	It seems that when the first news came of the great crime which had taken place in New York mister Fairbrother was absent from the hotel on a prospecting tour through the adjacent mountains
3928-153300-0002	train-other-500	Couriers had been sent after him and it was one of these who finally brought him into town He had been found wandering alone on horseback among the defiles of an untraveled region sick and almost incoherent from fever Indeed
3928-153300-0003	train-other-500	his condition was such that neither the courier nor such others as saw him had the heart to tell him the dreadful news from New York or even to show him the papers To their great relief he betrayed no curiosity in them
none	none	 All he wanted was a berth in the first train going south 
3928-153300-0004	train-other-500	and this was an easy way for them out of a great responsibility They listened to his wishes and saw him safely aboard
none	none	 with such alacrity and with so many precautions against his being disturbed that they have never doubted that he left El Moro in total ignorance 
3928-153300-0005	train-other-500	not only of the circumstances of his great bereavement but of the bereavement itself
none	none	 This ignorance which he appeared to have carried with him to the Placide 
3928-153300-0006	train-other-500	was regarded by those who knew him best as proving the truth of the affirmation elicited from him in the pauses of his delirium
3928-153300-0007	train-other-500	of the genuineness of the stone which had passed from his hands to those of his wife at the time of their separation and further despatches coming in some private and some official
none	none	 but all insisting upon the fact that it would be weeks before he would be in a condition to submit to any sort of examination 
3928-153300-0008	train-other-500	on a subject so painful the authorities in New York decided to wait no longer for his testimony but to proceed at once with the inquest Great as is the temptation to give a detailed account of proceedings
none	none	 which were of such moment to myself and to every word of which I listened with the eagerness of a novice and the anguish of a woman who sees her lover s reputation 
3928-153300-0009	train-other-500	at the mercy of a verdict which may stigmatize him as a possible criminal I see no reason for encumbering my narrative with what
none	none	 for the most part would be a mere repetition of facts already known to you 
3928-153300-0010	train-other-500	mister Durand s intimate and suggestive connection with this crime the explanations he had to give of this connection frequently bizarre and I must acknowledge not always convincing
3928-153300-0011	train-other-500	nothing could alter these nor change the fact of the undoubted cowardice
none	none	 he displayed in hiding missus Fairbrother s gloves in my unfortunate little bag As for the mystery of the warning it remained as much of a mystery as ever 
3928-153300-0012	train-other-500	Nor did any better success follow an attempt to fix the ownership of the stiletto
none	none	 though a half day was exhausted in an endeavor 
3928-153300-0013	train-other-500	to show that the latter might have come into mister Durand s possession in some of the many visits he was shown to have made of late to various curio shops in and out of New York City
none	none	 I had expected all this just as I had expected mister Grey to be absent from the proceedings 
3928-153300-0014	train-other-500	and his testimony ignored But this expectation did not make the ordeal any easier and when I noticed the effect of witness after witness leaving the stand without having improved mister Durand s position by a jot
none	none	 or offering any new clue capable of turning suspicion into other directions 
3928-153300-0015	train-other-500	I felt my spirit harden and my purpose strengthen till I hardly knew myself I must have frightened my uncle for his hand was always on my arm and his chiding voice in my ear bidding me beware
none	none	 not only for my own sake and his but for that of mister Durand 
3928-153300-0016	train-other-500	whose eye was seldom away from my face The verdict however was not the one I had so deeply dreaded While it did not exonerate mister Durand it did not openly accuse him
3928-153300-0017	train-other-500	and I was on the point of giving him a smile of congratulation and renewed hope
none	none	 when I saw my little detective the one who had spied the gloves in my bag at the ball advance and place his hand upon his arm The police had gone a step further than the coroner s jury and mister Durand was arrested before my eyes on a charge of murder mister Durand s visits to the curio shops as explained by him were made with a view of finding a casket in which to place his diamond This explanation was looked upon with as much doubt as the others he had offered where the situation seemed to be of a compromising character IX THE MOUSE NIBBLES AT THE NET The next day saw me at police headquarters begging an interview from the inspector with the intention of confiding to him a theory which must either cost me his sympathy or open the way to a new inquiry which I felt sure would lead to mister Durand s complete exoneration 
3928-153301-0000	train-other-500	I chose this gentleman for my confidant from among all those with whom I had been brought in contact by my position as witness in a case of this magnitude first because he had been present at the most tragic moment of my life
none	none	 and secondly because I was conscious of a sympathetic bond between us which would insure me a kind hearing However ridiculous my idea might appear to him I was assured that he would treat me with consideration 
3928-153301-0001	train-other-500	and not visit whatever folly I might be guilty of on the head of him for whom I risked my reputation for good sense Nor was I disappointed in this
none	none	 Inspector Dalzell s air was fatherly 
3928-153301-0002	train-other-500	and his tone altogether gentle as in reply to my excuses for troubling him with my opinions he told me that in a case of such importance
none	none	 he was glad to receive the impressions even of such a prejudiced 
3928-153301-0003	train-other-500	little partizan as myself The word fired me and I spoke You consider mister Durand guilty and so do many others I fear in spite of his long record for honesty and uprightness And why
3928-153301-0004	train-other-500	Because you will not admit the possibility of another person s guilt a person standing so high in private and public estimation that the very idea seems preposterous and little short of insulting to the country
none	none	 of which he is an acknowledged ornament My dear The inspector had actually risen His expression and whole attitude showed shock 
3928-153301-0005	train-other-500	But I did not quail I only subdued my manner and spoke with quieter conviction
none	none	 I am aware said I how words so daring must impress you But listen sir listen to what I have to say before you utterly condemn me 
3928-153301-0006	train-other-500	I acknowledge that it is the frightful position into which I threw mister Durand by my officious attempt to right him which has driven me to make this second effort to fix the crime on the only
3928-153301-0007	train-other-500	other man who had possible access to missus Fairbrother at the fatal moment How could I live in inaction How could you expect me to weigh for a moment this foreigner s reputation against that of my own lover
3928-153301-0008	train-other-500	If I have reasons Reasons reasons which would appeal to all if instead
none	none	 of this person s having an international reputation at his back he had been a simple gentleman like mister Durand would you not consider me entitled to speak Certainly but You have no confidence in my reasons Inspector they may not weigh against that splash of blood on mister Durand s shirt front 
3928-153301-0009	train-other-500	but such as they are I must give them But first it will be necessary for you to accept for the nonce mister Durand s statements as true Are you willing to do this I will try Then
none	none	 a harder thing yet 
3928-153301-0010	train-other-500	to put some confidence in my judgment I saw the man and did not like him long before any intimation of the evening s tragedy had turned suspicion on any one I watched him as I watched others
3928-153301-0011	train-other-500	I saw that he had not come to the ball to please mister Ramsdell
none	none	 or for any pleasure he himself hoped to reap from social intercourse 
3928-153301-0012	train-other-500	but for some purpose much more important and that this purpose was connected with missus Fairbrother s diamond Indifferent almost morose before she came upon the scene he brightened to a surprising extent
3928-153301-0013	train-other-500	the moment he found himself in her presence Not because she was a beautiful woman
none	none	 for he scarcely honored her face or even her superb figure with a look All his glances were centered on her large fan which in swaying to and fro alternately hid and revealed the splendor on her breast and when by chance it hung suspended for a moment in her forgetful hand and he caught a full glimpse of the great gem 
3928-153301-0014	train-other-500	I perceived such a change in his face that if nothing more had occurred that night to give prominence to this woman and her diamond I should have carried home the conviction that interests of no common import lay behind a feeling so extraordinarily displayed
none	none	 Fanciful my dear Miss Van Arsdale I Interesting but fanciful I know I have not yet touched on fact But facts are coming Inspector He stared Evidently he was not accustomed to hear the law laid down in this fashion by a midget of my proportions Go on said he 
3928-153301-0015	train-other-500	happily I have no clerk here to listen I would not speak if you had
none	none	 These are words for but one ear as yet 
3928-153301-0016	train-other-500	Not even my uncle suspects the direction of my thoughts Proceed he again enjoined Upon which I plunged into my subject missus Fairbrother wore the real diamond and no imitation to the ball
3928-153301-0017	train-other-500	Of this I feel sure The bit of glass or paste displayed to the coroner s jury was bright enough but it was not the star of light I saw burning on her breast as she passed me on her way to the alcove
3928-153301-0018	train-other-500	Miss Van Arsdale The interest which mister Durand displayed in it the marked excitement into which he was thrown by his first view of its size and splendor
none	none	 confirm in my mind the evidence which he gave on oath and he is a well known diamond expert you know and must have been very well aware that he would injure rather than help his cause by this admission 
3928-153301-0019	train-other-500	that at that time he believed the stone to be real and of immense value Wearing such a gem then she entered the fatal alcove and with a smile on her face prepared to employ her fascinations
none	none	 on whoever chanced to come within their reach 
3928-153301-0020	train-other-500	But now something happened Please let me tell it my own way A shout from the driveway or a bit of snow thrown against the window drew her attention to a man standing below
none	none	 holding up a note fastened to the end of a whip handle I do not know whether or not you have found that man If you have The inspector made no sign 
3928-153301-0021	train-other-500	I judge that you have not so I may go on with my suppositions missus Fairbrother took in this note She may have expected it and for this reason chose the alcove to sit in
none	none	 or it may have been a surprise to her 
3928-153301-0022	train-other-500	Probably we shall never know the whole truth about it but what we can know and do if you are still holding to our compact and viewing this crime in the light of mister Durand s explanations is that it made a change in her
3928-153301-0023	train-other-500	and made her anxious to rid herself of the diamond It has been decided that the hurried scrawl should read Take warning He means to be at the ball Expect trouble if you do not give him the diamond or something to that effect
none	none	 But why was it passed up to her unfinished Was the haste too great I hardly think so I believe in another explanation which points with startling directness to the possibility that the person referred to in this broken communication 
3928-153301-0024	train-other-500	was not mister Durand but one whom I need not name and that the reason you have failed to find the messenger of whose appearance you have received definite information
none	none	 is that you have not looked among the servants of a certain distinguished visitor in town Oh I burst forth with feverish volubility as I saw the inspector s lips open in what could not fail to be a sarcastic utterance I know what you feel tempted to reply Why should a servant deliver a warning against his own master 
3928-153301-0025	train-other-500	If you will be patient with me you will soon see but first I wish to make it clear that missus Fairbrother having received this warning
none	none	 just before mister Durand appeared in the alcove 
3928-153301-0026	train-other-500	reckless scheming woman that she was sought to rid herself of the object against which it was directed in the way we have temporarily accepted as true
none	none	 Relying on her arts and possibly misconceiving the nature of mister Durand s interest in her she hands over the diamond hidden in her rolled up gloves which he without suspicion carries away with him 
3928-153301-0027	train-other-500	thus linking himself indissolubly to a great crime of which another was the perpetrator That other or so I believe from my very heart of hearts was the man I saw leaning against the wall at the foot of the alcove
3928-153301-0028	train-other-500	a few minutes before I passed into the supper room I stopped with a gasp hardly able to meet the stern and forbidding look with which the inspector sought to restrain what he evidently considered the senseless ravings of a child
none	none	 But I had come there to speak 
3928-153301-0029	train-other-500	and I hastily proceeded before the rebuke thus expressed could formulate itself into words I have some excuse for a declaration so monstrous
none	none	 Perhaps I am the only person who can satisfy you in regard to a certain fact 
3928-153301-0030	train-other-500	about which you have expressed some curiosity Inspector have you ever solved the mystery of the two broken coffee cups found amongst the debris at missus Fairbrother s feet It did not come out in the inquest I noticed
none	none	 Not yet 
3928-153301-0031	train-other-500	he cried but you can not tell me anything about them Possibly not But I can tell you this
none	none	 When I reached the supper room door that evening 
3928-153301-0032	train-other-500	I looked back and providentially or otherwise only the future can determine that detected mister Grey in the act of lifting two cups from a tray left by some waiter on a table standing just outside the reception room door
3928-153301-0033	train-other-500	I did not see where he carried them I only saw his face turned toward the alcove
none	none	 and as there was no other lady there 
3928-153301-0034	train-other-500	or anywhere near there I have dared to think Here the inspector found speech
none	none	 You saw mister Grey lift two cups and turn toward the alcove at a moment we all know to have been critical You should have told me this before He may be a possible witness I scarcely listened I was too full of my own argument There were other people in the hall especially at my end of it A perfect throng was coming from the billiard room where the dancing had been and it might easily be that he could both enter and leave that secluded spot without attracting attention He had shown too early 
3928-153301-0035	train-other-500	and much too unmistakably his lack of interest in the general company for his every movement to be watched as at his first arrival But this is simple conjecture
none	none	 what I have to say next is evidence The stiletto have you studied it sir 
3928-153301-0036	train-other-500	I have from the pictures It is very quaint and among the devices on the handle is one that especially attracted my attention See This is what I mean
none	none	 And I handed him a drawing which I had made with some care in expectation of this very interview He surveyed it with some astonishment I understand I pursued in trembling tones for I was much affected by my own daring that no one has 
3928-153301-0037	train-other-500	so far succeeded in tracing this weapon to its owner Why didn t your experts study heraldry and the devices of great houses
none	none	 They would have found that this one is not unknown in England I can tell you on whose blazon it can often be seen and so could mister Grey X I ASTONISH THE INSPECTOR I was not the only one to tremble now This man of infinite experience and daily contact with crime had turned as pale as ever I myself had done in face of a threatening calamity 
3928-153302-0000	train-other-500	I shall see about this he muttered crumpling the paper in his hand But this is a very terrible business you are plunging me into I sincerely hope that you are not heedlessly misleading me
none	none	 I am correct in my facts if that is what you mean said I The stiletto is an English heirloom and bears on its blade among other devices that of mister Grey s family on the female side But that is not all I want to say If the blow was struck to obtain the diamond the shock of not finding it on his victim must have been terrible Now mister Grey s heart if my whole theory is not utterly false was set upon obtaining this stone 
3928-153302-0001	train-other-500	Your eye was not on him as mine was when you made your appearance in the hall with the recovered jewel He showed astonishment eagerness
none	none	 and a determination which finally led him forward as you know 
3928-153302-0002	train-other-500	with the request to take the diamond in his hand
none	none	 Why did he want to take it in his hand And why having taken it did he drop it a diamond supposed to be worth an ordinary man s fortune Because he was startled by a cry he chose to consider the traditional one of his family proclaiming death 
3928-153302-0003	train-other-500	Is it likely sir Is it conceivable even that any such cry as we heard could in this day and generation
none	none	 ring through such an assemblage 
3928-153302-0004	train-other-500	unless it came with ventriloquial power from his own lips You observed that he turned his back that his face was hidden from us Discreet and reticent
none	none	 as we have all been and careful in our criticisms of so bizarre an event there still must be many to question the reality of such superstitious fears and some to ask if such a sound could be without human agency and a very guilty agency too Inspector I am but a child in your estimation and I feel my position in this matter much more keenly than you do but I would not be true to the man whom I have unwittingly helped to place in his present unenviable position if I did not tell you that in my judgment this cry was a spurious one employed by the gentleman himself as an excuse for dropping the stone And why should he wish to drop the stone Because of the fraud he meditated Because it offered him an opportunity for substituting a false stone for the real Did you not notice a change in the aspect of this jewel dating from this very moment Did it shine with as much brilliancy in your hand when you received it back as when you passed it over Nonsense I do not know it is all too absurd for argument 
3928-153302-0005	train-other-500	Yet he did stop to argue saying in the next breath You forget that the stone has a setting Would you claim that this gentleman of family place and political distinction had planned this hideous crime with sufficient premeditation
none	none	 to have provided himself with the exact counterpart of a brooch which it is highly improbable he ever saw 
3928-153302-0006	train-other-500	You would make him out a Cagliostro or something worse Miss Van Arsdale I fear your theory will topple over of its own weight He was very patient with me he did not show me the door Yet such a substitution took place
3928-153302-0007	train-other-500	and took place that evening I insisted
none	none	 The bit of paste shown us at the inquest was never the gem missus Fairbrother wore on entering the alcove Besides where all is sensation why cavil at one more improbability mister Grey may have come over to America for no other reason He is known as a collector and when a man has a passion for diamond getting He is known as a collector In his own country I was not told that Nor I But I found it out How my dear child how By a cablegram or so You cabled his 
3928-153302-0008	train-other-500	name to England No Inspector uncle has a code and I made use of it to ask a friend in London for a list of the most noted diamond fanciers in the country mister Grey s name was third on the list
none	none	 He gave me a look in which admiration was strangely blended with doubt and apprehension You are making a brave struggle said he but it is a hopeless one I have one more confidence to repose in you The nurse who has charge of Miss Grey was in my class in the hospital 
3928-153302-0009	train-other-500	We love each other and to her I dared appeal on one point Inspector here my voice unconsciously fell as he impetuously drew nearer a note was sent from that sick chamber on the night of the ball a note surreptitiously written by Miss Grey
3928-153302-0010	train-other-500	while the nurse was in an adjoining room The messenger was mister Grey s valet and its destination the house in which her father was enjoying his position as chief guest She says that it was meant for him but I have dared to think
3928-153302-0011	train-other-500	that the valet would tell a different story My friend did not see what her patient wrote but she acknowledged that if her patient wrote more than two words the result must have been an unintelligible scrawl since she was too weak to hold a pencil firmly
none	none	 and so nearly blind that she would have had to feel her way over the paper The inspector started and rising hastily went to his desk from which he presently brought the scrap of paper 
3928-153302-0012	train-other-500	which had already figured in the inquest as the mysterious communication taken from missus Fairbrother s hand by the coroner
none	none	 Pressing it out flat he took another look at it then glanced up in visible discomposure It has always looked to us as if written in the dark by an agitated hand but I said nothing the broken and unfinished scrawl was sufficiently eloquent Did your friend declare Miss Grey to have written with a pencil and on a small piece of unruled paper 
3928-153302-0013	train-other-500	Yes the pencil was at her bedside the paper was torn from a book which lay there She did not put the note when written in an envelope but gave it to the valet just as it was He is an old man and had come to her room for some final orders
3928-153302-0014	train-other-500	The nurse saw all this Has she that book No it went out next morning with the scraps It was some pamphlet I believe
none	none	 The inspector turned the morsel of paper over and over in his hand 
3928-153302-0015	train-other-500	What is this nurse s name Henrietta Pierson Does she share your doubts
none	none	 I can not say You have seen her often 
3928-153302-0016	train-other-500	No only the one time Is she discreet Very On this subject she will be like the grave unless forced by you to speak And Miss Grey She is still ill
3928-153302-0017	train-other-500	too ill to be disturbed by questions especially on so delicate a topic
none	none	 But she is getting well fast Her father s fears as we heard them expressed on one memorable occasion were ill founded sir Slowly the inspector inserted this scrap of paper between the folds of his pocketbook He did not give me another look though I stood trembling before him Was he in any way convinced or was he simply seeking for the most considerate way in which to dismiss me 
3928-153302-0018	train-other-500	and my abominable theory I could not gather his intentions from his expression and was feeling very faint
none	none	 and heart sick when he suddenly turned upon me with the remark 
3928-153302-0019	train-other-500	A girl as ill as you say Miss Grey was must have had some very pressing matter on her mind to attempt to write and send a message under such difficulties
none	none	 According to your idea she had some notion of her father s designs and wished to warn missus Fairbrother against them But don t you see that such conduct as this would be preposterous nay unparalleled in persons of their distinction You must find some other explanation for Miss Grey s seemingly mysterious action 
3928-153302-0020	train-other-500	and I an agent of crime other than one of England s most reputable statesmen So that mister Durand is shown the same consideration I am content said I It is the truth and the truth only I desire
3928-153302-0021	train-other-500	I am willing to trust my cause with you He looked none too grateful for this confidence Indeed now that I look back on this scene I do not wonder that he shrank from the responsibility thus foisted upon him
none	none	 What do you want me to do he asked Prove something Prove that I am altogether wrong or altogether right 
3928-153302-0022	train-other-500	Or if proof is not possible pray allow me the privilege of doing what I can myself to clear up the matter You There was apprehension disapprobation almost menace in his tone I bore it
3928-153302-0023	train-other-500	with as steady and modest a glance as possible saying when I thought he was about to speak again I will do nothing without your sanction I realize the dangers of this inquiry and the disgrace that would follow if our attempt was suspected before proof reached a point sufficient
none	none	 to justify it It is not an open attack I meditate but one Here I whispered in his ear for several minutes when I had finished he gave me a prolonged stare then he laid his hand on my head You are a little wonder he declared But your ideas are very quixotic 
3928-153302-0024	train-other-500	very However he added suddenly growing grave something I must admit may be excused a young girl who finds herself forced to choose between the guilt of her lover and that of a man esteemed great by the world
none	none	 but altogether removed from her and her natural sympathies You acknowledge then that it lies between these two I see no third said he I drew a breath of relief Don t deceive yourself Miss Van Arsdale it is not among the possibilities that mister Grey has had any connection with this crime He is an eccentric man that s all But but I shall do my duty I shall satisfy you and myself on certain points and if I hardly breathed there is the least doubt I will see you again and The change he saw in me frightened away the end of his sentence 
3928-153302-0025	train-other-500	Turning upon me with some severity he declared There are nine hundred and ninety nine chances in a thousand that my next word to you will be to prepare yourself for mister Durand s arraignment and trial But an infinitesimal chance remains to the contrary
none	none	 If you choose to trust to it I can only admire your pluck and the great confidence you show in your unfortunate lover And with this half hearted encouragement I was forced to be content not only for that day but for many days when XI THE INSPECTOR ASTONISHES ME But before I proceed to relate what happened at the end of those two weeks I must say a word or two in regard to what happened during them Nothing happened to improve mister Durand s position and nothing openly to compromise mister Grey s mister Fairbrother from whose testimony many of us hoped something would yet be gleaned calculated to give a turn to the suspicion now centered on one man continued ill in New Mexico and all that could be learned from him of any importance was contained in a short letter dictated from his bed in which he affirmed that the diamond when it left him was in a unique setting procured by himself in France that he knew of no other jewel similarly mounted and that if the false gem was set according to his own description the probabilities were that the imitation stone had been put in place of the real one under his wife s direction and in some workshop in New York as she was not the woman to take the trouble to send abroad for anything she could get done in this country The description followed It coincided with the one we all knew This was something of a blow to me Public opinion would naturally reflect that of the husband and it would require very strong evidence indeed to combat a logical supposition of this kind with one so forced and seemingly extravagant as that upon which my own theory was based Yet truth often transcends imagination and having confidence in the inspector s integrity I subdued my impatience for a week almost for two when my suspense and rapidly culminating dread of some action being taken against mister Durand were suddenly cut short by a message from the inspector followed by his speedy presence in my uncle s house We have a little room on our parlor floor very snug and secluded and in this room I received him Seldom have I dreaded a meeting more and seldom have I been met with greater kindness and consideration He was so kind that I feared he had only disappointing news to communicate but his first words reassured me He said I have come to you on a matter of importance We have found enough truth in the suppositions you advanced at our last interview to warrant us in the attempt you yourself proposed for the elucidation of this mystery That this is the most risky and altogether the most unpleasant duty which I have encountered during my several years of service I am willing to acknowledge to one so sensible and at the same time of so much modesty as yourself This English gentleman has a reputation which lifts him far above any unworthy suspicion and were it not for the favorable impression made upon us by mister Durand in a long talk we had with him last night I would sooner resign my place than pursue this matter against him Success would create a horror on both sides the water unprecedented during my career while failure would bring down ridicule on us which would destroy the prestige of the whole force Do you see my difficulty Miss Van Arsdale We can not even approach this haughty and highly reputable Englishman with questions without calling down on us the wrath of the whole English nation We must be sure before we make a move and for us to be sure where the evidence is all circumstantial I know of no better plan than the one you were pleased to suggest which at the time I was pleased to call quixotic Drawing a long breath I surveyed him timidly Never had I so realized my presumption or experienced such a thrill of joy in my frightened yet elated heart They believed in Anson s innocence and they trusted me Insignificant as I was it was to my exertions this great result was due As I realized this I felt my heart swell and my throat close In despair of speaking I held out my hands He took them kindly and seemed to be quite satisfied Such a little trembling tear filled Amazon he cried Shall you have courage to undertake the task before you If not Oh but I have said I It is your goodness and the surprise of it all which unnerves me I can go through what we have planned if you think the secret of my personality and interest in mister Durand can be kept from the people I go among It can if you will follow our advice implicitly You say that you know the doctor and that he stands ready to recommend you in case Miss Pierson withdraws her services Yes he is eager to give me a chance He was a college mate of my father s How will you explain to him your wish to enter upon your duties under another name Very simply I have already told him that the publicity given my name in the late proceedings has made me very uncomfortable that my first case of nursing would require all my self possession and that if he did not think it wrong I should like to go to it under my mother s name He made no dissent and I think I can persuade him that I would do much better work as Miss Ayers than as the too well known Miss Van Arsdale You have great powers of persuasion But may you not meet people at the hotel who know you I shall try to avoid people and if my identity is discovered its effect or non effect upon one we find it difficult to mention will give us our clue If he has no guilty interest in the crime my connection with it as a witness will not disturb him Besides two days of unsuspicious acceptance of me as Miss Grey s nurse are all I want I shall take immediate opportunity I assure you to make the test I mentioned But how much confidence you will have to repose in me I comprehend all the importance of my undertaking and shall work as if my honor as well as yours were at stake I am sure you will Then for the first time in my life I was glad that I was small and plain rather than tall and fascinating like so many of my friends for he said If you had been a triumphant beauty depending on your charms as a woman to win people to your will we should never have listened to your proposition or risked our reputation in your hands It is your wit your earnestness and your quiet determination which have impressed us You see I speak plainly I do so because I respect you And now to business Details followed After these were well understood between us I ventured to say Do you object would it be asking too much if I requested some enlightenment as to what facts you have discovered about mister Grey which go to substantiate my theory I might work more intelligently No Miss Van Arsdale you would not work more intelligently and you know it But you have the natural curiosity of one whose very heart is bound up in this business I could deny you what you ask but I won t for I want you to work with quiet confidence which you would not do if your mind were taken up with doubts and questions Miss Van Arsdale one surmise of yours was correct A man was sent that night to the Ramsdell house with a note from Miss Grey We know this because he boasted of it to one of the bell boys before he went out saying that he was going to have a glimpse of one of the swellest parties of the season It is also true that this man was mister Grey s valet an old servant who came over with him from England But what adds weight to all this and makes us regard the whole affair with suspicion is the additional fact that this man received his dismissal the following morning and has not been seen since by any one we could reach This looks bad to begin with like the suppression of evidence you know Then mister Grey has not been the same man since that night He is full of care and this care is not entirely in connection with his daughter who is doing very well and bids fair to be up in a few days But all this would be nothing if we had not received advices from England which prove that mister Grey s visit here has an element of mystery in it There was every reason for his remaining in his own country where a political crisis is approaching yet he crossed the water bringing his sickly daughter with him The explanation as volunteered by one who knew him well was this That only his desire to see or acquire some precious object for his collection could have taken him across the ocean at this time nothing else rivaling his interest in governmental affairs Still this would be nothing if a stiletto similar to the one employed in this crime had not once formed part of a collection of curios belonging to a cousin of his whom he often visited This stiletto has been missing for some time stolen as the owner declared by some unknown person All this looks bad enough but when I tell you that a week before the fatal ball at mister Ramsdell s mister Grey made a tour of the jewelers on Broadway and with the pretext of buying a diamond for his daughter entered into a talk about famous stones ending always with some question about the Fairbrother gem you will see that his interest in that stone is established and that it only remains for us to discover if that interest is a guilty one I can not believe this possible but you have our leave to make your experiment and see Only do not count too much on his superstition If he is the deep dyed criminal you imagine the cry which startled us all at a certain critical instant was raised by himself and for the purpose you suggested None of the sensitiveness often shown by a man who has been surprised into crime will be his Relying on his reputation and the prestige of his great name he will if he thinks himself under fire face every shock unmoved I see I understand He must believe himself all alone then the natural man may appear I thank you Inspector That idea is of inestimable value to me and I shall act on it I do not say immediately not on the first day and possibly not on the second but as soon as opportunity offers for my doing what I have planned with any chance of success And now advise me how to circumvent my uncle and aunt who must never know to what an undertaking I have committed myself Inspector Dalzell spared me another fifteen minutes and this last detail was arranged Then he rose to go As he turned from me he said To morrow And I answered with a full heart but a voice clear as my purpose To morrow XII ALMOST This is your patient Your new nurse my dear What did you say your name is Miss Ayers Yes mister Grey Alice Ayers Oh what a sweet name This expressive greeting from the patient herself was the first heart sting I received a sting which brought a flush into my cheek which I would fain have kept down Since a change of nurses was necessary I am glad they sent me one like you the feeble but musical voice went on and I saw a wasted but eager hand stretched out In a whirl of strong feeling I advanced to take it I had not counted on such a reception I had not expected any bond of congeniality to spring up between this high feeling English girl and myself to make my purpose hateful to me Yet as I stood there looking down at her bright if wasted face I felt that it would be very easy to love so gentle and cordial a being and dreaded raising my eyes to the gentleman at my side lest I should see something in him to hamper me and make this attempt which I had undertaken in such loyalty of spirit a misery to myself and ineffectual to the man I had hoped to save by it When I did look up and catch the first beams of mister Grey s keen blue eyes fixed inquiringly on me I neither knew what to think nor how to act He was tall and firmly knit and had an intellectual aspect altogether I was conscious of regarding him with a decided feeling of awe and found myself forgetting why I had come there and what my suspicions were suspicions which had carried hope with them hope for myself and hope for my lover who would never escape the opprobrium even if he did the punishment of this great crime were this the only other person who could possibly be associated with it found to be the fine clear souled man he appeared to be in this my first interview with him Perceiving very soon that his apprehensions in my regard were limited to a fear lest I should not feel at ease in my new home under the restraint of a presence more accustomed to intimidate than attract strangers I threw aside all doubts of myself and met the advances of both father and daughter with that quiet confidence which my position there demanded The result both gratified and grieved me As a nurse entering on her first case I was happy as a woman with an ulterior object in view verging on the audacious and unspeakable I was wretched and regretful and just a little shaken in the conviction which had hitherto upheld me I was therefore but poorly prepared to meet the ordeal which awaited me when a little later in the day mister Grey called me into the adjoining room and after saying that it would afford him great relief to go out for an hour or so asked if I were afraid to be left alone with my patient O no sir I began but stopped in secret dismay I was afraid but not on account of her condition rather on account of my own What if I should be led into betraying my feelings on finding myself under no other eye than her own What if the temptation to probe her poor sick mind should prove stronger than my duty toward her as a nurse My tones were hesitating but mister Grey paid little heed his mind was too fixed on what he wished to say himself Before I go said he I have a request to make I may as well say a caution to give you Do not I pray either now or at any future time carry or allow any one else to carry newspapers into Miss Grey s room They are just now too alarming There has been as you know a dreadful murder in this city If she caught one glimpse of the headlines or saw so much as the name of Fairbrother which which is a name she knows the result might be very hurtful to her She is not only extremely sensitive from illness but from temperament Will you be careful I shall be careful It was such an effort for me to say these words to say anything in the state of mind into which I had been thrown by his unexpected allusion to this subject that I unfortunately drew his attention to myself and it was with what I felt to be a glance of doubt that he added with decided emphasis You must consider this whole subject as a forbidden one in this family Only cheerful topics are suitable for the sick room If Miss Grey attempts to introduce any other stop her Do not let her talk about anything which will not be conducive to her speedy recovery These are the only instructions I have to give you all others must come from her physician I made some reply with as little show of emotion as possible It seemed to satisfy him for his face cleared as he kindly observed You have a very trustworthy look for one so young I shall rest easy while you are with her and I shall expect you to be always with her when I am not Every moment mind She is never to be left alone with gossiping servants If a word is mentioned in her hearing about this crime which seems to be in everybody s mouth I shall feel forced greatly as I should regret the fad to blame you This was a heart stroke but I kept up bravely changing color perhaps but not to such a marked degree as to arouse any deeper suspicion in his mind than that I had been wounded in my amour propre She shall be well guarded said I You may trust me to keep from her all avoidable knowledge of this crime He bowed and I was about to leave his presence when he detained me by remarking with the air of one who felt that some explanation was necessary I was at the ball where this crime took place Naturally it has made a deep impression on me and would on her if she heard of it Assuredly I murmured wondering if he would say more and how I should have the courage to stand there and listen if he did It is the first time I have ever come in contact with crime he went on with what in one of his reserved nature seemed a hardly natural insistence I could well have been spared the experience A tragedy with which one has been even thus remotely connected produces a lasting effect upon the mind Oh yes oh yes I murmured edging involuntarily toward the door Did I not know Had I not been there too I little I whom he stood gazing down upon from such a height little realizing the fatality which united us and what was even a more overwhelming thought to me at the moment the fact that of all persons in the world the shrinking little being into whose eyes he was then looking was perhaps his greatest enemy and the one person great or small from whom he had the most to fear But I was no enemy to his gentle daughter and the relief I felt at finding myself thus cut off by my own promise from even the remotest communication with her on this forbidden subject was genuine and sincere But the father What was I to think of the father Alas I could have but one thought admirable as he appeared in all lights save the one in which his too evident connection with this crime had placed him I spent the hours of the afternoon in alternately watching the sleeping face of my patient too sweetly calm in its repose or so it seemed for the mind beneath to harbor such doubts as were shown in the warning I had ascribed to her and vain efforts to explain by any other hypothesis than that of guilt the extraordinary evidence which linked this man of great affairs and the loftiest repute to a crime involving both theft and murder Nor did the struggle end that night It was renewed with still greater positiveness the next day as I witnessed the glances which from time to time passed between this father and daughter glances full of doubt and question on both sides but not exactly such doubt or such question as my suspicions called for Or so I thought and spent another day or two hesitating very much over my duty when coming unexpectedly upon mister Grey one evening I felt all my doubts revive in view of the extraordinary expression of dread I might with still greater truth say fear which informed his features and made them to my unaccustomed eyes almost unrecognizable He was sitting at his desk in reverie over some papers which he seemed not to have touched for hours and when at some movement I made he started up and met my eye I could swear that his cheek was pale the firm carriage of his body shaken and the whole man a victim to some strong and secret apprehension he vainly sought to hide when I ventured to tell him what I wanted he made an effort and pulled himself together but I had seen him with his mask off and his usually calm visage and self possessed mien could not again deceive me My duties kept me mainly at Miss Grey s bedside but I had been provided with a little room across the hall and to this room I retired very soon after this for rest and a necessary understanding with myself For in spite of this experience and my now settled convictions my purpose required whetting The indescribable charm the extreme refinement and nobility of manner observable in both mister Grey and his daughter were producing their effect I felt guilty constrained whatever my convictions the impetus to act was leaving me How could I recover it By thinking of Anson Durand and his present disgraceful position Anson Durand Oh how the feeling surged up in my breast as that name slipped from my lips on crossing the threshold of my little room Anson Durand whom I believed innocent whom I loved but whom I was betraying with every moment of hesitation in which I allowed myself to indulge what if the Honorable mister Grey is an eminent statesman a dignified scholarly and to all appearance high minded man what if my patient is sweet dove eyed and affectionate Had not Anson qualities as excellent in their way rights as certain and a hold upon myself superior to any claims which another might advance Drawing a much crumpled little note from my pocket I eagerly read it It was the only one I had of his writing the only letter he had ever written me I had already re read it a hundred times but as I once more repeated to myself its well known lines I felt my heart grow strong and fixed in the determination which had brought me into this family Restoring the letter to its place I opened my gripsack and from its inmost recesses drew forth an object which I had no sooner in hand than a natural sense of disquietude led me to glance apprehensively first at the door then at the window though I had locked the one and shaded the other It seemed as if some other eye besides my own must be gazing at what I held so gingerly in hand that the walls were watching me if nothing else and the sensation this produced was so exactly like that of guilt or what I imagined to be guilt that I was forced to repeat once more to myself that it was not a good man s overthrow I sought or even a bad man s immunity from punishment but the truth the absolute truth No shame could equal that which I should feel if by any over delicacy now I failed to save the man who trusted me The article which I held have you guessed it was the stiletto with which missus Fairbrother had been killed It had been intrusted to me by the police for a definite purpose The time for testing that purpose had come or so nearly come that I felt I must be thinking about the necessary ways and means Unwinding the folds of tissue paper in which the stiletto was wrapped I scrutinized the weapon very carefully Hitherto I had seen only pictures of it now I had the article itself in my hand It was not a natural one for a young woman to hold a woman whose taste ran more toward healing than inflicting wounds but I forced myself to forget why the end of its blade was rusty and looked mainly at the devices which ornamented the handle I had not been mistaken in them They belonged to the house of Grey and to none other It was a legitimate inquiry I had undertaken However the matter ended I should always have these historic devices for my excuse My plan was to lay this dagger on mister Grey s desk at a moment when he would be sure to see it and I to see him If he betrayed a guilty knowledge of this fatal steel if unconscious of my presence he showed surprise and apprehension then we should know how to proceed justice would be loosed from constraint and the police feel at liberty to approach him It was a delicate task this I realized how delicate when I had thrust the stiletto out of sight under my nurse s apron and started to cross the hall Should I find the library clear Would the opportunity be given me to approach his desk or should I have to carry this guilty witness of a world famous crime on into Miss Grey s room and with its unholy outline pressing a semblance of itself upon my breast sit at that innocent pillow meet those innocent eyes and answer the gentle inquiries which now and then fell from the sweetest lips I have ever seen smile into the face of a lonely preoccupied stranger The arrangement of the rooms was such as made it necessary for me to pass through this sitting room in order to reach my patient s bedroom With careful tread so timed as not to appear stealthy I accordingly advanced and pushed open the door The room was empty mister Grey was still with his daughter and I could cross the floor without fear But never had I entered upon a task requiring more courage or one more obnoxious to my natural instincts I hated each step I took but I loved the man for whom I took those steps and moved resolutely on Only as I reached the chair in which mister Grey was accustomed to sit I found that it was easier to plan an action than to carry it out Home life and the domestic virtues had always appealed to me more than a man s greatness The position which this man held in his own country his usefulness there even his prestige as statesman and scholar were facts but very dreamy facts to me while his feelings as a father the place he held in his daughter s heart these were real to me these I could understand and it was of these and not of his place as a man that this his favorite seat spoke to me How often had I beheld him sit by the hour with his eye on the door behind which his one darling lay ill Even now it was easy for me to recall his face as I had sometimes caught a glimpse of it through the crack of the suddenly opened door and I felt my breast heave and my hand falter as I drew forth the stiletto and moved to place it where his eye would fall upon it on his leaving his daughter s bedside But my hand returned quickly to my breast and fell hack again empty A pile of letters lay before me on the open lid of the desk The top one was addressed to me with the word Important written in the corner I did not know the writing but I felt that I should open and read this letter before committing myself or those who stood back of me to this desperate undertaking Glancing behind me and seeing that the door into Miss Grey s room was ajar I caught up this letter and rushed with it back into my own room As I surmised it was from the inspector and as I read it I realized that I had received it not one moment too soon In language purposely non committal but of a meaning not to be mistaken it advised me that some unforeseen facts had come to light which altered all former suspicions and made the little surprise I had planned no longer necessary There was no allusion to mister Durand but the final sentence ran Drop all care and give your undivided attention to your patient XIII THE MISSING RECOMMENDATION My patient slept that night but I did not The shock given by this sudden cry of Halt at the very moment I was about to make my great move the uncertainty as to what it meant and my doubt of its effect upon mister Durand s position put me on the anxious seat and kept my thoughts fully occupied till morning I was very tired and must have shown it when with the first rays of a very meager sun Miss Grey softly unclosed her eyes and found me looking at her for her smile had a sweet compassion in it and she said as she pressed my hand You must have watched me all night I never saw any one look so tired or so good she softly finished I had rather she had not uttered that last phrase It did not fit me at the moment did not fit me perhaps at any time Good I when my thoughts had not been with her but with mister Durand when the dominating feeling in my breast was not that of relief but a vague regret that I had not been allowed to make my great test and so establish to my own satisfaction at least the perfect innocence of my lover even at the cost of untold anguish to this confiding girl upon whose gentle spirit the very thought of crime would cast a deadly blight I must have flushed certainly I showed some embarrassment for her eyes brightened with shy laughter as she whispered You do not like to be praised another of your virtues You have too many I have only one I love my friends She did One could see that love was life to her For an instant I trembled How near I had been to wrecking this gentle soul Was she safe yet I was not sure My own doubts were not satisfied I awaited the papers with feverish impatience They should contain news News of what Ah that was the question You will let me see my mail this morning will you not she asked as I busied myself about her That is for the doctor to say I smiled You are certainly better this morning It is so hard for me not to be able to read his letters or to write a word to relieve his anxiety Thus she told me her heart s secret and unconsciously added another burden to my already too heavy load I was on my way to give some orders about my patient s breakfast when mister Grey came into the sitting room and met me face to face He had a newspaper in his hand and my heart stood still as I noted his altered looks and disturbed manner Were these due to anything he had found in those columns It was with difficulty that I kept my eyes from the paper which he held in such a manner as to disclose its glaring head lines These I dared not read with his eyes fixed on mine How is Miss Grey How is my daughter he asked in great haste and uneasiness Is she better this morning or worse Better I assured him and was greatly astonished to see his brow instantly clear Really he asked You really consider her better The doctors say so but I have not very much faith in doctors in a case like this he added I have seen no reason to distrust them I protested Miss Grey s illness while severe does not appear to be of an alarming nature But then I have had very little experience out of the hospital I am young yet mister Grey He looked as if he quite agreed with me in this estimate of myself and with a brow still clouded passed into his daughter s room the paper in his hand Before I joined them I found and scanned another journal Expecting great things I was both surprised and disappointed to find only a small paragraph devoted to the Fairbrother case In this it was stated that the authorities hoped for new light on this mystery as soon as they had located a certain witness whose connection with the crime they had just discovered No more no less than was contained in Inspector Dalzell s letter How could I bear it the suspense the doubt and do my duty to my patient Happily I had no choice I had been adjudged equal to this business and I must prove myself to be so Perhaps my courage would revive after I had had my breakfast perhaps then I should be able to fix upon the identity of the new witness something which I found myself incapable of at this moment These thoughts were on my mind as I crossed the rooms on my way back to Miss Grey s bedside By the time I reached her door I was outwardly calm as her first words showed Oh the cheerful smile It makes me feel better in spite of myself If she could have seen into my heart mister Grey who was leaning over the foot of the bed cast me a quick glance which was not without its suspicion Had he detected me playing a part or were such doubts as he displayed the product simply of his own uneasiness I was not able to decide and with this unanswered question added to the number already troubling me I was forced to face the day which for aught I knew might be the precursor of many others equally trying and unsatisfactory But help was near Before noon I received a message from my uncle to the effect that if I could be spared he would be glad to see me at his home as near three o clock as possible What could he want of me I could not guess and it was with great inner perturbation that having won mister Grey s permission I responded to his summons I found my uncle awaiting me in a carriage before his own door and I took my seat at his side without the least idea of his purpose I supposed that he had planned this ride that he might talk to me unreservedly and without fear of interruption But I soon saw that he had some very different object in view for not only did he start down town instead of up but his conversation such as it was confined itself to generalities and studiously avoided the one topic of supreme interest to us both At last as we turned into Bleecker Street I let my astonishment and perplexity appear Where are we bound I asked It can not be that you are taking me to see mister Durand No said he and said no more Ah Police Headquarters I faltered as the carriage made another turn and drew up before a building I had reason to remember Uncle what am I to do here See a friend he answered as he helped me to alight Then as I followed him in some bewilderment he whispered in my ear Inspector Dalzell He wants a few minutes conversation with you Oh the weight which fell from my shoulders at these words I was to hear then what had intervened between me and my purpose The wearing night I had anticipated was to be lightened with some small spark of knowledge I had confidence enough in the kind hearted inspector to be sure of that I caught at my uncle s arm and squeezed it delightedly quite oblivious of the curious glances I must have received from the various officials we passed on our way to the inspector s office We found him waiting for us and I experienced such pleasure at sight of his kind and earnest face that I hardly noticed uncle s sly retreat till the door closed behind him Oh Inspector what has happened I impetuously exclaimed in answer to his greeting Something that will help mister Durand without disturbing mister Grey have you as good news for me as that Hardly he answered moving up a chair and seating me in it with a fatherly air which under the circumstances was more discouraging than consolatory We have simply heard of a new witness or rather a fact has come to light which has turned our inquiries into a new direction And and you can not tell me what this fact is I faltered as he showed no intention of adding anything to this very unsatisfactory explanation I should not but you were willing to do so much for us I must set aside my principles a little and do something for you After all it is only forestalling the reporters by a day Miss Van Arsdale this is the story Yesterday morning a man was shown into this room and said that he had information to give which might possibly prove to have some bearing on the Fairbrother case I had seen the man before and recognized him at the first glance as one of the witnesses who made the inquest unnecessarily tedious Do you remember Jones the caterer who had only two or three facts to give and yet who used up the whole afternoon in trying to state those facts I do indeed I answered Well he was the man and I own that I was none too delighted to see him But he was more at his ease with me than I expected and I soon learned what he had to tell It was this One of his men had suddenly left him one of his very best men one of those who had been with him in the capacity of waiter at the Ramsdell ball It was not uncommon for his men to leave him but they usually gave notice This man gave no notice he simply did not show up at the usual hour This was a week or two ago Jones having a liking for the man who was an excellent waiter sent a messenger to his lodging house to see if he were ill But he had left his lodgings with as little ceremony as he had left the caterer This under ordinary circumstances would have ended the business but there being some great function in prospect Jones did not feel like losing so good a man without making an effort to recover him so he looked up his references in the hope of obtaining some clue to his present whereabouts He kept all such matters in a special book and expected to have no trouble in finding the man s name James Wellgood or that of his former employer But when he came to consult this book he was astonished to find that nothing was recorded against this man s name but the date of his first employment March fifteen Had he hired him without a recommendation He would not be likely to yet the page was clear of all reference only the name and the date But the date You have already noted its significance and later he did too The day of the Ramsdell ball The day of the great murder As he recalled the incidents of that day he understood why the record of Wellgood s name was unaccompanied by the usual reference It had been a difficult day all round The function was an important one and the weather bad There was besides an unusual shortage in his number of assistants Two men had that very morning been laid up with sickness and when this able looking self confident Wellgood presented himself for immediate employment he took him out of hand with the merest glance at what looked like a very satisfactory reference Later he had intended to look up this reference which he had been careful to preserve by sticking it along with other papers on his spike file But in the distractions following the untoward events of the evening he had neglected to do so feeling perfectly satisfied with the man s work and general behavior Now it was a different thing The man had left him summarily and he felt impelled to hunt up the person who had recommended him and see whether this was the first time that Wellgood had repaid good treatment with bad Running through the papers with which his file was now full he found that the one he sought was not there This roused him in good earnest for he was certain that he had not removed it himself and there was no one else who had the right to do so He suspected the culprit a young lad who occasionally had access to his desk But this boy was no longer in the office He had dismissed him for some petty fault the previous week and it took him several days to find him again Meantime his anger grew and when he finally came face to face with the lad he accused him of the suspected trick with so much vehemence that the inevitable happened and the boy confessed This is what he acknowledged He had taken the reference off the file but only to give it to Wellgood himself who had offered him money for it When asked how much money the boy admitted that the sum was ten dollars an extraordinary amount from a poor man for so simple a service if the man merely wished to secure his reference for future use so extraordinary that mister Jones grew more and more pertinent in his inquiries eliciting finally what he surely could not have hoped for in the beginning the exact address of the party referred to in the paper he had stolen and which for some reason the boy remembered It was an uptown address and as soon as the caterer could leave his business he took the elevated and proceeded to the specified street and number Miss Van Arsdale a surprise awaited him and awaited us when he told the result of his search The name attached to the recommendation had been Hiram Sears Steward He did not know of any such man perhaps you do but when he reached the house from which the recommendation was dated he saw that it was one of the great houses of New York though he could not at the instant remember who lived there But he soon found out The first passer by told him Miss Van Arsdale perhaps you can do the same The number was Eighty sixth Street I repeated quite aghast Why mister Fairbrother himself The husband of Exactly so and Hiram Sears whose name you may have heard mentioned at the inquest though for a very good reason he was not there in person is his steward and general factotum Oh and it was he who recommended Wellgood Yes And did mister Jones see him No The house you remember is closed mister Fairbrother on leaving town gave his servants a vacation His steward he took with him that is they started together But we hear no mention made of him in our telegrams from Santa Fe He does not seem to have followed mister Fairbrother into the mountains You say that in a peculiar way I remarked Because it has struck us peculiarly Where is Sears now And why did he not go on with mister Fairbrother when he left home with every apparent intention of accompanying him to the Placide mine Miss Van Arsdale we were impressed with this fact when we heard of mister Fairbrother s lonely trip from where he was taken ill to his mine outside of Santa Fe but we have only given it its due importance since hearing what has come to us to day Miss Van Arsdale continued the inspector as I looked up quickly I am going to show great confidence in you I am going to tell you what our men have learned about this Sears As I have said before it is but forestalling the reporters by a day and it may help you to understand why I sent you such peremptory orders to stop when your whole heart was fixed on an attempt by which you hoped to right mister Durand We can not afford to disturb so distinguished a person as the one you have under your eye while the least hope remains of fixing this crime elsewhere And we have such hope This man this Sears is by no means the simple character one would expect from his position Considering the short time we have had it was only yesterday that Jones found his way into this office we have unearthed some very interesting facts in his regard His devotion to mister Fairbrother was never any secret and we knew as much about that the day after the murder as we do now But the feelings with which he regarded missus Fairbrother well that is another thing and it was not till last night we heard that the attachment which bound him to her was of the sort which takes no account of youth or age fitness or unfitness He was no Adonis and old enough we are told to be her father but for all that we have already found several persons who can tell strange stories of the persistence with which his eager old eyes would follow her whenever chance threw them together during the time she remained under her husband s roof and others who relate with even more avidity how after her removal to apartments of her own he used to spend hours in the adjoining park just to catch a glimpse of her figure as she crossed the sidewalk on her way to and from her carriage Indeed his senseless almost senile passion for this magnificent beauty became a by word in some mouths and it only escaped being mentioned at the inquest from respect to mister Fairbrother who had never recognized this weakness in his steward and from its lack of visible connection with her horrible death and the stealing of her great jewel Nevertheless we have a witness now it is astonishing how many witnesses we can scare up by a little effort who never thought of coming forward themselves who can swear to having seen him one night shaking his fist at her retreating figure as she stepped haughtily by him into her apartment house This witness is sure that the man he saw thus gesticulating was Sears and he is sure the woman was missus Fairbrother The only thing he is not sure of is how his own wife will feel when she hears that he was in that particular neighborhood on that particular evening when he was evidently supposed to be somewhere else And the inspector laughed Is the steward s disposition a bad one I asked that this display of feeling should impress you so much I don t know what to say about that yet Opinions differ on this point His friends speak of him as the mildest kind of a man who without native executive skill could not manage the great household he has in charge His enemies and we have unearthed a few say on the contrary that they have never had any confidence in his quiet ways that these were not in keeping with the fact or his having been a California miner in the early fifties You can see I am putting you very nearly where we are ourselves Nor do I see why I should not add that this passion of the seemingly subdued but really hot headed steward for a woman who never showed him anything but what he might call an insulting indifference struck us as a clue to be worked up especially after we received this answer to a telegram we sent late last night to the nurse who is caring for mister Fairbrother in New Mexico He handed me a small yellow slip and I read The steward left mister Fairbrother at El Moro He has not heard from him since ANNETTA LA SERRA For Abner Fairbrother At El Moro I cried Why that was long enough ago For him to have reached New York before the murder Exactly so if he took advantage of every close connection XIV TRAPPED I caught my breath sharply I did not say anything I felt that I did not understand the inspector sufficiently yet to speak He seemed to be pleased with my reticence At all events his manner grew even kinder as he said This Sears is a witness we must have He is being looked for now high and low and we hope to get some clue to his whereabouts before night That is if he is in this city Meanwhile we are all glad I am sure you are also to spare so distinguished a gentleman as mister Grey the slightest annoyance And mister Durand What of him in this interim He will have to await developments I see no other way my dear It was kindly said but my head drooped This waiting was what was killing him and killing me The inspector saw and gently patted my hand Come said he you have head enough to see that it is never wise to force matters Then possibly with an intention of rousing me he remarked There is another small fact which may interest you It concerns the waiter Wellgood recommended as you will remember by this Sears In my talk with Jones it leaked out as a matter of small moment and so it was to him that this Wellgood was the waiter who ran and picked up the diamond after it fell from mister Grey s hand Ah This may mean nothing it meant nothing to Jones but I inform you of it because there is a question I want to put to you in this connection You smile Did I I meekly answered I do not know why This was not true I had been waiting to see why the inspector had so honored me with all these disclosures almost with his thoughts Now I saw He desired something in return You were on the scene at this very moment he proceeded after a brief contemplation of my face and you must have seen this man when he lifted the jewel and handed it back to mister Grey Did you remark his features No sir I was too far off besides my eyes were on mister Grey That is a pity I was in hopes you could satisfy me on a very important point What point is that Inspector Dalzell Whether he answered the following description And taking up another paper he was about to read it aloud to me when an interruption occurred A man showed himself at the door whom the inspector no sooner recognized than he seemed to forget me in his eagerness to interrogate him Perhaps the appearance of the latter had something to do with it he looked as if he had been running or had been the victim of some extraordinary adventure At all events the inspector arose as he entered and was about to question him when he remembered me and casting about for some means of ridding himself of my presence without injury to my feelings he suddenly pushed open the door of an adjoining room and requested me to step inside while he talked a moment with this man Of course I went but I cast him an appealing look as I did so It evidently had its effect for his expression changed as his band fell on the doorknob Would he snap the lock tight and so shut me out from what concerned me as much as it did any one in the whole world Or would he recognize my anxiety the necessity I was under of knowing just the ground I was standing on and let me hear what this man had to report I watched the door It closed slowly too slowly to latch Would he catch it anew by the knob No he left it thus and while the crack was hardly perceptible I felt confident that the least shake of the floor would widen it and give me the opportunity I sought But I did not have to wait for this The two men in the office I had just left began to speak and to my unbounded relief were sufficiently intelligible even now to warrant me in giving them my fullest attention After some expressions of astonishment on the part of the inspector as to the plight in which the other presented himself the latter broke out I ve just escaped death I ll tell you about that later What I want to tell you now is that the man we want is in town I saw him last night or his shadow which is the same thing It was in the house in Eighty sixth Street the house they all think closed He came in with a key and Wait You have him No It s a long story sir Tell it The tone was dry The inspector was evidently disappointed Don t blame me till you hear said the other He is no common crook This is how it was You wanted the suspect s photograph and a specimen of his writing I knew no better place to look for them than in his own room in mister Fairbrother s house I accordingly got the necessary warrant and late last evening undertook the job I went alone I was always an egotistical chap more s the pity and with no further precaution than a passing explanation to the officer I met at the corner I hastened up the block to the rear entrance on Eighty seventh Street There are three doors to the Fairbrother house as you probably know Two on Eighty sixth Street the large front one and a small one connecting directly with the turret stairs and one on Eighty seventh Street It was to the latter I had a key I do not think any one saw me go in It was raining and such people as went by were more concerned in keeping their umbrellas properly over their heads than in watching men skulking about in doorways I got in then all right and being careful to close the door behind me went up the first short flight of steps to what I knew must be the main hall I had been given a plan of the interior and I had studied it more or less before starting out but I knew that I should get lost if I did not keep to the rear staircase at the top of which I expected to find the steward s room There was a faint light in the house in spite of its closed shutters and tightly drawn shades and having a certain dread of using my torch knowing my weakness for pretty things and how hard it would be for me to pass so many fine rooms without looking in I made my way up stairs with no other guide than the hand rail When I had reached what I took to be the third floor I stopped Finding it very dark I first listened a natural instinct with us then I lit up and looked about me I was in a large hall empty as a vault and almost as desolate Blank doors met my eyes in all directions with here and there an open passageway I felt myself in a maze I had no idea which was the door I sought and it is not pleasant to turn unaccustomed knobs in a shut up house at midnight with the rain pouring in torrents and the wind making pandemonium in a half dozen great chimneys But it had to be done and I went at it in regular order till I came to a little narrow one opening on the turret stair This gave me my bearings Sears room adjoined the staircase There was no difficulty in spotting the exact door now and merely stopping to close the opening I had made to this little staircase I crossed to this door and flung it open I had been right in my calculations It was the steward s room and I made at once for the desk And you found Mostly locked drawers But a key on my bunch opened some of these and my knife the rest Here are the specimens of his handwriting which I collected I doubt if you will get much out of them I saw nothing compromising in the whole room but then I hadn t time to go through his trunks and one of them looked very interesting old as the hills and You hadn t time Why hadn t you time What happened to cut it short Well sir I ll tell you The tone in which this was said roused me if it did not the inspector I had just come from the desk which had disappointed me and was casting a look about the room which was as bare as my hand of everything like ornament I might almost say comfort when I heard a noise which was not that of swishing rain or even gusty wind these had not been absent from my ears for a moment I didn t like that noise it had a sneakish sound and I shut my light off in a hurry After that I crept hastily out of the room for I don t like a set to in a trap It was darker than ever now in the hall or so it seemed and as I backed away I came upon a jog in the wall behind which I crept For the sound I had heard was no fancy Some one besides myself was in the house and that some one was coming up the little turret stair striking matches as he approached Who could it be A detective from the district attorney s office I hardly thought so He would have been provided with something better than matches to light his way A burglar No not on the third floor of a house as rich as this Some fellow on the force then who had seen me come in and by some trick of his own had managed to follow me I would see Meantime I kept my place behind the jog and watched not knowing which way the intruder would go Whoever he was he was evidently astonished to see the turret door ajar for he lit another match as he threw it open and though I failed to get a glimpse of his figure I succeeded in getting a very good one of his shadow It was one to arouse a detective s instinct at once I did not say to myself this is the man I want but I did say this is nobody from headquarters and I steadied myself for whatever might turn up The first thing that happened was the sudden going out of the match which had made this shadow visible The intruder did not light another I heard him move across the floor with the rapid step of one who knows his way well and the next minute a gas jet flared up in the steward s room and I knew that the man the whole force was looking for had trapped himself You will agree that it was not my duty to take him then and there without seeing what he was after He was thought to be in the eastern states or south or west and he was here but why here That is what I knew you would want to know and it was just what I wanted to know myself So I kept my place which was good enough and just listened for I could not see What was his errand What did he want in this empty house at midnight Papers first and then clothes I heard him at his desk I heard him in the closet and afterward pottering in the old trunk I had been so anxious to look into myself He must have brought the key with him for it was no time before I heard him throwing out the contents in a wild search for something he wanted in a great hurry He found it sooner than you would believe and began throwing the things back when something happened Expectedly or unexpectedly his eye fell on some object which roused all his passions and he broke into loud exclamations ending in groans Finally he fell to kissing this object with a fervor suggesting rage and a rage suggesting tenderness carried to the point of agony I have never heard the like my curiosity was so aroused that I was on the point of risking everything for a look when he gave a sudden snarl and cried out loud enough for me to hear Kiss what I ve hated That is as bad as to kill what I ve loved Those were the words I am sure he said kiss and I am sure he said kill This is very interesting Go on with your story Why didn t you collar him while he was in this mood You would have won by the surprise I had no pistol sir and he had I heard him cock it I thought he was going to take his own life and held my breath for the report But nothing like that was in his mind Instead he laid the pistol down and deliberately tore in two the object of his anger Then with a smothered curse he made for the door and turret staircase I was for following but not till I had seen what he had destroyed in such an excess of feeling I thought I knew but I wanted to feel sure So before risking myself in the turret I crept to the room he had left and felt about on the floor till I came upon these A torn photograph missus Fairbrother s Yes Have you not heard how he loved her A foolish passion but evidently sincere and Never mind comments Sweetwater Stick to facts I will sir They are interesting enough After I had picked up these scraps I stole back to the turret staircase And here I made my first break I stumbled in the darkness and the man below heard me for the pistol clicked again I did not like this and had some thoughts of backing out of my job But I didn t I merely waited till I heard his step again then I followed But very warily this time It was not an agreeable venture It was like descending into a well with possible death at the bottom I could see nothing and presently could hear nothing but the almost imperceptible sliding of my own fingers down the curve of the wall which was all I had to guide me Had he stopped midway and would my first intimation of his presence be the touch of cold steel or the flinging around me of two murderous arms I had met with no break in the smooth surface of the wall so could not have reached the second story When I should get there the question would be whether to leave the staircase and seek him in the mazes of its great rooms or to keep on down to the parlor floor and so to the street whither he was possibly bound I own that I was almost tempted to turn on my light and have done with it but I remembered of how little use I should be to you lying in this well of a stairway with a bullet in me and so I managed to compose myself and go on as I had begun Next instant my fingers slipped round the edge of an opening and I knew that the moment of decision had come Realizing that no one can move so softly that he will not give away his presence in some way I paused for the sound which I knew must come and when a click rose from the depths of the hall before me I plunged into that hall and thus into the house proper Here it was not so dark yet I could make out none of the objects I now and then ran against I passed a mirror I hardly know how I knew it to be such and in that mirror I seemed to see the ghost of a ghost flit by and vanish It was too much I muttered a suppressed oath and plunged forward when I struck against a closing door It flew open again and I rushed in turning on my light in my extreme desperation when instead of hearing the sharp report of a pistol as I expected I saw a second door fall to before me this time with a sound like the snap of a spring lock Finding that this was so and that all advance was barred that way I wheeled hurriedly back toward the door by which I had entered the place to find that that had fallen to simultaneously with the other a single spring acting for both I was trapped a prisoner in the strangest sort of passageway or closet and as a speedy look about presently assured me a prisoner with very little hope of immediate escape for the doors were not only immovable without even locks to pick or panels to break in but the place was bare of windows and the only communication which it could be said to have with the outside world at all was a shaft rising from the ceiling almost to the top of the house Whether this served as a ventilator or a means of lighting up the hole when both doors were shut it was much too inaccessible to offer any apparent way of escape Never was a man more thoroughly boxed in As I realized how little chance there was of any outside interference how my captor even if he was seen leaving the house by the officer on duty would be taken for myself and so allowed to escape I own that I felt my position a hopeless one But anger is a powerful stimulant and I was mortally angry not only with Sears but with myself So when I was done swearing I took another look around and finding that there was no getting through the walls turned my attention wholly to the shaft which would certainly lead me out of the place if I could only find means to mount it And how do you think I managed to do this at last A look at my bedraggled lime covered clothes may give you some idea I cut a passage for myself up those perpendicular walls as the boy did up the face of the natural bridge in Virginia Do you remember that old story in the Reader It came to me like an inspiration as I stood looking up from below and though I knew that I should have to work most of the way in perfect darkness I decided that a man s life was worth some risk and that I had rather fall and break my neck while doing something than to spend hours in maddening inactivity only to face death at last from slow starvation I had a knife an exceedingly good knife in my pocket and for the first few steps I should have the light of my electric torch The difficulty that is the first difficulty was to reach the shaft from the floor where I stood There was but one article of furniture in the room and that was something between a table and a desk No chairs and the desk was not high enough to enable me to reach the mouth of the shaft If I could turn it on end there might be some hope But this did not look feasible However I threw off my coat and went at the thing with a vengeance and whether I was given superhuman power or whether the clumsy thing was not as heavy as it looked I did finally succeed in turning it on its end close under the opening from which the shaft rose The next thing was to get on its top That seemed about as impossible as climbing the bare wall itself but presently I bethought me of the drawers and though they were locked I did succeed by the aid of my keys to get enough of them open to make for myself a very good pair of stairs I could now see my way to the mouth of the shaft but after that Taking out my knife I felt the edge It was a good one so was the point but was it good enough to work holes in plaster It depended somewhat upon the plaster Had the masons in finishing that shaft any thought of the poor wretch who one day would have to pit his life against the hardness of the final covering My first dig at it would tell I own I trembled violently at the prospect of what that first test would mean to me and wondered if the perspiration which I felt starting at every pore was the result of the effort I had been engaged in or just plain fear Inspector I do not intend to have you live with me through the five mortal hours which followed I was enabled to pierce that plaster with my knife and even to penetrate deep enough to afford a place for the tips of my fingers and afterward for the point of my toes digging prying sweating panting listening first for a sudden opening of the doors beneath then for some shout or wicked interference from above as I worked my way up inch by inch foot by foot to what might not be safety after it was attained Five hours six Then I struck something which proved to be a window and when I realized this and knew that with but one more effort I should breathe freely again I came as near falling as I had at any time before I began this terrible climb Happily I had some premonition of my danger and threw myself into a position which held me till the dizzy minute passed Then I went calmly on with my work and in another half hour had reached the window which fortunately for me not only opened inward but was off the latch It was with a sense of inexpressible relief that I clambered through this window and for a brief moment breathed in the pungent odor of cedar But it could have been only for a moment It was three o clock in the afternoon before I found myself again in the outer air The only way I can account for the lapse of time is that the strain to which both body and nerve had been subjected was too much for even my hardy body and that I fell to the floor of the cedar closet and from a faint went into a sleep that lasted until two I can easily account for the last hour because it took me that long to cut the thick paneling from the door of the closet However I am here now sir and in very much the same condition in which I left that house I thought my first duty was to tell you that I had seen Hiram Sears in that house last night and put you on his track I drew a long breath I think the inspector did I had been almost rigid from excitement and I don t believe he was quite free from it either But his voice was calmer than I expected when he finally said I ll remember this It was a good night s work Then the inspector put to him some questions which seemed to fix the fact that Sears had left the house before Sweetwater did after which he bade him send certain men to him and then go and fix himself up I believe he had forgotten me I had almost forgotten myself XV SEARS OR WELLGOOD Not till the inspector had given several orders was I again summoned into his presence He smiled as our eyes met but did not allude any more than I did to what had just passed Nevertheless we understood each other When I was again seated he took up the conversation where we had left it The description I was just about to read to you he went on will you listen to it now Gladly said I it is Wellgood s I believe He did not answer save by a curious glance from under his brows but taking the paper again from his desk went on reading A man of fifty five looking like one of sixty Medium height insignificant features head bald save for a ring of scanty dark hair No beard a heavy nose long mouth and sleepy half shut eyes capable of shooting strange glances Nothing distinctive in face or figure save the depth of his wrinkles and a scarcely observable stoop in his right shoulder Do you see Wellgood in that he suddenly asked I have only the faintest recollection of his appearance was my doubtful reply But the impression I get from this description is not exactly the one I received of that waiter in the momentary glimpse I got of him So others have told me before he remarked looking very disappointed The description is of Sears given me by a man who knew him well and if we could fit the description of the one to that of the other we should have it easy But the few persons who have seen Wellgood differ greatly in their remembrance of his features and even of his coloring It is astonishing how superficially most people see a man even when they are thrown into daily contact with him mister Jones says the man s eyes are gray his hair a wig and dark his nose pudgy and his face without much expression His land lady that his eyes are blue his hair whether wig or not a dusty auburn and his look quick and piercing a look which always made her afraid His nose she don t remember Both agree or rather all agree that he wore no beard Sears did but a beard can be easily taken off and all of them declare that they would know him instantly if they saw him And so the matter stands Even you can give me no definite description one I mean as satisfactory or unsatisfactory as this of Sears I shook my head Like the others I felt that I should know him if I saw him but I could go no further than that There seemed to be so little that was distinctive about the man The inspector hoping perhaps that all this would serve to rouse my memory shrugged his shoulders and put the best face he could on the matter Well well said he we shall have to be patient A day may make all the difference possible in our outlook If we can lay hands on either of these men He seemed to realize he had said a word too much for he instantly changed the subject by asking if I had succeeded in getting a sample of Miss Grey s writing I was forced to say no that everything had been very carefully put away But I do not know what moment I may come upon it I added I do not forget its importance in this investigation Very good Those lines handed up to missus Fairbrother from the walk outside are the second most valuable clue we possess I did not ask him what the first was I knew It was the stiletto Strange that no one has testified to that handwriting I remarked He looked at me in surprise Fifty persons have sent in samples of writing which they think like it he observed Often of persons who never heard of the Fairbrothers We have been bothered greatly with the business You know little of the difficulties the police labor under I know too much I sighed He smiled and patted me on the hand Go back to your patient he said Forget every other duty but that of your calling until you get some definite word from me I shall not keep you in suspense one minute longer than is absolutely necessary He had risen I rose too But I was not satisfied I could not leave the room with my ideas I might say with my convictions in such a turmoil Inspector said I you will think me very obstinate but all you have told me about Sears all I have heard about him in fact this I emphasized does not convince me of the entire folly of my own suspicions Indeed I am afraid that if anything they are strengthened This steward who is a doubtful character I acknowledge may have had his reasons for wishing missus Fairbrother s death may even have had a hand in the matter but what evidence have you to show that he himself entered the alcove struck the blow or stole the diamond I have listened eagerly for some such evidence but I have listened in vain I know he murmured I know But it will come at least I think so This should have reassured me no doubt and sent me away quiet and happy But something the tenacity of a deep conviction possibly kept me lingering before the inspector and finally gave me the courage to say I know I ought not to speak another word that I am putting myself at a disadvantage in doing so but I can not help it Inspector I can not help it when I see you laying such stress upon the few indirect clues connecting the suspicious Sears with this crime and ignoring the direct clues we have against one whom we need not name Had I gone too far Had my presumption transgressed all bounds and would he show a very natural anger No he smiled instead an enigmatical smile no doubt which I found it difficult to understand but yet a smile You mean he suggested that Sears possible connection with the crime can not eliminate mister Grey s very positive one nor can the fact that Wellgood s hand came in contact with mister Grey s at or near the time of the exchange of the false stone with the real make it any less evident who was the guilty author of this exchange The inspector s hand was on the door knob but he dropped it at this and surveying me very quietly said I thought that a few days spent at the bedside of Miss Grey in the society of so renowned and cultured a gentleman as her father would disabuse you of these damaging suspicions I don t wonder that you thought so I burst out You would think so all the more if you knew how kind he can be and what solicitude he shows for all about him But I can not get over the facts They all point it seems to me straight in one direction All You heard what was said in this room I saw it in your eye how the man who surprised the steward in his own room last night heard him talking of love and death in connection with missus Fairbrother To kiss what I hate It is almost as bad as to kill what I love he said something like that Yes I heard that But did he mean that he had been her actual slayer Could you convict him on those words Well we shall find out Then as to Wellgood s part in the little business you choose to consider that it took place at the time the stone fell from mister Grey s hand What proof have you that the substitution you believe in was not made by him He could easily have done it while crossing the room to mister Grey s side Inspector Then hotly as the absurdity of the suggestion struck me with full force He do this A waiter or as you think mister Fairbrother s steward to be provided with so hard to come by an article as this counterpart of a great stone Isn t that almost as incredible a supposition as any I have myself presumed to advance Possibly but the affair is full of incredibilities the greatest of which to my mind is the persistence with which you a kind hearted enough little woman persevere in ascribing the deepest guilt to one you profess to admire and certainly would be glad to find innocent of any complicity with a great crime I felt that I must justify myself mister Durand has had no such consideration shown him said I I know my child I know but the cases differ Wouldn t it be well for you to see this and be satisfied with the turn which things have taken without continuing to insist upon involving mister Grey in your suspicions A smile took off the edge of this rebuke yet I felt it keenly and only the confidence I had in his fairness as a man and public official enabled me to say But I am talking quite confidentially And you have been so good to me so willing to listen to all I had to say that I can not help but speak my whole mind It is my only safety valve Remember how I have to sit in the presence of this man with my thoughts all choked up It is killing me But I think I should go back content if you will listen to one more suggestion I have to make It is my last Say it I am nothing if not indulgent He had spoken the word Indulgent that was it He let me speak probably had let me speak from the first from pure kindness He did not believe one little bit in my good sense or logic But I was not to be deterred I would empty my mind of the ugly thing that lay there I would leave there no miserable dregs of doubt to ferment and work their evil way with me in the dead watches of the night which I had yet to face So I took him at his word I only want to ask this In case Sears is innocent of the crime who wrote the warning and where did the assassin get the stiletto with the Grey arms chased into its handle And the diamond Still the diamond You hint that he stole that too That with some idea of its proving useful to him on this gala occasion he had provided himself with an imitation stone setting and all he who has never shown so far as we have heard any interest in missus Fairbrother s diamond only in missus Fairbrother herself If Wellgood is Sears and Sears the medium by which the false stone was exchanged for the real then he made this exchange in mister Grey s interests and not his own But I don t believe he had anything to do with it I think everything goes to show that the exchange was made by mister Grey himself A second Daniel muttered the inspector lightly Go on little lawyer But for all this attempt at banter on his part I imagined that I saw the beginning of a very natural anxiety to close the conversation I therefore hastened with what I had yet to say cutting my words short and almost stammering in my eagerness Remember the perfection of that imitation stone a copy so exact that it extends to the setting That shows plan forgive me if I repeat myself preparation a knowledge of stones a particular knowledge of this one mister Fairbrother s steward may have had the knowledge but he would have been a fool to have used his knowledge to secure for himself a valuable he could never have found a purchaser for in any market But a fancier one who has his pleasure in the mere possession of a unique and invaluable gem ah that is different He might risk a crime history tells us of several Here I paused to take breath which gave the inspector chance to say In other words this is what you think The Englishman desirous of covering up his tracks conceived the idea of having this imitation on hand in case it might be of use in the daring and disgraceful undertaking you ascribe to him Recognizing his own inability to do this himself he delegated the task to one who in some way he had been led to think cherished a secret grudge against its present possessor a man who had had some opportunity for seeing the stone and studying the setting The copy thus procured mister Grey went to the ball and relying on his own seemingly unassailable position attacked missus Fairbrother in the alcove and would have carried off the diamond if he had found it where he had seen it earlier blazing on her breast But it was not there The warning received by her a warning you ascribe to his daughter a fact which is yet to be proved had led her to rid herself of the jewel in the way mister Durand describes and he found himself burdened with a dastardly crime and with nothing to show for it Later however to his intense surprise and possible satisfaction he saw that diamond in my hands and recognizing an opportunity as he thought of yet securing it he asked to see it held it for an instant and then making use of an almost incredible expedient for distracting attention dropped not the real stone but the false one retaining the real one in his hand This in plain English as I take it is your present idea of the situation Astonished at the clearness with which he read my mind I answered Yes Inspector that is what was in my mind Good then it is just as well that it is out Your mind is now free and you can give it entirely to your duties Then as he laid his hand on the door knob he added In studying so intently your own point of view you seem to have forgotten that the last thing which mister Grey would be likely to do under those circumstances would be to call attention to the falsity of the gem upon whose similarity to the real stone he was depending Not even his confidence in his own position as an honored and highly esteemed guest would lead him to do that Not if he were a well known connoisseur I faltered with the pride of one who has handled the best gems He would know that the deception would be soon discovered and that it would not do for him to fail to recognize it for what it was when the make believe was in his hands Forced my dear child forced and as chimerical as all the rest It can not stand putting into words I will go further you are a good girl and can bear to hear the truth from me I don t believe in your theory I can t I have not been able to from the first nor have any of my men but if your ideas are true and mister Grey is involved in this matter you will find that there has been more of a hitch about that diamond than you in your simplicity believe If mister Grey were in actual possession of this valuable he would show less care than you say he does So would he if it were in Wellgood s hands with his consent and a good prospect of its coming to him in the near future But if it is in Wellgood s hands without his consent or any near prospect of his regaining it then we can easily understand his present apprehensions and the growing uneasiness he betrays True I murmured If then the inspector pursued giving me a parting glance not without its humor probably not without something really serious underlying its humor we should find in following up our present clue that mister Grey has had dealings with this Wellgood or this Sears or if you with your advantages for learning the fact should discover that he shows any extraordinary interest in either of them the matter will take on a different aspect But we have not got that far yet At present our task is to find one or the other of these men If we are lucky we shall discover that the waiter and the steward are identical in spite of their seemingly different appearance A rogue such as this Sears has shown himself to be would be an adept at disguise You are right I acknowledged He has certainly the heart of a criminal If he had no hand in missus Fairbrother s murder he came near having one in that of your detective You know what I mean I could not help hearing Inspector He smiled looked me steadfastly in the face for a moment and then bowed me out The inspector told me afterward that in spite of the cavalier manner with which he had treated my suggestions he spent a very serious half hour head to head with the district attorney The result was the following order to Sweetwater the detective You are to go to the saint Regis make yourself solid there and gradually as you can manage it work yourself into a position for knowing all that goes on in Room If the gentleman mind you the gentleman we care nothing about the women should go out you are to follow him if it takes you to We want to know his secret but he must never know our interest in it and you are to be as silent in this matter as if possessed of neither ear nor tongue I will add memory for if you find this secret to be one in which we have no lawful interest you are to forget it absolutely and for ever You will understand why when you consult the saint Regis register But they expected nothing from it absolutely nothing XVI DOUBT I prayed uncle that we might be driven home by the way of Eighty sixth Street I wanted to look at the Fairbrother house I had seen it many times but I felt that I should see it with new eyes after the story I had just heard in the inspector s office That an adventure of this nature could take place in a New York house taxed my credulity I might have believed it of Paris wicked mysterious Paris the home of intrigue and every redoubtable crime but of our own homely commonplace metropolis the house must be seen for me to be convinced of the fact related Many of you know the building It is usually spoken of with a shrug the sole reason for which seems to be that there is no other just like it in the city I myself have always considered it imposing and majestic but to the average man it is too suggestive of Old World feudal life to be pleasing On this afternoon a dull depressing one it looked undeniably heavy as we approached it but interesting in a very new way to me because of the great turret at one angle the scene of that midnight descent of two men each in deadly fear of the other yet quailing not in their purpose the one of flight the other of pursuit There was no railing in front of the house It may have seemed an unnecessary safeguard to the audacious owner Consequently the small door in the turret opened directly upon the street making entrance and exit easy enough for any one who had the key But the shaft and the small room at the bottom where were they Naturally in the center of the great mass the room being without windows It was therefore useless to look for it and yet my eye ran along the peaks and pinnacles of the roof searching for the skylight in which it undoubtedly ended At last I espied it and my curiosity satisfied on this score I let my eyes run over the side and face of the building for an open window or a lifted shade But all were tightly closed and gave no more sign of life than did the boarded up door But I was not deceived by this As we drove away I thought how on the morrow there would be a regular procession passing through this street to see just the little I had seen to day The detective s adventure was like to make the house notorious For several minutes after I had left its neighborhood my imagination pictured room after room shut up from the light of day but bearing within them the impalpable aura of those two shadows flitting through them like the ghosts of ghosts as the detective had tellingly put it The heart has its strange surprises Through my whole ride and the indulgence in these thoughts I was conscious of a great inner revulsion against all I had intimated and even honestly felt while talking with the inspector Perhaps this is what this wise old official expected He had let me talk and the inevitable reaction followed I could now see only mister Grey s goodness and claims to respect and began to hate myself that I had not been immediately impressed by the inspector s views and shown myself more willing to drop every suspicion against the august personage I had presumed to associate with crime What had given me the strength to persist Loyalty to my lover His innocence had not been involved Indeed every word uttered in the inspector s office had gone to prove that he no longer occupied a leading place in police calculations that their eyes were turned elsewhere and that I had only to be patient to see mister Durand quite cleared in their minds But was this really so Was he as safe as that What if this new clue failed What if they failed to find Sears or lay hands on the doubtful Wellgood Would mister Durand be released without a trial Should we hear nothing more of the strange and to many the suspicious circumstances which linked him to this crime It would be expecting too much from either police or official discrimination No mister Durand would never be completely exonerated till the true culprit was found and all explanations made I had therefore been simply fighting his battles when I pointed out what I thought to be the weak place in their present theory and sore as I felt in contemplation of my seemingly heartless action I was not the unimpressionable addle pated nonentity I must have seemed to the inspector Yet my comfort was small and the effort it took to face mister Grey and my young patient was much greater than I had anticipated I blushed as I approached to take my place at Miss Grey s bedside and had her father been as suspicious of me at that moment as I was of him I am sure that I should have fared badly in his thoughts But he was not on the watch for my emotions He was simply relieved to see me back I noticed this immediately also that something had occurred during my absence which absorbed his thought and filled him with anxiety A Western Union envelope lay at his feet proof that he had just received a telegram This under ordinary circumstances would not have occasioned me a second thought such a man being naturally the recipient of all sorts of communications from all parts of the world but at this crisis with the worm of a half stifled doubt still gnawing at my heart everything that occurred to him took on importance and roused questions When he had left the room Miss Grey nestled up to me with the seemingly ingenuous remark Poor papa something disturbs him He will not tell me what I suppose he thinks I am not strong enough to share his troubles But I shall be soon Don t you see I am gaining every day Indeed I do was my hearty response In face of such a sweet confidence and open affection doubt vanished and I was able to give all my thoughts to her I wish papa felt as sure of this as you do she said For some reason he does not seem to take any comfort from my improvement When Doctor Freligh says Well well we are getting on finely to day I notice that he does not look less anxious nor does he even meet these encouraging words with a smile Haven t you noticed it He looks as care worn and troubled about me now as he did the first day I was taken sick Why should he Is it because he has lost so many children he can not believe in his good fortune at having the most insignificant of all left to him I do not know your father very well I protested and can not judge what is going on in his mind But he must see that you are quite a different girl from what you were a week ago and that if nothing unforeseen happens your recovery will only be a matter of a week or two longer Oh how I love to hear you say that To be well again To read letters she murmured and to write them And I saw the delicate hand falter up to pinch the precious packet awaiting that happy hour I did not like to discuss her father with her so took this opportunity to turn the conversation aside into safer channels But we had not proceeded far before mister Grey returned and taking his stand at the foot of the bed remarked after a moment s gloomy contemplation of his daughter s face You are better today the doctor says I have just been telephoning to him But do you feel well enough for me to leave you for a few days There is a man I must see must go to if you have no dread of being left alone with your good nurse and the doctor s constant attendance Miss Grey looked startled Doubtless she found it difficult to understand what man in this strange country could interest her father enough to induce him to leave her while he was yet laboring under such solicitude But a smile speedily took the place of her look of surprised inquiry and she affectionately exclaimed Oh I haven t the least dread in the world not now See I can hold up my arms Go papa go it will give me a chance to surprise you with my good looks when you come back He turned abruptly away He was suffering from an emotion deeper than he cared to acknowledge But he gained control over himself speedily and coming back announced with forced decision I shall have to go to night I have no choice Promise me that you will not go back in my absence that you will strive to get well that you will put all your mind into striving to get well Indeed I will she answered a little frightened by the feeling he showed Don t worry so much I have more than one reason for living papa He shook his head and went immediately to make his preparations for departure His daughter gave one sob then caught me by the hand You look dumfounded said she But never mind we shall get on very well together I have the most perfect confidence in you Was it my duty to let the inspector know that mister Grey anticipated absenting himself from the city for a few days I decided that I would only be impressing my own doubts upon him after a rebuke which should have allayed them Yet when mister Grey came to take his departure I wished that the inspector might have been a witness to his emotion if only to give me one of his very excellent explanations The parting was more like that of one who sees no immediate promise of return than of a traveler who intends to limit his stay to a few days He looked her in the eyes and kissed her a dozen times each time with an air of heartbreak which was good neither for her nor for himself and when he finally tore himself away it was to look back at her from the door with an expression I was glad she did not see or it would certainly have interfered with the promise she had made to concentrate all her energies on getting well What was at the root of his extreme grief at leaving her Did he fear the person he was going to meet or were his plans such as involved a much longer stay than he had mentioned Did he even mean to return at all Ah that was the question Did he intend to return or had I been the unconscious witness of a flight XVII SWEETWATER IN A NEW ROLE 
3923_153309_000003_000000	train-clean-360	A few days later three men were closeted in the district attorney s office 
3923_153309_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Two of them were officials the district attorney himself and our old friend the inspector 
3923_153309_000003_000002	train-clean-360	The third was the detective Sweetwater chosen by them to keep watch on mister Grey 
3923_153309_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Sweetwater had just come to town this was evident from the gripsack he had set down in a corner on entering also from a certain tousled appearance which bespoke hasty rising and but few facilities for proper attention to his person 
3923_153309_000004_000001	train-clean-360	These details counted little however in the astonishment created by his manner 
3923_153309_000004_000002	train-clean-360	For a hardy chap he looked strangely nervous and indisposed so much so that after the first short greeting the inspector asked him what was up and if he had had another Fairbrother house experience 
3923_153309_000005_000000	train-clean-360	He replied with a decided no that it was not his adventure which had upset him but the news he had to bring 
3923_153309_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Here he glanced at every door and window and then leaning forward over the table at which the two officials sat he brought his head as nearly to them as possible and whispered five words 
3923_153309_000007_000000	train-clean-360	They produced a most unhappy sensation 
3923_153309_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Both the men hardened as they were by duties which soon sap the sensibilities started and turned as pale as the speaker himself 
3923_153309_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Then the district attorney with one glance at the inspector rose and locked the door 
3923_153309_000008_000000	train-clean-360	It was a prelude to this tale which I give not as it came from his mouth but as it was afterward related to me 
none	none	The language I fear is mostly my own 
3923_153309_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The detective had just been with mister Grey to the coast of Maine Why there will presently appear 
3923_153309_000009_000001	train-clean-360	His task had been to follow this gentleman and follow him he did 
3923_153309_000010_000000	train-clean-360	mister Grey was a very stately man difficult of approach and was absorbed besides by some overwhelming care 
none	none	But this fellow was one in a thousand and somehow during the trip he managed to do him some little service which drew the attention of the great man to himself This done he so improved his opportunity that the two were soon on the best of terms and he learned that the Englishman was without a valet and being unaccustomed to move about without one felt the awkwardness of his position very much This gave Sweetwater his cue and when he found that the services of such a man were wanted only during the present trip and for the handling of affairs quite apart from personal tendance upon the gentleman himself he showed such an honest desire to fill the place and made out to give such a good account of himself that he found himself engaged for the work before reaching C 
3923_153309_000011_000000	train-clean-360	This was a great stroke of luck he thought but he little knew how big a stroke or into what a series of adventures it was going to lead him 
3923_153309_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Once on the platform of the small station at which mister Grey had bidden him to stop he noticed two things the utter helplessness of the man in all practical matters and his extreme anxiety to see all that was going on about him without being himself seen 
none	none	There was method in this curiosity too much method 
3923_153309_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Women did not interest him in the least They could pass and repass without arousing his attention but the moment a man stepped his way he shrank from him only to betray the greatest curiosity concerning him the moment he felt it safe to turn and observe him 
3923_153309_000012_000003	train-clean-360	All of which convinced Sweetwater that the Englishman s errand was in connection with a man whom he equally dreaded and desired to meet 
3923_153309_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Of this he was made absolutely certain a little later 
none	none	As they were leaving the depot with the rest of the arrivals mister Grey said
3923_153309_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I want you to get me a room at a very quiet hotel 
none	none	This done you are to hunt up the man whose name you will find written in this paper and when you have found him make up your mind how it will be possible for me to get a good look at him without his getting any sort of a look at me 
3923_153309_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Do this and you will earn a week s salary in one day 
none	none	Sweetwater with his head in air and his heart on fire for matters were looking very promising indeed took the paper and put it in his pocket then he began to hunt for a hotel 
3923_153309_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Not till he had found what he wished and installed the Englishman in his room did he venture to open the precious memorandum and read the name he had been speculating over for an hour 
3923_153309_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It was not the one he had anticipated but it came near to it It was that of James Wellgood 
none	none	Satisfied now that he had a ticklish matter to handle he prepared for it with his usual enthusiasm and circumspection Sauntering out into the street he strolled first toward the post office 
3923_153309_000017_000001	train-clean-360	The train on which he had just come had been a mail train and he calculated that he would find half the town there 
3923_153309_000018_000000	train-clean-360	His calculation was a correct one 
none	none	The store was crowded with people Taking his place in the line drawn up before the post office window he awaited his turn and when it came shouted out the name which was his one talisman James Wellgood 
3923_153309_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The man behind the boxes was used to the name and reached out a hand toward a box unusually well stacked but stopped half way there and gave Sweetwater a sharp look 
3923_153309_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Who are you he asked 
3923_153309_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 A stranger that young man put in volubly looking for James Wellgood 
3923_153309_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I thought perhaps you could tell me where to find him 
3923_153309_000021_000002	train-clean-360	I see that his letters pass through this office 
3923_153309_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 You re taking up another man s time complained the postmaster 
none	none	He probably alluded to the man whose elbow Sweetwater felt boring into his back
3923_153309_000022_000002	train-clean-360	 Ask Dick over there he knows him 
3923_153309_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The detective was glad enough to escape and ask Dick 
3923_153309_000023_000001	train-clean-360	But he was better pleased yet when Dick a fellow with a squint whose hand was always in the sugar told him that mister Wellgood would probably be in for his mail in a few moments 
3923_153309_000023_000002	train-clean-360	 That is his buggy standing before the drug store on the opposite side of the way 
3923_153309_000024_000000	train-clean-360	So he had netted Jones quondam waiter at the first cast 
3923_153309_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Lucky was what he said to himself still lucky 
3923_153309_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Sauntering to the door he watched for the owner of that buggy 
3923_153309_000025_000001	train-clean-360	He had learned as such fellows do that there was a secret hue and cry after this very man by the New York police that he was supposed by some to be Sears himself 
3923_153309_000025_000002	train-clean-360	In this way he would soon be looking upon the very man whose steps he had followed through the Fairbrother house a few nights before and through whose resolute action he had very nearly run the risk of a lingering death from starvation 
3923_153309_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 A dangerous customer thought he 
3923_153309_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 I wonder if my instinct will go so far as to make me recognize his presence 
none	none	I shouldn t wonder It has served me almost as well as that many times before It appeared to serve him now for when the man finally showed himself on the cross walk separating the two buildings he experienced a sudden indecision not unlike that of dread and there being nothing in the man s appearance to warrant apprehension he took it for the instinctive recognition it undoubtedly was He therefore watched him narrowly and succeeded in getting one glance from his eye It was enough 
3923_153309_000028_000002	train-clean-360	The man was commonplace commonplace in feature dress and manner but his eye gave him away 
none	none	There was nothing commonplace in that It was an eye to beware of 
3923_153309_000029_000000	train-clean-360	He had taken in Sweetwater as he passed but Sweetwater was of a commonplace type too and woke no corresponding dread in the other s mind for he went whistling into the store from which he presently reissued with a bundle of mail in his hand 
none	none	The detective s first instinct was to take him into custody as a suspect much wanted by the New York police but reason assured him that he not only had no warrant for this but that he would better serve the ends of justice by following out his present task of bringing this man and the Englishman together and watching the result 
3923_153309_000029_000002	train-clean-360	But how with the conditions laid on him by mister Grey was this to be done 
3923_153309_000029_000003	train-clean-360	He knew nothing of the man s circumstances or of his position in the town 
3923_153309_000029_000004	train-clean-360	How then go to work to secure his cooperation in a scheme possibly as mysterious to him as it was to himself 
3923_153309_000029_000005	train-clean-360	He could stop this stranger in mid street with some plausible excuse but it did not follow that he would succeed in luring him to the hotel where mister Grey could see him 
3923_153309_000029_000006	train-clean-360	Wellgood or as he believed Sears knew too much of life to be beguiled by any open clap trap and Sweetwater was obliged to see him drive off without having made the least advance in the purpose engrossing him 
3923_153309_000030_000000	train-clean-360	But that was nothing 
3923_153309_000030_000001	train-clean-360	He had all the evening before him and reentering the store he took up his stand near the sugar barrel 
3923_153309_000030_000002	train-clean-360	He had perceived that in the pauses of weighing and tasting Dick talked if he were guided with suitable discretion why should he not talk of Wellgood 
3923_153309_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He was guided and he did talk and to some effect 
3923_153309_000031_000001	train-clean-360	That is he gave information of the man which surprised Sweetwater 
none	none	If in the past and in New York he had been known as a waiter or should I say steward he was known here as a manufacturer of patent medicine designed to rejuvenate the human race 
3923_153309_000031_000003	train-clean-360	He had not been long in town and was somewhat of a stranger yet but he wouldn t be so long 
3923_153309_000031_000004	train-clean-360	He was going to make things hum he was 
3923_153309_000031_000005	train-clean-360	Money for this money for that a horse where another man would walk and mail well that alone would make this post office worth while 
3923_153309_000031_000006	train-clean-360	Then the drugs ordered by wholesale 
3923_153309_000031_000007	train-clean-360	Those boxes over there were his ready to be carted out to his manufactory 
3923_153309_000031_000008	train-clean-360	Count them some one and think of the bottles and bottles of stuff they stand for 
3923_153309_000031_000009	train-clean-360	If it sells as he says it will then he will soon be rich and so on till Sweetwater brought the garrulous Dick to a standstill by asking whether Wellgood had been away for any purpose since he first came to town 
none	none	He received the reply that he had just come home from New York where he had been for some articles needed in his manufactory 
3923_153309_000031_000011	train-clean-360	Sweetwater felt all his convictions confirmed and ended the colloquy with the final question 
3923_153309_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 And where is his manufactory 
3923_153309_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Might be worth visiting perhaps 
3923_153309_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The other made a gesture said something about northwest and rushed to help a customer 
3923_153309_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Sweetwater took the opportunity to slide away 
none	none	More explicit directions could easily be got elsewhere and he felt anxious to return to mister Grey and discover if possible whether it would prove as much a matter of surprise to him as to Sweetwater himself that the man who answered to the name of Wellgood was the owner of a manufactory and a barrel or two of drugs out of which he proposed to make a compound that would rob the doctors of their business and make himself and this little village rich 
3923_153309_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Sweetwater made only one stop on his way to mister Grey s hotel rooms and that was at the stables 
3923_153309_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Here he learned whatever else there was to know and armed with definite information he appeared before mister Grey who to his astonishment was dining in his own room 
none	none	He had dismissed the waiter and was rather brooding than eating 
3923_153309_000035_000001	train-clean-360	He looked up eagerly however when Sweetwater entered and asked what news 
3923_153309_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The detective with some semblance of respect answered that he had seen Wellgood but that he had been unable to detain him or bring him within his employer s observation 
3923_153309_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 He is a patent medicine man he then explained and manufactures his own concoctions in a house he has rented here on a lonely road some half mile out of town 
3923_153309_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Wellgood does 
3923_153309_000038_000001	train-clean-360	the man named Wellgood mister Grey exclaimed with all the astonishment the other secretly expected 
3923_153309_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Wellgood James Wellgood 
none	none	There is no other in town How long has this man been here the statesman inquired after a moment of apparently great discomfiture Just twenty four hours this time He was here once before when he rented the house and made all his plans Ah 
3923_153309_000043_000000	train-clean-360	mister Grey rose precipitately 
3923_153309_000043_000001	train-clean-360	His manner had changed 
3923_153309_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I must see him 
3923_153309_000044_000001	train-clean-360	What you tell me makes it all the more necessary for me to see him 
3923_153309_000044_000002	train-clean-360	How can you bring it about 
none	none	Without his seeing you Sweetwater asked Yes yes certainly without his seeing me 
3923_153309_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Couldn t you rap him up at his own door and hold him in talk a minute while I looked on from the carriage or whatever vehicle we can get to carry us there 
3923_153309_000046_000002	train-clean-360	The least glimpse of his face would satisfy me 
3923_153309_000046_000003	train-clean-360	That is to night 
3923_153309_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll try said Sweetwater not very sanguine as to the probable result of this effort 
3923_153309_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Returning to the stables he ordered the team 
none	none	With the last ray of the sun they set out the reins in Sweetwater s hands They headed for the coast road XVIII THE CLOSED DOOR The road was once the highway but the tide having played so many tricks with its numberless bridges a new one had been built farther up the cliff carrying with it the life and business of the small town Many old landmarks still remained shops warehouses and even a few scattered dwellings But most of these were deserted and those that were still in use showed such neglect that it was very evident the whole region would soon be given up to the encroaching sea and such interests as are inseparable from it The hour was that mysterious one of late twilight when outlines lose their distinctness and sea and shore melt into one mass of uniform gray There was no wind and the waves came in with a soft plash but so near to the level of the road that it was evident even to these strangers that the tide was at its height and would presently begin to ebb Soon they had passed the last forsaken dwelling and the town proper lay behind them Sand and a few rocks were all that lay between them now and the open stretch of the ocean which at this point approached the land in a small bay well guarded on either side by embracing rocky heads This was what made the harbor at C It was very still They passed one team and only one Sweetwater looked very sharply at this team and at its driver but saw nothing to arouse suspicion They were now a half mile from C and seemingly in a perfectly desolate region A manufactory here exclaimed mister Grey It was the first word he had uttered since starting Not far from here was Sweetwater s equally laconic reply and the road taking a turn almost at the moment of his speaking he leaned forward and pointed out a building standing on the right hand side of the road with its feet in the water That s it said he They described it well enough for me to know it when I see it Looks like a robber s hole at this time of night he laughed but what can you expect from a manufactory of patent medicine mister Grey was silent He was looking very earnestly at the building It is larger than I expected he remarked at last Sweetwater himself was surprised but as they advanced and their point of view changed they found it to be really an insignificant structure and mister Wellgood s portion of it more insignificant still In reality it was a collection of three stores under one roof two of them were shut up and evidently unoccupied the third showed a lighted window This was the manufactory It occupied the middle place and presented a tolerably decent appearance It showed besides the lighted lamp I have mentioned such signs of life as a few packing boxes tumbled out on the small platform in front and a whinnying horse attached to an empty buggy tied to a post on the opposite side of the road I m glad to see the lamp muttered Sweetwater Now what shall we do Is it light enough for you to see his face if I can manage to bring him to the door mister Grey seemed startled It s darker than I thought said he But call the man and if I can not see him plainly I ll shout to the horse to stand which you will take as a signal to bring this Wellgood nearer But do not be surprised if I ride off before he reaches the buggy I ll come back again and take you up farther down the road All right sir answered Sweetwater with a side glance at the speaker s inscrutable features It s a go And leaping to the ground he advanced to the manufactory door and knocked loudly No one appeared He tried the latch it lifted but the door did not open it was fastened from within Strange he muttered casting a glance at the waiting horse and buggy then at the lighted window which was on the second floor directly over his head Guess I ll sing out Here he shouted the man s name Wellgood I say Wellgood No response to this either Looks bad he acknowledged to himself and taking a step back he looked up at the window It was closed but there was neither shade nor curtain to obstruct the view Do you see anything he inquired of mister Grey who sat with his eye at the small window in the buggy top Nothing No movement in the room above No shadow at the window Nothing Well it s confounded strange And he went back still calling Wellgood The tied up horse whinnied and the waves gave a soft splash and that was all if I except Sweetwater s muttered oath Coming back he looked again at the window then with a gesture toward mister Grey turned the corner of the building and began to edge himself along its side in an endeavor to reach the rear and see what it offered But he came to a sudden standstill He found himself on the edge of the bank before he had taken twenty steps Yet the building projected on and he saw why it had looked so large from a certain point of the approach Its rear was built out on piles making its depth even greater than the united width of the three stores At low tide this might be accessible from below but just now the water was almost on a level with the top of the piles making all approach impossible save by boat Disgusted with his failure Sweetwater returned to the front and finding the situation unchanged took a new resolve After measuring with his eye the height of the first story he coolly walked over to the strange horse and slipping his bridle brought it back and cast it over a projection of the door by its aid he succeeded in climbing up to the window which was the sole eye to the interior mister Grey sat far back in his buggy watching every movement There were no shades at the window as I have before said and once Sweetwater s eye had reached the level of the sill he could see the interior without the least difficulty There was nobody there The lamp burned on a great table littered with papers but the rude cane chair before it was empty and so was the room He could see into every corner of it and there was not even a hiding place where anybody could remain concealed Sweetwater was still looking when the lamp which had been burning with considerable smoke flared up and went out Sweetwater uttered an ejaculation and finding himself face to face with utter darkness slid from his perch to the ground Approaching mister Grey for the second time he said I can not understand it The fellow is either lying low or he s gone out leaving his lamp to go out too But whose is the horse just excuse me while I tie him up again It looks like the one he was driving to day It is the one Well he won t leave him here all night Shall we lie low and wait for him to come and unhitch this animal Or do you prefer to return to the hotel mister Grey was slow in answering Finally he said The man may suspect our intention You can never tell anything about such fellows as he He may have caught some unexpected glimpse of me or simply heard that I was in town If he s the man I think him he has reasons for avoiding me which I can very well understand Let us go back not to the hotel I must see this adventure through tonight but far enough for him to think we have given up all idea of routing him out to night Perhaps that is all he is waiting for You can steal back Excuse me said Sweetwater but I know a better dodge than that We ll circumvent him We passed a boat house on our way down here I ll just drive you up procure a boat and bring you back here by water I don t believe that he will expect that and if he is in the house we shall see him or his light Meanwhile he can escape by the road Escape Do you think he is planning to escape The detective spoke with becoming surprise and mister Grey answered without apparent suspicion It is possible if he suspects my presence in the neighborhood Do you want to stop him I want to see him Oh I remember Well sir we will drive on that is after a moment What are you going to do Oh nothing You said you wanted to see the man before he escaped Yes but And that he might escape by the road Yes Well I was just making that a little bit impracticable A small pebble in the keyhole and why see now his horse is walking off Gee I must have fastened him badly I shouldn t wonder if he trotted all the way to town But it can t be helped I can not be supposed to race after him Are you ready now sir I ll give another shout then I ll get in And once more the lonely region about echoed with the cry Wellgood I say Wellgood There was no answer and the young detective masking for the nonce as mister Grey s confidential servant jumped into the buggy and turned the horse s head toward C XIX THE FACE The moon was well up when the small boat in which our young detective was seated with mister Grey appeared in the bay approaching the so called manufactory of Wellgood The looked for light on the waterside was not there All was dark except where the windows reflected the light of the moon This was a decided disappointment to Sweetwater if not to mister Grey He had expected to detect signs of life in this quarter and this additional proof of Wellgood s absence from home made it look as if they had come out on a fool s errand and might much better have stuck to the road No promise there came in a mutter from his lips Shall I row in sir and try to make a landing You may row nearer I should like a closer view I don t think we shall attract any attention There are more boats than ours on the water Sweetwater was startled Looking round he saw a launch or some such small steamer riding at anchor not far from the mouth of the bay But that was not all Between it and them was a rowboat like their own resting quietly in the wake of the moon I don t like so much company he muttered Something s brewing something in which we may not want to take a part Very likely answered mister Grey grimly But we must not be deterred not till I have seen the rest Sweetwater did not hear mister Grey seemed to remember himself Row nearer he now bade Get under the shadow of the rocks if you can If the boat is for him he will show himself Yet I hardly see how he can board from that bank It did not look feasible Nevertheless they waited and watched with much patience for several long minutes The boat behind them did not advance nor was any movement discernible in the direction of the manufactory Another short period then suddenly a light flashed from a window high up in the central gable sparkled for an instant and was gone Sweetwater took it for a signal and with a slight motion of the wrist began to work his way in toward shore till they lay almost at the edge of the piles Hark It was Sweetwater who spoke Both listened mister Grey with his head turned toward the launch and Sweetwater with his eye on the cavernous space sharply outlined by the piles which the falling tide now disclosed under each contiguous building Goods had been directly shipped from these stores in the old days This he had learned in the village How shipped he had not been able to understand from his previous survey of the building But he thought he could see now At low tide or better at half tide access could be got to the floor of the extension and if this floor held a trap the mystery would be explainable So would be the hovering boat the signal light and yes this sound overheard of steps on a rattling planking I hear nothing whispered mister Grey from the other end The boat is still there but not a man has dipped an oar They will soon returned Sweetwater as a smothered sound of clanking iron reached his ears from the hollow spaces before him Duck your head sir I m going to row in under this portion of the house mister Grey would have protested and with very good reason There was scarcely a space of three feet between them and the boards overhead But Sweetwater had so immediately suited action to word that he had no choice They were now in utter darkness and mister Grey s thoughts must have been peculiar as he crouched over the stern hardly knowing what to expect or whether this sudden launch into darkness was for the purpose of flight or pursuit But enlightenment came soon The sound of a man s tread in the building above was every moment becoming more perceptible and while wondering possibly at his position mister Grey naturally turned his head as nearly as he could in the direction of these sounds and was staring with blank eyes into the darkness when Sweetwater leaning toward him whispered Look up There s a trap In a minute he ll open it Mark him but don t breathe a word and I ll get you out of this all right mister Grey attempted some answer but it was lost in the prolonged creak of slowly moving hinges somewhere over their heads Spaces which had looked dark suddenly looked darker hearing was satisfied but not the eye A man s breath panting with exertion testified to a near by presence but that man was working without a light in a room with shuttered windows and mister Grey probably felt that he knew very little more than before when suddenly most unexpectedly to him at least a face started out of that overhead darkness a face so white with every feature made so startlingly distinct by the strong light Sweetwater had thrown upon it that it seemed the only thing in the world to the two men beneath In another moment it had vanished or rather the light which had revealed it What s that Are you there came down from above in hoarse and none too encouraging tones There was none to answer Sweetwater with a quick pull on the oars had already shot the boat out of its dangerous harbor XX MOONLIGHT AND A CLUE Are you satisfied Have you got what you wanted asked Sweetwater when they were well away from the shore and the voice they had heard calling at intervals from the chasm they had left Yes You re a good fellow It could not have been better managed Then after a pause too prolonged and thoughtful to please Sweetwater who was burning with curiosity if not with some deeper feeling What was that light you burned A match Sweetwater did not answer He dared not How speak of the electric torch he as a detective carried in his pocket That would be to give himself away He therefore let this question slip by and put in one of his own Are you ready to go back now sir Are we all done here This with his ear turned and his eye bent forward for the adventure they had interrupted was not at an end whether their part in it was or not mister Grey hesitated his glances following those of Sweetwater Let us wait said he in a tone which surprised Sweetwater If he is meditating an escape I must speak to him before he reaches the launch At all hazards he added after another moment s thought All right sir How do you propose His words were interrupted by a shrill whistle from the direction of the bank Promptly and as if awaiting this signal the two men in the rowboat before them dipped their oars and pulled for the shore taking the direction of the manufactory Sweetwater said nothing but held himself in readiness mister Grey was equally silent but the lines of his face seemed to deepen in the moonlight as the boat gliding rapidly through the water passed them within a dozen boat lengths and slipped into the opening under the manufactory building Now row he cried Make for the launch We ll intercept them on their return Sweetwater glowing with anticipation bent to his work The boat beneath them gave a bound and in a few minutes they were far out on the waters of the bay They re coming he whispered eagerly as he saw mister Grey looking anxiously back How much farther shall I go Just within hailing distance of the launch was mister Grey s reply Sweetwater gaging the distance with a glance stopped at the proper point and rested on his oars But his thoughts did not rest He realized that he was about to witness an interview whose importance he easily recognized How much of it would he hear What would be the upshot and what was his full duty in the case He knew that this man Wellgood was wanted by the New York police but he was possessed with no authority to arrest him even if he had the power Something more than I bargained for he inwardly commented But I wanted excitement and now I have got it If only I can keep my head level I may get something out of this if not all I could wish Meantime the second boat was very nearly on them He could mark the three figures and pick out Wellgood s head from among the rest It had a resolute air the face on which to his evident discomfiture the moon shone wore a look which convinced the detective that this was no patent medicine manufacturer nor even a caterer s assistant but a man of nerve and resources the same indeed whom he had encountered in mister Fairbrother s house with such disastrous almost fatal results to himself The discovery though an unexpected one did not lessen his sense of the extreme helplessness of his own position He could witness but he could not act follow mister Grey s orders but indulge in none of his own The detective must continue to be lost in the valet though it came hard and woke a sense of shame in his ambitious breast Meanwhile Wellgood had seen them and ordered his men to cease rowing Give way there he shouted We re for the launch and in a hurry There s some one here who wants to speak to you mister Wellgood Sweetwater called out as respectfully as he could Shall I mention your name he asked of mister Grey No I will do that myself And raising his voice he accosted the other with these words I am the man Percival Grey of Darlington Manor England I should like to say a word to you before you embark A change quick as lightning and almost as dangerous passed over the face Sweetwater was watching with such painful anxiety but as the other added nothing to his words and seemed to be merely waiting he shrugged his shoulders and muttered an order to his rowers to proceed In another moment the sterns of the two small craft swung together but in such a way that by dint of a little skilful manipulation on the part of Wellgood s men the latter s back was toward the moon mister Grey leaned toward Wellgood and his face fell into shadow also Bah thought the detective I should have managed that myself But if I can not see I shall at least hear But he deceived himself in this The two men spoke in such low whispers that only their intensity was manifest Not a word came to Sweetwater s ears Bah he thought again this is bad But he had to swallow his disappointment and more For presently the two men so different in culture station and appearance came as it seemed to an understanding and Wellgood taking his hand from his breast fumbled in one of his pockets and drew out something which he handed to mister Grey This made Sweetwater start and peer with still greater anxiety at every movement when to his surprise both bent forward each over his own knee doing something so mysterious he could get no clue to its nature till they again stretched forth their hands to each other and he caught the gleam of paper and realized that they were exchanging memoranda or notes These must have been important for each made an immediate endeavor to read his slip by turning it toward the moon s rays That both were satisfied was shown by their after movements Wellgood put his slip into his pocket and without further word to mister Grey motioned his men to row away They did so with a will leaving a line of silver in their wake mister Grey on the contrary gave no orders He still held his slip and seemed to be dreaming But his eye was on the shore and he did not even turn when sounds from the launch denoted that she was under way Sweetwater looking at this morsel of paper with greedy eyes dipped his oars and began pulling softly toward that portion of the beach where a small and twinkling light defined the boat house He hoped mister Grey would speak hoped that in some way by some means he might obtain a clue to his patron s thoughts But the English gentleman sat like an image and did not move till a slight but sudden breeze blowing in shore seized the paper in his hand and carried it away past Sweetwater who vainly sought to catch it as it went fluttering by into the water ahead where it shone for a moment then softly disappeared Sweetwater uttered a cry so did mister Grey Is it anything you wanted called out the former leaning over the bow of the boat and making a dive at the paper with his oar Yes but if it s gone it s gone returned the other with some feeling Careless of me very careless but I was thinking of He stopped he was greatly agitated but he did not encourage Sweetwater in any further attempts to recover the lost memorandum Indeed such an effort would have been fruitless the paper was gone and there was nothing left for them but to continue their way As they did so it would have been hard to tell in which breast chagrin mounted higher Sweetwater had lost a clue in a thousand and mister Greywell no one knew what he had lost He said nothing and plainly showed by his changed manner that he was in haste to land now and be done with this doubtful adventure When they reached the boat house mister Grey left Sweetwater to pay for the boat and started at once for the hotel The man in charge had the bow of the boat in hand preparatory to pulling it up on the boards As Sweetwater turned toward him he caught sight of the side of the boat shining brightly in the moonlight He gave a start and with a muttered ejaculation darted forward and picked off a small piece of paper from the dripping keel It separated in his hand and a part of it escaped him but the rest he managed to keep by secreting it in his palm where it still clung wet and possibly illegible when he came upon mister Grey again in the hotel office Here s your pay said that gentleman giving him a bill I am very glad I met you You have served me remarkably well There was an anxiety in his face and a hurry in his movements which struck Sweetwater Does this mean that you are through with me asked Sweetwater That you have no further call for my services Quite so said the gentleman I m going to take the train to night I find that I still have time Sweetwater began to look alive Uttering hasty thanks he rushed away to his own room and turning on the gas peeled off the morsel of paper which had begun to dry on his hand If it should prove to be the blank end If the written part were the one which had floated off Such disappointments had fallen to his lot He was not unused to them But he was destined to better luck this time The written end had indeed disappeared but there was one word left which he had no sooner read than he gave a low cry and prepared to leave for New York on the same train as mister Grey The word was diamond XXI GRIZEL GRIZEL I indulged in some very serious thoughts after mister Grey s departure A fact was borne in upon me to which I had hitherto closed my prejudiced eyes but which I could no longer ignore whatever confusion it brought or however it caused me to change my mind on a subject which had formed one of the strongest bases to the argument by which I had sought to save mister Durand Miss Grey cherished no such distrust of her father as I in my ignorance of their relations had imputed to her in the early hours of my ministrations This you have already seen in my account of their parting Whatever his dread fear or remorse there was no evidence that she felt toward him anything but love and confidence but love and confidence from her to him were in direct contradiction to the doubts I had believed her to have expressed in the half written note handed to missus Fairbrother in the alcove Had I been wrong then in attributing this scrawl to her It began to look so Though forbidden to allow her to speak on the one tabooed subject I had wit enough to know that nothing would keep her from it if the fate of missus Fairbrother occupied any real place in her thoughts Yet when the opportunity was given me one morning of settling this fact beyond all doubt I own that my main feeling was one of dread I feared to see this article in my creed destroyed lest I should lose confidence in the whole Yet conscience bade me face the matter boldly for had I not boasted to myself that my one desire was the truth I allude to the disposition which Miss Grey showed on the morning of the third day to do a little surreptitious writing You remember that a specimen of her handwriting had been asked for by the inspector and once had been earnestly desired by myself Now I seemed likely to have it if I did not open my eyes too widely to the meaning of her seemingly chance requests A little pencil dangled at the end of my watch chain Would I let her see it let her hold it in her hand for a minute it was so like one she used to have Of course I took it off of course I let her retain it a little while in her hand But the pencil was not enough A few minutes later she asked for a book to look at I sometimes let her look at pictures But the book bothered her she would look at it later would I give her something to mark the place that postal over there I gave her the postal She put it in the book and I who understood her thoroughly wondered what excuse she would now find for sending me into the other room She found one very soon and with a heavily beating heart I left her with that pencil and postal A soft laugh from her lips drew me back She was holding up the postal See I have written a line to him Oh you good good nurse to let me You needn t look so alarmed It hasn t hurt me one bit I knew that it had not knew that such an exertion was likely to be more beneficial than hurtful to her or I should have found some excuse for deterring her I endeavored to make my face more natural As she seemed to want me to take the postal in my hand I drew near and took it The address looks very shaky she laughed I think you will have to put it in an envelope I looked at it I could not help it her eye was on me and I could not even prepare my mind for the shock of seeing it like or totally unlike the writing of the warning It was totally unlike so distinctly unlike that it was no longer possible to attribute those lines to her which according to mister Durand s story had caused missus Fairbrother to take off her diamond Why why she cried You actually look pale Are you afraid the doctor will scold us It hasn t hurt me nearly so much as lying here and knowing what he would give for one word from me You are right and I am foolish I answered with all the spirit left in me I should be glad I am glad that you have written these words I will copy the address on an envelope and send it out in the first mail Thank you she murmured giving me back my pencil with a sly smile Now I can sleep I must have roses in my cheeks when papa comes home And she bade fair to have ruddier roses than myself for conscience was working havoc in my breast The theory I had built up with such care the theory I had persisted in urging upon the inspector in spite of his rebuke was slowly crumbling to pieces in my mind with the falling of one of its main pillars With the warning unaccounted for in the manner I have stated there was a weakness in my argument which nothing could make good How could I tell the inspector if ever I should be so happy or so miserable as to meet his eye again Humiliated to the dust I could see no worth now in any of the arguments I had advanced I flew from one extreme to the other and was imputing perfect probity to mister Grey and an honorable if mysterious reason for all his acts when the door opened and he came in Instantly my last doubt vanished I had not expected him to return so soon He was glad to be back that I could see but there was no other gladness in him I had looked for some change in his manner and appearance that is if he returned at all but the one I saw was not a cheerful one even after he had approached his daughter s bedside and found her greatly improved She noticed this and scrutinized him strangely He dropped his eyes and turned to leave the room but was stopped by her loving cry he came back and leaned over her What is it father You are fatigued worried No no quite well he hastily assured her But you are you as well as you seem Indeed yes I am gaining every day See see I shall soon be able to sit up Yesterday I read a few words He started with a side glance at me which took in a table near by on which a little book was lying Oh a book Yes and and Arthur s letters The father flushed lifted himself patted her arm tenderly and hastened into another room Miss Grey s eyes followed him longingly and I heard her give utterance to a soft sigh A few hours before this would have conveyed to my suspicious mind deep and mysterious meanings but I was seeing everything now in a different light and I found myself no longer inclined either to exaggerate or to misinterpret these little marks of filial solicitude Trying to rejoice over the present condition of my mind I was searching in the hidden depths of my nature for the patience of which I stood in such need when every thought and feeling were again thrown into confusion by the receipt of another communication from the inspector in which he stated that something had occurred to bring the authorities round to my way of thinking and that the test with the stiletto was to be made at once Could the irony of fate go further I dropped the letter half read querying if it were my duty to let the inspector know of the flaw I had discovered in my own theory before I proceeded with the attempt I had suggested when I believed in its complete soundness I had not settled the question when I took the letter up again Re reading its opening sentence I was caught by the word something It was a very indefinite one yet was capable of covering a large field It must cover a large field or it could not have produced such a change in the minds of these men conservative from principle and in this instance from discretion I would be satisfied with that word something and quit further thinking I was weary of it The inspector was now taking the initiative and I was satisfied to be his simple instrument and no more Arrived at this conclusion however I read the rest of the letter The test was to go on but under different conditions It was no longer to be made at my own discretion and in the up stairs room it was to be made at luncheon hour and in mister Grey s private dining room where if by any chance mister Grey found himself outraged by the placing of this notorious weapon beside his plate the blame could be laid on the waiter who mistaking his directions had placed it on mister Grey s table when it was meant for Inspector Dalzell s who was lunching in the adjoining room It was I however who was to do the placing With what precautions and under what circumstances will presently appear Fortunately the hour set was very near Otherwise I do not know how I could have endured the continued strain of gazing on my patient s sweet face looking up at me from her pillow with a shadow over its beauty which had not been there before her father s return And that father I could hear him pacing the library floor with a restlessness that struck me as being strangely akin to my own inward anguish of impatience and doubt What was he dreading What was it I had seen darkening his face and disturbing his manner when from time to time he pushed open the communicating door and cast an anxious glance our way only to withdraw again without uttering a word Did he realize that a crisis was approaching that danger menaced him and from me No not the latter for his glance never strayed to me but rested solely on his daughter I was therefore not connected with the disturbance in his thoughts As far as that was concerned I could proceed fearlessly I had not him to dread only the event That I did dread as any one must who saw Miss Grey s face during these painful moments and heard that restless tramp in the room beyond At last the hour struck the hour at which mister Grey always descended to lunch He was punctuality itself and under ordinary circumstances I could depend upon his leaving the room within five minutes of the stroke of one But would he be as prompt to day Was he in the mood for luncheon Would he go down stairs at all Yes for the tramp tramp stopped I heard him approaching his daughter s door for a last look in and managed to escape just in time to procure what I wanted and reach the room below before he came My opportunity was short but I had time to see two things first that the location of his seat had been changed so that his back was to the door leading into the adjoining room secondly that this door was ajar The usual waiter was in the room and showed no surprise at my appearance I having been careful to have it understood that hereafter Miss Grey s appetite was to be encouraged by having her soup served from her father s table by her father s own hands and that I should be there to receive it mister Grey is coming said I approaching the waiter and handing him the stiletto loosely wrapped in tissue paper Will you be kind enough to place this at his plate just as it is A man gave it to me for mister Grey said we were to place it there The waiter suspecting nothing did as he was bidden and I had hardly time to catch up the tray laden with dishes which I saw awaiting me on a side table when mister Grey came in and was ushered to his seat The soup was not there but I advanced with my tray and stood waiting not too near lest the violent beating of my heart should betray me As I did so the waiter disappeared and the door behind us opened Though mister Grey s eye had fallen on the package and I saw him start I darted one glance at the room thus disclosed and saw that it held two tables At one the inspector and some one I did not know sat eating at the other a man alone whose back was to us all and who seemingly was entirely disconnected with the interests of this tragic moment All this I saw in an instant the next my eyes were fixed on mister Grey s face He had reached out his hand to the package and his features showed an emotion I hardly understood What s this he murmured feeling it with wonder I should almost say anger Suddenly he pulled off the wrapper and my heart stood still in expectancy If he quailed and how could he help doing so if guilty what a doubt would be removed from my own breast what an impediment from police action But he did not quail he simply uttered an exclamation of intense anger and laid the weapon back on the table without even taking the precaution of covering it up I think he muttered an oath but there was no fear in it not a particle My disappointment was so great my humiliation so unbounded that forgetting myself in my dismay I staggered back and let the tray with all its contents slip from my hands The crash that followed stopped mister Grey in the act of rising But it did something more It awoke a cry from the adjoining room which I shall never forget While we both started and turned to see from whom this grievous sound had sprung a man came stumbling toward us with his hands before his eyes and this name wild on his lips Grizel Grizel missus Fairbrother s name and the man XXII GUILT Was he Wellgood Sears Who A lover of the woman certainly that was borne in on us by the passion of his cry Grizel Grizel But how here and why such fury in mister Grey s face and such amazement in that of the inspector This question was not to be answered offhand mister Grey advancing laid a finger on the man s shoulder Come said he we will have our conversation in another room The man who in dress and appearance looked oddly out of place in those gorgeous rooms shook off the stupor into which he had fallen and started to follow the Englishman A waiter crossed their track with the soup for our table mister Grey motioned him aside Take that back said he I have some business to transact with this gentleman before I eat I ll ring when I want you Then they entered where I was As the door closed I caught sight of the inspector s face turned earnestly toward me In his eyes I read my duty and girded up my heart as it were to meet what In that moment it was impossible to tell The next enlightened me With a total ignoring of my presence due probably to his great excitement mister Grey turned on his companion the moment he had closed the door and seizing him by the collar cried Fairbrother you villain why have you called on your wife like this Are you murderer as well as thief Fairbrother this man Then who was he who was being nursed back to life on the mountains beyond Santa Fe Sears Anything seemed possible in that moment Meanwhile dropping his hand from the other s throat as suddenly as he had seized it mister Grey caught up the stiletto from the table where he had flung it crying Do you recognize this Ah then I saw guilt In a silence worse than any cry this so called husband of the murdered woman the man on whom no suspicion had fallen the man whom all had thought a thousand miles away at the time of the deed stared at the weapon thrust under his eyes while over his face passed all those expressions of fear abhorrence and detected guilt which fool that I was I had expected to see reflected in response to the same test in mister Grey s equable countenance The surprise and wonder of it held me chained to the spot I was in a state of stupefaction so that I scarcely noted the broken fragments at my feet But the intruder noticed them Wrenching his gaze from the stiletto which mister Grey continued to hold out he pointed to the broken cup and saucer muttering That is what startled me into this betrayal the noise of breaking china I can not bear it since He stopped bit his lip and looked around him with an air of sudden bravado Since you dropped the cups at your wife s feet in mister Ramsdell s alcove finished mister Grey with admirable self possession I see that explanations from myself are not in order was the grim retort launched with the bitterest sarcasm Then as the full weight of his position crushed in on him his face assumed an aspect startling to my unaccustomed eyes and thrusting his hand into his pocket he drew forth a small box which he placed in mister Grey s hands The Great Mogul he declared simply It was the first time I had heard this diamond so named Without a word that gentleman opened the box took one look at the contents assumed a satisfied air and carefully deposited the recovered gem in his own pocket As his eyes returned to the man before him all the passion of the latter burst forth It was not for that I killed her cried he It was because she defied me and flaunted her disobedience in my very face I would do it again yet Here his voice broke and it was in a different tone and with a total change of manner he added You stand appalled at my depravity You have not lived my life Then quickly and with a touch of sullenness You suspected me because of the stiletto It was a mistake using that stiletto Otherwise the plan was good I doubt if you know now how I found my way into the alcove possibly under your very eyes certainly under the eyes of many who knew me I do not It is enough that you entered it that you confess your guilt Here mister Grey stretched his hand toward the electric button No it is not enough The tone was fierce authoritative Do not ring the bell not yet I have a fancy to tell you how I managed that little affair Glancing about he caught up from a near by table a small brass tray Emptying it of its contents he turned on us with drawn down features and an obsequious air so opposed to his natural manner that it was as if another man stood before us Pardon my black tie he muttered holding out the tray toward mister Grey Wellgood The room turned with me It was he then the great financier the multimillionaire the husband of the magnificent Grizel who had entered mister Ramsdell s house as a waiter mister Grey did not show surprise but he made a gesture when instantly the tray was thrown aside and the man resumed his ordinary aspect I see you understand me he cried I who have played host at many a ball passed myself off that night as one of the waiters I came and went and no one noticed me It is such a natural sight to see a waiter passing ices that my going in and out of the alcove did not attract the least attention I never look at waiters when I attend balls I never look higher than their trays No one looked at me higher than my tray I held the stiletto under the tray and when I struck her she threw up her hands and they hit the tray and the cups fell I have never been able to bear the sound of breaking china since I loved her A gasp and he recovered himself That is neither here nor there he muttered You summoned me under threat to present myself at your door to day I have done so I meant to restore you your diamond simply It has become worthless to me But fate exacted more Surprise forced my secret from me That young lady with her damnable awkwardness has put my head in a noose But do not think to hold it there I did not risk this interview without precautions I assure you and when I leave this hotel it will be as a free man With one of his rapid changes wonderful and inexplicable to me at the moment he turned toward me with a bow saying courteously enough We will excuse the young lady Next moment the barrel of a pistol gleamed in his hand The moment was critical mister Grey stood directly in the line of fire and the audacious man who thus held him at his mercy was scarcely a foot from the door leading into the hall Marking the desperation of his look and the steadiness of his finger on the trigger I expected to see mister Grey recoil and the man escape But mister Grey held his own though he made no move and did not venture to speak Nerved by his courage I summoned up all my own This man must not escape nor must mister Grey suffer The pistol directed against him must be diverted to myself Such amends were due one whose good name I had so deeply if secretly insulted I had but to scream to call out for the inspector but a remembrance of the necessity we were now under of preserving our secret of keeping from mister Grey the fact that he had been under surveillance was even at that moment surrounded by the police deterred me and I threw myself toward the bell instead crying out that I would raise the house if he moved and laid my finger on the button The pistol swerved my way The face above it smiled I watched that smile Before it broadened to its full extent I pressed the button Fairbrother stared dropped his pistol and burst forth with these two words Brave girl The tone I can never convey Then he made for the door As he laid his hand on the knob he called back I have been in worse straits than this But he never had when he opened the door he found himself face to face with the inspector XXIII THE GREAT MOGUL Later it was all explained mister Grey looking like another man came into the room where I was endeavoring to soothe his startled daughter and devour in secret my own joy Taking the sweet girl in his arms he said with a calm ignoring of my presence at which I secretly smiled This is the happiest moment of my existence Helen I feel as if I had recovered you from the brink of the grave Me Why I have never been so ill as that I know but I have felt as if you were doomed ever since I heard or thought I heard in this city and under no ordinary circumstances the peculiar cry which haunts our house on the eve of any great misfortune I shall not apologize for my fears you know that I have good cause for them but to day only to day I have heard from the lips of the most arrant knave I have ever known that this cry sprang from himself with intent to deceive me He knew my weakness knew the cry he was in Darlington Manor when Cecilia died and wishing to startle me into dropping something which I held made use of his ventriloquial powers he had been a mountebank once poor wretch and with such effect that I have not been a happy man since in spite of your daily improvement and continued promise of recovery But I am happy now relieved and joyful and this miserable being would you like to hear his story Are you strong enough for anything so tragic He is a thief and a murderer but he has feelings and his life has been a curious one and strangely interwoven with ours Do you care to hear about it He is the man who stole our diamond My patient uttered a little cry Oh tell me she entreated excited but not unhealthfully while I was in an anguish of curiosity I could with difficulty conceal mister Grey turned with courtesy toward me and asked if a few family details would bore me I smiled and assured him to the contrary At which he settled himself in the chair he liked best and began a tale which I will permit myself to present to you complete and from other points of view than his own Some five years before one of the great diamonds of the world was offered for sale in an Eastern market mister Grey who stopped at no expense in the gratification of his taste in this direction immediately sent his agent to Egypt to examine this stone If the agent discovered it to be all that was claimed for it and within the reach of a wealthy commoner s purse he was to buy it Upon inspection it was found to be all that was claimed with one exception In the center of one of the facets was a flaw but as this was considered to mark the diamond and rather add to than detract from its value as a traditional stone with many historical associations it was finally purchased by mister Grey and placed among his treasures in his manor house in Kent Never a suspicious man he took delight in exhibiting this acquisition to such of his friends and acquaintances as were likely to feel any interest in it and it was not an uncommon thing for him to allow it to pass from hand to hand while he pottered over his other treasures and displayed this and that to such as had no eyes for the diamond It was after one such occasion that he found on taking the stone in his hand to replace it in the safe he had had built for it in one of his cabinets that it did not strike his eye with its usual force and brilliancy and on examining it closely he discovered the absence of the telltale flaw Struck with dismay he submitted it to a still more rigid inspection when he found that what he held was not even a diamond but a worthless bit of glass which had been substituted by some cunning knave for his invaluable gem For the moment his humiliation almost equaled his sense of loss he had been so often warned of the danger he ran in letting so priceless an object pass around under all eyes but his own His wife and friends had prophesied some such loss as this not once but many times and he had always laughed at their fears saying that he knew his friends and there was not a scamp amongst them But now he saw it proved that even the intuition of a man well versed in human nature is not always infallible and ashamed of his past laxness and more ashamed yet of the doubts which this experience called up in regard to all his friends he shut up the false stone with his usual care and buried his loss in his own bosom till he could sift his impressions and recall with some degree of probability the circumstances under which this exchange could have been made It had not been made that evening Of this he was positive The only persons present on this occasion were friends of such standing and repute that suspicion in their regard was simply monstrous When and to whom then had he shown the diamond last Alas it had been a long month since he had shown the jewel Cecilia his youngest daughter had died in the interim therefore his mind had not been on jewels A month time for his precious diamond to have been carried back to the East Time for it to have been recut Surely it was lost to him for ever unless he could immediately locate the person who had robbed him of it But this promised difficulties He could not remember just what persons he had entertained on that especial day in his little hall of cabinets and when he did succeed in getting a list of them from his butler he was by no means sure that it included the full number of his guests His own memory was execrable and in short he had but few facts to offer to the discreet agent sent up from Scotland Yard one morning to hear his complaint and act secretly in his interests He could give him carte blanche to carry on his inquiries in the diamond market but little else And while this seemed to satisfy the agent it did not lead to any gratifying result to himself and he had thoroughly made up his mind to swallow his loss and say nothing about it when one day a young cousin of his living in great style in an adjoining county informed him that in some mysterious way he had lost from his collection of arms a unique and highly prized stiletto of Italian workmanship Startled by this coincidence mister Grey ventured upon a question or two which led to his cousin s confiding to him the fact that this article had disappeared after a large supper given by him to a number of friends and gentlemen from London This piece of knowledge still further coinciding with his own experience caused mister Grey to ask for a list of his guests in the hope of finding among them one who had been in his own house His cousin quite unsuspicious of the motives underlying this request hastened to write out this list and together they pored over the names crossing out such as were absolutely above suspicion When they had reached the end of the list but two names remained uncrossed One was that of a rattle pated youth who had come in the wake of a highly reputed connection of theirs and the other that of an American tourist who gave all the evidences of great wealth and had presented letters to leading men in London which had insured him attentions not usually accorded to foreigners This man s name was Fairbrother and the moment mister Grey heard it he recalled the fact that an American with a peculiar name but with a reputation for wealth had been among his guests on the suspected evening Hiding the effect produced upon him by this discovery he placed his finger on this name and begged his cousin to look up its owner s antecedents and present reputation in America but not content with this he sent his own agent over to New York whither as he soon learned this gentleman had returned The result was an apparent vindication of the suspected American He was found to be a well known citizen of the great metropolis moving in the highest circles and with a reputation for wealth won by an extraordinary business instinct To be sure he had not always enjoyed these distinctions Like many another self made man he had risen from a menial position in a Western mining camp to be the owner of a mine himself and so up through the various gradations of a successful life to a position among the foremost business men of New York In all these changes he had maintained a name for honest if not generous dealing He lived in great style had married and was known to have but one extravagant fancy This was for the unique and curious in art a taste which if report spoke true cost him many thousands each year This last was the only clause in the report which pointed in any way toward this man being the possible abstractor of the Great Mogul as mister Grey s famous diamond was called and the latter was too just a man and too much of a fancier in this line himself to let a fact of this kind weigh against the favorable nature of the rest So he recalled his agent double locked his cabinets and continued to confine his display of valuables to articles which did not suggest jewels Thus three years passed when one day he heard mention made of a wonderful diamond which had been seen in New York From its description he gathered that it must be the one surreptitiously abstracted from his cabinet and when after some careful inquiries he learned that the name of its possessor was Fairbrother he awoke to his old suspicions and determined to probe this matter to the bottom But secretly He still had too much consideration to attack a man in high position without full proof Knowing of no one he could trust with so delicate an inquiry as this had now become he decided to undertake it himself and for this purpose embraced the first opportunity to cross the water He took his daughter with him because he had resolved never to let his one remaining child out of his sight But she knew nothing of his plans or reason for travel No one did Indeed only his lawyer and the police were aware of the loss of his diamond His first surprise on landing was to learn that mister Fairbrother of whose marriage he had heard had quarreled with his wife and that in the separation which had occurred the diamond had fallen to her share and was consequently in her possession at the present moment This changed matters and mister Grey s only thought now was to surprise her with the diamond on her person and by one glance assure himself that it was indeed the Great Mogul Since missus Fairbrother was reported to be a beautiful woman and a great society belle he saw no reason why he should not meet her publicly and that very soon He therefore accepted invitations and attended theaters and balls though his daughter had suffered from her voyage and was not able to accompany him But alas he soon learned that missus Fairbrother was never seen with her diamond and one evening after an introduction at the opera that she never talked about it So there he was balked on the very threshold of his enterprise and recognizing the fact was preparing to take his now seriously ailing daughter south when he received an invitation to a ball of such a select character that he decided to remain for it in the hope that missus Fairbrother would be tempted to put on all her splendor for so magnificent a function and thus gratify him with a sight of his own diamond During the days that intervened he saw her several times and very soon decided that in spite of her reticence in regard to this gem she was not sufficiently in her husband s confidence to know the secret of its real ownership This encouraged him to attempt piquing her into wearing the diamond on this occasion He talked of precious stones and finally of his own declaring that he had a connoisseur s eye for a fine diamond but had seen none as yet in America to compete with a specimen or two he had in his own cabinets Her eye flashed at this and though she said nothing he felt sure that her presence at mister Ramsdell s house would be enlivened by her great jewel So much for mister Grey s attitude in this matter up to the night of the ball It is interesting enough but that of Abner Fairbrother is more interesting still and much more serious His was indeed the hand which had abstracted the diamond from mister Grey s collection Under ordinary conditions he was an honest man He prized his good name and would not willingly risk it but he had little real conscience and once his passions were aroused nothing short of the object desired would content him At once forceful and subtle he had at his command infinite resources which his wandering and eventful life had heightened almost to the point of genius He saw this stone and at once felt an inordinate desire to possess it He had coveted other men s treasures before but not as he coveted this What had been longing in other cases was mania in this There was a woman in America whom he loved She was beautiful and she was splendor loving To see her with this glory on her breast would be worth almost any risk which his imagination could picture at the moment Before the diamond had left his hand he had made up his mind to have it for his own He knew that it could not be bought so he set about obtaining it by an act he did not hesitate to acknowledge to himself as criminal But he did not act without precautions Having a keen eye and a proper sense or size and color he carried away from his first view of it a true image of the stone and when he was next admitted to mister Grey s cabinet room he had provided the means for deceiving the owner whose character he had sounded He might have failed in his daring attempt if he had not been favored by a circumstance no one could have foreseen A daughter of the house Cecilia by name lay critically ill at the time and mister Grey s attention was more or less distracted Still the probabilities are that he would have noticed something amiss with the stone when he came to restore it to its place if just as he took it in his hand there had not risen in the air outside a weird and wailing cry which at once seized upon the imagination of the dozen gentlemen present and so nearly prostrated their host that he thrust the box he held unopened into the safe and fell upon his knees a totally unnerved man crying The banshee the banshee My daughter will die Another hand than his locked the safe and dropped the key into the distracted father s pocket Thus a superhuman daring conjoined with a special intervention of fate had made the enterprise a successful one and Fairbrother believing more than ever in his star carried this invaluable jewel back with him to New York The stiletto well the taking of that was a folly for which he had never ceased to blush He had not stolen it he would not steal so inconsiderable an object He had merely put it in his pocket when he saw it forgotten passed over given to him as it were That the risk contrary to that involved in the taking of the diamond was far in excess of the gratification obtained he realized almost immediately but having made the break and acquired the curio he spared himself all further thought or the consequences and presently resumed his old life in New York none the worse to all appearances for these escapades from virtue and his usual course of fair and open dealing But he was soon the worse from jealousy of the wife which his new possession had possibly won for him She had answered all his expectations as mistress of his home and the exponent of his wealth and for a year nay for two he had been perfectly happy Indeed he had been more than that he had been triumphant especially on that memorable evening when after a cautious delay of months he had dared to pin that unapproachable sparkler to her breast and present her thus bedecked to the smart set her whom his talents and especially his far reaching business talents had made his own Recalling the old days of barter and sale across the pine counter in Colorado he felt that his star rode high and for a time was satisfied with his wife s magnificence and the prestige she gave his establishment But pride is not all even to a man of his daring ambition Gradually he began to realize first that she was indifferent to him next that she despised him and lastly that she hated him She had dozens at her feet any of whom was more agreeable to her than her own husband and though he could not put his finger on any definite fault he soon wearied of a beauty that only glowed for others and made up his mind to part with her rather than let his heart be eaten out by unappeasable longing for what his own good sense told him would never be his Yet being naturally generous he was satisfied with a separation and finding it impossible to think of her as other than extravagantly fed waited on and clothed he allowed her a good share of his fortune with the one proviso that she should not disgrace him But the diamond she stole or rather carried off in her naturally high handed manner with the rest of her jewels He had never given it to hen She knew the value he set on it but not how he came by it and would have worn it quite freely if he had not very soon given her to understand that the pleasure of doing so ceased when she left his house As she could not be seen with it without occasioning public remark she was forced though much against her will to heed his wishes and enjoy its brilliancy in private But once when he was out of town she dared to appear with this fortune on her breast and again while on a visit West and her husband heard of it mister Fairbrother had had the jewel set to suit him not in Florence as Sears had said but by a skilful workman he had picked up in great poverty in a remote corner of Williamsburg Always in dread of some complication he had provided himself with a second facsimile in paste this time of an astonishing brightness and this facsimile he had had set precisely like the true stone Then he gave the workman a thousand dollars and sent him back to Switzerland This imitation in paste he showed nobody but he kept it always in his pocket why he hardly knew Meantime he had one confidant not of his crime but of his sentiments toward his wife and the determination he had secretly made to proceed to extremities if she continued to disobey him This was a man of his own age or older who had known him in his early days and had followed all his fortunes He had been the master of Fairbrother then but he was his servant now and as devoted to his interests as if they were his own which in a way they were For eighteen years he had stood at the latter s right hand satisfied to look no further but for the last three his glances had strayed a foot or two beyond his master and taken in his master s wife The feelings which this man had for missus Fairbrother were peculiar She was a mere adjunct to her great lord but she was a very gorgeous one and while he could not imagine himself doing anything to thwart him whose bread he ate and to whose rise he had himself contributed yet if he could remain true to him without injuring he he would account himself happy The day came when he had to decide between them and against all chances against his own preconceived notion of what he would do under these circumstances he chose to consider her This day came when in the midst of growing complacency and an intense interest in some new scheme which demanded all his powers Abner Fairbrother learned from the papers that mister Grey of English Parliamentary fame had arrived in New York on an indefinite visit As no cause was assigned for the visit beyond a natural desire on the part of this eminent statesman to see this great country mister Fairbrother s fears reached a sudden climax and he saw himself ruined and for ever disgraced if the diamond now so unhappily out of his hands should fall under the eyes of its owner whose seeming quiet under its loss had not for a moment deceived him Waiting only long enough to make sure that the distinguished foreigner was likely to accept social attentions and so in all probability would be brought in contact with missus Fairbrother he sent her by his devoted servant a peremptory message in which he demanded back his diamond and upon her refusing to heed this followed it up by another in which he expressly stated that if she took it out of the safe deposit in which he had been told she was wise enough to keep it or wore it so much as once during the next three months she would pay for her presumption with her life This was no idle threat though she chose to regard it as such laughing in the old servant s face and declaring that she would run the risk if the notion seized her But the notion did not seem to seize her at once and her husband was beginning to take heart when he heard of the great ball about to be given by the Ramsdells and realized that if she were going to be tempted to wear the diamond at all it would be at this brilliant function given in honor of the one man he had most cause to fear in the whole world Sears seeing the emotion he was under watched him closely They had both been on the point of starting for New Mexico to visit a mine in which mister Fairbrother was interested and he waited with inconceivable anxiety to see if his master would change his plans It was while he was in this condition of mind that he was seen to shake his fist at missus Fairbrother s passing figure a menace naturally interpreted as directed against her but which if we know the man was rather the expression of his anger against the husband who could rebuke and threaten so beautiful a creature Meanwhile mister Fairbrother s preparations went on and three weeks before the ball they started mister Fairbrother had business in Chicago and business in Denver It was two weeks and more before he reached La Junta Sears counted the days At La Junta they had a long conversation or rather mister Fairbrother talked and Sears listened The sum of what he said was this He had made up his mind to have back his diamond He was going to New York to get it He was going alone and as he wished no one to know that he had gone or that his plans had been in any way interrupted the other was to continue on to El Moro and passing himself off as Fairbrother hire a room at the hotel and shut himself up in it for ten days on any plea his ingenuity might suggest If at the end of that time Fairbrother should rejoin him well and good They would go on together to Santa Fe But if for any reason the former should delay his return then Sears was to exercise his own judgment as to the length of time he should retain his borrowed personality also as to the advisability of pushing on to the mine and entering on the work there as had been planned between them Sears knew what all this meant He understood what was in his master s mind as well as if he had been taken into his full confidence and openly accepted his part of the business with seeming alacrity even to the point of supplying Fairbrother with suitable references as to the ability of one James Wellgood to fill a waiter s place at fashionable functions It was not the first he had given him Seventeen years before he had written the same minus the last phrase That was when he was the master and Fairbrother the man But he did not mean to play the part laid out for him for all his apparent acquiescence He began by following the other s instructions He exchanged clothes with him and other necessaries and took the train for La Junta at or near the time that Fairbrother started east But once at El Moro once registered there as Abner Fairbrother from New York he took a different course from the one laid out for him a course which finally brought him into his master s wake and landed him at the same hour in New York This is what he did Instead of shutting himself up in his room he expressed an immediate desire to visit some neighboring mines and procuring a good horse started off at the first available moment He rode north lost himself in the mountains and wandered till he found a guide intelligent enough to lend himself to his plans To this guide he confided his horse for the few days he intended to be gone paying him well and promising him additional money if during his absence he succeeded in circulating the report that he Abner Fairbrother had gone deep into the mountains bound for such and such a camp Having thus provided an alibi not only for himself but for his master too in case he should need it he took the direct road to the nearest railway station and started on his long ride east He did not expect to overtake the man he had been personating but fortune was kinder than is usual in such cases and owing to a delay caused by some accident to a freight train he arrived in Chicago within a couple of hours of mister Fairbrother and started out of that city on the same train But not on the same car Sears had caught a glimpse of Fairbrother on the platform and was careful to keep out of his sight This was easy enough He bought a compartment in the sleeper and stayed in it till they arrived at the Grand Central Station Then he hastened out and fortune favoring him with another glimpse of the man in whose movements he was so interested followed him into the streets Fairbrother had shaved off his beard before leaving El Moro Sears had shaved his off on the train Both were changed the former the more owing to a peculiarity of his mouth which up till now he had always thought best to cover Sears therefore walked behind him without fear and was almost at his heels when this owner of one of New York s most notable mansions entered with a spruce air the doors of a prominent caterer Understanding the plot now and having everything to fear for his mistress he walked the streets for some hours in a state of great indecision Then he went up to her apartment But he had no sooner come within sight of it than a sense of disloyalty struck him and he slunk away only to come sidling back when it was too late and she had started for the ball Trembling with apprehension but still strangely divided in his impulses wishing to serve master and mistress both without disloyalty to the one or injury to the other he hesitated and argued with himself till his fears for the latter drove him to mister Ramsdell s house The night was a stormy one The heaviest snow of the season was falling with a high gale blowing down the Sound As he approached the house which as we know is one of the modern ones in the Riverside district he felt his heart fail him But as he came nearer and got the full effect of glancing lights seductive music and the cheery bustle of crowding carriages he saw in his mind s eye such a picture of his beautiful mistress threatened unknown to herself in a quarter she little realized that he lost all sense of what had hitherto deterred him Making then and there his great choice he looked about for the entrance with the full intention of seeing and warning her But this he presently perceived was totally impracticable He could neither go to her nor expect her to come to him meanwhile time was passing and if his master was there The thought made his head dizzy and situated as he was among the carriages he might have been run over in his confusion if his eyes had not suddenly fallen on a lighted window the shade of which had been inadvertently left up Within this window which was only a few feet above his head stood the glowing image of a woman clad in pink and sparkling with jewels Her face was turned from him but he recognized her splendor as that of the one woman who could never be too gorgeous for his taste and alive to this unexpected opportunity he made for this window with the intention of shouting up to her and so attracting her attention But this proved futile and driven at last to the end of his resources he tore out a slip of paper from his note book and in the dark and with the blinding snow in his eyes wrote the few broken sentences which he thought would best warn her without compromising his master The means he took to reach her with this note I have already related As soon as he saw it in her hands he fled the place and took the first train west He was in a pitiable condition when three days later he reached the small station from which he had originally set out The haste the exposure the horror of the crime he had failed to avert had undermined his hitherto excellent constitution and the symptoms of a serious illness were beginning to make themselves manifest But he like his indomitable master possessed a great fund of energy and willpower He saw that if he was to save Abner Fairbrother and now that missus Fairbrother was dead his old master was all the world to him he must make Fairbrother s alibi good by carrying on the deception as planned by the latter and getting as soon as possible to his camp in the New Mexico mountains He knew that he would have strength to do this and he went about it without sparing himself Making his way into the mountains he found the guide and his horse at the place agreed upon and paying the guide enough for his services to insure a quiet tongue rode back toward El Moro where he was met and sent on to Santa Fe as already related Such is the real explanation of the well nigh unintelligible scrawl found in missus Fairbrother s hand after her death As to the one which left Miss Grey s bedside for this same house it was alike in the writing and sending the loving freak of a very sick but tender hearted girl She had noted the look with which mister Grey had left her and in her delirious state thought that a line in her own hand would convince him of her good condition and make it possible for him to enjoy the evening She was however too much afraid of her nurse to write it openly and though we never found that scrawl it was doubtless not very different in appearance from the one with which I had confounded it The man to whom it was intrusted stopped for too many warming drinks on his way for it ever to reach mister Ramsdell s house He did not even return home that night and when he did put in an appearance the next morning he was dismissed This takes me back to the ball and missus Fairbrother She had never had much fear of her husband till she received his old servant s note in the peculiar manner already mentioned This coming through the night and the wet and with all the marks of hurry upon it did impress her greatly and led her to take the first means which offered of ridding herself of her dangerous ornament The story of this we know Meanwhile a burning heart and a scheming brain were keeping up their deadly work a few paces off under the impassive aspect and active movements of the caterer s newly hired waiter Abner Fairbrother whose real character no one had ever been able to sound unless it was the man who had known him in his days of struggle was one of those dangerous men who can conceal under a still brow and a noiseless manner the most violent passions and the most desperate resolves He was angry with his wife who was deliberately jeopardizing his good name and he had come there to kill her if he found her flaunting the diamond in mister Grey s eyes and though no one could have detected any change in his look and manner as he passed through the room where these two were standing the doom of that fair woman was struck when he saw the eager scrutiny and indescribable air of recognition with which this long defrauded gentleman eyed his own diamond He had meant to attack her openly seize the diamond fling it at mister Grey s feet and then kill himself That had been his plan But when he found after a round or two among the guests that nobody looked at him and nobody recognized the well known millionaire in the automaton like figure with the formally arranged whiskers and sleekly combed hair colder purposes intervened and he asked himself if it would not be possible to come upon her alone strike his blow possess himself of the diamond and make for parts unknown before his identity could be discovered He loved life even without the charm cast over it by this woman Its struggles and its hard bought luxuries fascinated him If mister Grey suspected him why mister Grey was English and he a resourceful American If it came to an issue the subtle American would win if mister Grey were not able to point to the flaw which marked this diamond as his own And this Fairbrother had provided against and would succeed in if he could hold his passions in check and be ready with all his wit when matters reached a climax Such were the thoughts and such the plans of the quiet attentive man who with his tray laden with coffee and ices came and went an unnoticed unit among twenty other units similarly quiet and similarly attentive He waited on lady after lady and when on the reissuing of mister Durand from the alcove he passed in there with his tray and his two cups of coffee nobody heeded and nobody remembered It was all over in a minute and he came out still unnoted and went to the supper room for more cups of coffee But that minute had set its seal on his heart for ever She was sitting there alone with her side to the entrance so that he had to pass around in order to face her Her elegance and a certain air she had of remoteness from the scene of which she was the glowing center when she smiled awed him and made his hand loosen a little on the slender stiletto he held close against the bottom of the tray But such resolution does not easily yield and his fingers soon tightened again this time with a deadly grip He had expected to meet the flash of the diamond as he bent over her and dreaded doing so for fear it would attract his eye from her face and so cost him the sight of that startled recognition which would give the desired point to his revenge But the tray as he held it shielded her breast from view and when he lowered it to strike his blow he thought of nothing but aiming so truly as to need no second blow He had had his experience in those old years in a mining camp and he did not fear failure in this What he did fear was her utterance of some cry possibly his name But she was stunned with horror and did not shriek horror of him whose eyes she met with her glassy and staring ones as he slowly drew forth the weapon Why he drew it forth instead of leaving it in her breast he could not say Possibly because it gave him his moment of gloating revenge When in another instant her hands flew up and the tray tipped and the china fell the revulsion came and his eyes opened to two facts the instrument of death was still in his grasp and the diamond on whose possession he counted was gone from his wife s breast It was a horrible moment Voices could be heard approaching the alcove laughing voices that in an instant would take on the note of horror And the music ah how low it had sunk as if to give place to the dying murmur he now heard issuing from her lips But he was a man of iron Thrusting the stiletto into the first place that offered he drew the curtains over the staring windows then slid out with his tray calm speckless and attentive as ever dead to thought dead to feeling but aware quite aware in the secret depths of his being that something besides his wife had been killed that night and that sleep and peace of mind and all pleasure in the past were gone for ever It was not he I saw enter the alcove and come out with news of the crime He left this role to one whose antecedents could better bear investigation His part was to play with just the proper display of horror and curiosity the ordinary menial brought face to face with a crime in high life He could do this He could even sustain his share in the gossip and for this purpose kept near the other waiters The absence of the diamond was all that troubled him That brought him at times to the point of vertigo Had mister Grey recognized and claimed it If so he Abner Fairbrother must remain James Wellgood the waiter indefinitely This would require more belief in his star than ever he had had yet But as the moments passed and no contradiction was given to the universally received impression that the same hand which had struck the blow had taken the diamond even this cause of anxiety left his breast and he faced people with more and more courage till the moment when he suddenly heard that the diamond had been found in the possession of a man perfectly strange to him and saw the inspector pass it over into the hands of mister Grey Instantly he realized that the crisis of his fate was on him If mister Grey were given time to identify this stone he Abner Fairbrother was lost and the diamond as well Could he prevent this There was but one way and that way he took Making use of his ventriloquial powers he had spent a year on the public stage in those early days playing just such tricks as these he raised the one cry which he knew would startle mister Grey more than any other in the world and when the diamond fell from his hand as he knew it would he rushed forward and in the act of picking it up made that exchange which not only baffled the suspicions of the statesman but restored to him the diamond for whose possession he was now ready to barter half his remaining days Meanwhile mister Grey had had his own anxieties During this whole long evening he had been sustained by the conviction that the diamond of which he had caught but one passing glimpse was the Great Mogul of his once famous collection So sure was he of this that at one moment he found himself tempted to enter the alcove demand a closer sight of the diamond and settle the question then and there He even went so far as to take in his hands the two cups of coffee which should serve as his excuse for this intrusion but his naturally chivalrous instincts again intervened and he set the cups down again this I did not see and turned his steps toward the library with the intention of writing her a note instead But though he found paper and pen to hand he could find no words for so daring a request and he came back into the hall only to hear that the woman he had contemplated addressing had just been murdered and her great jewel stolen The shock was too much and as there was no leaving the house then he retreated again to the library where he devoured his anxieties in silence till hope revived again at sight of the diamond in the inspector s hand only to vanish under the machinations of one he did not even recognize when he took the false jewel from his hand The American had outwitted the Englishman and the triumph of evil was complete Or so it seemed But if the Englishman is slow he is sure Thrown off the track for the time being mister Grey had only to see a picture of the stiletto in the papers to feel again that despite all appearances Fairbrother was really not only at the bottom of the thefts from which his cousin and himself had suffered but of this frightful murder as well He made no open move he was a stranger in a strange land and much disturbed besides by his fears for his daughter but he started a secret inquiry through his old valet whom he ran across in the street and whose peculiar adaptability for this kind of work he well knew The aim of these inquiries was to determine if the person whom two physicians and three assistants were endeavoring to nurse back to health on the top of a wild plateau in a remote district of New Mexico was the man he had once entertained at his own board in England and the adventures thus incurred would make a story in itself But the result seemed to justify them Word came after innumerable delays very trying to mister Grey that he was not the same though he bore the name of Fairbrother and was considered by every one around there to be Fairbrother mister Grey ignorant of the relations between the millionaire master and his man which sometimes led to the latter s personifying the former was confident of his own mistake and bitterly ashamed of his own suspicions But a second message set him right A deception was being practised down in New Mexico and this was how his spy had found it out Certain letters which went into the sick tent were sent away again and always to one address He had learned the address It was that of James Wellgood C Maine If mister Grey would look up this Wellgood he would doubtless learn something of the man he was so interested in This gave mister Grey personally something to do for he would trust no second party with a message involving the honor of a possibly innocent man As the place was accessible by railroad and his duty clear he took the journey involved and succeeded in getting a glimpse in the manner we know of the man James Wellgood This time he recognized Fairbrother and satisfied from the circumstances of the moment that he would be making no mistake in accusing him of having taken the Great Mogul he intercepted him in his flight as you have already read and demanded the immediate return of his great diamond And Fairbrother We shall have to go back a little to bring his history up to this critical instant When he realized the trend of public opinion when he saw a perfectly innocent man committed to the Tombs for his crime he was first astonished and then amused at what he continued to regard as the triumph of his star But he did not start for El Moro wise as he felt it would be to do so Something of the fascination usual with criminals kept him near the scene of his crime that and an anxiety to see how Sears would conduct himself in the Southwest That Sears had followed him to New York knew his crime and was the strongest witness against him was as far from his thoughts as that he owed him the warning which had all but balked him of his revenge When therefore he read in the papers that Abner Fairbrother had been found sick in his camp at Santa Fe he felt that nothing now stood in the way of his entering on the plans he had framed for ultimate escape On his departure from El Moro he had taken the precaution of giving Sears the name of a certain small town on the coast of Maine where his mail was to be sent in case of a great emergency He had chosen this town for two reasons First because he knew all about it having had a young man from there in his employ secondly because of its neighborhood to the inlet where an old launch of his had been docked for the winter Always astute always precautionary he had given orders to have this launch floated and provisioned so that now he had only to send word to the captain to have at his command the best possible means of escape Meanwhile he must make good his position in C He did it in the way we know Satisfied that the only danger he need fear was the discovery of the fraud practised in New Mexico he had confidence enough in Sears even in his present disabled state to take his time and make himself solid with the people of C while waiting for the ice to disappear from the harbor This accomplished and cruising made possible he took a flying trip to New York to secure such papers and valuables as he wished to carry out of the country with him They were in safe deposit but that safe deposit was in his strong room in the center of his house in Eighty sixth Street a room which you will remember in connection with Sweetwater s adventure To enter his own door with his own latch key in the security and darkness of a stormy night seemed to this self confident man a matter of no great risk Nor did he find it so He reached his strong room procured his securities and was leaving the house without having suffered an alarm when some instinct of self preservation suggested to him the advisability of arming himself with a pistol His own was in Maine but he remembered where Sears kept his he had seen it often enough in that old trunk he had brought with him from the Sierras He accordingly went up stairs to the steward s room found the pistol and became from that instant invincible But in restoring the articles he had pulled out he came across a photograph of his wife and lost himself over it and went mad as we have heard the detective tell That later he should succeed in trapping this detective and should leave the house without a qualm as to his fate shows what sort of man he was in moments of extreme danger I doubt from what I have heard of him since if he ever gave two thoughts to the man after he had sprung the double lock on him which considering his extreme ignorance of who his victim was or what relation he bore to his own fate was certainly remarkable Back again in C he made his final preparations for departure He had already communicated with the captain of the launch who may or may not have known his passenger s real name He says that he supposed him to be some agent of mister Fairbrother s that among the first orders he received from that gentleman was one to the effect that he was to follow the instructions of one Wellgood as if they came from himself that he had done so and not till he had mister Fairbrother on board had he known whom he was expected to carry into other waters However there are many who do not believe the captain Fairbrother had a genius for rousing devotion in the men who worked for him and probably this man was another Sears To leave speculation all was in train then and freedom but a quarter of a mile away when the boat he was in was stopped by another and he heard mister Grey s voice demanding the jewel The shock was severe and he had need of all the nerve which had hitherto made his career so prosperous to sustain the encounter with the calmness which alone could carry off the situation Declaring that the diamond was in New York he promised to restore it if the other would make the sacrifice worth while by continuing to preserve his hitherto admirable silence concerning him mister Grey responded by granting him just twenty four hours and when Fairbrother said the time was not long enough and allowed his hand to steal ominously to his breast he repeated still more decisively Twenty four hours The ex miner honored bravery Withdrawing his hand from his breast he brought out a note book instead of a pistol and in a tone fully as determined replied The diamond is in a place inaccessible to any one but myself If you will put your name to a promise not to betray me for the thirty six hours I ask I will sign one to restore you the diamond before one thirty o clock on Friday I will said mister Grey So the promises were written and duly exchanged mister Grey returned to New York and Fairbrother boarded his launch The diamond really was in New York and to him it seemed more politic to use it as a means of securing mister Grey s permanent silence than to fly the country leaving a man behind him who knew his secret and could precipitate his doom with a word He would therefore go to New York play his last great card and if he lost be no worse off than he was now He did not mean to lose But he had not calculated on any inherent weakness in himself had not calculated on Providence A dish tumbled and with it fell into chaos the fair structure of his dreams With the cry of Grizel Grizel he gave up his secret his hopes and his life There was no retrieval possible after that The star of Abner Fairbrother had set mister Grey and his daughter learned very soon of my relations to mister Durand but through the precautions of the inspector and my own powers of self control no suspicion has ever crossed their minds of the part I once played in the matter of the stiletto This was amply proved by the invitation mister Durand and I have just received to spend our honeymoon at Darlington Manor End of Project Gutenberg s The Woman in the Alcove by Anna Katharine Green END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE
