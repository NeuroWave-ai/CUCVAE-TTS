none	none	a decade later a proud tyrant raised an undying monument to the nation s glory and his own vanity During the greater part of the day the guillotine had been kept busy at its ghastly work all that France had boasted of in the past centuries of ancient names and blue blood had paid toll to her desire for liberty and for fraternity The carnage had only ceased at this late hour of the day because there were other more interesting sights for the people to witness a little while before the final closing of the barricades for the night And so the crowd rushed away from the Place de la Greve and made for the various barricades in order to watch this interesting and amusing sight It was to be seen every day for those aristos were such fools They were traitors to the people of course all of them men women and children who happened to be descendants of the great men who since the Crusades had made the glory of France her old NOBLESSE Their ancestors had oppressed the people had crushed them under the scarlet heels of their dainty buckled shoes and now the people had become the rulers of France and crushed their former masters not beneath their heel for they went shoeless mostly in these days but a more effectual weight the knife of the guillotine And daily hourly the hideous instrument of torture claimed its many victims old men young women tiny children until the day when it would finally demand the head of a King and of a beautiful young Queen But this was as it should be were not the people now the rulers of France Every aristocrat was a traitor as his ancestors had been before him for two hundred years now the people had sweated and toiled and starved to keep a lustful court in lavish extravagance now the descendants of those who had helped to make those courts brilliant had to hide for their lives to fly if they wished to avoid the tardy vengeance of the people And they did try to hide and tried to fly that was just the fun of the whole thing Every afternoon before the gates closed and the market carts went out in procession by the various barricades some fool of an aristo endeavoured to evade the clutches of the Committee of Public Safety In various disguises under various pretexts they tried to slip through the barriers which were so well guarded by citizen soldiers of the Republic Men in women s clothes women in male attire children disguised in beggars rags there were some of all sorts CI DEVANT counts marquises even dukes who wanted to fly from France reach England or some other equally accursed country and there try to rouse foreign feelings against the glorious Revolution or to raise an army in order to liberate the wretched prisoners in the Temple who had once called themselves sovereigns of France But they were nearly always caught at the barricades Sergeant Bibot especially at the West Gate had a wonderful nose for scenting an aristo in the most perfect disguise Then of course the fun began Bibot would look at his prey as a cat looks upon the mouse play with him sometimes for quite a quarter of an hour pretend to be hoodwinked by the disguise by the wigs and other bits of theatrical make up which hid the identity of a CI DEVANT noble marquise or count

none	none	Bibot had a keen sense of humour and it was well worth hanging round that West Barricade in order to see him catch an aristo in the very act of trying to flee from the vengeance of the people Sometimes Bibot would let his prey actually out by the gates allowing him to think for the space of two minutes at least that he really had escaped out of Paris and might even manage to reach the coast of England in safety but Bibot would let the unfortunate wretch walk about ten metres towards the open country then he would send two men after him and bring him back stripped of his disguise Oh that was extremely funny for as often as not the fugitive would prove to be a woman some proud marchioness who looked terribly comical when she found herself in Bibot s clutches after all and knew that a summary trial would await her the next day and after that the fond embrace of Madame la Guillotine No wonder that on this fine afternoon in September the crowd round Bibot s gate was eager and excited The lust of blood grows with its satisfaction there is no satiety the crowd had seen a hundred noble heads fall beneath the guillotine to day it wanted to make sure that it would see another hundred fall on the morrow Bibot was sitting on an overturned and empty cask close by the gate of the barricade a small detachment of citoyen soldiers was under his command The work had been very hot lately Those cursed aristos were becoming terrified and tried their hardest to slip out of Paris men women and children whose ancestors even in remote ages had served those traitorous Bourbons were all traitors themselves and right food for the guillotine Every day Bibot had had the satisfaction of unmasking some fugitive royalists and sending them back to be tried by the Committee of Public Safety presided over by that good patriot Citoyen Foucquier Tinville Robespierre and Danton both had commended Bibot for his zeal and Bibot was proud of the fact that he on his own initiative had sent at least fifty aristos to the guillotine But to day all the sergeants in command at the various barricades had had special orders Recently a very great number of aristos had succeeded in escaping out of France and in reaching England safely There were curious rumours about these escapes they had become very frequent and singularly daring the people s minds were becoming strangely excited about it all Sergeant Grospierre had been sent to the guillotine for allowing a whole family of aristos to slip out of the North Gate under his very nose It was asserted that these escapes were organised by a band of Englishmen whose daring seemed to be unparalleled and who from sheer desire to meddle in what did not concern them spent their spare time in snatching away lawful victims destined for Madame la Guillotine These rumours soon grew in extravagance there was no doubt that this band of meddlesome Englishmen did exist moreover they seemed to be under the leadership of a man whose pluck and audacity were almost fabulous Strange stories were afloat of how he and those aristos whom he rescued became suddenly invisible as they reached the barricades and escaped out of the gates by sheer supernatural agency No one had seen these mysterious Englishmen as for their leader he was never spoken of save with a superstitious shudder Citoyen Foucquier Tinville would in the course of the day receive a scrap of paper from some mysterious source sometimes he would find it in the pocket of his coat at others it would be handed to him by someone in the crowd whilst he was on his way to the sitting of the Committee of Public Safety The paper always contained a brief notice that the band of meddlesome Englishmen were at work and it was always signed with a device drawn in red a little star shaped flower which we in England call the Scarlet Pimpernel Within a few hours of the receipt of this impudent notice the citoyens of the Committee of Public Safety would hear that so many royalists and aristocrats had succeeded in reaching the coast and were on their way to England and safety The guards at the gates had been doubled the sergeants in command had been threatened with death whilst liberal rewards were offered for the capture of these daring and impudent Englishmen There was a sum of five thousand francs promised to the man who laid hands on the mysterious and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel Everyone felt that Bibot would be that man and Bibot allowed that belief to take firm root in everybody s mind and so day after day people came to watch him at the West Gate so as to be present when he laid hands on any fugitive aristo who perhaps might be accompanied by that mysterious Englishman Bah he said to his trusted corporal Citoyen Grospierre was a fool Had it been me now at that North Gate last week Citoyen Bibot spat on the ground to express his contempt for his comrade s stupidity How did it happen citoyen asked the corporal Grospierre was at the gate keeping good watch began Bibot pompously as the crowd closed in round him listening eagerly to his narrative We ve all heard of this meddlesome Englishman this accursed Scarlet Pimpernel He won t get through MY gate MORBLEU unless he be the devil himself But Grospierre was a fool The market carts were going through the gates there was one laden with casks and driven by an old man with a boy beside him Grospierre was a bit drunk but he thought himself very clever he looked into the casks most of them at least and saw they were empty and let the cart go through A murmur of wrath and contempt went round the group of ill clad wretches who crowded round Citoyen Bibot Half an hour later continued the sergeant up comes a captain of the guard with a squad of some dozen soldiers with him Has a cart gone through he asks of Grospierre breathlessly 
7754_105383_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Yes 
none	none	says Grospierre not half an hour ago And you have let them escape shouts the captain furiously You ll go to the guillotine for this citoyen sergeant that cart held concealed the CI DEVANT Duc de Chalis and all his family What thunders Grospierre aghast Aye and the driver was none other than that cursed Englishman the Scarlet Pimpernel A howl of execration greeted this tale Citoyen Grospierre had paid for his blunder on the guillotine but what a fool oh what a fool Bibot was laughing so much at his own tale that it was some time before he could continue After them my men shouts the captain he said after a while remember the reward after them they cannot have gone far And with that he rushes through the gate followed by his dozen soldiers But it was too late shouted the crowd excitedly They never got them Curse that Grospierre for his folly He deserved his fate Fancy not examining those casks properly But these sallies seemed to amuse Citoyen Bibot exceedingly he laughed until his sides ached and the tears streamed down his cheeks
7754_105383_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Nay 
none	none	nay he said at last those aristos weren t in the cart the driver was not the Scarlet Pimpernel What No The captain of the guard was that damned Englishman in disguise and everyone of his soldiers aristos The crowd this time said nothing the story certainly savoured of the supernatural and though the Republic had abolished God it had not quite succeeded in killing the fear of the supernatural in the hearts of the people Truly that Englishman must be the devil himself The sun was sinking low down in the west Bibot prepared himself to close the gates EN AVANT the carts he said Some dozen covered carts were drawn up in a row ready to leave town in order to fetch the produce from the country close by for market the next morning They were mostly well known to Bibot as they went through his gate twice every day on their way to and from the town He spoke to one or two of their drivers mostly women and was at great pains to examine the inside of the carts You never know he would say and I m not going to be caught like that fool Grospierre The women who drove the carts usually spent their day on the Place de la Greve beneath the platform of the guillotine knitting and gossiping whilst they watched the rows of tumbrils arriving with the victims the Reign of Terror claimed every day It was great fun to see the aristos arriving for the reception of Madame la Guillotine and the places close by the platform were very much sought after Bibot during the day had been on duty on the Place He recognized most of the old hats tricotteuses as they were called who sat there and knitted whilst head after head fell beneath the knife and they themselves got quite bespattered with the blood of those cursed aristos He la mere said Bibot to one of these horrible hags what have you got there He had seen her earlier in the day with her knitting and the whip of her cart close beside her Now she had fastened a row of curly locks to the whip handle all colours from gold to silver fair to dark and she stroked them with her huge bony fingers as she laughed at Bibot I made friends with Madame Guillotine s lover she said with a coarse laugh he cut these off for me from the heads as they rolled down He has promised me some more to morrow but I don t know if I shall be at my usual place Ah how is that la mere asked Bibot who hardened soldier that he was could not help shuddering at the awful loathsomeness of this semblance of a woman with her ghastly trophy on the handle of her whip My grandson has got the small pox she said with a jerk of her thumb towards the inside of her cart some say it s the plague If it is I sha n t be allowed to come into Paris to morrow At the first mention of the word small pox Bibot had stepped hastily backwards and when the old hag spoke of the plague he retreated from her as fast as he could Curse you he muttered whilst the whole crowd hastily avoided the cart leaving it standing all alone in the midst of the place The old hag laughed Curse you citoyen for being a coward she said Bah what a man to be afraid of sickness MORBLEU the plague Everyone was awe struck and silent filled with horror for the loathsome malady the one thing which still had the power to arouse terror and disgust in these savage brutalised creatures Get out with you and with your plague stricken brood shouted Bibot hoarsely And with another rough laugh and coarse jest the old hag whipped up her lean nag and drove her cart out of the gate This incident had spoilt the afternoon The people were terrified of these two horrible curses the two maladies which nothing could cure and which were the precursors of an awful and lonely death They hung about the barricades silent and sullen for a while eyeing one another suspiciously avoiding each other as if by instinct lest the plague lurked already in their midst Presently as in the case of Grospierre a captain of the guard appeared suddenly But he was known to Bibot and there was no fear of his turning out to be a sly Englishman in disguise A cart he shouted breathlessly even before he had reached the gates What cart asked Bibot roughly Driven by an old hag A covered cart There were a dozen An old hag who said her son had the plague Yes You have not let them go MORBLEU said Bibot whose purple cheeks had suddenly become white with fear The cart contained the CI DEVANT Comtesse de Tourney and her two children all of them traitors and condemned to death And their driver muttered Bibot as a superstitious shudder ran down his spine SACRE TONNERRE said the captain but it is feared that it was that accursed Englishman himself the Scarlet Pimpernel CHAPTER II DOVER THE FISHERMAN S REST In the kitchen Sally was extremely busy saucepans and frying pans were standing in rows on the gigantic hearth the huge stock pot stood in a corner and the jack turned with slow deliberation and presented alternately to the glow every side of a noble sirloin of beef The two little kitchen maids bustled around eager to help hot and panting with cotton sleeves well tucked up above the dimpled elbows and giggling over some private jokes of their own whenever Miss Sally s back was turned for a moment And old Jemima stolid in temper and solid in bulk kept up a long and subdued grumble while she stirred the stock pot methodically over the fire What ho Sally came in cheerful if none too melodious accents from the coffee room close by Lud bless my soul exclaimed Sally with a good humoured laugh what be they all wanting now I wonder Beer of course grumbled Jemima you don t xpect Jimmy Pitkin to ave done with one tankard do ye mister Arry e looked uncommon thirsty too simpered Martha one of the little kitchen maids and her beady black eyes twinkled as they met those of her companion whereupon both started on a round of short and suppressed giggles Sally looked cross for a moment and thoughtfully rubbed her hands against her shapely hips her palms were itching evidently to come in contact with Martha s rosy cheeks but inherent good humour prevailed and with a pout and a shrug of the shoulders she turned her attention to the fried potatoes What ho Sally hey Sally And a chorus of pewter mugs tapped with impatient hands against the oak tables of the coffee room accompanied the shouts for mine host s buxom daughter Sally shouted a more persistent voice are ye goin to be all night with that there beer I do think father might get the beer for them muttered Sally as Jemima stolidly and without further comment took a couple of foam crowned jugs from the shelf and began filling a number of pewter tankards with some of that home brewed ale for which The Fisherman s Rest had been famous since that days of King Charles E knows ow busy we are in ere Your father is too busy discussing politics with mister Empseed to worry isself about you and the kitchen grumbled Jemima under her breath Sally had gone to the small mirror which hung in a corner of the kitchen and was hastily smoothing her hair and setting her frilled cap at its most becoming angle over her dark curls then she took up the tankards by their handles three in each strong brown hand and laughing grumbling blushing carried them through into the coffee room There there was certainly no sign of that bustle and activity which kept four women busy and hot in the glowing kitchen beyond The coffee room of The Fisherman s Rest is a show place now at the beginning of the twentieth century At the end of the eighteenth in the year of grace seventeen ninety two it had not yet gained the notoriety and importance which a hundred additional years and the craze of the age have since bestowed upon it Yet it was an old place even then for the oak rafters and beams were already black with age as were the panelled seats with their tall backs and the long polished tables between on which innumerable pewter tankards had left fantastic patterns of many sized rings In the leaded window high up a row of pots of scarlet geraniums and blue larkspur gave the bright note of colour against the dull background of the oak That mister Jellyband landlord of The Fisherman s Rest at Dover was a prosperous man was of course clear to the most casual observer The pewter on the fine old dressers the brass above the gigantic hearth shone like silver and gold the red tiled floor was as brilliant as the scarlet geranium on the window sill this meant that his servants were good and plentiful that the custom was constant and of that order which necessitated the keeping up of the coffee room to a high standard of elegance and order As Sally came in laughing through her frowns and displaying a row of dazzling white teeth she was greeted with shouts and chorus of applause Why here s Sally What ho Sally Hurrah for pretty Sally I thought you d grown deaf in that kitchen of yours muttered Jimmy Pitkin as he passed the back of his hand across his very dry lips All ri all ri laughed Sally as she deposited the freshly filled tankards upon the tables why what a urry to be sure And is your gran mother a dyin an you wantin to see the pore soul afore she m gone I never see d such a mighty rushin A chorus of good humoured laughter greeted this witticism which gave the company there present food for many jokes for some considerable time Sally now seemed in less of a hurry to get back to her pots and pans A young man with fair curly hair and eager bright blue eyes was engaging most of her attention and the whole of her time whilst broad witticisms anent Jimmy Pitkin s fictitious grandmother flew from mouth to mouth mixed with heavy puffs of pungent tobacco smoke Facing the hearth his legs wide apart a long clay pipe in his mouth stood mine host himself worthy mister Jellyband landlord of The Fisherman s Rest as his father had before him aye and his grandfather and great grandfather too for that matter Portly in build jovial in countenance and somewhat bald of pate mister Jellyband was indeed a typical rural John Bull of those days the days when our prejudiced insularity was at its height when to an Englishman be he lord yeoman or peasant the whole of the continent of Europe was a den of immorality and the rest of the world an unexploited land of savages and cannibals There he stood mine worthy host firm and well set up on his limbs smoking his long churchwarden and caring nothing for

none	none	at home and despising everybody abroad He wore the typical scarlet waistcoat with shiny brass buttons the corduroy breeches and grey worsted stockings and smart buckled shoes that characterised every self respecting innkeeper in Great Britain in these days and while pretty motherless Sally had need of four pairs of brown hands to do all the work that fell on her shapely shoulders worthy Jellyband discussed the affairs of nations with his most privileged guests The coffee room indeed lighted by two well polished lamps which hung from the raftered ceiling looked cheerful and cosy in the extreme Through the dense clouds of tobacco smoke that hung about in every corner the faces of mister Jellyband s customers appeared red and pleasant to look at and on good terms with themselves their host and all the world from every side of the room loud guffaws accompanied pleasant if not highly intellectual conversation while Sally s repeated giggles testified to the good use mister Harry Waite was making of the short time she seemed inclined to spare him They were mostly fisher folk who patronised mister Jellyband s coffee room but fishermen are known to be very thirsty people the salt which they breathe in when they are on the sea accounts for their parched throats when on shore but The Fisherman s Rest was something more than a rendezvous for these humble folk The London and Dover coach started from the hostel daily and passengers who had come across the Channel and those who started for the grand tour all became acquainted with mister Jellyband his French wines and his home brewed ales It was towards the close of September seventeen ninety two and the weather which had been brilliant and hot throughout the month had suddenly broken up for two days torrents of rain had deluged the south of England doing its level best to ruin what chances the apples and pears and late plums had of becoming really fine self respecting fruit Even now it was beating against the leaded windows and tumbling down the chimney making the cheerful wood fire sizzle in the hearth Lud did you ever see such a wet September mister Jellyband asked mister Hempseed He sat in one of the seats inside the hearth did mister Hempseed for he was an authority and important personage not only at The Fisherman s Rest where mister Jellyband always made a special selection of him as a foil for political arguments but throughout the neighborhood where his learning and notably his knowledge of the Scriptures was held in the most profound awe and respect With one hand buried in the capacious pockets of his corduroys underneath his elaborately worked well worn smock the other holding his long clay pipe mister Hempseed sat there looking dejectedly across the room at the rivulets of moisture which trickled down the window panes No replied mister Jellyband sententiously I dunno mister Empseed as I ever did An I ve been in these parts nigh on sixty years Aye you wouldn t rec llect the first three years of them sixty mister Jellyband quietly interposed mister Hempseed I dunno as I ever see d an infant take much note of the weather leastways not in these parts an I ve lived ere nigh on seventy five years mister Jellyband The superiority of this wisdom was so incontestable that for the moment mister Jellyband was not ready with his usual flow of argument It do seem more like April than September don t it continued mister Hempseed dolefully as a shower of raindrops fell with a sizzle upon the fire Aye that it do assented the worthy host but then what
7717_105405_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 can you 
none	none	xpect mister Empseed I says with sich a government as we ve got mister Hempseed shook his head with an infinity of wisdom tempered by deeply rooted mistrust of the British climate and the British Government I don t xpect nothing mister Jellyband he said Pore folks like us is of no account up there in Lunnon I knows that and it s not often as I do complain But when it comes to sich wet weather in September and all me fruit a rottin and a dying like the Guptian mother s first born and doin no more good than they did pore dears save a lot more Jews pedlars and sich with their oranges and sich like foreign ungodly fruit which nobody d buy if English apples and pears was nicely swelled As the Scriptures say That s quite right mister Empseed retorted Jellyband and as I says what can you xpect There s all them Frenchy devils over the Channel yonder a murderin their king and nobility and mister Pitt and mister Fox and mister Burke a fightin and a wranglin between them if we Englishmen should low them to go on in their ungodly way Let em murder says mister Pitt Stop em says mister Burke And let em murder says I and be demmed to em said mister Hempseed emphatically for he had but little liking for his friend Jellyband s political arguments wherein he always got out of his depth and had but little chance for displaying those pearls of wisdom which had earned for him so high a reputation in the neighbourhood and so many free tankards of ale at The Fisherman s Rest Let em murder he repeated again but don t lets ave sich rain in September for that is agin the law and the Scriptures which says Lud mister Arry ow you made me jump It was unfortunate for Sally and her flirtation that this remark of hers should have occurred at the precise moment when mister Hempseed was collecting his breath in order to deliver himself one of those Scriptural utterances which made him famous for it brought down upon her pretty head the full flood of her father s wrath Now then Sally me girl now then he said trying to force a frown upon his good humoured face stop that fooling with them young jackanapes and get on with the work The work s gettin on all ri father But mister Jellyband was peremptory He had other views for his buxom daughter his only child who would in God s good time become the owner of The Fisherman s Rest than to see her married to one of these young fellows who earned but a precarious livelihood with their net Did ye hear me speak me girl he said in that quiet tone which no one inside the inn dared to disobey Get on with my Lord Tony s supper for if it ain t the best we can do and e not satisfied see what you ll get that s all Reluctantly Sally obeyed Is you xpecting special guests then to night mister Jellyband asked Jimmy Pitkin in a loyal attempt to divert his host s attention from the circumstances connected with Sally s exit from the room Aye that I be replied Jellyband friends of my Lord Tony hisself Dukes and duchesses from over the water yonder whom the young lord and his friend Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and other young noblemen have helped out of the clutches of them murderin devils But this was too much for mister Hempseed s querulous philosophy Lud he said what do they do that for I wonder I don t old not with interferin in other folks ways As the Scriptures say Maybe mister Empseed interrupted Jellyband with biting sarcasm as you re a personal friend of mister Pitt and as you says along with mister Fox Let em murder says you Pardon me mister Jellyband feebly protested mister Hempseed I dunno as I ever did But mister Jellyband had at last succeeded in getting upon his favourite hobby horse and had no intention of dismounting in any hurry Or maybe you ve made friends with some of them French chaps oo they do say have come over here o purpose to make us Englishmen agree with their murderin ways I dunno what you mean mister Jellyband suggested mister Hempseed all I know is All I know is loudly asserted mine host that there was my friend Peppercorn oo owns the Blue Faced Boar an as true and loyal an Englishman as you d see in the land And now look at im E made friends with some o them frog eaters obnobbed with them just as if they was Englishmen and not just a lot of immoral Godforsaking furrin spies Well and what happened Peppercorn e now ups and talks of revolutions and liberty and down with the aristocrats just like mister Empseed over ere Pardon me mister Jellyband again interposed mister Hempseed feebly I dunno as I ever did mister Jellyband had appealed to the company in general who were listening awe struck and open mouthed at the recital of mister Peppercorn s defalcations At one table two customers gentlemen apparently by their clothes had pushed aside their half finished game of dominoes and had been listening for some time and evidently with much amusement at mister Jellyband s international opinions One of them now with a quiet sarcastic smile still lurking round the corners of his mobile mouth turned towards the centre of the room where mister Jellyband was standing You seem to think mine honest friend he said quietly that these Frenchmen spies I think you called them are mighty clever fellows to have made mincemeat so to speak of your friend mister Peppercorn s opinions How did they accomplish that now think you Lud sir I suppose they talked im over Those Frenchies I ve eard it said ave got the gift of gab and mister Empseed ere will tell you ow it is that they just twist some people round their little finger like Indeed and is that so mister Hempseed inquired the stranger politely Nay sir replied mister Hempseed much irritated I dunno as I can give you the information you require Faith then said the stranger let us hope my worthy host that these clever spies will not succeed in upsetting your extremely loyal opinions But this was too much for mister Jellyband s pleasant equanimity He burst into an uproarious fit of laughter which was soon echoed by those who happened to be in his debt Hahaha hohoho hehehe He laughed in every key did my worthy host and laughed until his sided ached and his eyes streamed At me hark at that Did ye ear im say that they d be upsettin my opinions Eh Lud love you sir but you do say some queer things Well mister Jellyband said mister Hempseed sententiously you know what the Scriptures say Let im oo stands take eed lest e fall But then hark ee mister Empseed retorted Jellyband still holding his sides with laughter the Scriptures didn t know me Why I wouldn t so much as drink a glass of ale with one o them murderin Frenchmen and nothin d make me change my opinions Why I ve eard it said that them frog eaters can t even speak the King s English so of course if any of em tried to speak their God forsaken lingo to me why I should spot them directly see and forewarned is forearmed as the saying goes Aye my honest friend assented the stranger cheerfully I see that you are much too sharp and a match for any twenty Frenchmen and here s to your very good health my worthy host if you ll do me the honour to finish this bottle of mine with me I am sure you re very polite sir said mister Jellyband wiping his eyes which were still streaming with the abundance of his laughter and I don t mind if I do The stranger poured out a couple of tankards full of wine and having offered one to mine host he took the other himself Loyal Englishmen as we all are he said whilst the same humorous smile played round the corners of his thin lips loyal as we are we must admit that this at least is one good thing which comes to us from France Aye we ll none of us deny that sir assented mine host And here s to the best landlord in England our worthy host mister Jellyband said the stranger in a loud tone of voice Hi hip hurrah retorted the whole company present Then there was a loud clapping of hands and mugs and tankards made a rattling music upon the tables to the accompaniment of loud laughter at nothing in particular and of mister Jellyband s muttered exclamations Just fancy ME bein talked over by any God forsaken furriner What Lud love you sir but you do say some queer things To which obvious fact the stranger heartily assented It was certainly a preposterous suggestion that anyone could ever upset mister Jellyband s firmly rooted opinions anent the utter worthlessness of the inhabitants of the whole continent of Europe CHAPTER III THE REFUGEES Feeling in every part of England certainly ran very high at this time against the French and their doings Smugglers and legitimate traders between the French and the English coasts brought snatches of news from over the water which made every honest Englishman s blood boil and made him long to have a good go at those murderers who had imprisoned their king and all his family subjected the queen and the royal children to every species of indignity and were even now loudly demanding the blood of the whole Bourbon family and of every one of its adherents The execution of the Princesse de Lamballe Marie Antoinette s young and charming friend had filled every one in England with unspeakable horror the daily execution of scores of royalists of good family whose only sin was their aristocratic name seemed to cry for vengeance to the whole of civilised Europe Yet with all that no one dared to interfere Burke had exhausted all his eloquence in trying to induce the British Government to fight the revolutionary government of France but mister Pitt with characteristic prudence did not feel that this country was fit yet to embark on another arduous and costly war It was for Austria to take the initiative Austria whose fairest daughter was even now a dethroned queen imprisoned and insulted by a howling mob surely twas not so argued mister Fox for the whole of England to take up arms because one set of Frenchmen chose to murder another As for mister Jellyband and his fellow John Bulls though they looked upon all foreigners with withering contempt they were royalist and anti revolutionists to a man and at this present moment were furious with Pitt for his caution and moderation although they naturally understood nothing of the diplomatic reasons which guided that great man s policy By now Sally came running back very excited and very eager The joyous company in the coffee room had heard nothing of the noise outside but she had spied a dripping horse and rider who had stopped at the door of The Fisherman s Rest and while the stable boy ran forward to take charge of the horse pretty Miss Sally went to the front door to greet the welcome visitor I think I see d my Lord Antony s horse out in the yard father she said as she ran across the coffee room But already the door had been thrown open from outside and the next moment an arm covered in drab cloth and dripping with the heavy rain was round pretty Sally s waist while a hearty voice echoed along the polished rafters of the coffee room Aye and bless your brown eyes for being so sharp my pretty Sally said the man who had just entered whilst worthy mister Jellyband came bustling forward eager alert and fussy as became the advent of one of the most favoured guests of his hostel Lud I protest Sally added Lord Antony as he deposited a kiss on Miss Sally s blooming cheeks but you are growing prettier and prettier every time I see you and my honest friend Jellyband here have hard work to keep the fellows off that slim waist of yours What say you mister Waite mister Waite torn between his respect for my lord and his dislike of that particular type of joke only replied with a doubtful grunt Lord Antony Dewhurst one of the sons of the Duke of Exeter was in those days a very perfect type of a young English gentlemen tall well set up broad of shoulders and merry of face his laughter rang loudly wherever he went A good sportsman a lively companion a courteous well bred man of the world with not too much brains to spoil his temper he was a universal favourite in London drawing rooms or in the coffee rooms of village inns At The Fisherman s Rest everyone knew him for he was fond of a trip across to France and always spent a night under worthy mister Jellyband s roof on his way there or back He nodded to Waite Pitkin and the others as he at last released Sally s waist and crossed over to the hearth to warm and dry himself as he did so he cast a quick somewhat suspicious glance at the two strangers who had quietly resumed their game of dominoes and for a moment a look of deep earnestness even of anxiety clouded his jovial young face But only for a moment the next he turned to mister Hempseed who was respectfully touching his forelock Well mister Hempseed and how is the fruit Badly my lord badly replied mister Hempseed dolefully but what can you xpect with this ere government favourin them rascals over in France who would murder their king and all their nobility Odd s life retorted Lord Antony so they would honest Hempseed at least those they can get hold of worse luck But we have got some friends coming here to night who at any rate have evaded their clutches It almost seemed when the young man said these words as if he threw a defiant look towards the quiet strangers in the corner Thanks to you my lord and to your friends so I ve heard it said said mister Jellyband But in a moment Lord Antony s hand fell warningly on mine host s arm Hush he said peremptorily and instinctively once again looked towards the strangers Oh Lud love you they are all right my lord retorted Jellyband don t you be afraid I wouldn t have spoken only I knew we were among friends That gentleman over there is as true and loyal a subject of King George as you are yourself my lord saving your presence He is but lately arrived in Dover and is setting down in business in these parts In business Faith then it must be as an undertaker for I vow I never beheld a more rueful countenance Nay my lord I believe that the gentleman is a widower which no doubt would account for the melancholy of his bearing but he is a friend nevertheless I ll vouch for that and you will own my lord that who should judge of a face better than the landlord of a popular inn Oh that s all right then if we are among friends said Lord Antony who evidently did not care to discuss the subject with his host But tell me you have no one else staying here have you No one my lord and no one coming either leastways Leastways No one your lordship would object to I know Who is it Well my lord Sir

none	none	Blakeney and his lady will be here presently but they ain t a goin to stay Lady Blakeney queried Lord Antony in some astonishment Aye my lord Sir Percy s skipper was here just now He says that my lady s brother is crossing over to France to day in the DAY DREAM which is Sir Percy s yacht and Sir Percy and my lady will come with him as far as here to see the last of him It don t put you out do it my lord No no it doesn t put me out friend nothing will put me out unless that supper is not the very best which Miss Sally can cook and which has ever been served in The Fisherman s Rest You need have no fear of that my lord said Sally who all this while had been busy setting the table for supper And very gay and inviting it looked with a large bunch of brilliantly coloured dahlias in the centre and the bright pewter goblets and blue china about How many shall I lay for my lord Five places pretty Sally but let the supper be enough for ten at least our friends will be tired and I hope hungry As for me I vow I could demolish a baron of beef to night Here they are I do believe said Sally excitedly as a distant clatter of horses and wheels could now be distinctly heard drawing rapidly nearer There was a general commotion in the coffee room Everyone was curious to see my Lord Antony s swell friends from over the water Miss Sally cast one or two quick glances at the little bit of mirror which hung on the wall and worthy mister Jellyband bustled out in order to give the first welcome himself to his distinguished guests Only the two strangers in the corner did not participate in the general excitement They were calmly finishing their game of dominoes and did not even look once towards the door Straight ahead Comtesse the door on your right said a pleasant voice outside Aye there they are all right enough said Lord Antony joyfully off with you my pretty Sally and see how quick you can dish up the soup The door was thrown wide open and preceded by mister Jellyband who was profuse in his bows and welcomes a party of four two ladies and two gentlemen entered the coffee room Welcome Welcome to old England said Lord Antony effusively as he came eagerly forward with both hands outstretched towards the newcomers Ah you are Lord Antony Dewhurst I think said one of the ladies speaking with a strong foreign accent At your service Madame he replied as he ceremoniously kissed the hands of both the ladies then turned to the men and shook them both warmly by the hand Sally was already helping the ladies to take off their traveling cloaks and both turned with a shiver towards the brightly blazing hearth There was a general movement among the company in the coffee room Sally had bustled off to her kitchen whilst Jellyband still profuse with his respectful salutations arranged one or two chairs around the fire mister Hempseed touching his forelock was quietly vacating the seat in the hearth Everyone was staring curiously yet deferentially at the foreigners Ah Messieurs what can I say said the elder of the two ladies as she stretched a pair of fine aristocratic hands to the warmth of the blaze and looked with unspeakable gratitude first at Lord Antony then at one of the young men who had accompanied her party and who was busy divesting himself of his heavy caped coat Only that you are glad to be in England Comtesse replied Lord Antony and that you have not suffered too much from your trying voyage Indeed indeed we are glad to be in England she said while her eyes filled with tears and we have already forgotten all that we have suffered Her voice was musical and low and there was a great deal of calm dignity and of many sufferings nobly endured marked in the handsome aristocratic face with its wealth of snowy white hair dressed high above the forehead after the fashion of the times I hope my friend Sir Andrew Ffoulkes proved an entertaining travelling companion madame Ah indeed Sir Andrew was kindness itself How could my children and I ever show enough gratitude to you all Messieurs Her companion a dainty girlish figure childlike and pathetic in its look of fatigue and of sorrow had said nothing as yet but her eyes large brown and full of tears looked up from the fire and sought those of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes who had drawn near to the hearth and to her then as they met his which were fixed with unconcealed admiration upon the sweet face before him a thought of warmer colour rushed up to her pale cheeks So this is England she said as she looked round with childlike curiosity at the great hearth the oak rafters and the yokels with their elaborate smocks and jovial rubicund British countenances A bit of it Mademoiselle replied Sir Andrew smiling but all of it at your service The young girl blushed again but this time a bright smile fleet and sweet illumined her dainty face She said nothing and Sir Andrew too was silent yet those two young people understood one another as young people have a way of doing all the world over and have done since the world began But I say supper here broke in Lord Antony s jovial voice supper honest Jellyband Where is that pretty wench of yours and the dish of soup Zooks man while you stand there gaping at the ladies they will faint with hunger One moment one moment my lord said Jellyband as he threw open the door that led to the kitchen and shouted lustily Sally Hey Sally there are ye ready my girl Sally was ready and the next moment she appeared in the doorway carrying a gigantic tureen from which rose a cloud of steam and an abundance of savoury odour Odd s life supper at last ejaculated Lord Antony merrily as he gallantly offered his arm to the Comtesse May I have the honour he added ceremoniously as he led her towards the supper table There was a general bustle in the coffee room mister Hempseed and most of the yokels and fisher folk had gone to make way for the quality and to finish smoking their pipes elsewhere Only the two strangers stayed on quietly and unconcernedly playing their game of dominoes and sipping their wine whilst at another table Harry Waite who was fast losing his temper watched pretty Sally bustling round the table She looked a very dainty picture of English rural life and no wonder that the susceptible young Frenchman could scarce take his eyes off her pretty face The Vicomte de Tournay was scarce nineteen a beardless boy on whom terrible tragedies which were being enacted in his own country had made but little impression He was elegantly and even foppishly dressed and once safely landed in England he was evidently ready to forget the horrors of the Revolution in the delights of English life Pardi if zis is England he said as he continued to ogle Sally with marked satisfaction I am of it satisfied It would be 
7754_105383_000048_000001	train-clean-360	impossible 
none	none	at this point to record the exact exclamation which escaped through mister Harry Waite s clenched teeth Only respect for the quality and notably for my Lord Antony kept his marked disapproval of the young foreigner in check Nay but this IS England you abandoned young reprobate interposed Lord Antony with a laugh and do not I pray bring your loose foreign ways into this most moral country Lord Antony had already sat down at the head of the table with the Comtesse on his right Jellyband was bustling round filling glasses and putting chairs straight Sally waited ready to hand round the soup mister Harry Waite s friends had at last succeeded in taking him out of the room for his temper was growing more and more violent under the Vicomte s obvious admiration for Sally Suzanne came in stern commanding accents from the rigid Comtesse Suzanne blushed again she had lost count of time and of place whilst she had stood beside the fire allowing the handsome young Englishman s eyes to dwell upon her sweet face and his hand as if unconsciously to rest upon hers Her mother s voice brought her back to reality once more and with a submissive Yes Mama she took her place at the supper table CHAPTER IV THE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL 
7754_105383_000001_000000	train-clean-360	They all looked a merry even a happy party as they sat round the table Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Antony Dewhurst two typical good looking well born and well bred Englishmen of that year of grace seventeen ninety two and the aristocratic French comtesse with her two children who had just escaped from such dire perils and found a safe retreat at last on the shores of protecting England 
7754_105383_000002_000000	train-clean-360	In the corner the two strangers had apparently finished their game one of them arose and standing with his back to the merry company at the table he adjusted with much deliberation his large triple caped coat As he did so he gave one quick glance all around him 
none	none	Everyone was busy laughing and chatting and he murmured the words All safe his companion then with the alertness borne of long practice slipped on to his knees in a moment and the next had crept noiselessly under the oak bench 
7754_105383_000002_000002	train-clean-360	The stranger then with a loud Good night quietly walked out of the coffee room 
7754_105383_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Not one of those at the supper table had noticed this curious and silent manoeuvre but when the stranger finally closed the door of the coffee room behind him they all instinctively sighed a sigh of relief 
7754_105383_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Alone at last said Lord Antony jovially 
none	none	Then the young Vicomte de Tournay rose glass in hand and with the graceful affection peculiar to the times he raised it aloft and said in broken English
7754_105383_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 To His Majesty George Three of England 
7754_105383_000006_000001	train-clean-360	God bless him for his hospitality to us all poor exiles from France 
7754_105383_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 His Majesty the King echoed Lord Antony and Sir Andrew as they drank loyally to the toast 
none	none	To His Majesty King Louis of France added Sir Andrew with solemnity May God protect him and give him victory over his enemies 
7754_105383_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Everyone rose and drank this toast in silence 
7754_105383_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The fate of the unfortunate King of France then a prisoner of his own people seemed to cast a gloom even over mister Jellyband s pleasant countenance 
none	none	And to M le Comte de Tournay de Basserive said Lord Antony merrily May we welcome him in England before many days are over Ah Monsieur said the Comtesse as with a slightly trembling hand she conveyed her glass to her lips I scarcely dare to hope But already Lord Antony had served out the soup and for the next few moments all conversation ceased while Jellyband and Sally handed round the plates and everyone began to eat Faith Madame said Lord Antony after a while mine was no idle toast seeing yourself Mademoiselle Suzanne and my friend the Vicomte safely in England now surely you must feel reasurred as to the fate of Monsieur le Comte Ah Monsieur replied the Comtesse with a heavy sigh I trust in God I can but pray and hope
7754_105383_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Aye Madame here interposed Sir Andrew Ffoulkes trust in God by all means but believe also a little in your English friends who have sworn to bring the Count safely across the Channel even as they have brought you to day 
none	none	Indeed indeed Monsieur she replied I have the fullest confidence in you and your friends Your fame I assure you has spread throughout the whole of France 
7754_105383_000016_000002	train-clean-360	The way some of my own friends have escaped from the clutches of that awful revolutionary tribunal was nothing short of a miracle and all done by you and your friends 
none	none	We were but the hands Madame la Comtesse But my husband Monsieur said the Comtesse whilst unshed tears seemed to veil her voice he is in such deadly peril I would never have left him only there were my children 
7754_105383_000018_000001	train-clean-360	I was torn between my duty to him and to them 
7754_105383_000018_000002	train-clean-360	They refused to go without me and you and your friends assured me so solemnly that my husband would be safe But oh 
7754_105383_000018_000003	train-clean-360	now that I am here amongst you all in this beautiful free England I think of him flying for his life hunted like a poor beast in such peril 
none	none	Ah 
7754_105383_000018_000005	train-clean-360	I should not have left him 
none	none	I should not have left him The poor woman had completely broken down fatigue sorrow and emotion had overmastered her rigid aristocratic bearing 
7754_105383_000019_000001	train-clean-360	She was crying gently to herself whilst Suzanne ran up to her and tried to kiss away her tears 
none	none	Lord Antony and Sir Andrew had said nothing to interrupt the Comtesse whilst she was speaking 
7754_105383_000020_000001	train-clean-360	There was no doubt that they felt deeply for her their very silence testified to that but in every century and ever since England has been what it is an Englishman has always felt somewhat ashamed of his own emotion and of his own sympathy 
none	none	And so the two young men said nothing and busied themselves in trying to hide their feelings only succeeding in looking immeasurably sheepish As for me Monsieur said Suzanne suddenly as she looked through a wealth of brown curls across at Sir Andrew I trust you absolutely and I KNOW that you will bring my dear father safely to England just as you brought us to day 
7754_105383_000022_000000	train-clean-360	This was said with so much confidence such unuttered hope and belief that it seemed as if by magic to dry the mother s eyes and to bring a smile upon everybody s lips 
none	none	Nay 
7754_105383_000023_000001	train-clean-360	You shame me Mademoiselle replied Sir Andrew though my life is at your service I have been but a humble tool in the hands of our great leader who organised and effected your escape 
7754_105383_000024_000000	train-clean-360	He had spoken with so much warmth and vehemence that Suzanne s eyes fastened upon him in undisguised wonder 
7754_105383_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Your leader Monsieur said the Comtesse eagerly 
7754_105383_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Ah of course you must have a leader 
7754_105383_000025_000002	train-clean-360	And I did not think of that before 
7754_105383_000025_000003	train-clean-360	But tell me where is he 
none	none	I must go to him at once and I and my children must throw ourselves at his feet and thank him for all that he has done for us
7754_105383_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Alas Madame said Lord Antony that is impossible 
none	none	Impossible Why Because the Scarlet Pimpernel works in the dark and his identity is only known under the solemn oath of secrecy to his immediate followers
7754_105383_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 The Scarlet Pimpernel said Suzanne with a merry laugh 
none	none	Why what a droll name 
7754_105383_000029_000002	train-clean-360	What is the Scarlet Pimpernel Monsieur 
7754_105383_000030_000000	train-clean-360	She looked at Sir Andrew with eager curiosity 
7754_105383_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The young man s face had become almost transfigured 
7754_105383_000030_000002	train-clean-360	His eyes shone with enthusiasm hero worship love admiration for his leader seemed literally to glow upon his face 
none	none	The Scarlet Pimpernel Mademoiselle he said at last is the name of a humble English wayside flower but it is also the name chosen to hide the identity of the best and bravest man in all the world so that he may better succeed in accomplishing the noble task he has set himself to do
7754_105383_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah yes here interposed the young Vicomte I have heard speak of this Scarlet Pimpernel 
7754_105383_000031_000001	train-clean-360	A little flower red yes 
none	none	They say in Paris that every time a royalist escapes to England that devil Foucquier Tinville the Public Prosecutor receives a paper with that little flower designated in red upon it Yes
7754_105383_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes that is so assented Lord Antony 
7754_105383_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Then he will have received one such paper to day 
7754_105383_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Undoubtedly 
none	none	Oh I wonder what he will say said Suzanne merrily I have heard that the picture of that little red flower is the only thing that frightens him Faith then said Sir Andrew he will have many more opportunities of studying the shape of that small scarlet flower Ah monsieur sighed the Comtesse it all sounds like a romance and I cannot understand it all
7754_105383_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Why should you try Madame 
7754_105383_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 But tell me why should your leader why should you all spend your money and risk your lives for it is your lives you risk Messieurs when you set foot in France and all for us French men and women who are nothing to you 
none	none	Sport Madame la Comtesse sport asserted Lord Antony with his jovial loud and pleasant voice we are a nation of sportsmen you know and just now it is the fashion to pull the hare from between the teeth of the hound Ah no no not sport only Monsieur you have a more noble motive I am sure for the good work you do
7754_105383_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Faith Madame I would like you to find it then as for me I vow I love the game for this is the finest sport I have yet encountered Hair breath escapes the devil s own risks Tally ho and away we go 
7754_105383_000043_000000	train-clean-360	But the Comtesse shook her head still incredulously 
7754_105383_000043_000001	train-clean-360	To her it seemed preposterous that these young men and their great leader all of them rich probably wellborn and young should for no other motive than sport run the terrible risks which she knew they were constantly doing 
7754_105383_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Their nationality once they had set foot in France would be no safeguard to them 
7754_105383_000043_000003	train-clean-360	Anyone found harbouring or assisting suspected royalists would be ruthlessly condemned and summarily executed whatever his nationality might be 
none	none	And this band of young Englishmen had to her own knowledge bearded the implacable and bloodthirsty tribunal of the Revolution within the very walls of Paris itself and had snatched away condemned victims almost from the very foot of the guillotine With a shudder she recalled the events of the last few days her escape from Paris with her two children all three of them hidden beneath the hood of a rickety cart and lying amidst a heap of turnips and cabbages not daring to breathe whilst the mob howled A la lanterne les aristos at the awful West Barricade It had all occurred in such a miraculous way she and her husband had understood that they had been placed on the list of suspected persons which meant that their trial and death were but a matter of days of hours perhaps Then came the hope of salvation the mysterious epistle signed with the enigmatical scarlet device the clear peremptory directions the parting from the Comte de Tournay which had torn the poor wife s heart in two the hope of reunion the flight with her two children the covered cart that awful hag driving it who looked like some horrible evil demon with the ghastly trophy on her whip handle 
7754_105383_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The Comtesse looked round at the quaint old fashioned English inn the peace of this land of civil and religious liberty and she closed her eyes to shut out the haunting vision of that West Barricade and of the mob retreating panic stricken when the old hag spoke of the plague 
7754_105383_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Every moment under that cart she expected recognition arrest herself and her children tried and condemned and these young Englishmen under the guidance of their brave and mysterious leader had risked their lives to save them all as they had already saved scores of other innocent people 
7754_105383_000048_000000	train-clean-360	And all only for sport 
none	none	Impossible Suzanne s eyes as she sought those of Sir Andrew plainly told him that she thought that HE at any rate rescued his fellowmen from terrible and unmerited death through a higher and nobler motive than his friend would have her believe How many are there in your brave league Monsieur she asked timidly
7754_105383_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Twenty all told Mademoiselle he replied one to command and nineteen to obey 
7754_105383_000050_000001	train-clean-360	All of us Englishmen and all pledged to the same cause to obey our leader and to rescue the innocent 
none	none	May God protect you all Messieurs said the Comtesse fervently He had done that so far Madame
7754_105383_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 It is wonderful to me wonderful That you should all be so brave so devoted to your fellowmen yet you are English and in France treachery is rife all in the name of liberty and fraternity 
none	none	The women even in France have been more bitter against us aristocrats than the men said the Vicomte with a sigh Ah yes added the Comtesse while a look of haughty disdain and intense bitterness shot through her melancholy eyes There was that woman Marguerite saint Just for instance She denounced the Marquis de saint Cyr and all his family to the awful tribunal of the Terror Marguerite saint Just said Lord Antony as he shot a quick and apprehensive glance across at Sir Andrew Marguerite saint Just Surely
7754_105383_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes replied the Comtesse surely you know her 
7754_105383_000058_000001	train-clean-360	She was a leading actress of the Comedie Francaise and she married an Englishman lately You must know her 
none	none	Know her said Lord Antony Know Lady Blakeney the most fashionable woman in London the wife of the richest man in England 
7754_105383_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Of course we all know Lady Blakeney 
none	none	She was a school fellow of mine at the convent in Paris interposed Suzanne and we came over to England together to learn your language I was very fond of Marguerite and I cannot believe that she ever did anything so wicked It certainly seems incredible said Sir Andrew You say that she actually denounced the Marquis de saint Cyr 
7754_105383_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Why should she have done such a thing 
7754_105383_000061_000003	train-clean-360	Surely there must be some mistake 
none	none	No mistake is possible Monsieur rejoined the Comtesse coldly Marguerite saint Just s brother is a noted republican There was some talk of a family feud between him and my cousin the Marquis de saint Cyr The saint Justs are quite plebeian and the republican government employs many spies 
7754_105383_000062_000002	train-clean-360	I assure you there is no mistake 
7754_105383_000062_000003	train-clean-360	You had not heard this story 
none	none	Faith Madame I did hear some vague rumours of it but in England no one would credit it 
7754_105383_000063_000001	train-clean-360	Sir Percy Blakeney her husband is a very wealthy man of high social position the intimate friend of the Prince of Wales and Lady Blakeney leads both fashion and society in London 
none	none	That may be Monsieur and we shall of course lead a very quiet life in England but I pray God that while I remain in this beautiful country I may never meet Marguerite saint Just The proverbial wet blanket seemed to have fallen over the merry little company gathered round the table Suzanne looked sad and silent Sir Andrew fidgeted uneasily with his fork whilst the Comtesse encased in the plate armour of her aristocratic prejudices sat rigid and unbending in her straight backed chair 
7754_105383_000065_000002	train-clean-360	As for Lord Antony he looked extremely uncomfortable and glanced once or twice apprehensively towards Jellyband who looked just as uncomfortable as himself 
7754_105383_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 At what time do you expect Sir Percy and Lady Blakeney he contrived to whisper unobserved to mine host 
7754_105383_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Any moment my lord whispered Jellyband in reply 
7754_105383_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Even as he spoke a distant clatter was heard of an approaching coach louder and louder it grew one or two shouts became distinguishable then the rattle of horses hoofs on the uneven cobble stones and the next moment a stable boy had thrown open the coffee room door and rushed in excitedly 
7754_105383_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir Percy Blakeney and my lady he shouted at the top of his voice they re just arriving 
none	none	And with more shouting jingling of harness and iron hoofs upon the stones a magnificent coach drawn by four superb bays had halted outside the porch of The Fisherman s Rest CHAPTER V MARGUERITE In a moment the pleasant oak raftered coffee room of the inn became the scene of hopeless confusion and discomfort At the first announcement made by the stable boy Lord Antony with a fashionable oath had jumped up from his seat and was now giving many and confused directions to poor bewildered Jellyband who seemed at his wits end what to do For goodness sake man admonished his lordship try to keep Lady Blakeney talking outside for a moment while the ladies withdraw Zounds he added with another more emphatic oath this is most unfortunate Quick Sally the candles shouted Jellyband as hopping about from one leg to another he ran hither and thither adding to the general discomfort of everybody The Comtesse too had risen to her feet rigid and erect trying to hide her excitement beneath more becoming SANG FROID she repeated mechanically I will not see her I will not see her Outside the excitement attendant upon the arrival of very important guests grew apace Good day Sir Percy Good day to your ladyship Your servant Sir Percy was heard in one long continued chorus with alternate more feeble tones of Remember the poor blind man of your charity lady and gentleman Then suddenly a singularly sweet voice was heard through all the din Let the poor man be and give him some supper at my expense The voice was low and musical with a slight sing song in it and a faint SOUPCON of foreign intonation in the pronunciation of the consonants Everyone in the coffee room heard it and paused instinctively listening to it for a moment Sally was holding the candles by the opposite door which led to the bedrooms upstairs and the Comtesse was in the act of beating a hasty retreat before that enemy who owned such a sweet musical voice Suzanne reluctantly was preparing to follow her mother while casting regretful glances towards the door where she hoped still to see her dearly beloved erstwhile school fellow Then Jellyband threw open the door still stupidly and blindly hoping to avert the catastrophe which he felt was in the air and the same low musical voice said with a merry laugh and mock consternation B r r r r I am as wet as a herring DIEU has anyone ever seen such a contemptible climate Suzanne come with me at once I wish it said the Comtesse peremptorily Oh Mama pleaded Suzanne My lady er h m my lady came in feeble accents from Jellyband who stood clumsily trying to bar the way PARDIEU my good man said Lady Blakeney with some impatience what are you standing in my way for dancing about like a turkey with a sore foot Let me get to the fire I am perished with the cold And the next moment Lady Blakeney gently pushing mine host on one side had swept into the coffee room There are many portraits and miniatures extant of Marguerite saint Just Lady Blakeney as she was then but it is doubtful if any of these really do her singular beauty justice Tall above the average with magnificent presence and regal figure it is small wonder that even the Comtesse paused for a moment in involuntary admiration before turning her back on so fascinating an apparition Marguerite Blakeney was then scarcely five and twenty and her beauty was at its most dazzling stage The large hat with its undulating and waving plumes threw a soft shadow across the classic brow with the aureole of auburn hair free at the moment from any powder the sweet almost childlike mouth the straight chiselled nose round chin and delicate throat all seemed set off by the picturesque costume of the period The rich blue velvet robe moulded in its every line the graceful contour of the figure whilst one tiny hand held with a dignity all its own the tall stick adorned with a large bunch of ribbons which fashionable ladies of the period had taken to carrying recently With a quick glance all around the room Marguerite Blakeney had taken stock of every one there She nodded pleasantly to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes whilst extending a hand to Lord Antony Hello my Lord Tony why what are YOU doing here in Dover she said merrily Then without waiting for a reply she turned and faced the Comtesse and Suzanne Her whole face lighted up with additional brightness as she stretched out both arms towards the young girl Why if that isn t my little Suzanne over there PARDIEU little citizeness how came you to be in England And Madame too She went up effusive to them both with not a single touch of embarrassment in her manner or in her smile Lord Tony and Sir Andrew watched the little scene with eager apprehension English though they were they had often been in France and had mixed sufficiently with the French to realise the unbending hauteur the bitter hatred with which the old NOBLESSE of France viewed all those who had helped to contribute to their downfall Armand saint Just the brother of beautiful Lady Blakeney though known to hold moderate and conciliatory views was an ardent republican his feud with the ancient family of saint Cyr the rights and wrongs of which no outsider ever knew had culminated in the downfall the almost total extinction of the latter In France saint Just and his party had triumphed and here in England face to face with these three refugees driven from their country flying for their lives bereft of all which centuries of luxury had given them there stood a fair scion of those same republican families which had hurled down a throne and uprooted an aristocracy whose origin was lost in the dim and distant vista of bygone centuries She stood there before them in all the unconscious insolence of beauty and stretched out her dainty hand to them as if she would by that one act bridge over the conflict and bloodshed of the past decade Suzanne I forbid you to speak to that woman said the Comtesse sternly as she placed a restraining hand upon her daughter s arm She had spoken in English so that all might hear and understand the two young English gentlemen as well as the common innkeeper and his daughter The latter literally gasped with horror at this foreign insolence this impudence before her ladyship who was English now that she was Sir Percy s wife and a friend of the Princess of Wales to boot As for Lord Antony and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes their very hearts seemed to stand still with horror at this gratuitous insult One of them uttered an exclamation of appeal the other one of warning and instinctively both glanced hurriedly towards the door whence a slow drawly not unpleasant voice had already been heard Alone among those present Marguerite Blakeney and the Comtesse de Tournay had remained seemingly unmoved The latter rigid erect and defiant with one hand still upon her daughter s arm seemed the very personification of unbending pride For the moment Marguerite s sweet face had become as white as the soft fichu which swathed her throat and a very keen observer might have noted that the hand which held the tall beribboned stick was clenched and trembled somewhat But this was only momentary the next instant the delicate eyebrows were raised slightly the lips curved sarcastically upwards the clear blue eyes looked straight at the rigid Comtesse and with a slight shrug of the shoulders Hoity toity citizeness she said gaily what fly stings you pray We are in England now Madame rejoined the Comtesse coldly and I am at liberty to forbid my daughter to touch your hand in friendship Come Suzanne She beckoned to her daughter and without another look at Marguerite Blakeney but with a deep old fashioned curtsey to the two young men she sailed majestically out of the room There was silence in the old inn parlour for a moment as the rustle of the Comtesse s skirts died away down the passage Marguerite rigid as a statue followed with hard set eyes the upright figure as it disappeared through the doorway but as little Suzanne humble and obedient was about to follow her mother the hard set expression suddenly vanished and a wistful almost pathetic and childlike look stole into Lady Blakeney s eyes Little Suzanne caught that look the child s sweet nature went out to the beautiful woman scarcely older than herself filial obedience vanished before girlish sympathy at the door she turned ran back to Marguerite and putting her arms round her kissed her effusively then only did she follow her mother Sally bringing up the rear with a final curtsey to my lady Suzanne s sweet and dainty impulse had relieved the unpleasant tension Sir Andrew s eyes followed the pretty little figure until it had quite disappeared then they met Lady Blakeney s with unassumed merriment Marguerite with dainty affection had kissed her hand to the ladies as they disappeared through the door then a humorous smile began hovering round the corners of her mouth So that s it is it she said gaily La Sir Andrew did you ever see such an unpleasant person I hope when I grow old I sha n t look like that She gathered up her skirts and assuming a majestic gait stalked towards the fireplace Suzanne she said mimicking the Comtesse s voice I forbid you to speak to that woman The laugh which accompanied this sally sounded perhaps a trifled forced and hard but neither Sir Andrew nor Lord Tony were very keen observers The mimicry was so perfect the tone of the voice so accurately reproduced that both the young men joined in a hearty cheerful Bravo Ah Lady Blakeney added Lord Tony how they must miss you at the Comedie Francaise and how the Parisians must hate Sir Percy for having taken you away Lud man rejoined Marguerite with a shrug of her graceful shoulders tis impossible to hate Sir Percy for anything his witty sallies would disarm even Madame la Comtesse herself The young Vicomte who had not elected to follow his mother in her dignified exit now made a step forward ready to champion the Comtesse should Lady Blakeney aim any further shafts at her But before he could utter a preliminary word of protest a pleasant though distinctly inane laugh was heard from outside and the next moment an unusually tall and very richly dressed figure appeared in the doorway CHAPTER VI AN EXQUISITE OF ninety two Sir Percy Blakeney as the chronicles of the time inform us was in this year of grace seventeen ninety two still a year or two on the right side of thirty Tall above the average even for an Englishman broad shouldered and massively built he would have been called unusually good looking but for a certain lazy expression in his deep set blue eyes and that perpetual inane laugh which seemed to disfigure his strong clearly cut mouth It was nearly a year ago now that Sir Percy Blakeney Bart one of the richest men in England leader of all the fashions and intimate friend of the Prince of Wales had astonished fashionable society in London and Bath by bringing home from one of his journeys abroad a beautiful fascinating clever French wife He the sleepiest dullest most British Britisher that had ever set a pretty woman yawning had secured a brilliant matrimonial prize for which as all chroniclers aver there had been many competitors Marguerite saint Just had first made her DEBUT in artistic Parisian circles at the very moment when the greatest social upheaval the world has ever known was taking place within its very walls Scarcely eighteen lavishly gifted with beauty and talent chaperoned only by a young and devoted brother she had soon gathered round her in her charming apartment in the Rue Richelieu a coterie which was as brilliant as it was exclusive exclusive that is to say only from one point of view Marguerite saint Just was from principle and by conviction a republican equality of birth was her motto inequality of fortune was in her eyes a mere untoward accident but the only inequality she admitted was that of talent Money and titles may be hereditary she would say but brains are not and thus her charming salon was reserved for originality and intellect for brilliance and wit for clever men and talented women and the entrance into it was soon looked upon in the world of intellect which even in those days and in those troublous times found its pivot in Paris as the seal to an artistic career Clever men distinguished men and even men of exalted station formed a perpetual and brilliant court round the fascinating young actress of the Comedie Francaise and she glided through republican revolutionary bloodthirsty Paris like a shining comet with a trail behind her of all that was most distinguished most interesting in intellectual Europe Then the climax came Some smiled indulgently and called it an artistic eccentricity others looked upon it as a wise provision in view of the many events which were crowding thick and fast in Paris just then but to all the real motive of that climax remained a puzzle and a mystery Anyway Marguerite saint Just married Sir Percy Blakeney one fine day just like that without any warning to her friends without a SOIREE DE CONTRAT or DINER DE FIANCAILLES or other appurtenances of a fashionable French wedding How that stupid dull Englishman ever came to be admitted within the intellectual circle which revolved round the cleverest woman in Europe as her friends unanimously called her no one ventured to guess golden key is said to open every door asserted the more malignantly inclined Enough she married him and the cleverest woman in Europe had linked her fate to that demmed idiot Blakeney and not even her most intimate friends could assign to this strange step any other motive than that of supreme eccentricity Those friends who knew laughed to scorn the idea that Marguerite saint Just had married a fool for the sake of the worldly advantages with which he might endow her They knew as a matter of fact that Marguerite saint Just cared nothing about money and still less about a title moreover there were at least half a dozen other men in the cosmopolitan world equally well born if not so wealthy as Blakeney who would have been only too happy to give Marguerite saint Just any position she might choose to covet As for Sir Percy himself he was universally voted to be totally unqualified for the onerous post he had taken upon himself His chief qualifications for it seemed to consist in his blind adoration for her his great wealth and the high favour in which he stood at the English court but London society thought that taking into consideration his own intellectual limitations it would have been wiser on his part had he bestowed those worldly advantages upon a less brilliant and witty wife Although lately he had been so prominent a figure in fashionable English society he had spent most of his early life abroad His father the late Sir Algernon Blakeney had had the terrible misfortune of seeing an idolized young wife become hopelessly insane after two years of happy married life Percy had just been born when the late Lady Blakeney fell prey to the terrible malady which in those days was looked upon as hopelessly incurable and nothing short of a curse of God upon the entire family Sir Algernon took his afflicted young wife abroad and there presumably Percy was educated and grew up between an imbecile mother and a distracted father until he attained his majority The death of his parents following close upon one another left him a free man and as Sir Algernon had led a forcibly simple and retired life the large Blakeney fortune had increased tenfold Sir Percy Blakeney had travelled a great deal abroad before he brought home his beautiful young French wife The fashionable circles of the time were ready to receive them both with open arms Sir Percy was rich his wife was accomplished the Prince of Wales took a very great liking to them both Within six months they were the acknowledged leaders of fashion and of style Sir Percy s coats were the talk of the town his inanities were quoted his foolish laugh copied by the gilded youth at Almack s or the Mall Everyone knew that he was hopelessly stupid but then that was scarcely to be wondered at seeing that all the Blakeneys for generations had been notoriously dull and that his mother died an imbecile Thus society accepted him petted him made much of him since his horses were the finest in the country his FETES and wines the most sought after As for his marriage with the cleverest woman in Europe well the inevitable came with sure and rapid footsteps No one pitied him since his fate was of his own making There were plenty of young ladies in England of high birth and good looks who would have been quite willing to help him to spend the Blakeney fortune whilst smiling indulgently at his inanities and his good humoured foolishness Moreover Sir Percy got no pity because he seemed to require none he seemed very proud of his clever wife and to care little that she took no pains to disguise that good natured contempt which she evidently felt for him and that she even amused herself by sharpening her ready wits at his expense But then Blakeney was really too stupid to notice the ridicule with which his wife covered him and if his matrimonial relations with the fascinating Parisienne had not turned out all that his hopes and his dog like devotion for her had pictured society could never do more than vaguely guess at it In his beautiful house at Richmond he played second fiddle to his clever wife with imperturbable BONHOMIE he lavished jewels and luxuries of all kinds upon her which she took with inimitable grace dispensing the hospitality of his superb mansion with the same graciousness with which she had welcomed the intellectual coterie of Paris Physically Sir Percy Blakeney was undeniably handsome always excepting the lazy bored look which was habitual to him He was always irreproachable dressed and wore the exaggerated Incroyable fashions which had just crept across from Paris to England with the perfect good taste innate in an English gentleman On this special afternoon in September in spite of the long journey by coach in spite of rain and mud his coat set irreproachably across his fine shoulders his hands looked almost femininely white as they emerged through billowy frills of finest Mechline lace the extravagantly short waisted satin coat wide lapelled waistcoat and tight fitting striped breeches set off his massive figure to perfection and in repose one might have admired so fine a specimen of English manhood until the foppish ways the affected movements the perpetual inane laugh brought one s admiration of Sir Percy Blakeney to an abrupt close He had lolled into the old fashioned inn parlour shaking the wet off his fine overcoat then putting up a gold rimmed eye glass to his lazy blue eye he surveyed the company upon whom an embarrassed silence had suddenly fallen How do Tony How do Ffoulkes he said recognizing the two young men and shaking them by the hand Zounds my dear fellow he added smothering a slight yawn did you ever see such a beastly day Demmed climate this With a quaint little laugh half of embarrassment and half of sarcasm Marguerite had turned towards her husband and was surveying him from head to foot with an amused little twinkle in her merry blue eyes La said Sir Percy after a moment or two s silence as no one offered any comment how sheepish you all look What s up Oh nothing Sir Percy replied Marguerite with a certain amount of gaiety which however sounded somewhat forced nothing to disturb your equanimity only an insult to your wife The laugh which accompanied this remark was evidently intended to reassure Sir Percy as to the gravity of the incident It apparently succeeded in that for echoing the laugh he rejoined placidly La m dear you don t say so Begad who was the bold man who dared to tackle you eh Lord Tony tried to interpose but had no time to do so for the young Vicomte had already quickly stepped forward Monsieur he said prefixing his little speech with an elaborate bow and speaking in broken English my mother the Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive has offenced Madame who I see is your wife I cannot ask your pardon for my mother what she does is right in my eyes But I am ready to offer you the usual reparation between men of honour The young man drew up his slim stature to its full height and looked very enthusiastic very proud and very hot as he gazed at six foot odd of gorgeousness as represented by Sir Percy Blakeney Bart Lud Sir Andrew said Marguerite with one of her merry infectious laughs look on that pretty picture the English turkey and the French bantam The simile was quite perfect and the English turkey looked down with complete bewilderment upon the dainty little French bantam which hovered quite threateningly around him La sir said Sir Percy at last putting up his eye glass and surveying the young Frenchman with undisguised wonderment where in the cuckoo s name did you learn to speak English Monsieur protested the Vicomte somewhat abashed at the way his warlike attitude had been taken by the ponderous looking Englishman I protest tis marvellous continued Sir Percy imperturbably demmed marvellous Don t you think so Tony eh I vow I can t speak the French lingo like that What Nay I ll vouch for that rejoined Marguerite Sir Percy has a British accent you could cut with a knife Monsieur interposed the Vicomte earnestly and in still more broken English I fear you have not understand I offer you the only posseeble reparation among gentlemen What the devil is that asked Sir Percy blandly My sword Monsieur replied the Vicomte who though still bewildered was beginning to lose his temper You are a sportsman Lord Tony said Marguerite merrily ten to one on the little bantam But Sir Percy was staring sleepily at the Vicomte for a moment or two through his partly closed heavy lids then he smothered another yawn stretched his long limbs and turned leisurely away Lud love you sir he muttered good humouredly demmit young man what s the good of your sword to me What the Vicomte thought and felt at that moment when that long limbed Englishman treated him with such marked insolence might fill volumes of sound reflections What he said resolved itself into a single articulate word for all the others were choked in his throat by his surging wrath A duel Monsieur he stammered Once more Blakeney turned and from his high altitude looked down on the choleric little man before him but not even for a second did he seem to lose his own imperturbable good humour He laughed his own pleasant and inane laugh and burying his slender long hands into the capacious pockets of his overcoat he said leisurely a bloodthirsty young ruffian Do you want to make a hole in a law abiding man As for me sir I never fight duels he added as he placidly sat down and stretched his long lazy legs out before him Demmed uncomfortable things duels ain t they Tony Now the Vicomte had no doubt vaguely heard that in England the fashion of duelling amongst gentlemen had been surpressed by the law with a very stern hand still to him a Frenchman whose notions of bravery and honour were based upon a code that had centuries of tradition to back it the spectacle of a gentleman actually refusing to fight a duel was a little short of an enormity In his mind he vaguely pondered whether he should strike that long legged Englishman in the face and call him a coward or whether such conduct in a lady s presence might be deemed ungentlemanly when Marguerite happily interposed I pray you Lord Tony she said in that gentle sweet musical voice of hers I pray you play the peacemaker The child is bursting with rage and she added with a SOUPCON of dry sarcasm might do Sir Percy an injury She laughed a mocking little laugh which however did not in the least disturb her husband s placid equanimity The British turkey has had the day she said Sir Percy would provoke all the saints in the calendar and keep his temper the while But already Blakeney good humoured as ever had joined in the laugh against himself Demmed smart that now wasn t it he said turning pleasantly to the Vicomte Clever woman my wife sir You will find THAT out if you live long enough in England Sir Percy is right Vicomte here interposed Lord Antony laying a friendly hand on the young Frenchman s shoulder It would hardly be fitting that you should commence your career in England by provoking him to a duel For a moment longer the Vicomte hesitated then with a slight shrug of the shoulders directed against the extraordinary code of honour prevailing in this fog ridden island he said with becoming dignity Ah well if Monsieur is satisfied I have no griefs You mi lor are our protector If I have done wrong I withdraw myself Aye do rejoined Blakeney with a long sigh of satisfaction withdraw yourself over there Demmed excitable little puppy he added under his breath Faith Ffoulkes if that s a specimen of the goods you and your friends bring over from France my advice to you is drop em mid Channel my friend or I shall have to see old Pitt about it get him to clap on a prohibitive tariff and put you in the stocks an you smuggle La Sir Percy your chivalry misguides you said Marguerite coquettishly you forget that you yourself have imported one bundle of goods from France Blakeney slowly rose to his feet and making a deep and elaborate bow before his wife he said with consummate gallantry I had the pick of the market Madame and my taste is unerring More so than your chivalry I fear she retorted sarcastically Odd s life m dear be reasonable Do you think I am going to allow my body to be made a pincushion of by every little frog eater who don t like the shape of your nose Lud Sir Percy laughed Lady Blakeney as she bobbed him a quaint and pretty curtsey you need not be afraid Tis not the MEN who dislike the shape of my nose Afraid be demmed Do you impugn my bravery Madame I don t patronise the ring for nothing do I Tony I ve put up the fists with Red Sam before now and and he didn t get it all his own way either S faith Sir Percy said Marguerite with a long and merry laugh that went echoing along the old oak rafters of the parlour I would I had seen you then ha ha ha ha you must have looked a pretty picture and and to be afraid of a little French boy ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha he he he echoed Sir Percy good humouredly La Madame you honour me Zooks Ffoulkes mark ye that I have made my wife laugh The cleverest woman in Europe Odd s fish we must have a bowl on that and he tapped vigorously on the table near him Hey Jelly Quick man Here Jelly Harmony was once more restored mister Jellyband with a mighty effort recovered himself from the many emotions he had experienced within the last half hour A bowl of punch Jelly hot and strong eh said Sir Percy The wits that have just made a clever woman laugh must be whetted Ha ha ha Hasten my good Jelly Nay there is no time Sir Percy interposed Marguerite The skipper will be here directly and my brother must get on board or the DAY DREAM will miss the tide Time m dear There is plenty of time for any gentleman to get drunk and get on board before the turn of the tide I think your ladyship said Jellyband respectfully that the young gentleman is coming along now with Sir Percy s skipper That s right said Blakeney then Armand can join us in the merry bowl Think you Tony he added turning towards the Vicomte that the jackanapes of yours will join us in a glass Tell him that we drink in token of reconciliation In fact you are all such merry company said Marguerite that I trust you will forgive me if I bid my brother good bye in another room It would have been bad form to protest Both Lord Antony and Sir Andrew felt that Lady Blakeney could not altogether be in tune with them at the moment Her love for her brother Armand saint Just was deep and touching in the extreme He had just spent a few weeks with her in her English home and was going back to serve his country at the moment when death was the usual reward for the most enduring devotion Sir Percy also made no attempt to detain his wife With that perfect somewhat affected gallantry which characterised his every movement he opened the coffee room door for her and made her the most approved and elaborate bow which the fashion of the time dictated as she sailed out of the room without bestowing on him more than a passing slightly contemptuous glance Only Sir Andrew Ffoulkes whose every thought since he had met Suzanne de Tournay seemed keener more gentle more innately sympathetic noted the curious look of intense longing of deep and hopeless passion with which the inane and flippant Sir Percy followed the retreating figure of his brilliant wife

3728_105386_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Once outside the noisy coffee room alone in the dimly lighted passage Marguerite Blakeney seemed to breathe more freely 
3728_105386_000002_000001	train-clean-360	She heaved a deep sigh like one who had long been oppressed with the heavy weight of constant self control and she allowed a few tears to fall unheeded down her cheeks 
3728_105386_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Outside the rain had ceased and through the swiftly passing clouds the pale rays of an after storm sun shone upon the beautiful white coast of Kent and the quaint irregular houses that clustered round the Admiralty Pier 
none	none	Marguerite Blakeney stepped on to the porch and looked out to sea Silhouetted against the ever changing sky a graceful schooner with white sails set was gently dancing in the breeze The DAY DREAM it was Sir Percy Blakeney s yacht which was ready to take Armand saint Just back to France into the very midst of that seething bloody Revolution which was overthrowing a monarchy attacking a religion destroying a society in order to try and rebuild upon the ashes of tradition a new Utopia of which a few men dreamed but which none had the power to establish In the distance two figures were approaching The Fisherman s Rest one an oldish man with a curious fringe of grey hairs round a rotund and massive chin and who walked with that peculiar rolling gait which invariably betrays the seafaring man the other a young slight figure neatly and becomingly dressed in a dark many caped overcoat he was clean shaved and his dark hair was taken well back over a clear and noble forehead
3728_105386_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Armand said Marguerite Blakeney as soon as she saw him approaching from the distance and a happy smile shone on her sweet face even through the tears 
none	none	A minute or two later brother and sister were locked in each other s arms while the old skipper stood respectfully on one side How much time have we got Briggs asked Lady Blakeney before M saint Just need go on board We ought to weigh anchor before half an hour your ladyship replied the old man pulling at his grey forelock Linking her arm in his Marguerite led her brother towards the cliffs
3728_105386_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Half an hour she said looking wistfully out to sea half an hour more and you ll be far from me Armand 
none	none	Oh 
3728_105386_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I can t believe that you are going dear 
none	none	These last few days whilst Percy has been away and I ve had you all to myself have slipped by like a dream I am not going far sweet one said the young man gently a narrow channel to cross a few miles of road I can soon come back
3728_105386_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Nay tis not the distance Armand but that awful Paris just now 
3728_105386_000013_000000	train-clean-360	They had reached the edge of the cliff 
none	none	The gentle sea breeze blew Marguerite s hair about her face and sent the ends of her soft lace fichu waving round her like a white and supple snake 
3728_105386_000013_000002	train-clean-360	She tried to pierce the distance far away beyond which lay the shores of France that relentless and stern France which was exacting her pound of flesh the blood tax from the noblest of her sons 
3728_105386_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Our own beautiful country Marguerite said Armand who seemed to have divined her thoughts 
3728_105386_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 They are going too far Armand she said vehemently 
none	none	You are a republican so am I we have the same thoughts the same enthusiasm for liberty and equality but even YOU must think that they are going too far
3728_105386_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Hush said Armand instinctively as he threw a quick apprehensive glance around him 
none	none	Ah you see you don t think yourself that it is safe even to speak of these things here in England She clung to him suddenly with strong almost motherly passion Don t go Armand she begged don t go back What should I do if if if 
3728_105386_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Her voice was choked in sobs her eyes tender blue and loving gazed appealingly at the young man who in his turn looked steadfastly into hers 
3728_105386_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 You would in any case be my own brave sister he said gently who would remember that when France is in peril it is not for her sons to turn their backs on her 
none	none	Even as he spoke that sweet childlike smile crept back into her face pathetic in the extreme for it seemed drowned in tears
3728_105386_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Armand she said quaintly I sometimes wish you had not so many lofty virtues 
3728_105386_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I assure you little sins are far less dangerous and uncomfortable 
3728_105386_000021_000002	train-clean-360	But you WILL be prudent she added earnestly 
3728_105386_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 As far as possible 
3728_105386_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I promise you 
none	none	Remember dear I have only you to to care for me
3728_105386_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Nay sweet one you have other interests now 
3728_105386_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Percy cares for you 
3728_105386_000025_000000	train-clean-360	A look of strange wistfulness crept into her eyes as she murmured 
3728_105386_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 He did once 
3728_105386_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 But surely 
3728_105386_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 There there dear don t distress yourself on my account 
3728_105386_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Percy is very good 
3728_105386_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Nay he interrupted energetically I will distress myself on your account my Margot 
3728_105386_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Listen dear I have not spoken of these things to you before something always seemed to stop me when I wished to question you 
3728_105386_000029_000002	train-clean-360	But somehow I feel as if I could not go away and leave you now without asking you one question 
none	none	You need not answer it if you do not wish he added as he noted a sudden hard look almost of apprehension darting through her eyes
7717_105405_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it 
3728_105386_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it she asked simply 
3728_105398_000038_000002	train-clean-360	What is it 
none	none	she asked simply Does Sir Percy Blakeney know that 
3728_105386_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I mean does he know the part you played in the arrest of the Marquis de saint Cyr 
3728_105386_000032_000000	train-clean-360	She laughed a mirthless bitter contemptuous laugh which was like a jarring chord in the music of her voice 
none	none	That I denounced the Marquis de saint Cyr you mean to the tribunal that ultimately sent him and all his family to the guillotine 
3728_105386_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Yes he does know 
3728_105386_000033_000002	train-clean-360	I told him after I married him 
3728_105386_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 You told him all the circumstances which so completely exonerated you from any blame 
none	none	It was too late to talk of circumstances he heard the story from other sources my confession came too tardily it seems 
3728_105386_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I could no longer plead extenuating circumstances I could not demean myself by trying to explain 
none	none	And
3728_105386_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 And now I have the satisfaction Armand of knowing that the biggest fool in England has the most complete contempt for his wife 
none	none	She spoke with vehement bitterness this time and Armand saint Just who loved her so dearly felt that he had placed a somewhat clumsy finger upon an aching wound
3728_105386_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 But Sir Percy loved you Margot he repeated gently 
3728_105386_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Loved me Well Armand I thought at one time that he did or I should not have married him 
3728_105386_000040_000001	train-clean-360	I daresay she added speaking very rapidly as if she were about to lay down a heavy burden which had oppressed her for months I daresay that even you thought as everybody else did that I married Sir Percy because of his wealth but I assure you dear that it was not so 
none	none	He seemed to worship me with a curious intensity of concentrated passion which went straight to my heart 
3728_105386_000040_000003	train-clean-360	I had never loved any one before as you know and I was four and twenty then so I naturally thought that it was not in my nature to love 
3728_105386_000040_000004	train-clean-360	But it has always seemed to me that it MUST be HEAVENLY to be loved blindly passionately wholly worshipped in fact and the very fact that Percy was slow and stupid was an attraction for me as I thought he would love me all the more 
none	none	A clever man would naturally have other interests an ambitious man other hopes 
3728_105386_000040_000006	train-clean-360	I thought that a fool would worship and think of nothing else 
3728_105386_000040_000007	train-clean-360	And I was ready to respond Armand I would have allowed myself to be worshipped and given infinite tenderness in return 
none	none	She sighed and there was a world of disillusionment in that sigh Armand saint Just had allowed her to speak on without interruption he listened to her whilst allowing his own thoughts to run riot It was terrible to see a young and beautiful woman a girl in all but name still standing almost at the threshold of her life yet bereft of hope bereft of illusions bereft of all those golden and fantastic dreams which should have made her youth one long perpetual holiday Yet perhaps though he loved his sister dearly perhaps he understood he had studied men in many countries men of all ages men of every grade of social and intellectual status and inwardly he understood what Marguerite had left unsaid Granted that Percy Blakeney was dull witted but in his slow going mind there would still be room for that ineradicable pride of a descendant of a long line of English gentlemen A Blakeney had died on Bosworth field another had sacrified life and fortune for the sake of a treacherous Stuart and that same pride foolish and prejudiced as the republican Armand would call it must have been stung to the quick on hearing of the sin which lay at Lady Blakeney s door 
3728_105386_000042_000002	train-clean-360	She had been young misguided ill advised perhaps 
none	none	Armand knew that her impulses and imprudence knew it still better but Blakeney was slow witted 
7717_105405_000061_000001	train-clean-360	he would not listen 
none	none	to circumstances he only clung to facts and these had shown him Lady Blakeney denouncing a fellow man to a tribunal that knew no pardon and the contempt he would feel for the deed she had done however unwittingly would kill that same love in him in which sympathy and intellectuality could never have a part 
3728_105386_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Yet even now his own sister puzzled him 
none	none	Life and love have such strange vagaries 
3728_105386_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Could it be that with the waning of her husband s love Marguerite s heart had awakened with love for him 
none	none	Strange extremes meet in love s pathway this woman who had had half intellectual Europe at her feet might perhaps have set her affections on a fool 
3728_105386_000043_000004	train-clean-360	Marguerite was gazing out towards the sunset 
3728_105386_000043_000005	train-clean-360	Armand could not see her face but presently it seemed to him that something which glittered for a moment in the golden evening light fell from her eyes onto her dainty fichu of lace 
3728_105386_000044_000000	train-clean-360	But he could not broach that subject with her 
3728_105386_000044_000001	train-clean-360	He knew her strange passionate nature so well and knew that reserve which lurked behind her frank open ways 
none	none	They had always been together these two for their parents had died when Armand was still a youth and Marguerite but a child He some eight years her senior had watched over her until her marriage had chaperoned her during those brilliant years spent in the flat of the Rue de Richelieu and had seen her enter upon this new life of hers here in England with much sorrow and some foreboding 
3728_105386_000045_000000	train-clean-360	This was his first visit to England since her marriage and the few months of separation had already seemed to have built up a slight thin partition between brother and sister the same deep intense love was still there on both sides but each now seemed to have a secret orchard into which the other dared not penetrate 
none	none	There was much Armand saint Just could not tell his sister the political aspect of the revolution in France was changing almost every day she might not understand how his own views and sympathies might become modified even as the excesses committed by those who had been his friends grew in horror and in intensity 
3728_105386_000046_000001	train-clean-360	And Marguerite could not speak to her brother about the secrets of her heart she hardly understood them herself she only knew that in the midst of luxury she felt lonely and unhappy 
none	none	And now Armand was going away she feared for his safety she longed for his presence 
3728_105386_000047_000001	train-clean-360	She would not spoil these last few sadly sweet moments by speaking about herself 
none	none	She led him gently along the cliffs then down to the beach their arms linked in one another s they had still so much to say that lay just outside that secret orchard of theirs CHAPTER VIII THE ACCREDITED AGENT The afternoon was rapidly drawing to a close and a long chilly English summer s evening was throwing a misty pall over the green Kentish landscape The DAY DREAM had set sail and Marguerite Blakeney stood alone on the edge of the cliff over an hour watching those white sails which bore so swiftly away from her the only being who really cared for her whom she dared to love whom she knew she could trust Some little distance away to her left the lights from the coffee room of The Fisherman s Rest glittered yellow in the gathering mist from time to time it seemed to her aching nerves as if she could catch from thence the sound of merry making and of jovial talk or even that perpetual senseless laugh of her husband s which grated continually upon her sensitive ears Sir Percy had had the delicacy to leave her severely alone She supposed that in his own stupid good natured way he may have understood that she would wish to remain alone while those white sails disappeared into the vague horizon so many miles away He whose notions of propriety and decorum were supersensitive had not suggested even that an attendant should remain within call Marguerite was grateful to her husband for all this she always tried to be grateful to him for his thoughtfulness which was constant and for his generosity which really was boundless She tried even at times to curb the sarcastic bitter thoughts of him which made her in spite of herself say cruel insulting things which she vaguely hoped would wound him Yes she often wished to wound him to make him feel that she too held him in contempt that she too had forgotten that she had almost loved him Loved that inane fop whose thoughts seemed unable to soar beyond the tying of a cravat or the new cut of a coat Bah And yet vague memories that were sweet and ardent and attuned to this calm summer s evening came wafted back to her memory on the invisible wings of the light sea breeze the tie when first he worshipped her he seemed so devoted a very slave and there was a certain latent intensity in that love which had fascinated her Then suddenly that love that devotion which throughout his courtship she had looked upon as the slavish fidelity of a dog seemed to vanish completely Twenty four hours after the simple little ceremony at old saint Roch she had told him the story of how inadvertently she had spoken of certain matters connected with the Marquis de saint Cyr before some men her friends who had used this information against the unfortunate Marquis and sent him and his family to the guillotine She hated the Marquis Years ago Armand her dear brother loved Angele de saint Cyr but saint Just was a plebeian and the Marquis full of the pride and arrogant prejudices of his caste One day Armand the respectful timid lover ventured on sending a small poem enthusiastic ardent passionate to the idol of his dreams The next night he was waylaid just outside Paris by the valets of Marquis de saint Cyr and ignominiously thrashed thrashed like a dog within an inch of his life because he had dared to raise his eyes to the daughter of the aristocrat The incident was one which in those days some two years before the great Revolution was of almost daily occurrence in France incidents of that type in fact led to bloody reprisals which a few years later sent most of those haughty heads to the guillotine Marguerite remembered it all what her brother must have suffered in his manhood and his pride must have been appalling what she suffered through him and with him she never attempted even to analyse Then the day of retribution came saint Cyr and his kin had found their masters in those same plebeians whom they had despised Armand and Marguerite both intellectual thinking beings adopted with the enthusiasm of their years the Utopian doctrines of the Revolution while the Marquis de saint Cyr and his family fought inch by inch for the retention of those privileges which had placed them socially above their fellow men Marguerite impulsive thoughtless not calculating the purport of her words still smarting under the terrible insult her brother had suffered at the Marquis hands happened to hear amongst her own coterie that the saint Cyrs were in treasonable correspondence with Austria hoping to obtain the Emperor s support to quell the growing revolution in their own country In those days one denunciation was sufficient Marguerite s few thoughtless words anent the Marquis de saint Cyr bore fruit within twenty four hours He was arrested His papers were searched letters from the Austrian Emperor promising to send troops against the Paris populace were found in his desk He was arraigned for treason against the nation and sent to the guillotine whilst his family his wife and his sons shared in this awful fate Marguerite horrified at the terrible consequences of her own thoughtlessness was powerless to save the Marquis his own coterie the leaders of the revolutionary movement all proclaimed her as a heroine and when she married Sir Percy Blakeney she did not perhaps altogether realise how severely he would look upon the sin which she had so inadvertently committed and which still lay heavily upon her soul She made full confession of it to her husband trusting his blind love for her her boundless power over him to soon make him forget what might have sounded unpleasant to an English ear Certainly at the moment he seemed to take it very quietly hardly in fact did he appear to understand the meaning of all she said but what was more certain still was that never after that could she detect the slightest sign of that love which she once believed had been wholly hers Now they had drifted quite apart and Sir Percy seemed to have laid aside his love for her as he would an ill fitting glove She tried to rouse him by sharpening her ready wit against his dull intellect endeavouring to excite his jealousy if she could not rouse his love tried to goad him to self assertion but all in vain He remained the same always passive drawling sleepy always courteous invariably a gentleman she had all that the world and a wealthy husband can give to a pretty woman yet on this beautiful summer s evening with the white sails of the DAY DREAM finally hidden by the evening shadows she felt more lonely than that poor tramp who plodded his way wearily along the rugged cliffs With another heavy sigh Marguerite Blakeney turned her back upon the sea and cliffs and walked slowly back towards The Fisherman s Rest As she drew near the sound of revelry of gay jovial laughter grew louder and more distinct She could distinguish Sir Andrew Ffoulkes pleasant voice Lord Tony s boisterous guffaws her husband s occasional drawly sleepy comments then realising the loneliness of the road and the fast gathering gloom round her she quickened her steps the next moment she perceived a stranger coming rapidly towards her Marguerite did not look up she was not the least nervous and The Fisherman s Rest was now well within call The stranger paused when he saw Marguerite coming quickly towards him and just as she was about to slip past him he said very quietly Citoyenne saint Just Marguerite uttered a little cry of astonishment at thus hearing her own familiar maiden name uttered so close to her She looked up at the stranger and this time with a cry of unfeigned pleasure she put out both her hands effusively towards him Chauvelin she exclaimed Himself citoyenne at your service said the stranger gallantly kissing the tips of her fingers Marguerite said nothing for a moment or two as she surveyed with obvious delight the not very prepossessing little figure before her Chauvelin was then nearer forty than thirty a clever shrewd looking personality with a curious fox like expression in the deep sunken eyes He was the same stranger who an hour or two previously had joined mister Jellyband in a friendly glass of wine Chauvelin my friend said Marguerite with a pretty little sigh of satisfaction I am mightily pleased to see you No doubt poor Marguerite saint Just lonely in the midst of her grandeur and of her starchy friends was happy to see a face that brought back memories of that happy time in Paris when she reigned a queen over the intellectual coterie of the Rue de Richelieu She did not notice the sarcastic little smile however that hovered round the thin lips of Chauvelin But tell me she added merrily what in the world or whom in the world are you doing here in England I might return the subtle compliment fair lady he said What of yourself Oh I she said with a shrug of the shoulders Je m ennuie mon ami that is all They had reached the porch of The Fisherman s Rest but Marguerite seemed loth to go within The evening air was lovely after the storm and she had found a friend who exhaled the breath of Paris who knew Armand well who could talk of all the merry brilliant friends whom she had left behind So she lingered on under the pretty porch while through the gaily lighted dormer window of the coffee room sounds of laughter of calls for Sally and for beer of tapping of mugs and clinking of dice mingled with Sir Percy Blakeney s inane and mirthless laugh Chauvelin stood beside her his shrewd pale yellow eyes fixed on the pretty face which looked so sweet and childlike in this soft English summer twilight You surprise me citoyenne he said quietly as he took a pinch of snuff Do I now she retorted gaily Faith my little Chauvelin I should have thought that with your penetration you would have guessed that an atmosphere composed of fogs and virtues would never suit Marguerite saint Just Dear me is it as bad as that he asked in mock consternation Quite she retorted and worse Strange Now I thought that a pretty woman would have found English country life peculiarly attractive Yes so did I she said with a sigh Pretty women she added meditatively ought to have a good time in England since all the pleasant things are forbidden them the very things they do every day Quite so You ll hardly believe it my little Chauvelin she said earnestly but I often pass a whole day a whole day without encountering a single temptation No wonder retorted Chauvelin gallantly that the cleverest woman in Europe is troubled with ENNUI She laughed one of her melodious rippling childlike laughs It must be pretty bad mustn t it she asked archly or I should not have been so pleased to see you And this within a year of a romantic love match that s just the difficulty Ah that idyllic folly said Chauvelin with quiet sarcasm did not then survive the lapse of weeks Idyllic follies never last my little Chauvelin They come upon us like the measles and are as easily cured Chauvelin took another pinch of snuff he seemed very much addicted to that pernicious habit so prevalent in those days perhaps too he found the taking of snuff a convenient veil for disguising the quick shrewd glances with which he strove to read the very souls of those with whom he came in contact No wonder he repeated with the same gallantry that the most active brain in Europe is troubled with ENNUI I was in hopes that you had a prescription against the malady my little Chauvelin How can I hope to succeed in that which Sir Percy Blakeney has failed to accomplish Shall we leave Sir Percy out of the question for the present my dear friend she said drily Ah my dear lady pardon me but that is just what we cannot very well do said Chauvelin whilst once again his eyes keen as those of a fox on the alert darted a quick glance at Marguerite I have a most perfect prescription against the worst form of ENNUI which I would have been happy to submit to you but But what There IS Sir Percy What has he to do with it Quite a good deal I am afraid The prescription I would offer fair lady is called by a very plebeian name Work Work Chauvelin looked at Marguerite long and scrutinisingly It seemed as if those keen pale eyes of his were reading every one of her thoughts They were alone together the evening air was quite still and their soft whispers were drowned in the noise which came from the coffee room Still Chauvelin took a step or two from under the porch looked quickly and keenly all round him then seeing that indeed no one was within earshot he once more came back close to Marguerite Will you render France a small service citoyenne he asked with a sudden change of manner which lent his thin fox like face a singular earnestness La man she replied flippantly how serious you look all of a sudden Indeed I do not know if I WOULD render France a small service at any rate it depends upon the kind of service she or you want Have you ever heard of the Scarlet Pimpernel Citoyenne saint Just asked Chauvelin abruptly Heard of the Scarlet Pimpernel she retorted with a long and merry laugh Faith man we talk of nothing else We have hats a la Scarlet Pimpernel our horses are called Scarlet Pimpernel at the Prince of Wales supper party the other night we had a souffle a la Scarlet Pimpernel Lud she added gaily the other day I ordered at my milliner s a blue dress trimmed with green and bless me if she did not call that a la Scarlet Pimpernel Chauvelin had not moved while she prattled merrily along he did not even attempt to stop her when her musical voice and her childlike laugh went echoing through the still evening air But he remained serious and earnest whilst she laughed and his voice clear incisive and hard was not raised above his breath as he said Then as you have heard of that enigmatical personage citoyenne you must also have guessed and know that the man who hides his identity under that strange pseudonym is the most bitter enemy of our republic of France of men like Armand saint Just La she said with a quaint little sigh I dare swear he is France has many bitter enemies these days But you citoyenne are a daughter of France and should be ready to help her in a moment of deadly peril My brother Armand devotes his life to France she retorted proudly as for me I can do nothing here in England Yes you he urged still more earnestly whilst his thin fox like face seemed suddenly to have grown impressive and full of dignity here in England citoyenne you alone can help us Listen I have been sent over here by the Republican Government as its representative I present my credentials to mister Pitt in London to morrow One of my duties here is to find out all about this League of the Scarlet Pimpernel which has become a standing menace to France since it is pledged to help our cursed aristocrats traitors to their country and enemies of the people to escape from the just punishment which they deserve You know as well as I do citoyenne that once they are over here those French EMIGRES try to rouse public feeling against the Republic They are ready to join issue with any enemy bold enough to attack France Now within the last month scores of these EMIGRES some only suspected of treason others actually condemned by the Tribunal of Public Safety have succeeded in crossing the Channel Their escape in each instance was planned organized and effected by this society of young English jackanapes headed by a man whose brain seems as resourceful as his identity is mysterious All the most strenuous efforts on the part of my spies have failed to discover who he is whilst the others are the hands he is the head who beneath this strange anonymity calmly works at the destruction of France I mean to strike at that head and for this I want your help through him afterwards I can reach the rest of the gang he is a young buck in English society of that I feel sure Find that man for me citoyenne he urged find him for France Marguerite had listened to Chauvelin s impassioned speech without uttering a word scarce making a movement hardly daring to breathe She had told him before that this mysterious hero of romance was the talk of the smart set to which she belonged already before this her heart and her imagination had been stirred by the thought of the brave man who unknown to fame had rescued hundreds of lives from a terrible often an unmerciful fate She had but little real sympathy with those haughty French aristocrats insolent in their pride of caste of whom the Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive was so typical an example but republican and liberal minded though she was from principle she hated and loathed the methods which the young Republic had chosen for establishing itself She had not been in Paris for some months the horrors and bloodshed of the Reign of Terror culminating in the September massacres had only come across the Channel to her as a faint echo Robespierre Danton Marat she had not known in their new guise of bloody judiciaries merciless wielders of the guillotine Her very soul recoiled in horror from these excesses to which she feared her brother Armand moderate republican as he was might become one day the holocaust Then when first she heard of this band of young English enthusiasts who for sheer love of their fellowmen dragged women and children old and young men from a horrible death her heart had glowed with pride for them and now as Chauvelin spoke her very soul went out to the gallant and mysterious leader of the reckless little band who risked his life daily who gave it freely and without ostentation for the sake of humanity Her eyes were moist when Chauvelin had finished speaking the lace at her bosom rose and fell with her quick excited breathing she no longer heard the noise of drinking from the inn she did not heed her husband s voice or his inane laugh her thoughts had gone wandering in search of the mysterious hero Ah there was a man she might have loved had he come her way everything in him appealed to her romantic imagination his personality his strength his bravery the loyalty of those who served under him in that same noble cause and above all that anonymity which crowned him as if with a halo of romantic glory Find him for France citoyenne Chauvelin s voice close to her ear roused her from her dreams The mysterious hero had vanished and not twenty yards away from her a man was drinking and laughing to whom she had sworn faith and loyalty La man she said with a return of her assumed flippancy you are astonishing Where in the world am I to look for him You go everywhere citoyenne whispered Chauvelin insinuatingly Lady Blakeney is the pivot of social London so I am told you see everything you HEAR everything Easy my friend retorted Marguerite drawing herself up to her full height and looking down with a slight thought of contempt on the small thin figure before her Easy you seem to forget that there are six feet of Sir Percy Blakeney and a long line of ancestors to stand between Lady Blakeney and such a thing as you propose For the sake of France citoyenne reiterated Chauvelin earnestly Tush man you talk nonsense anyway for even if you did know who this Scarlet Pimpernel is you could do nothing to him an Englishman I d take my chance of that said Chauvelin with a dry rasping little laugh At any rate we could send him to the guillotine first to cool his ardour then when there is a diplomatic fuss about it we can apologise humbly to the British Government and if necessary pay compensation to the bereaved family What you propose is horrible Chauvelin she said drawing away from him as from some noisome insect Whoever the man may be he is brave and noble and never do you hear me never would I lend a hand to such villainy You prefer to be insulted by every French aristocrat who comes to this country Chauvelin had taken sure aim when he shot this tiny shaft Marguerite s fresh young cheeks became a touch more pale and she bit her under lip for she would not let him see that the shaft had struck home That is beside the question she said at last with indifference I can defend myself but I refuse to do any dirty work for you or for France You have other means at your disposal you must use them my friend And without another look at Chauvelin Marguerite Blakeney turned her back on him and walked straight into the inn That is not your last word citoyenne said Chauvelin as a flood of light from the passage illumined her elegant richly clad figure we meet in London I hope We meet in London she said speaking over her shoulder at him but that is my last word She threw open the coffee room door and disappeared from his view but he remained under the porch for a moment or two taking a pinch of snuff He had received a rebuke and a snub but his shrewd fox like face looked neither abashed nor disappointed on the contrary a curious smile half sarcastic and wholly satisfied played around the corners of his thin lips CHAPTER IX THE OUTRAGE A beautiful starlit night had followed on the day of incessant rain a cool balmy late summer s night essentially English in its suggestion of moisture and scent of wet earth and dripping leaves 
7277-105388-0001	train-other-500	The magnificent coach drawn by four of the finest thoroughbreds in England had driven off along the London road with Sir Percy Blakeney on the box holding the reins in his slender feminine hands and beside him Lady Blakeney wrapped in costly furs
none	none	 A fifty mile drive on a starlit summer s night 
7277-105388-0002	train-other-500	Marguerite had hailed the notion of it with delight
none	none	 Sir Percy was an enthusiastic whip his four thoroughbreds which had been sent down to Dover a couple of days before 
7277-105388-0003	train-other-500	were just sufficiently fresh and restive to add zest to the expedition and Marguerite revelled in anticipation of the few hours of solitude with the soft night breeze fanning her cheeks her thoughts wandering whither away
7277-105388-0004	train-other-500	She knew from old experience that Sir Percy would speak little if at all he had often driven her on his beautiful coach for hours at night from point to point without making more than one or two casual remarks upon the weather or the state of the roads
none	none	 He was very fond of driving by night and she had very quickly adopted his fancy as she sat next to him hour after hour 
7277-105388-0005	train-other-500	admiring the dexterous certain way in which he handled the reins she often wondered what went on in that slow going head of his He never told her and she had never cared to ask At The Fisherman s Rest mister Jellyband was going the round putting out the lights
7277-105388-0006	train-other-500	His bar customers had all gone but upstairs in the snug little bedrooms mister Jellyband had quite a few important guests the Comtesse de Tournay with Suzannne and the Vicomte
none	none	 and there were two more bedrooms ready for Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Antony Dewhurst if the two young men should elect to honour the ancient hostelry and stay the night For the moment these two young gallants were comfortably installed in the coffee room before the huge log fire which in spite of the mildness of the evening 
7277-105388-0007	train-other-500	had been allowed to burn merrily I say Jelly has everyone gone asked Lord Tony as the worthy landlord still busied himself clearing away glasses and mugs Everyone as you see my lord And all your servants gone to bed
7277-105388-0008	train-other-500	All except the boy on duty in the bar and added mister Jellyband with a laugh I expect he ll be asleep afore long the rascal Then we can talk here undisturbed for half an hour At your service my lord I ll leave your candles on the dresser and your rooms are quite ready
7277-105388-0009	train-other-500	I sleep at the top of the house myself but if your lordship ll only call loudly enough I daresay I shall hear All right Jelly and I say put the lamp out the fire ll give us all the light we need and we don t want to attract the passer by
none	none	 Al ri my lord mister Jellyband did as he was bid he turned out the quaint old lamp that hung from the raftered ceiling and blew out all the candles Let s have a bottle of wine Jelly suggested Sir Andrew Al ri sir 
7277-105388-0010	train-other-500	Jellyband went off to fetch the wine The room now was quite dark save for the circle of ruddy and fitful light formed by the brightly blazing logs in the hearth Is that all gentlemen asked Jellyband as he returned with a bottle of wine and a couple of glasses which he placed on the table
7277-105388-0011	train-other-500	That ll do nicely thanks Jelly said Lord Tony Good night my lord Good night sir Good night Jelly The two young men listened whilst the heavy tread of mister Jellyband was heard echoing along the passage and staircase
7277-105388-0012	train-other-500	Presently even that sound died out and the whole of The Fisherman s Rest seemed wrapt in sleep save the two young men drinking in silence beside the hearth For a while no sound was heard even in the coffee room save the ticking of the old grandfather s clock and the crackling of the burning wood
none	none	 All right again this time Ffoulkes asked Lord Antony at last 
7277-105388-0013	train-other-500	Sir Andrew had been dreaming evidently gazing into the fire and seeing therein no doubt a pretty piquant face with large brown eyes and a wealth of dark curls round a childish forehead Yes he said still musing all right
7277-105388-0014	train-other-500	No hitch None Lord Antony laughed pleasantly as he poured himself out another glass of wine
none	none	 I need not ask I suppose whether you found the journey pleasant this time 
7277-105388-0015	train-other-500	No friend you need not ask replied Sir Andrew gaily It was all right Then here s to her very good health said jovial Lord Tony She s a bonnie lass though she IS a French one And here s to your courtship may it flourish and prosper exceedingly
7277-105388-0016	train-other-500	He drained his glass to the last drop then joined his friend beside the hearth Well you ll be doing the journey next Tony I expect said Sir Andrew rousing himself from his meditations you and Hastings certainly
none	none	 and I hope you may have as pleasant a task as I had and as charming a travelling companion You have no idea Tony 
7277-105388-0017	train-other-500	No I haven t interrupted his friend pleasantly but I ll take your word for it And now he added whilst a sudden earnestness crept over his jovial young face how about business The two young men drew their chairs closer together and instinctively though they were alone their voices sank to a whisper
none	none	 I saw the Scarlet Pimpernel alone for a few moments in Calais said Sir Andrew a day or two ago He crossed over to England two days before we did He had escorted the party all the way from Paris dressed you ll never credit it as an old market woman and driving until they were safely out of the city the covered cart under which the Comtesse de Tournay Mlle Suzanne 
7277-105388-0018	train-other-500	and the Vicomte lay concealed among the turnips and cabbages They themselves of course never suspected who their driver was He drove them right through a line of soldiery and a yelling mob who were screaming A bas les aristos
none	none	 But the market cart got through along with some others and the Scarlet Pimpernel in shawl petticoat and hood yelled A bas les aristos louder than anybody Faith added the young man as his eyes glowed with enthusiasm for the beloved leader that man s a marvel His cheek is preposterous I vow and that s what carries him through Lord Antony whose vocabulary was more limited than that of his friend could only find an oath or two with which to show his admiration for his leader 
7277-105388-0019	train-other-500	He wants you and Hastings to meet him at Calais said Sir Andrew more quietly on the second of next month Let me see that will be next Wednesday Yes It is of course the case of the Comte de Tournay this time a dangerous task for the Comte
7277-105388-0020	train-other-500	whose escape from his chateau after he had been declared a suspect by the Committee of Public Safety was a masterpiece of the Scarlet Pimpernel s ingenuity
none	none	 is now under sentence of death It will be rare sport to get HIM out of France and you will have a narrow escape if you get through at all 
7277-105388-0021	train-other-500	saint Just has actually gone to meet him of course no one suspects saint Just as yet but after that to get them both out of the country I faith twill be a tough job and tax even the ingenuity of our chief I hope I may yet have orders to be of the party
7277-105388-0022	train-other-500	Have you any special instructions for me Yes rather more precise ones than usual It appears that the Republican Government have sent an accredited agent over to England a man named Chauvelin
7277-105388-0023	train-other-500	who is said to be terribly bitter against our league and determined to discover the identity of our leader so that he may have him kidnapped the next time he attempts to set foot in France This Chauvelin has brought a whole army of spies with him
7277-105388-0024	train-other-500	and until the chief has sampled the lot he thinks we should meet as seldom as possible on the business of the league and on no account should talk to each other in public places for a time When he wants to speak to us he will contrive to let us know
none	none	 The two young men were both bending over the fire for the blaze had died down and only a red glow from the dying embers cast a lurid light on a narrow semicircle in front of the hearth 
7277-105388-0025	train-other-500	The rest of the room lay buried in complete gloom Sir Andrew had taken a pocket book from his pocket and drawn therefrom a paper which he unfolded and together they tried to read it by the dim red firelight
7277-105388-0026	train-other-500	So intent were they upon this so wrapt up in the cause the business they had so much at heart so precious was this document which came from the very hand of their adored leader that they had eyes and ears only for that They lost count of the sounds around them
7277-105388-0027	train-other-500	of the dropping of the crisp ash from the grate of the monotonous ticking of the clock of the soft almost imperceptible rustle of something on the floor close beside them A figure had emerged from under one of the benches
7277-105388-0028	train-other-500	with snake like noiseless movements it crept closer and closer to the two young men not breathing only gliding along the floor in the inky blackness of the room You are to read these instructions and commit them to memory said Sir Andrew then destroy them
none	none	 He was about to replace the letter case into his pocket 
7277-105388-0029	train-other-500	when a tiny slip of paper fluttered from it and fell on to the floor Lord Antony stooped and picked it up What s that he asked I don t know replied Sir Andrew It dropped out of your pocket just now It certainly does not seem to be with the other paper
7277-105388-0030	train-other-500	Strange I wonder when it got there It is from the chief he added glancing at the paper Both stooped to try and decipher this last tiny scrap of paper on which a few words had been hastily scrawled when suddenly a slight noise attracted their attention
7277-105388-0031	train-other-500	which seemed to come from the passage beyond What s that said both instinctively Lord Antony crossed the room towards the door which he threw open quickly and suddenly at that very moment he received a stunning blow between the eyes which threw him back violently into the room
7277-105388-0032	train-other-500	Simultaneously the crouching snake like figure in the gloom had jumped up and hurled itself from behind upon the unsuspecting Sir Andrew felling him to the ground
none	none	 All this occurred within the short space of two or three seconds and before either Lord Antony or Sir Andrew had time or chance to utter a cry or to make the faintest struggle 
7277-105388-0033	train-other-500	They were each seized by two men a muffler was quickly tied round the mouth of each and they were pinioned to one another back to back their arms hands and legs securely fastened One man had in the meanwhile quietly shut the door
7277-105388-0034	train-other-500	he wore a mask and now stood motionless while the others completed their work All safe citoyen said one of the men as he took a final survey of the bonds which secured the two young men Good replied the man at the door now search their pockets and give me all the papers you find
7277-105388-0035	train-other-500	This was promptly and quietly done The masked man having taken possession of all the papers listened for a moment or two if there were any sound within The Fisherman s Rest Evidently satisfied that this dastardly outrage had remained unheard
7277-105388-0036	train-other-500	he once more opened the door and pointed peremptorily down the passage The four men lifted Sir Andrew and Lord Antony from the ground and as quietly as noiselessly as they had come they bore the two pinioned young gallants out of the inn and along the Dover Road into the gloom beyond
7277-105388-0037	train-other-500	In the coffee room the masked leader of this daring attempt was quickly glancing through the stolen papers
none	none	 Not a bad day s work on the whole he muttered as he quietly took off his mask and his pale fox like eyes glittered in the red glow of the fire Not a bad day s work He opened one or two letters from Sir Andrew Ffoulkes pocket book 
7277-105388-0038	train-other-500	noted the tiny scrap of paper which the two young men had only just had time to read but one letter specially signed Armand saint Just seemed to give him strange satisfaction
none	none	 Armand saint Just a traitor after all he murmured Now fair Marguerite Blakeney he added viciously between his clenched teeth I think that you will help me to find the Scarlet Pimpernel CHAPTER X IN THE OPERA BOX It was one of the gala 
7699-105389-0000	train-other-500	nights at Covent Garden Theatre the first of the autumn season in this memorable year of grace seventeen ninety two The house was packed both in the smart orchestra boxes and in the pit
none	none	 as well as in the more plebeian balconies and galleries above Gluck s ORPHEUS made a strong appeal to the more intellectual portions of the house whilst the fashionable women the gaily dressed and brilliant throng spoke to the eye of those who cared but little for this latest importation from Germany 
7699-105389-0001	train-other-500	Selina Storace had been duly applauded after her grand ARIA by her numerous admirers Benjamin Incledon the acknowledged favourite of the ladies had received special gracious recognition from the royal box
7699-105389-0002	train-other-500	and now the curtain came down after the glorious finale to the second act
7699-105389-0003	train-other-500	and the audience which had hung spell bound on the magic strains of the great maestro seemed collectively to breathe a long sigh of satisfaction previous to letting loose its hundreds of waggish and frivolous tongues
7699-105389-0004	train-other-500	In the smart orchestra boxes many well known faces were to be seen mister Pitt overweighted with cares of state was finding brief relaxation in to night s musical treat the Prince of Wales
7699-105389-0005	train-other-500	jovial rotund somewhat coarse and commonplace in appearance moved about from box to box spending brief quarters of an hour with those of his more intimate friends In Lord Grenville s box too a
7699-105389-0006	train-other-500	curious interesting personality attracted everyone s attention a thin small figure with shrewd sarcastic face and deep set eyes attentive to the music
7699-105389-0007	train-other-500	keenly critical of the audience dressed in immaculate black with dark hair free from any powder Lord Grenville Foreign Secretary of State
none	none	 paid him marked though frigid deference Here and there dotted about among distinctly English types of beauty 
7699-105389-0008	train-other-500	one or two foreign faces stood out in marked contrast the haughty aristocratic cast of countenance of the many French royalist EMIGRES who
7699-105389-0009	train-other-500	persecuted by the relentless revolutionary faction of their country had found a peaceful refuge in England
none	none	 On these faces sorrow and care were deeply writ the women especially paid but little heed either to the music or to the brilliant audience 
7699-105389-0010	train-other-500	no doubt their thoughts were far away with husband brother son maybe still in peril or lately succumbed to a cruel fate
none	none	 Among these the Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive but lately arrived from France was a most conspicuous figure 
7699-105389-0011	train-other-500	dressed in deep heavy black silk with only a white lace kerchief to relieve the aspect of mourning about her person
7699-105389-0012	train-other-500	she sat beside Lady Portarles who was vainly trying by witty sallies and somewhat broad jokes to bring a smile to the Comtesse s sad mouth
7699-105389-0013	train-other-500	Behind her sat little Suzanne and the Vicomte both silent and somewhat shy among so many strangers Suzanne s eyes seemed wistful when she first entered the crowded house
7699-105389-0014	train-other-500	she had looked eagerly all around scanning every face scrutinised every box Evidently the one face she wished to see was not there for she settled herself quietly behind her mother listened apathetically to the music
7699-105389-0015	train-other-500	and took no further interest in the audience itself Ah Lord Grenville said Lady Portarles as following a discreet knock
7699-105389-0016	train-other-500	the clever interesting head of the Secretary of State appeared in the doorway of the box you could not arrive more A PROPOS Here is Madame la Comtesse de Tournay positively dying
none	none	 to hear the latest news from France 
7699-105389-0017	train-other-500	The distinguished diplomat had come forward and was shaking hands with the ladies Alas he said sadly it is of the very worst The massacres continue Paris literally reeks with blood
7699-105389-0018	train-other-500	and the guillotine claims a hundred victims a day Pale and tearful the Comtesse was leaning back in her chair listening horror struck to this brief and graphic account of what went on in her own misguided country Ah monsieur
7699-105389-0019	train-other-500	she said in broken English it is dreadful to hear all that and my poor husband still in that awful country It is terrible for me to be sitting here in a theatre all safe and in peace whilst he is in such peril
none	none	 Lud Madame said honest bluff Lady Portarles your sitting in a convent won t make your husband safe and you have your children to consider they are too young to be dosed with anxiety and premature mourning 
7699-105389-0020	train-other-500	The Comtesse smiled through her tears at the vehemence of her friend
7699-105389-0021	train-other-500	Lady Portarles whose voice and manner would not have misfitted a jockey had a heart of gold and hid the most genuine sympathy and most gentle kindliness beneath the somewhat coarse manners affected by some ladies at that time Besides which Madame added Lord Grenville
none	none	 did you not tell me yesterday that the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel had pledged their honour to bring M le Comte safely across the Channel Ah yes replied the Comtesse
7555_105394_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 and that is 
none	none	my only hope I saw Lord Hastings yesterday he reassured me again 
7699-105389-0022	train-other-500	Then I am sure you need have no fear What the league have sworn that they surely will accomplish Ah added the old diplomat with a sigh
7699-105389-0023	train-other-500	if I were but a few years younger La man interrupted honest Lady Portarles you are still young enough to turn your back
none	none	 on that French scarecrow that sits enthroned in your box to night I wish I could but your ladyship must remember that in serving our country we must put prejudices aside M Chauvelin 
7699-105389-0024	train-other-500	is the accredited agent of his Government Odd s fish man she retorted you don t call those bloodthirsty ruffians over there a government do you It has not been thought advisable as yet
7699-105389-0025	train-other-500	said the Minister guardedly for England to break off diplomatic relations with France
none	none	 and we cannot therefore refuse to receive with courtesy the agent she wishes to send to us Diplomatic relations be demmed my lord That sly little fox over there is nothing but a spy I ll warrant and you ll find an I m much mistaken 
7699-105389-0026	train-other-500	that he ll concern himself little with such diplomacy beyond trying to do mischief to royalist refugees to our heroic Scarlet Pimpernel and to the members of that brave little league
7699-105389-0027	train-other-500	I am sure said the Comtesse pursing up her thin lips
none	none	 that if this Chauvelin wishes to do us mischief 
7699-105389-0028	train-other-500	he will find a faithful ally in Lady Blakeney Bless the woman ejaculated Lady Portarles did ever anyone see such perversity
none	none	 My Lord Grenville you have the gift of gab will you please explain to Madame la Comtesse that she is acting like a fool 
7699-105389-0029	train-other-500	In your position here in England Madame she added turning a wrathful and resolute face towards the Comtesse
none	none	 you cannot afford to put on the hoity toity airs you French aristocrats are so fond of 
7699-105389-0030	train-other-500	Lady Blakeney may or may not be in sympathy with those Ruffians in France she may or may not have had anything to do with the arrest and condemnation of saint Cyr or whatever the man s name is
none	none	 but she is the leader of fashion in this country Sir Percy Blakeney has more money than any half dozen other men put together he is hand and glove with royalty and your trying to snub Lady Blakeney will not harm her but will make you look a fool Isn t that so my Lord But what Lord Grenville thought of this matter or to what reflections this comely tirade of Lady Portarles led the Comtesse de Tournay remained unspoken for the curtain had just risen on the third act of ORPHEUS and admonishments to silence came from every part of the house Lord Grenville took a hasty farewell of the ladies and slipped back into his box where M Chauvelin had sat through this ENTR ACTE with his eternal snuff box in his hand and with his keen pale eyes intently fixed upon a box opposite him where with much frou frou of silken skirts much laughter and general stir of curiosity amongst the audience Marguerite Blakeney had just entered accompanied by her husband and looking divinely pretty beneath the wealth of her golden reddish curls slightly besprinkled with powder 
7699-105389-0031	train-other-500	and tied back at the nape of her graceful neck with a gigantic black bow Always dressed in the very latest vagary of fashion Marguerite alone among the ladies that night had discarded the crossover fichu and broad lapelled over dress
none	none	 which had been in fashion for the last two or three years She wore the short waisted classical shaped gown which so soon was to become the approved mode in every country in Europe It suited her graceful regal figure to perfection 
7699-105389-0032	train-other-500	composed as it was of shimmering stuff which seemed a mass of rich gold embroidery As she entered she leant for a moment out of the box taking stock
7699-105389-0033	train-other-500	of all those present whom she knew Many bowed to her as she did so and from the royal box there came also a quick and gracious salute Chauvelin watched her intently all through the commencement of the third act
7699-105389-0034	train-other-500	as she sat enthralled with the music her exquisite little hand toying with a small jewelled fan her regal head her throat arms and neck
7699-105389-0035	train-other-500	covered with magnificent diamonds and rare gems the gift of the adoring husband who sprawled leisurely by her side Marguerite was passionately fond of music
7699-105389-0036	train-other-500	ORPHEUS charmed her to night The very joy of living was writ plainly upon the sweet young face
none	none	 it sparkled out of the merry blue eyes and lit up the smile that lurked around the lips She was after all but five and twenty in the hey day of youth the darling of a brilliant throng adored FETED petted cherished Two days ago the DAY DREAM had returned from Calais bringing her news that her idolised brother had safely landed that he thought of her and would be prudent for her sake What wonder for the moment and listening to Gluck s impassioned strains that she forgot her disillusionments forgot her vanished love dreams forgot even the lazy good humoured nonentity who had made up for his lack of spiritual attainments by lavishing worldly advantages upon her He had stayed beside her in the box just as long as convention demanded making way for His Royal Highness and for the host of admirers who in a continued procession came to pay homage to the queen of fashion Sir Percy had strolled away to talk to more congenial friends probably Marguerite did not even wonder whither he had gone she cared so little she had had a little court round her composed of the JEUNESSE DOREE of London and had just dismissed them all wishing to be alone with Gluck for a brief while 
7699-105389-0037	train-other-500	A discreet knock at the door roused her from her enjoyment Come in she said with some impatience without turning to look at the intruder Chauvelin waiting for his opportunity noted that she was alone
7699-105389-0038	train-other-500	and now without pausing for that impatient Come in he quietly slipped into the box
none	none	 and the next moment was standing behind Marguerite s chair 
7699-105389-0039	train-other-500	A word with you citoyenne he said quietly Marguerite turned quickly in alarm which was not altogether feigned Lud man you
none	none	 frightened me she said with a forced little laugh your presence is entirely inopportune I want to listen to Gluck and have no mind for talking But this is my only opportunity he said as quietly and without waiting for permission he drew a chair close behind her so close that he could whisper in her ear without disturbing the audience 
7699-105389-0040	train-other-500	and without being seen in the dark background of the box
none	none	 This is my only opportunity he repeated as she vouchsafed him no reply 
7699-105389-0041	train-other-500	Lady Blakeney is always so surrounded so FETED by her court that a mere old friend has but very little chance Faith man
7699-105389-0042	train-other-500	she said impatiently you must seek for another opportunity then I am going to Lord Grenville s ball to night after the opera So are you probably I ll give you five minutes then
7699-105389-0043	train-other-500	Three minutes in the privacy of this box are quite sufficient for me he rejoined placidly and I think that you will be wise to listen to me Citoyenne saint Just
7699-105389-0044	train-other-500	Marguerite instinctively shivered Chauvelin had not raised his voice above a whisper
7699-105389-0045	train-other-500	he was now quietly taking a pinch of snuff yet there was something in his attitude something in those pale foxy eyes which seemed to freeze the blood in her veins as would the sight of some deadly hitherto unguessed peril Is that a threat citoyen she asked at last
7699-105389-0046	train-other-500	Nay fair lady he said gallantly only an arrow shot into the air He paused a moment like a cat
7699-105389-0047	train-other-500	which sees a mouse running heedlessly by ready to spring yet waiting with that feline sense of enjoyment of mischief about to be done
7699-105389-0048	train-other-500	Then he said quietly Your brother saint Just is in peril Not a muscle moved in the beautiful face before him
none	none	 He could only see it in profile for Marguerite seemed to be watching the stage intently but Chauvelin was a keen observer he noticed the sudden rigidity of the eyes the hardening of the mouth 
7699-105389-0049	train-other-500	the sharp almost paralysed tension of the beautiful graceful figure Lud then she said with affected merriment since tis one of your imaginary plots you d best go back to your own seat and leave me enjoy the music
none	none	 And with her hand she began to beat time nervously against the cushion of the box Selina Storace was singing the Che faro to an audience that hung spellbound upon the prima donna s lips 
7699-105389-0050	train-other-500	Chauvelin did not move from his seat he quietly watched that tiny nervous hand the only indication that his shaft had indeed struck home Well
7699-105389-0051	train-other-500	she said suddenly and irrelevantly and with the same feigned unconcern Well citoyenne he rejoined placidly About my brother I have news of him for you which I think will interest you but first let me explain
none	none	 May I 
7699-105389-0052	train-other-500	The question was unnecessary He felt though Marguerite still held her head steadily averted from him
none	none	 that her every nerve was strained to hear what he had to say The other day citoyenne 
7699-105389-0053	train-other-500	he said I asked for your help France needed it and I thought I could rely on you but you gave me your answer
none	none	 Since then the exigencies of my own affairs and your own social duties have kept up apart although many things have happened To the point I pray you citoyen 
7699-105389-0054	train-other-500	she said lightly the music is entrancing and the audience will get impatient of your talk One moment citoyenne The day on which I had the honour of meeting you at Dover
none	none	 and less than an hour after I had your final answer I obtained possession of some papers which revealed another of those subtle schemes for the escape of a batch of French aristocrats that traitor de Tournay amongst others all organized by that arch meddler the Scarlet Pimpernel Some of the threads too of this mysterious organization have come into my hands but not all 
7699-105389-0055	train-other-500	and I want you nay you MUST help me to gather them together
none	none	 Marguerite seemed to have listened to him with marked impatience 
7699-105389-0056	train-other-500	she now shrugged her shoulders and said gaily Bah man
none	none	 Have I not already told you that I care nought about your schemes or about the Scarlet Pimpernel And had you not spoken about my brother A little patience I entreat citoyenne he continued imperturbably Two gentlemen Lord Antony Dewhurst and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes were at The Fisherman s Rest at Dover that same night I know I saw them there They were already known to my spies as members of that accursed league It was Sir Andrew Ffoulkes who escorted the Comtesse de Tournay and her children across the Channel When the two young men were alone 
7699-105389-0057	train-other-500	my spies forced their way into the coffee room of the inn gagged and pinioned the two gallants seized their papers and brought them to me In a moment she had guessed the danger Papers Had Armand been imprudent
7699-105389-0058	train-other-500	The very thought struck her with nameless terror Still she would not let this man see that she feared she laughed gaily and lightly Faith and your impudence pases belief she said merrily
7699-105389-0059	train-other-500	Robbery and violence
none	none	 in England in a crowded inn Your men might have been caught in the act What if they had They are children of France and have been trained by your humble servant Had they been caught they would have gone to jail or even to the gallows 
7699-105389-0060	train-other-500	without a word of protest or indiscretion at any rate it was well worth the risk A crowded inn is safer for these little operations than you think and my men have experience Well And those papers
7699-105389-0061	train-other-500	she asked carelessly Unfortunately though they have given me cognisance of certain names certain movements
none	none	 enough I think to thwart their projected COUP for the moment it would only be for the moment 
7699-105389-0062	train-other-500	and still leaves me in ignorance of the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel La my friend she said with the same assumed flippancy of manner then you are where you were before aren t you
7699-105389-0063	train-other-500	and you can let me enjoy the last strophe of the ARIA Faith she added ostentatiously smothering an imaginary yawn had you not spoken about my brother I am coming to him now citoyenne Among the papers
none	none	 there was a letter to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes 
7699-105389-0064	train-other-500	written by your brother saint Just Well And That letter shows him to be not only in sympathy with the enemies of France but actually a helper
7699-105389-0065	train-other-500	if not a member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel The blow had been struck at last All along Marguerite had been expecting it she would not show fear
none	none	 she was determined to seem unconcerned 
7699-105389-0066	train-other-500	flippant even She wished when the shock came
none	none	 to be prepared for it to have all her wits about her 
7699-105389-0067	train-other-500	those wits which had been nicknamed the keenest in Europe Even now she did not flinch She knew that Chauvelin had spoken the truth the man was too earnest too blindly devoted to the misguided cause he had at heart too proud of his countrymen
7699-105389-0068	train-other-500	of those makers of revolutions to stoop to low purposeless falsehoods That letter of Armand s foolish imprudent Armand was in Chauvelin s hands Marguerite knew that as if she had seen the letter with her own eyes
7699-105389-0069	train-other-500	and Chauvelin would hold that letter for purposes of his own until it suited him to destroy it or to make use of it against Armand All that she knew and yet she continued to laugh more gaily more loudly than she had done before
7699-105389-0070	train-other-500	La man she said speaking over her shoulder and looking him full and squarely in the face
none	none	 did I not say it was some imaginary plot Armand in league with that enigmatic Scarlet Pimpernel Armand busy helping those French aristocrats whom he despises Faith the tale does 
7699-105389-0071	train-other-500	infinite credit to your imagination Let me make my point clear citoyenne said Chauvelin with the same unruffled calm I must assure you that saint Just is compromised beyond
7699-105389-0072	train-other-500	the slightest hope of pardon Inside the orchestra box all was silent for a moment or two Marguerite sat straight upright rigid and inert trying to think trying to face the situation
none	none	 to realise what had best be done In the house Storace had finished the ARIA 
7699-105389-0073	train-other-500	and was even now bowing in her classic garb but in approved eighteenth century fashion to the enthusiastic audience who cheered her to the echo Chauvelin
none	none	 said Marguerite Blakeney at last quietly and without that touch of bravado which had characterised her attitude all along Chauvelin my friend shall we try to understand one another It seems that my wits have become rusty by contact with this 
7699-105389-0074	train-other-500	damp climate Now tell me you are very anxious to discover the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel isn t that so France s most bitter enemy citoyenne all the more dangerous
7699-105389-0075	train-other-500	as he works in the dark All the more noble you mean Well and you would now force me to do some spying work for you in exchange for my brother Armand s safety Is that it
none	none	 Fie two very ugly words fair lady protested Chauvelin urbanely There can be no question of force and the service which I would ask of you 
7699-105389-0076	train-other-500	in the name of France could never be called by the shocking name of spying At any rate
none	none	 that is what it is called over here she said drily 
7699-105389-0077	train-other-500	That is your intention is it not My intention is that you yourself win the free pardon for Armand saint Just by doing me a small service What is it
none	none	 Only watch for me to night Citoyenne saint Just he said eagerly Listen among the papers which were found about the person of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes 
7699-105389-0078	train-other-500	there was a tiny note See he added taking a tiny scrap of paper from his pocket book and handing it to her It was the same scrap of paper which
7699-105389-0079	train-other-500	four days ago the two young men had been in the act of reading at the very moment when they were attacked by Chauvelin s minions Marguerite took it mechanically and stooped to read it There were only two lines written in a distorted
7699-105389-0080	train-other-500	evidently disguised handwriting she read them half aloud Remember we must not meet more often than is strictly necessary You have all instructions for the second
none	none	 If you wish to speak to me again I shall be at G s ball 
7699-105389-0081	train-other-500	What does it mean she asked Look again citoyenne and you will understand There is a device here in the corner a small red flower Yes The Scarlet Pimpernel she said eagerly
none	none	 and G s ball means Grenville s ball He will be at my Lord Grenville s ball to night 
7699-105389-0082	train-other-500	That is how I interpret the note citoyenne concluded Chauvelin blandly
none	none	 Lord Antony Dewhurst and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes after they were pinioned and searched by my spies were carried by my orders to a lonely house in the Dover Road which I had rented for the purpose 
7699-105389-0083	train-other-500	there they remained close prisoners until this morning But having found this tiny scrap of paper my intention was that they should be in London in time to attend my Lord Grenville s ball

7699-105389-0094	train-other-500	for no escape A precious hostage was being held for her obedience for she knew that this man would never make an empty threat No doubt Armand was already signalled to the Committee of Public Safety as one of the suspect he would not be allowed to leave France again and would be ruthlessly struck if she refused to obey Chauvelin
7699-105389-0095	train-other-500	For a moment woman like she still hoped to temporise She held out her hand to this man

7699-105389-0100	train-other-500	Marguerite shuddered She felt that from this man she could expect no mercy All powerful he held the beloved life in the hollow of his hand She knew him too well

7699-105389-0102	train-other-500	in spite of the oppressive air of opera house The heart appealing strains of the music seemed to reach her as from a distant land She drew her costly lace scarf up around her shoulders and sat silently watching the brilliant scene
none	none	 as if in a dream For a moment her thoughts wandered away from the loved one who was in danger to that other man who also had a claim on her confidence and her affection She felt lonely frightened for Armand s sake she longed to seek comfort

7699-105389-0105	train-other-500	appeared to be absorbed in the sour stirring melodies of ORPHEUS and was beating time to the music with his sharp ferret like head A discreet rap at the door roused Marguerite from her thoughts
none	none	 It was Sir Percy Blakeney tall sleepy good humoured and wearing that half shy half inane smile which just now seemed to irritate her every nerve Er your chair is outside m dear 
7699-105389-0106	train-other-500	he said with his most exasperating drawl I suppose you will want to go to that demmed ball
none	none	 Excuse me er Monsieur Chauvelin 
7699-105389-0107	train-other-500	I had not observed you He extended two slender white fingers toward Chauvelin who had risen when Sir Percy entered the box

7699-105389-0109	train-other-500	commented Sir Percy with a good natured smile Marguerite sighed impatiently Her last hope seemed suddenly to have vanished away She wrapped her cloak round her and without looking at her husband I am ready to go
7699-105389-0110	train-other-500	she said taking his arm At the door of the box she turned and looked straight at Chauvelin
none	none	 who with his CHAPEAU BRAS under his arm and a curious smile round his thin lips was preparing to follow the strangely ill assorted couple It is only AU REVOIR Chauvelin she said pleasantly 
7699-105389-0111	train-other-500	we shall meet at my Lord Grenville s ball anon
none	none	 And in her eyes the astute Frenchman read no doubt something which caused him profound satisfaction for with a sarcastic smile he took a delicate pinch of snuff then having dusted his dainty lace jabot he rubbed his thin bony hands contentedly together CHAPTER XI LORD GRENVILLE S BALL The historic ball given by the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Grenville was the most brilliant function of the year Though the autumn season had only just begun everybody who was anybody had contrived to be in London in time to be present there and to shine at this ball to the best of his or her respective ability 
7688_105390_000005_000000	train-clean-360	His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales had promised to be present He was coming on presently from the opera 
none	none	Lord Grenville himself had listened to the two first acts of ORPHEUS before preparing to receive his guests At ten o clock an unusually late hour in those days the grand rooms of the Foreign Office exquisitely decorated with exotic palms and flowers were filled to overflowing One room had been set apart for dancing and the dainty strains of the minuet made a soft accompaniment to the gay chatter the merry laughter of the numerous and brilliant company In a smaller chamber facing the top of the fine stairway the distinguished host stood ready to receive his guests Distinguished men beautiful women notabilities from every European country had already filed past him had exchanged the elaborate bows and curtsies with him which the extravagant fashion of the time demanded and then laughing and talking had dispersed in the ball reception and card rooms beyond Not far from Lord Grenville s elbow leaning against one of the console tables Chauvelin in his irreproachable black costume was taking a quiet survey of the brilliant throng He noted that Sir Percy and Lady Blakeney had not yet arrived and his keen pale eyes glanced quickly towards the door every time a new comer appeared He stood somewhat isolated the envoy of the Revolutionary Government of France was not likely to be very popular in England at a time when the news of the awful September massacres and of the Reign of Terror and Anarchy had just begun to filtrate across the Channel 
7688_105390_000009_000000	train-clean-360	In his official capacity he had been received courteously by his English colleagues mister Pitt had shaken him by the hand Lord Grenville had entertained him more than once but the more intimate circles of London society ignored him altogether the women openly turned their backs upon him the men who held no official position refused to shake his hand 
none	none	But Chauvelin was not the man to trouble himself about these social amenities which he called mere incidents in his diplomatic career He was blindly enthusiastic for the revolutionary cause he despised all social inequalities and he had a burning love for his own country these three sentiments made him supremely indifferent to the snubs he received in this fog ridden loyalist old fashioned England But above all Chauvelin had a purpose at heart He firmly believed that the French aristocrat was the most bitter enemy of France he would have wished to see every one of them annihilated he was one of those who during this awful Reign of Terror had been the first to utter the historic and ferocious desire that aristocrats might have but one head between them so that it might be cut off with a single stroke of the guillotine And thus he looked upon every French aristocrat who had succeeded in escaping from France as so much prey of which the guillotine had been unwarrantably cheated There is no doubt that those royalist EMIGRES once they had managed to cross the frontier did their very best to stir up foreign indignation against France Plots without end were hatched in England in Belgium in Holland to try and induce some great power to send troops into revolutionary Paris to free King Louis and to summarily hang the bloodthirsty leaders of that monster republic Small wonder therefore that the romantic and mysterious personality of the Scarlet Pimpernel was a source of bitter hatred to Chauvelin He and the few young jackanapes under his command well furnished with money armed with boundless daring and acute cunning had succeeded in rescuing hundreds of aristocrats from France Nine tenths of the EMIGRES who were FETED at the English court owed their safety to that man and to his league Chauvelin had sworn to his colleagues in Paris that he would discover the identity of that meddlesome Englishman entice him over to France and then Chauvelin drew a deep breath of satisfaction at the very thought of seeing that enigmatic head falling under the knife of the guillotine as easily as that of any other man Suddenly there was a great stir on the handsome staircase all conversation stopped for a moment as the majordomo s voice outside announced
7688_105390_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and suite Sir Percy Blakeney Lady Blakeney 
none	none	Lord Grenville went quickly to the door to receive his exalted guest The Prince of Wales dressed in a magnificent court suit of salmon coloured velvet richly embroidered with gold entered with Marguerite Blakeney on his arm and on his left Sir Percy in gorgeous shimmering cream satin cut in the extravagant Incroyable style his fair hair free from powder priceless lace at his neck and wrists and the flat CHAPEAU BRAS under his arm After the few conventional words of deferential greeting Lord Grenville said to his royal guest Will your Highness permit me to introduce M Chauvelin the accredited agent of the French Government Chauvelin immediately the Prince entered had stepped forward expecting this introduction He bowed very low whilst the Prince returned his salute with a curt nod of the head Monsieur said His Royal Highness coldly we will try to forget the government that sent you and look upon you merely as our guest a private gentleman from France As such you are welcome Monsieur Monseigneur rejoined Chauvelin bowing once again Madame he added bowing ceremoniously before Marguerite Ah my little Chauvelin she said with unconcerned gaiety and extending her tiny hand to him Monsieur and I are old friends your Royal Highness Ah then said the Prince this time very graciously you are doubly welcome Monsieur There is someone else I would crave permission to present to your Royal Highness here interposed Lord Grenville
7688_105390_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah who is it asked the Prince 
none	none	Madame la Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive and her family who have but recently come from France By all means They are among the lucky ones then Lord Grenville turned in search of the Comtesse who sat at the further end of the room Lud love me whispered his Royal Highness to Marguerite as soon as he had caught sight of the rigid figure of the old lady Lud love me she looks very virtuous and very melancholy Faith your Royal Highness she rejoined with a smile virtue is like precious odours most fragrant when it is crushed Virtue alas sighed the Prince is mostly unbecoming to your charming sex Madame Madame la Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive said Lord Grenville introducing the lady This is a pleasure Madame my royal father as you know is ever glad to welcome those of your compatriots whom France has driven from her shores Your Royal Highness is ever gracious replied the Comtesse with becoming dignity Then indicating her daughter who stood timidly by her side My daughter Suzanne Monseigneur she said Ah charming charming said the Prince and now allow me Comtesse to introduce you Lady Blakeney who honours us with her friendship You and she will have much to say to one another I vow Every compatriot of Lady Blakeney s is doubly welcome for her sake her friends are our friends her enemies the enemies of England Marguerite s blue eyes had twinkled with merriment at this gracious speech from her exalted friend The Comtesse de Tournay who lately had so flagrantly insulted her was here receiving a public lesson at which Marguerite could not help but rejoice But the Comtesse for whom respect of royalty amounted almost to a religion was too well schooled in courtly etiquette to show the slightest sign of embarrassment as the two ladies curtsied ceremoniously to one another His Royal Highness is ever gracious Madame said Marguerite demurely and with a wealth of mischief in her twinkling blue eyes but there is no need for his kind of mediation Your amiable reception of me at our last meeting still dwells pleasantly in my memory We poor exiles Madame rejoined the Comtesse frigidly show our gratitude to England by devotion to the wishes of Monseigneur Madame said Marguerite with another ceremonious curtsey Madame responded the Comtesse with equal dignity The Prince in the meanwhile was saying a few gracious words to the young Vicomte I am happy to know you Monsieur le Vicomte he said I knew your father well when he was ambassador in London Ah Monseigneur replied the Vicomte I was a leetle boy then and now I owe the honour of this meeting to our protector the Scarlet Pimpernel Hush said the Prince earnestly and quickly as he indicated Chauvelin who had stood a little on one side throughout the whole of this little scene watching Marguerite and the Comtesse with an amused sarcastic little smile around his thin lips Nay Monseigneur he said now as if in direct response to the Prince s challenge pray do not check this gentleman s display of gratitude the name of that interesting red flower is well known to me and to France The Prince looked at him keenly for a moment or two Faith then Monsieur he said perhaps you know more about our national hero than we do ourselves perchance you know who he is See he added turning to the groups round the room the ladies hang upon your lips you would render yourself popular among the fair sex if you were to gratify their curiosity Ah Monseigneur said Chauvelin significantly rumour has it in France that your Highness could an you would give the truest account of that enigmatical wayside flower He looked quickly and keenly at Marguerite as he spoke but she betrayed no emotion and her eyes met his quite fearlessly Nay man replied the Prince my lips are sealed and the members of the league jealously guard the secret of their chief so his fair adorers have to be content with worshipping a shadow Here in England Monsieur he added with wonderful charm and dignity we but name the Scarlet Pimpernel and every fair cheek is suffused with a blush of enthusiasm None have seen him save his faithful lieutenants We know not if he be tall or short fair or dark handsome or ill formed but we know that he is the bravest gentleman in all the world and we all feel a little proud Monsieur when we remember that he is an Englishman Ah Monsieur Chauvelin added Marguerite looking almost with defiance across at the placid sphinx like face of the Frenchman His Royal Highness should add that we ladies think of him as of a hero of old we worship him we wear his badge we tremble for him when he is in danger and exult with him in the hour of his victory Chauvelin did no more than bow placidly both to the Prince and to Marguerite he felt that both speeches were intended each in their way to convey contempt or defiance The pleasure loving idle Prince he despised the beautiful woman who in her golden hair wore a spray of small red flowers composed of rubies and diamonds her he held in the hollow of his hand he could afford to remain silent and to wait events A long jovial inane laugh broke the sudden silence which had fallen over everyone And we poor husbands came in slow affected accents from gorgeous Sir Percy we have to stand by while they worship a demmed shadow Everyone laughed the Prince more loudly than anyone The tension of subdued excitement was relieved and the next moment everyone was laughing and chatting merrily as the gay crowd broke up and dispersed in the adjoining rooms CHAPTER XII THE SCRAP OF PAPER Marguerite suffered intensely Though she laughed and chatted though she was more admired more surrounded more FETED than any woman there she felt like one condemned to death living her last day upon this earth Her nerves were in a state of painful tension which had increased a hundredfold during that brief hour which she had spent in her husband s company between the opera and the ball The short ray of hope that she might find in this good natured lazy individual a valuable friend and adviser had vanished as quickly as it had come the moment she found herself alone with him The same feeling of good humoured contempt which one feels for an animal or a faithful servant made her turn away with a smile from the man who should have been her moral support in this heart rending crisis through which she was passing who should have been her cool headed adviser when feminine sympathy and sentiment tossed her hither and thither between her love for her brother who was far away and in mortal peril and horror of the awful service which Chauvelin had exacted from her in exchange for Armand s safety There he stood the moral support the cool headed adviser surrounded by a crowd of brainless empty headed young fops who were even now repeating from mouth to mouth and with every sign of the keenest enjoyment a doggerel quatrain which he had just given forth Everywhere the absurd silly words met her people seemed to have little else to speak about even the Prince had asked her with a little laugh whether she appreciated her husband s latest poetic efforts All done in the tying of a cravat Sir Percy had declared to his clique of admirers We seek him here we seek him there Those Frenchies seek him everywhere Is he in heaven Is he in hell That demmed elusive Pimpernel Sir Percy s BON MOT had gone the round of the brilliant reception rooms The Prince was enchanted He vowed that life without Blakeney would be but a dreary desert Then taking him by the arm had led him to the card room and engaged him in a long game of hazard Sir Percy whose chief interest in most social gatherings seemed to centre round the card table usually allowed his wife to flirt dance to amuse or bore herself as much as she liked And to night having delivered himself of his BON MOT he had left Marguerite surrounded by a crowd of admirers of all ages all anxious and willing to help her to forget that somewhere in the spacious reception rooms there was a long lazy being who had been fool enough to suppose that the cleverest woman in Europe would settle down to the prosaic bonds of English matrimony Her still overwrought nerves her excitement and agitation lent beautiful Marguerite Blakeney much additional charm escorted by a veritable bevy of men of all ages and of most nationalities she called forth many exclamations of admiration from everyone as she passed She would not allow herself any more time to think Her early somewhat Bohemian training had made her something of a fatalist She felt that events would shape themselves that the directing of them was not in her hands From Chauvelin she knew that she could expect no mercy He had set a price on Armand s head and left it to her to pay or not as she chose Later on in the evening she caught sight of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Antony Dewhurst who seemingly had just arrived She noticed at once that Sir Andrew immediately made for little Suzanne de Tournay and that the two young people soon managed to isolate themselves in one of the deep embrasures of the mullioned windows there to carry on a long conversation which seemed very earnest and very pleasant on both sides Both the young men looked a little haggard and anxious but otherwise they were irreproachably dressed and there was not the slightest sign about their courtly demeanour of the terrible catastrophe which they must have felt hovering round them and round their chief That the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel had no intention of abandoning its cause she had gathered through little Suzanne herself who spoke openly of the assurance she and her mother had had that the Comte de Tournay would be rescued from France by the league within the next few days Vaguely she began to wonder as she looked at the brilliant and fashionable in the gaily lighted ball room which of these worldly men round her was the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel who held the threads of such daring plots and the fate of valuable lives in his hands A burning curiosity seized her to know him although for months she had heard of him and had accepted his anonymity as everyone else in society had done but now she longed to know quite impersonally quite apart from Armand and oh quite apart from Chauvelin only for her own sake for the sake of the enthusiastic admiration she had always bestowed on his bravery and cunning He was at the ball of course somewhere since Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Antony Dewhurst were here evidently expecting to meet their chief and perhaps to get a fresh MOT D ORDRE from him Marguerite looked round at everyone at the aristocratic high typed Norman faces the squarely built fair haired Saxon the more gentle humorous caste of the Celt wondering which of these betrayed the power the energy the cunning which had imposed its will and its leadership upon a number of high born English gentlemen among whom rumour asserted was His Royal Highness himself Sir Andrew Ffoulkes Surely not with his gentle blue eyes which were looking so tenderly and longingly after little Suzanne who was being led away from the pleasant TETE A TETE by her stern mother Marguerite watched him across the room as he finally turned away with a sigh and seemed to stand aimless and lonely now that Suzanne s dainty little figure had disappeared in the crowd She watched him as he strolled towards the doorway which led to a small boudoir beyond then paused and leaned against the framework of it looking still anxiously all round him Marguerite contrived for the moment to evade her present attentive cavalier and she skirted the fashionable crowd drawing nearer to the doorway against which Sir Andrew was leaning Why she wished to get closer to him she could not have said perhaps she was impelled by an all powerful fatality which so often seems to rule the destinies of men Suddenly she stopped her very heart seemed to stand still her eyes large and excited flashed for a moment towards that doorway then as quickly were turned away again Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was still in the same listless position by the door but Marguerite had distinctly seen that Lord Hastings a young buck a friend of her husband s and one of the Prince s set had as he quickly brushed past him slipped something into his hand For one moment longer oh it was the merest flash Marguerite paused the next she had with admirably played unconcern resumed her walk across the room but this time more quickly towards that doorway whence Sir Andrew had now disappeared All this from the moment that Marguerite had caught sight of Sir Andrew leaning against the doorway until she followed him into the little boudoir beyond had occurred in less than a minute Fate is usually swift when she deals a blow Now Lady Blakeney had suddenly ceased to exist It was Marguerite saint Just who was there only Marguerite saint Just who had passed her childhood her early youth in the protecting arms of her brother Armand She had forgotten everything else her rank her dignity her secret enthusiasms everything save that Armand stood in peril of his life and that there not twenty feet away from her in the small boudoir which was quite deserted in the very hands of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes might be the talisman which would save her brother s life Barely another thirty seconds had elapsed between the moment when Lord Hastings slipped the mysterious something into Sir Andrew s hand and the one when she in her turn reached the deserted boudoir Sir Andrew was standing with his back to her and close to a table upon which stood a massive silver candelabra A slip of paper was in his hand and he was in the very act of perusing its contents Unperceived her soft clinging robe making not the slightest sound upon the heavy carpet not daring to breathe until she had accomplished her purpose Marguerite slipped close behind him At that moment he looked round and saw her she uttered a groan passed her hand across her forehead and murmured faintly The heat in the room was terrible I felt so faint Ah She tottered almost as if she would fall and Sir Andrew quickly recovering himself and crumpling in his hand the tiny note he had been reading was only apparently just in time to support her You are ill Lady Blakeney he asked with much concern Let me No no nothing she interrupted quickly A chair quick She sank into a chair close to the table and throwing back her head closing her eyes There she murmured still faintly the giddiness is passing off Do not heed me Sir Andrew I assure you I already feel better At moments like these there is no doubt and psychologists actually assert it that there is in us a sense which has absolutely nothing to do with the other five it is not that we see it is not that we hear or touch yet we seem to do all three at once Marguerite sat there with her eyes apparently closed Sir Andrew was immediately behind her and on her right was the table with the five armed candelabra upon it Before her mental vision there was absolutely nothing but Armand s face Armand whose life was in the most imminent danger and who seemed to be looking at her from a background upon which were dimly painted the seething crowd of Paris the bare walls of the Tribunal of Public Safety with Foucquier Tinville the Public Prosecutor demanding Armand s life in the name of the people of France and the lurid guillotine with its stained knife waiting for another victim Armand For one moment there was dead silence in the little boudoir Beyond from the brilliant ball room the sweet notes of the gavotte the frou frou of rich dresses the talk and laughter of a large and merry crowd came as a strange weird accompaniment to the drama which was being enacted here Sir Andrew had not uttered another word Then it was that that extra sense became potent in Marguerite Blakeney She could not see for her two eyes were closed she could not hear for the noise from the ball room drowned the soft rustle of that momentous scrap of paper nevertheless she knew as if she had both seen and heard that Sir Andrew was even now holding the paper to the flame of one of the candles At the exact moment that it began to catch fire she opened her eyes raised her hand and with two dainty fingers had taken the burning scrap of paper from the young man s hand Then she blew out the flame and held the paper to her nostril with perfect unconcern How thoughtful of you Sir Andrew she said gaily surely twas your grandmother who taught you that the smell of burnt paper was a sovereign remedy against giddiness She sighed with satisfaction holding the paper tightly between her jewelled fingers that talisman which perhaps would save her brother Armand s life Sir Andrew was staring at her too dazed for the moment to realize what had actually happened he had been taken so completely by surprise that he seemed quite unable to grasp the fact that the slip of paper which she held in her dainty hand was one perhaps on which the life of his comrade might depend Marguerite burst into a long merry peal of laughter Why do you stare at me like that she said playfully I assure you I feel much better your remedy has proved most effectual This room is most delightedly cool she added with the same perfect composure and the sound of the gavotte from the ball room is fascinating and soothing She was prattling on in the most unconcerned and pleasant way whilst Sir Andrew in an agony of mind was racking his brains as to the quickest method he could employ to get that bit of paper out of that beautiful woman s hand Instinctively vague and tumultuous thoughts rushed through his mind he suddenly remembered her nationality and worst of all recollected that horrible tale anent the Marquis de saint Cyr which in England no one had credited for the sake of Sir Percy as well as for her own What Still dreaming and staring she said with a merry laugh you are most ungallant Sir Andrew and now I come to think of it you seemed more startled than pleased when you saw me just now I do believe after all that it was not concern for my health nor yet a remedy taught you by your grandmother that caused you to burn this tiny scrap of paper I vow it must have been your lady love s last cruel epistle you were trying to destroy Now confess she added playfully holding up the scrap of paper does this contain her final CONGE or a last appeal to kiss and make friends Whichever it is Lady Blakeney said Sir Andrew who was gradually recovering his self possession this little note is undoubtedly mine and Not caring whether his action was one that would be styled ill bred towards a lady the young man had made a bold dash for the note but Marguerite s thoughts flew quicker than his own her actions under pressure of this intense excitement were swifter and more sure She was tall and strong she took a quick step backwards and knocked over the small Sheraton table which was already top heavy and which fell down with a crash together with the massive candelabra upon it She gave a quick cry of alarm The candles Sir Andrew quick There was not much damage done one or two of the candles had blown out as the candelabra fell others had merely sent some grease upon the valuable carpet one had ignited the paper shade aver it Sir Andrew quickly and dexterously put out the flames and replaced the candelabra upon the table but this had taken him a few seconds to do and those seconds had been all that Marguerite needed to cast a quick glance at the paper and to note its contents a dozen words in the same distorted handwriting she had seen before and bearing the same device a star shaped flower drawn in red ink When Sir Andrew once more looked at her he only saw upon her face alarm at the untoward accident and relief at its happy issue whilst the tiny and momentous note had apparently fluttered to the ground Eagerly the young man picked it up and his face looked much relieved as his fingers closed tightly over it For shame Sir Andrew she said shaking her head with a playful sigh making havoc in the heart of some impressionable duchess whilst conquering the affections of my sweet little Suzanne Well well I do believe it was Cupid himself who stood by you and threatened the entire Foreign Office with destruction by fire just on purpose to make me drop love s message before it had been polluted by my indiscreet eyes To think that a moment longer and I might have known the secrets of an erring duchess You will forgive me Lady Blakeney said Sir Andrew now as calm as she was herself if I resume the interesting occupation which you have interrupted By all means Sir Andrew How should I venture to thwart the love god again Perhaps he would mete out some terrible chastisement against my presumption Burn your love token by all means Sir Andrew had already twisted the paper into a long spill and was once again holding it to the flame of the candle which had remained alight He did not notice the strange smile on the face of his fair VIS A VIS so intent was he on the work of destruction perhaps had he done so the look of relief would have faded from his face He watched the fateful note as it curled under the flame Soon the last fragment fell on the floor and he placed his heel upon the ashes And now Sir Andrew said Marguerite Blakeney with the pretty nonchalance peculiar to herself and with the most winning of smiles will you venture to excite the jealousy of your fair lady by asking me to dance the minuet CHAPTER XIII EITHER OR The few words which Marguerite Blakeney had managed to read on the half scorched piece of paper seemed literally to be the words of Fate Start myself tomorrow This she had read quite distinctly then came a blur caused by the smoke of the candle which obliterated the next few words but right at the bottom there was another sentence like letters of fire before her mental vision If you wish to speak to me again I shall be in the supper room at one o clock precisely The whole was signed with the hastily scrawled little device a tiny star shaped flower which had become so familiar to her One o clock precisely It was now close upon eleven the last minuet was being danced with Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and beautiful Lady Blakeney leading the couples through its delicate and intricate figures Close upon eleven the hands of the handsome Louis XV clock upon its ormolu bracket seemed to move along with maddening rapidity Two hours more and her fate and that of Armand would be sealed In two hours she must make up her mind whether she will keep the knowledge so cunningly gained to herself and leave her brother to his fate or whether she will wilfully betray a brave man whose life was devoted to his fellow men who was noble generous and above all unsuspecting It seemed a horrible thing to do But then there was Armand Armand too was noble and brave Armand too was unsuspecting And Armand loved her would have willingly trusted his life in her hands and now when she could save him from death she hesitated Oh it was monstrous her brother s kind gentle face so full of love for her seemed to be looking reproachfully at her You might have saved me Margot he seemed to say to her and you chose the life of a stranger a man you do not know whom you have never seen and preferred that he should be safe whilst you sent me to the guillotine All these conflicting thoughts raged through Marguerite s brain while with a smile upon her lips she glided through the graceful mazes of the minuet She noted with that acute sense of hers that she had succeeded in completely allaying Sir Andrew s fears Her self control had been absolutely perfect she was a finer actress at this moment and throughout the whole of this minuet than she had ever been upon the boards of the Comedie Francaise but then a beloved brother s life had not depended upon her histrionic powers She was too clever to overdo her part and made no further allusions to the supposed BILLET DOUX which had caused Sir Andrew Ffoulkes such an agonising five minutes She watched his anxiety melting away under her sunny smile and soon perceived that whatever doubt may have crossed his mind at the moment she had by the time the last bars of the minuet had been played succeeded in completely dispelling it he never realised in what a fever of excitement she was what effort it cost her to keep up a constant ripple of BANAL conversation When the minuet was over she asked Sir Andrew to take her into the next room I have promised to go down to supper with His Royal Highness she said but before we part tell me am I forgiven Forgiven Yes Confess I gave you a fright just now But remember I am not an English woman and I do not look upon the exchanging of BILLET DOUX as a crime and I vow I ll not tell my little Suzanne But now tell me shall I welcome you at my water party on Wednesday I am not sure Lady Blakeney he replied evasively I may have to leave London to morrow I would not do that if I were you she said earnestly then seeing the anxious look reappearing in his eyes she added gaily No one can throw a ball better than you can Sir Andrew we should so miss you on the bowling green He had led her across the room to one beyond where already His Royal Highness was waiting for the beautiful Lady Blakeney Madame supper awaits us said the Prince offering his arm to Marguerite and I am full of hope The goddess Fortune has frowned so persistently on me at hazard that I look with confidence for the smiles of the goddess of Beauty Your Highness has been unfortunate at the card tables asked Marguerite as she took the Prince s arm Aye most unfortunate Blakeney not content with being the richest among my father s subjects has also the most outrageous luck By the way where is that inimitable wit I vow Madam that this life would be but a dreary desert without your smiles and his sallies CHAPTER XIV ONE O CLOCK PRECISELY Supper had been extremely gay All those present declared that never had Lady Blakeney been more adorable nor that demmed idiot Sir Percy more amusing His Royal Highness had laughed until the tears streamed down his cheeks at Blakeney s foolish yet funny repartees His doggerel verse We seek him here we seek him there et cetera was sung to the tune of Ho Merry Britons and to the accompaniment of glasses knocked loudly against the table Lord Grenville moreover had a most perfect cook some wags asserted that he was a scion of the old French NOBLESSE who having lost his fortune had come to seek it in the CUISINE of the Foreign Office Marguerite Blakeney was in her most brilliant mood and surely not a soul in that crowded supper room had even an inkling of the terrible struggle which was raging within her heart The clock was ticking so mercilessly on It was long past midnight and even the Prince of Wales was thinking of leaving the supper table Within the next half hour the destinies of two brave men would be pitted against one another the dearly beloved brother and he the unknown hero Marguerite had not tried to see Chauvelin during this last hour she knew that his keen fox like eyes would terrify her at once and incline the balance of her decision towards Armand Whilst she did not see him there still lingered in her heart of hearts a vague undefined hope that something would occur something big enormous epoch making which would shift from her young weak shoulders this terrible burden of responsibility of having to choose between two such cruel alternatives But the minutes ticked on with that dull monotony which they invariably seem to assume when our very nerves ache with their incessant ticking After supper dancing was resumed His Royal Highness had left and there was general talk of departing among the older guests the young were indefatigable and had started on a new gavotte which would fill the next quarter of an hour Marguerite did not feel equal to another dance there is a limit to the most enduring of self control Escorted by a Cabinet Minister she had once more found her way to the tiny boudoir still the most deserted among all the rooms She knew that Chauvelin must be lying in wait for her somewhere ready to seize the first possible opportunity for a TETE A TETE His eyes had met hers for a moment after the fore supper minuet and she knew that the keen diplomat with those searching pale eyes of his had divined that her work was accomplished Fate had willed it so Marguerite torn by the most terrible conflict heart of woman can ever know had resigned herself to its decrees But Armand must be saved at any cost he first of all for he was her brother had been mother father friend to her ever since she a tiny babe had lost both her parents To think of Armand dying a traitor s death on the guillotine was too horrible even to dwell upon impossible in fact That could never be never As for the stranger the hero well there let Fate decide Marguerite would redeem her brother s life at the hands of the relentless enemy then let that cunning Scarlet Pimpernel extricate himself after that Perhaps vaguely Marguerite hoped that the daring plotter who for so many months had baffled an army of spies would still manage to evade Chauvelin and remain immune to the end She thought of all this as she sat listening to the witty discourse of the Cabinet Minister who no doubt felt that he had found in Lady Blakeney a most perfect listener Suddenly she saw the keen fox like face of Chauvelin peeping through the curtained doorway Lord Fancourt she said to the Minister will you do me a service I am entirely at your ladyship s service he replied gallantly Will you see if my husband is still in the card room And if he is will you tell him that I am very tired and would be glad to go home soon The commands of a beautiful woman are binding on all mankind even on Cabinet Ministers Lord Fancourt prepared to obey instantly I do not like to leave your ladyship alone he said Never fear I shall be quite safe here and I think undisturbed but I am really tired You know Sir Percy will drive back to Richmond It is a long way and we shall not an we do not hurry get home before daybreak Lord Fancourt had perforce to go The moment he had disappeared Chauvelin slipped into the room and the next instant stood calm and impassive by her side You have news for me he said An icy mantle seemed to have suddenly settled round Marguerite s shoulders though her cheeks glowed with fire she felt chilled and numbed Oh Armand will you ever know the terrible sacrifice of pride of dignity of womanliness a devoted sister is making for your sake Nothing of importance she said staring mechanically before her but it might prove a clue I contrived no matter how to detect Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in the very act of burning a paper at one of these candles in this very room That paper I succeeded in holding between my fingers for the space of two minutes and to cast my eyes on it for that of ten seconds Time enough to learn its contents asked Chauvelin quietly She nodded Then continued in the same even mechanical tone of voice In the corner of the paper there was the usual rough device of a small star shaped flower Above it I read two lines everything else was scorched and blackened by the flame And what were the two lines Her throat seemed suddenly to have contracted For an instant she felt that she could not speak the words which might send a brave man to his death It is lucky that the whole paper was not burned added Chauvelin with dry sarcasm for it might have fared ill with Armand saint Just What were the two lines citoyenne One was I start myself to morrow she said quietly the other If you wish to speak to me I shall be in the supper room at one o clock precisely Chauvelin looked up at the clock just above the mantelpiece Then I have plenty of time he said placidly What are you going to do she asked She was pale as a statue her hands were icy cold her head and heart throbbed with the awful strain upon her nerves Oh this was cruel cruel What had she done to have deserved all this Her choice was made had she done a vile action or one that was sublime The recording angel who writes in the book of gold alone could give an answer What are you going to do she repeated mechanically Oh nothing for the present After that it will depend On what On whom I shall see in the supper room at one o clock precisely You will see the Scarlet Pimpernel of course But you do not know him No But I shall presently Sir Andrew will have warned him I think not When you parted from him after the minuet he stood and watched you for a moment or two with a look which gave me to understand that something had happened between you It was only natural was it not that I should make a shrewd guess as to the nature of that something I thereupon engaged the young man in a long and animated conversation we discussed Herr Gluck s singular success in London until a lady claimed his arm for supper Since then I did not lose sight of him through supper When we all came upstairs again Lady Portarles buttonholed him and started on the subject of pretty Mlle Suzanne de Tournay I knew he would not move until Lady Portarles had exhausted on the subject which will not be for another quarter of an hour at least and it is five minutes to one now He was preparing to go and went up to the doorway where drawing aside the curtain he stood for a moment pointing out to Marguerite the distant figure of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in close conversation with Lady Portarles I think he said with a triumphant smile that I may safely expect to find the person I seek in the dining room fair lady There may be more than one Whoever is there as the clock strikes one will be shadowed by one of my men of these one or perhaps two or even three will leave for France to morrow ONE of these will be the Scarlet Pimpernel Yes And I also fair lady will leave for France to morrow The papers found at Dover upon the person of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes speak of the neighborhood of Calais of an inn which I know well called Le Chat Gris of a lonely place somewhere on the coast the Pere Blanchard s hut which I must endeavor to find All these places are given as the point where this meddlesome Englishman has bidden the traitor de Tournay and others to meet his emissaries But it seems that he has decided not to send his emissaries that he will start himself to morrow Now one of these persons whom I shall see anon in the supper room will be journeying to Calais and I shall follow that person until I have tracked him to where those fugitive aristocrats await him for that person fair lady will be the man whom I have sought for for nearly a year the man whose energies has outdone me whose ingenuity has baffled me whose audacity has set me wondering yes me who have seen a trick or two in my time the mysterious and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel And Armand she pleaded Have I ever broken my word I promise you that the day the Scarlet Pimpernel and I start for France I will send you that imprudent letter of his by special courier More than that I will pledge you the word of France that the day I lay hands on that meddlesome Englishman saint Just will be here in England safe in the arms of his charming sister And with a deep and elaborate bow and another look at the clock Chauvelin glided out of the room It seemed to Marguerite that through all the noise all the din of music dancing and laughter she could hear his cat like tread gliding through the vast reception rooms that she could hear him go down the massive staircase reach the dining room and open the door Fate HAD decided had made her speak had made her do a vile and abominable thing for the sake of the brother she loved She lay back in her chair passive and still seeing the figure of her relentless enemy ever present before her aching eyes When Chauvelin reached the supper room it was quite deserted It had that woebegone forsaken tawdry appearance which reminds one so much of a ball dress the morning after Half empty glasses littered the table unfolded napkins lay about the chairs turned towards one another in groups of twos and threes very close to one another in the far corners of the room which spoke of recent whispered flirtations over cold game pie and champagne there were sets of three and four chairs that recalled pleasant animated discussions over the latest scandal there were chairs straight up in a row that still looked starchy critical acid like antiquated dowager there were a few isolated single chairs close to the table that spoke of gourmands intent on the most RECHERCHE dishes and others overturned on the floor that spoke volumes on the subject of my Lord Grenville s cellars It was a ghostlike replica in fact of that fashionable gathering upstairs a ghost that haunts every house where balls and good suppers are given a picture drawn with white chalk on grey cardboard dull and colourless now that the bright silk dresses and gorgeously embroidered coats were no longer there to fill in the foreground and now that the candles flickered sleepily in their sockets Chauvelin smiled benignly and rubbing his long thin hands together he looked round the deserted supper room whence even the last flunkey had retired in order to join his friends in the hall below All was silence in the dimly lighted room whilst the sound of the gavotte the hum of distant talk and laughter and the rumble of an occasional coach outside only seemed to reach this palace of the Sleeping Beauty as the murmur of some flitting spooks far away It all looked so peaceful so luxurious and so still that the keenest observer a veritable prophet could never have guessed that at this present moment that deserted supper room was nothing but a trap laid for the capture of the most cunning and audacious plotter those stirring times had ever seen Chauvelin pondered and tried to peer into the immediate future What would this man be like whom he and the leaders of the whole revolution had sworn to bring to his death Everything about him was weird and mysterious his personality which he so cunningly concealed the power he wielded over nineteen English gentlemen who seemed to obey his every command blindly and enthusiastically the passionate love and submission he had roused in his little trained band and above all his marvellous audacity the boundless impudence which had caused him to beard his most implacable enemies within the very walls of Paris No wonder that in France the SOBRIQUET of the mysterious Englishman roused in the people a superstitious shudder Chauvelin himself as he gazed round the deserted room where presently the weird hero would appear felt a strange feeling of awe creeping all down his spine But his plans were well laid He felt sure that the Scarlet Pimpernel had not been warned and felt equally sure that Marguerite Blakeney had not played him false If she had a cruel look that would have made her shudder gleamed in Chauvelin s keen pale eyes If she had played him a trick Armand saint Just would suffer the extreme penalty But no no of course she had not played him false Fortunately the supper room was deserted this would make Chauvelin s task all the easier when presently that unsuspecting enigma would enter it alone No one was here now save Chauvelin himself Stay as he surveyed with a satisfied smile the solitude of the room the cunning agent of the French Government became aware of the peaceful monotonous breathing of some one of my Lord Grenville s guests who no doubt had supped both wisely and well and was enjoying a quiet sleep away from the din of the dancing above Chauvelin looked round once more and there in the corner of a sofa in the dark angle of the room his mouth open his eyes shut the sweet sounds of peaceful slumbers proceedings from his nostrils reclined the gorgeously apparelled long limbed husband of the cleverest woman in Europe Chauvelin looked at him as he lay there placid unconscious at peace with all the world and himself after the best of suppers and a smile that was almost one of pity softened for a moment the hard lines of the Frenchman s face and the sarcastic twinkle of his pale eyes Evidently the slumberer deep in dreamless sleep would not interfere with Chauvelin s trap for catching that cunning Scarlet Pimpernel Again he rubbed his hands together and following the example of Sir Percy Blakeney he too stretched himself out in the corner of another sofa shut his eyes opened his mouth gave forth sounds of peaceful breathing and waited

7555_105394_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Marguerite Blakeney had watched the slight sable clad figure of Chauvelin as he worked his way through the ball room 
none	none	Then perforce she had had to wait while her nerves tingled with excitement 
7555_105394_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Listlessly she sat in the small still deserted boudoir looking out through the curtained doorway on the dancing couples beyond looking at them yet seeing nothing hearing the music yet conscious of naught save a feeling of expectancy of anxious weary waiting 
7555_105394_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Her mind conjured up before her the vision of what was perhaps at this very moment passing downstairs 
none	none	The half deserted dining room the fateful hour Chauvelin on the watch then precise to the moment the entrance of a man he the Scarlet Pimpernel the mysterious leader who to Marguerite had become almost unreal so strange so weird was this hidden identity She wished she were in the supper room too at this moment watching him as he entered she knew that her woman s penetration would at once recognise in the stranger s face whoever he might be that strong individuality which belongs to a leader of men to a hero to the mighty high soaring eagle whose daring wings were becoming entangled in the ferret s trap Woman like she thought of him with unmixed sadness the irony of that fate seemed so cruel which allowed the fearless lion to succumb to the gnawing of a rat 
7555_105394_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Ah had Armand s life not been at stake 
7555_105394_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Faith your ladyship must have thought me very remiss said a voice suddenly close to her elbow 
7555_105394_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 I had a deal of difficulty in delivering your message for I could not find Blakeney anywhere at first 
none	none	Marguerite had forgotten all about her husband and her message to him his very name as spoken by Lord Fancourt sounded strange and unfamiliar to her so completely had she in the last five minutes lived her old life in the Rue de Richelieu again with Armand always near her to love and protect her to guard her from the many subtle intrigues which were forever raging in Paris in those days
7555_105394_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I did find him at last continued Lord Fancourt and gave him your message 
7555_105394_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He said that he would give orders at once for the horses to be put to 
7555_105394_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah she said still very absently you found my husband and gave him my message 
none	none	Yes he was in the dining room fast asleep 
7555_105394_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I could not manage to wake him up at first 
7555_105394_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you very much she said mechanically trying to collect her thoughts 
none	none	Will your ladyship honour me with the CONTREDANSE until your coach is ready asked Lord Fancourt No I thank you my lord but and you will forgive me I really am too tired and the heat in the ball room has become oppressive The conservatory is deliciously cool let me take you there and then get you something You seem ailing Lady Blakeney I am only very tired she repeated wearily as she allowed Lord Fancourt to lead her where subdued lights and green plants lent coolness to the air He got her a chair into which she sank This long interval of waiting was intolerable Why did not Chauvelin come and tell her the result of his watch 
7555_105394_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Lord Fancourt was very attentive 
7555_105394_000016_000001	train-clean-360	She scarcely heard what he said and suddenly startled him by asking abruptly 
7555_105394_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Lord Fancourt did you perceive who was in the dining room just now besides Sir Percy Blakeney 
none	none	Only the agent of the French government M Chauvelin equally fast asleep in another corner he said
7555_105394_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 Why does your ladyship ask 
7555_105394_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I know not 
none	none	I 
7555_105394_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Did you notice the time when you were there 
7555_105394_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 It must have been about five or ten minutes past one 
7555_105394_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I wonder what your ladyship is thinking about he added for evidently the fair lady s thoughts were very far away and she had not been listening to his intellectual conversation 
7555_105394_000021_000000	train-clean-360	But indeed her thoughts were not very far away only one storey below in this same house in the dining room where sat Chauvelin still on the watch 
7555_105394_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Had he failed 
7555_105394_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Had he failed 
7555_105394_000021_000002	train-clean-360	For one instant that possibility rose before as a hope the hope that the Scarlet Pimpernel had been warned by Sir Andrew and that Chauvelin s trap had failed to catch his bird but that hope soon gave way to fear 
none	none	Had he failed But then Armand Lord Fancourt had given up talking since he found that he had no listener He wanted an opportunity for slipping away for sitting opposite to a lady however fair who is evidently not heeding the most vigorous efforts made for her entertainment is not exhilarating even to a Cabinet Minister
7555_105394_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Shall I find out if your ladyship s coach is ready he said at last tentatively 
none	none	Oh thank you thank you if you would be so kind I fear I am but sorry company but I am really tired and perhaps would be best alone 
7555_105394_000025_000000	train-clean-360	But Lord Fancourt went and still Chauvelin did not come 
7555_105394_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Oh what had happened 
none	none	She felt Armand s fate trembling in the balance she feared now with a deadly fear that Chauvelin HAD failed and that the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel had proved elusive once more then she knew that she need hope for no pity no mercy from him He had pronounced his Either or and nothing less would content him he was very spiteful and would affect the belief that she had wilfully misled him and having failed to trap the eagle once again his revengeful mind would be content with the humble prey Armand Yet she had done her best had strained every nerve for Armand s sake She could not bear to think that all had failed She could not sit still she wanted to go and hear the worst at once she wondered even that Chauvelin had not come yet to vent his wrath and satire upon her 
7555_105394_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Lord Grenville himself came presently to tell her that her coach was ready and that Sir Percy was already waiting for her ribbons in hand 
none	none	Marguerite said Farewell to her distinguished host many of her friends stopped her as she crossed the rooms to talk to her and exchange pleasant AU REVOIRS The Minister only took final leave of beautiful Lady Blakeney on the top of the stairs below on the landing a veritable army of gallant gentlemen were waiting to bid Good bye to the queen of beauty and fashion whilst outside under the massive portico Sir Percy s magnificent bays were impatient pawing the ground At the top of the stairs just after she had taken final leave of her host she suddenly saw Chauvelin he was coming up the stairs slowly and rubbing his thin hands very softly together There was a curious look on his mobile face partly amused and wholly puzzled as his keen eyes met Marguerite s they became strangely sarcastic M Chauvelin she said as he stopped on the top of the stairs bowing elaborately before her my coach is outside may I claim your arm As gallant as ever he offered her his arm and led her downstairs 
7555_105394_000033_000001	train-clean-360	The crowd was very great some of the Minister s guests were departing others were leaning against the banisters watching the throng as it filed up and down the wide staircase 
none	none	Chauvelin she said at last desperately I must know what has happened
7555_105394_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 What has happened dear lady he said with affected surprise 
7555_105394_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 Where When 
7555_105394_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 You are torturing me Chauvelin 
none	none	I have helped you to night surely I have the right to know 
7555_105394_000036_000002	train-clean-360	What happened in the dining room at one o clock just now 
7555_105394_000037_000000	train-clean-360	She spoke in a whisper trusting that in the general hubbub of the crowd her words would remain unheeded by all save the man at her side 
none	none	Quiet and peace reigned supreme fair lady at that hour I was asleep in one corner of one sofa and Sir Percy Blakeney in another Nobody came into the room at all Nobody Then we have failed you and I
7555_105394_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes we have failed perhaps 
none	none	But Armand she pleaded Ah Armand saint Just s chances hang on a thread pray heaven dear lady that that thread may not snap
7555_105394_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Chauvelin I worked for you sincerely earnestly remember 
none	none	I remember my promise he said quietly The day that the Scarlet Pimpernel and I meet on French soil saint Just will be in the arms of his charming sister
7555_105394_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Which means that a brave man s blood will be on my hands she said with a shudder 
none	none	His blood or that of your brother 
7555_105394_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Surely at the present moment you must hope as I do that the enigmatical Scarlet Pimpernel will start for Calais to day 
none	none	I am only conscious of one hope citoyen And that is That Satan your master will have need of you elsewhere before the sun rises to day You flatter me citoyenne She had detained him for a while mid way down the stairs trying to get at the thoughts which lay beyond that thin fox like mask 
7555_105394_000053_000001	train-clean-360	But Chauvelin remained urbane sarcastic mysterious not a line betrayed to the poor anxious woman whether she need fear or whether she dared to hope 
7555_105394_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Downstairs on the landing she was soon surrounded 
none	none	Lady Blakeney never stepped from any house into her coach without an escort of fluttering human moths around the dazzling light of her beauty But before she finally turned away from Chauvelin she held out a tiny hand to him with that pretty gesture of childish appeal which was essentially her own
7555_105394_000054_000003	train-clean-360	 Give me some hope my little Chauvelin she pleaded 
none	none	With perfect gallantry he bowed over that tiny hand which looked so dainty and white through the delicately transparent black lace mitten and kissing the tips of the rosy fingers
7555_105394_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Pray heaven that the thread may not snap he repeated with his enigmatic smile 
none	none	And stepping aside he allowed the moths to flutter more closely round the candle and the brilliant throng of the JEUNESSE DOREE eagerly attentive to Lady Blakeney s every movement hid the keen fox like face from her view CHAPTER XVI RICHMOND A few minutes later she was sitting wrapped in cozy furs near Sir Percy Blakeney on the box seat of his magnificent coach and the four splendid bays had thundered down the quiet street The night was warm in spite of the gentle breeze which fanned Marguerite s burning cheeks Soon London houses were left behind and rattling over old Hammersmith Bridge Sir Percy was driving his bays rapidly towards Richmond The river wound in and out in its pretty delicate curves looking like a silver serpent beneath the glittering rays of the moon Long shadows from overhanging trees spread occasional deep palls right across the road The bays were rushing along at breakneck speed held but slightly back by Sir Percy s strong unerring hands These nightly drives after balls and suppers in London were a source of perpetual delight to Marguerite and she appreciated her husband s eccentricity keenly which caused him to adopt this mode of taking her home every night to their beautiful home by the river instead of living in a stuffy London house He loved driving his spirited horses along the lonely moonlit roads and she loved to sit on the box seat with the soft air of an English late summer s night fanning her face after the hot atmosphere of a ball or supper party The drive was not a long one less than an hour sometimes when the bays were very fresh and Sir Percy gave them full rein To night he seemed to have a very devil in his fingers and
3728_105398_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 the coach 
none	none	seemed to fly along the road beside the river As usual he did not speak to her but stared straight in front of him the ribbons seeming to lie quite loosely in his slender white hands Marguerite looked at him tentatively once or twice she could see his handsome profile and one lazy eye with its straight fine brow and drooping heavy lid The face in the moonlight looked singularly earnest and recalled to Marguerite s aching heart those happy days of courtship before he had become the lazy nincompoop the effete fop whose life seemed spent in card and supper rooms But now in the moonlight she could not catch the expression of the lazy blue eyes she could only see the outline of the firm chin the corner of the strong mouth the well cut massive shape of the forehead truly nature had meant well by Sir Percy his faults must all be laid at the door of that poor half crazy mother and of the distracted heart broken father neither of whom had cared for the young life which was sprouting up between them and which perhaps their very carelessness was already beginning to wreck Marguerite suddenly felt intense sympathy for her husband The moral crisis she had just gone through made her feel indulgent towards the faults the delinquencies of others How thoroughly a human being can be buffeted and overmastered by Fate had been borne in upon her with appalling force Had anyone told her a week ago that she would stoop to spy upon her friends that she would betray a brave and unsuspecting man into the hands of a relentless enemy she would have laughed the idea to scorn Yet she had done these things anon perhaps the death of that brave man would be at her door just as two years ago the Marquis de saint Cyr had perished through a thoughtless words of hers but in that case she was morally innocent she had meant no serious harm fate merely had stepped in But this time she had done a thing that obviously was base had done it deliberately for a motive which perhaps high moralists would not even appreciate As she felt her husband s strong arm beside her she also felt how much more he would dislike and despise her if he knew of this night s work Thus human beings judge of one another with but little reason and no charity She despised her husband for his inanities and vulgar unintellectual occupations and he she felt would despise her still worse because she had not been strong enough to do right for right s sake and to sacrifice her brother to the dictates of her conscience Buried in her thoughts Marguerite had found this hour in the breezy summer night all too brief and it was with a feeling of keen disappointment that she suddenly realised that the bays had turned into the massive gates of her beautiful English home Sir Percy Blakeney s house on the river has become a historic one palatial in its dimensions it stands in the midst of exquisitely laid out gardens with a picturesque terrace and frontage to the river Built in Tudor days the old red brick of the walls looks eminently picturesque in the midst of a bower of green the beautiful lawn with its old sun dial adding the true note of harmony to its foregrounds and now on this warm early autumn night the leaves slightly turned to russets and gold the old garden looked singularly poetic and peaceful in the moonlight With unerring precision Sir Percy had brought the four bays to a standstill immediately in front of the fine Elizabethan entrance hall in spite of the late hour an army of grooms seemed to have emerged from the very ground as the coach had thundered up and were standing respectfully round Sir Percy jumped down quickly then helped Marguerite to alight She lingered outside a moment whilst he gave a few orders to one of his men She skirted the house and stepped on to the lawn looking out dreamily into the silvery landscape Nature seemed exquisitely at peace in comparison with the tumultuous emotions she had gone through she could faintly hear the ripple of the river and the occasional soft and ghostlike fall of a dead leaf from a tree All else was quiet round her She had heard the horses prancing as they were being led away to their distant stables the hurrying of servant s feet as they had all gone within to rest the house also was quite still In two separate suites of apartments just above the magnificent reception rooms lights were still burning they were her rooms and his well divided from each other by the whole width of the house as far apart as their own lives had become Involuntarily she sighed at that moment she could really not have told why She was suffering from unconquerable heartache Deeply and achingly she was sorry for herself Never had she felt so pitiably lonely so bitterly in want of comfort and of sympathy With another sigh she turned away from the river towards the house vaguely wondering if after such a night she could ever find rest and sleep Suddenly before she reached the terrace she heard a firm step upon the crisp gravel and the next moment her husband s figure emerged out of the shadow He too had skirted the house and was wandering along the lawn towards the river He still wore his heavy driving coat with the numerous lapels and collars he himself had set in fashion but he had thrown it well back burying his hands as was his wont in the deep pockets of his satin breeches the gorgeous white costume he had worn at Lord Grenville s ball with its jabot of priceless lace looked strangely ghostly against the dark background of the house He apparently did not notice her for after a few moments pause he presently turned back towards the house and walked straight up to the terrace Sir Percy He already had one foot on the lowest of the terrace steps but at her voice he started and paused then looked searchingly into the shadows whence she had called to him She came forward quickly into the moonlight and as soon as he saw her he said with that air of consummate gallantry he always wore when speaking to her At your service Madame But his foot was still on the step and in his whole attitude there was a remote suggestion distinctly visible to her that he wished to go and had no desire for a midnight interview The air is deliciously cool she said the moonlight peaceful and poetic and the garden inviting Will you not stay in it awhile the hour is not yet late or is my company so distasteful to you that you are in a hurry to rid yourself of it Nay Madame he rejoined placidly but tis on the other foot the shoe happens to be and I ll warrant you ll find the midnight air more poetic without my company no doubt the sooner I remove the obstruction the better your ladyship will like it He turned once more to go I protest you mistake me Sir Percy she said hurriedly and drawing a little closer to him the estrangement which alas has arisen between us was none of my making remember Begad you must pardon me there Madame he protested coldly my memory was always of the shortest He looked her straight in the eyes with that lazy nonchalance which had become second nature to him She returned his gaze for a moment then her eyes softened as she came up quite close to him to the foot of the terrace steps Of the shortest Sir Percy Faith how it must have altered Was it three years ago or four that you saw me for one hour in Paris on your way to the East When you came back two years later you had not forgotten me She looked divinely pretty as she stood there in the moonlight with the fur cloak sliding off her beautiful shoulders the gold embroidery on her dress shimmering around her her childlike blue eyes turned up fully at him He stood for a moment rigid and still but for the clenching of his hand against the stone balustrade of the terrace You desired my presence Madame he said frigidly I take it that it was not with the view to indulging in tender reminiscences His voice certainly was cold and uncompromising his attitude before her stiff and unbending Womanly decorum would have suggested Marguerite should return coldness for coldness and should sweep past him without another word only with a curt nod of her head but womanly instinct suggested that she should remain that keen instinct which makes a beautiful woman conscious of her powers long to bring to her knees the one man who pays her no homage She stretched out her hand to him Nay Sir Percy why not the present is not so glorious but that I should not wish to dwell a little in the past He bent his tall figure and taking hold of the extreme tip of the fingers which she still held out to him he kissed them ceremoniously I faith Madame he said then you will pardon me if my dull wits cannot accompany you there Once again he attempted to go once more her voice sweet childlike almost tender called him back Sir Percy Your servant Madame Is it possible that love can die she said with sudden unreasoning vehemence Methought that the passion which you once felt for me would outlast the span of human life Is there nothing left of that love Percy which might help you to bridge over that sad estrangement His massive figure seemed while she spoke thus to him to stiffen still more the strong mouth hardened a look of relentless obstinacy crept into the habitually lazy blue eyes With what object I pray you Madame he asked coldly I do not understand you Yet tis simple enough he said with sudden bitterness which seemed literally to surge through his words though he was making visible efforts to suppress it I humbly put the question to you for my slow wits are unable to grasp the cause of this your ladyship s sudden new mood Is it that you have the taste to renew the devilish sport which you played so successfully last year Do you wish to see me once more a love sick suppliant at your feet so that you might again have the pleasure of kicking me aside like a troublesome lap dog She had succeeded in rousing him for the moment and again she looked straight at him for it was thus she remembered him a year ago Percy I entreat you she whispered can we not bury the past Pardon me Madame but I understood you to say that your desire was to dwell in it Nay I spoke not of THAT past Percy she said while a tone of tenderness crept into her voice Rather did I speak of a time when you loved me still and I oh I was vain and frivolous your wealth and position allured me I married you hoping in my heart that your great love for me would beget in me a love for you but alas The moon had sunk low down behind a bank of clouds In the east a soft grey light was beginning to chase away the heavy mantle of the night He could only see her graceful outline now the small queenly head with its wealth of reddish golden curls and the glittering gems forming the small star shaped red flower which she wore as a diadem in her hair Twenty four hours after our marriage Madame the Marquis de saint Cyr and all his family perished on the guillotine and the popular rumour reached me that it was the wife of Sir Percy Blakeney who helped to send them there Nay I myself told you the truth of that odious tale Not till after it had been recounted to me by strangers with all its horrible details And you believed them then and there she said with great vehemence without a proof or question you believed that I whom you vowed you loved more than life whom you professed you worshipped that I could do a thing so base as these STRANGERS chose to recount You thought I meant to deceive you about it all that I ought to have spoken before I married you yet had you listened I would have told you that up to the very morning on which saint Cyr went to the guillotine I was straining every nerve using every influence I possessed to save him and his family But my pride sealed my lips when your love seemed to perish as if under the knife of that same guillotine Yet I would have told you how I was duped Aye I whom that same popular rumour had endowed with the sharpest wits in France I was tricked into doing this thing by men who knew how to play upon my love for an only brother and my desire for revenge Was it unnatural Her voice became choked with tears She paused for a moment or two trying to regain some sort of composure She looked appealingly at him almost as if he were her judge He had allowed her to speak on in her own vehement impassioned way offering no comment no word of sympathy and now while she paused trying to swallow down the hot tears that gushed to her eyes he waited impassive and still The dim grey light of early dawn seemed to make his tall form look taller and more rigid The lazy good natured face looked strangely altered Marguerite excited as she was could see that the eyes were no longer languid the mouth no longer good humoured and inane A curious look of intense passion seemed to glow from beneath his drooping lids the mouth was tightly closed the lips compressed as if the will alone held that surging passion in check Marguerite Blakeney was above all a woman with all a woman s fascinating foibles all a woman s most lovable sins She knew in a moment that for the past few months she had been mistaken that this man who stood here before her cold as a statue when her musical voice struck upon his ear loved her as he had loved her a year ago that his passion might have been dormant but that it was there as strong as intense as overwhelming as when first her lips met his in one long maddening kiss Pride had kept him from her and woman like she meant to win back that conquest which had been hers before Suddenly it seemed to her that the only happiness life could ever hold for her again would be in feeling that man s kiss once more upon her lips Listen to the tale Sir Percy she said and her voice was low sweet infinitely tender Armand was all in all to me We had no parents and brought one another up He was my little father and I his tiny mother we loved one another so Then one day do you mind me Sir Percy the Marquis de saint Cyr had my brother Armand thrashed thrashed by his lacqueys that brother whom I loved better than all the world And his offence That he a plebeian had dared to love the daughter of the aristocrat for that he was waylaid and thrashed thrashed like a dog within an inch of his life Oh how I suffered his humiliation had eaten into my very soul When the opportunity occurred and I was able to take my revenge I took it But I only thought to bring that proud marquis to trouble and humiliation He plotted with Austria against his own country Chance gave me knowledge of this I spoke of it but I did not know how could I guess they trapped and duped me When I realised what I had done it was too late It is perhaps a little difficult Madame said Sir Percy after a moment of silence between them to go back over the past I have confessed to you that my memory is short but the thought certainly lingered in my mind that at the time of the Marquis death I entreated you for an explanation of those same noisome popular rumours If that same memory does not even now play me a trick I fancy that you refused me ALL explanation then and demanded of my love a humiliating allegiance it was not prepared to give I wished to test your love for me and it did not bear the test You used to tell me that you drew the very breath of life but for me and for love of me And to probe that love you demanded that I should forfeit mine honour he said whilst gradually his impassiveness seemed to leave him his rigidity to relax that I should accept without murmur or question as a dumb and submissive slave every action of my mistress My heart overflowing with love and passion I ASKED for no explanation I WAITED for one not doubting only hoping Had you spoken but one word from you I would have accepted any explanation and believed it But you left me without a word beyond a bald confession of the actual horrible facts proudly you returned to your brother s house and left me alone for weeks not knowing now in whom to believe since the shrine which contained my one illusion lay shattered to earth at my feet She need not complain now that he was cold and impassive his very voice shook with an intensity of passion which he was making superhuman efforts to keep in check Aye the madness of my pride she said sadly Hardly had I gone already I had repented But when I returned I found you oh so altered wearing already that mask of somnolent indifference which you have never laid aside until until now She was so close to him that her soft loose hair was wafted against his cheek her eyes glowing with tears maddened him the music in her voice sent fire through his veins But he would not yield to the magic charm of this woman whom he had so deeply loved and at whose hands his pride had suffered so bitterly He closed his eyes to shut out the dainty vision of that sweet face of that snow white neck and graceful figure round which the faint rosy light of dawn was just beginning to hover playfully Nay Madame it is no mask he said icily I swore to you once that my life was yours For months now it has been your plaything it has served its purpose But now she knew that the very coldness was a mask The trouble the sorrow she had gone through last night suddenly came back into her mind but no longer with bitterness rather with a feeling that this man who loved her would help her bear the burden Sir Percy she said impulsively Heaven knows you have been at pains to make the task which I had set to myself difficult to accomplish You spoke of my mood just now well we will call it that if you will I wished to speak to you because because I was in trouble and had need of your sympathy It is yours to command Madame How cold you are she sighed Faith I can scarce believe that but a few months ago one tear in my eye had set you well nigh crazy Now I come to you with a half broken heart and and I pray you Madame he said whilst his voice shook almost as much as hers in what way can I serve you Percy Armand is in deadly danger A letter of his rash impetuous as were all his actions and written to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes has fallen into the hands of a fanatic Armand is hopelessly compromised to morrow perhaps he will be arrested after that the guillotine unless oh it is horrible she said with a sudden wail of anguish as all the events of the past night came rushing back to her mind horrible and you do not understand you cannot and I have no one to whom I can turn for help or even for sympathy Tears now refused to be held back All her trouble her struggles the awful uncertainty of Armand s fate overwhelmed her She tottered ready to fall and leaning against the tone balustrade she buried her face in her hands and sobbed bitterly At first mention of Armand saint Just s name and of the peril in which he stood Sir Percy s face had become a shade more pale and the look of determination and obstinacy appeared more marked than ever between his eyes However he said nothing for the moment but watched her as her delicate frame was shaken with sobs watched her until unconsciously his face softened and what looked almost like tears seemed to glisten in his eyes And so he said with bitter sarcasm the murderous dog of the revolution is turning upon the very hands that fed it Begad Madame he added very gently as Marguerite continued to sob hysterically will you dry your tears I never could bear to see a pretty woman cry and I Instinctively with sudden overmastering passion at the sight of her helplessness and of her grief he stretched out his arms and the next would have seized her and held her to him protected from every evil with his very life his very heart s blood But pride had the better of it in this struggle once again he restrained himself with a tremendous effort of will and said coldly though still very gently Will you not turn to me Madame and tell me in what way I may have the honour to serve you She made a violent effort to control herself and turning her tear stained face to him she once more held out her hand which he kissed with the same punctilious gallantry but Marguerite s fingers this time lingered in his hand for a second or two longer than was absolutely necessary and this was because she had felt that his hand trembled perceptibly and was burning hot whilst his lips felt as cold as marble Can you do aught for Armand she said sweetly and simply You have so much influence at court so many friends Nay Madame should you not seek the influence of your French friend M Chauvelin His extends if I mistake not even as far as the Republican Government of France I cannot ask him Percy Oh I wish I dared to tell you but but he has put a price on my brother s head which She would have given worlds if she had felt the courage then to tell him everything all she had done that night how she had suffered and how her hand had been forced But she dared not give way to that impulse not now when she was just beginning to feel that he still loved her when she hoped that she could win him back She dared not make another confession to him After all he might not understand he might not sympathise with her struggles and temptation His love still dormant might sleep the sleep of death Perhaps he divined what was passing in her mind His whole attitude was one of intense longing a veritable prayer for that confidence which her foolish pride withheld from him When she remained silent he sighed and said with marked coldness Faith Madame since it distresses you we will not speak of it As for Armand I pray you have no fear I pledge you my word that he shall be safe Now have I your permission to go The hour is getting late and You will at least accept my gratitude she said as she drew quite close to him and speaking with real tenderness With a quick almost involuntary effort he would have taken her then in his arms for her eyes were swimming in tears which he longed to kiss away but she had lured him once just like this then cast him aside like an ill fitting glove He thought this was but a mood a caprice and he was too proud to lend himself to it once again It is too soon Madame he said quietly I have done nothing as yet The hour is late and you must be fatigued Your women will be waiting for you upstairs He stood aside to allow her to pass She sighed a quick sigh of disappointment His pride and her beauty had been in direct conflict and his pride had remained the conqueror Perhaps after all she had been deceived just now what she took to be the light of love in his eyes might only have been the passion of pride or who knows of hatred instead of love She stood looking at him for a moment or two longer He was again as rigid as impassive as before Pride had conquered and he cared naught for her The grey light of dawn was gradually yielding to the rosy light of the rising sun Birds began to twitter Nature awakened smiling in happy response to the warmth of this glorious October morning Only between these two hearts there lay a strong impassable barrier built up of pride on both sides which neither of them cared to be the first to demolish He had bent his tall figure in a low ceremonious bow as she finally with another bitter little sigh began to mount the terrace steps The long train of her gold embroidered gown swept the dead leaves off the steps making a faint harmonious sh sh sh as she glided up with one hand resting on the balustrade the rosy light of dawn making an aureole of gold round her hair and causing the rubies on her head and arms to sparkle She reached the tall glass doors which led into the house Before entering she paused once again to look at him hoping against hope to see his arms stretched out to her and to hear his voice calling her back But he had not moved his massive figure looked the very personification of unbending pride of fierce obstinacy Hot tears again surged to her eyes as she would not let him see them she turned quickly within and ran as fast as she could up to her own rooms Had she but turned back then and looked out once more on to the rose lit garden she would have seen that which would have made her own sufferings seem but light and easy to bear a strong man overwhelmed with his own passion and his own despair Pride had given way at last obstinacy was gone the will was powerless He was but a man madly blindly passionately in love and as soon as her light footsteps had died away within the house he knelt down upon the terrace steps and in the very madness of his love he kissed one by one the places where her small foot had trodden and the stone balustrade there where her tiny hand had rested last CHAPTER XVII FAREWELL When Marguerite reached her room she found her maid terribly anxious about her Your ladyship will be so tired said the poor woman whose own eyes were half closed with sleep It is past five o clock Ah yes Louise I daresay I shall be tired presently said Marguerite kindly but you are very tired now so go to bed at once I ll get into bed alone But my lady Now don t argue Louise but go to bed Give me a wrap and leave me alone Louise was only too glad to obey She took off her mistress s gorgeous ball dress and wrapped her up in a soft billowy gown Does your ladyship wish for anything else she asked when that was done No nothing more Put out the lights as you go out
3728_105398_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes my lady 
none	none	Good night my lady Good night Louise When the maid was gone Marguerite drew aside the curtains and threw open the windows The garden and the river beyond were flooded with rosy light Far away to the east the rays of the rising sun had changed the rose into vivid gold The lawn was deserted now and Marguerite looked down upon the terrace where she had stood a few moments ago trying in vain to win back a man s love which once had been so wholly hers It was strange that through all her troubles all her anxiety for Armand she was mostly conscious at the present moment of a keen and bitter heartache Her very limbs seemed to ache with longing for the love of a man who had spurned her who had resisted her tenderness remained cold to her appeals and had not responded to the glow of passion which had caused her to feel and hope that those happy olden days in Paris were not all dead and forgotten How strange it all was She loved him still And now that she looked back upon the last few months of misunderstandings and of loneliness she realised that she had never ceased to love him that deep down in her heart she had always vaguely felt that his foolish inanities his empty laugh his lazy nonchalance were nothing but a mask that the real man strong passionate wilful was there still the man she had loved whose intensity had fascinated her whose personality attracted her since she always felt that behind his apparently slow wits there was a certain something which he kept hidden from all the world and most especially from her A woman s heart is such a complex problem the owner thereof is often most incompetent to find the solution of this puzzle Did Marguerite Blakeney the cleverest woman in Europe really love a fool Was it love that she had felt for him a year ago when she married him Was it love she felt for him now that she realised that he still loved her but that he would not become her slave her passionate ardent lover once again Nay Marguerite herself could not have told that Not at this moment at any rate perhaps her pride had sealed her mind against a better understanding of her own heart But this she did know that she meant to capture that obstinate heart back again That she would conquer once more and then that she would never lose him She would keep him keep his love deserve it and cherish it for this much was certain that there was no longer any happiness possible for her without that one man s love Thus the most contradictory thoughts and emotions rushed madly through her mind Absorbed in them she had allowed time to slip by perhaps tired out with long excitement she had actually closed her eyes and sunk into a troubled sleep wherein quickly fleeting dreams seemed but the continuation of her anxious thoughts when suddenly she was roused from dream or meditation by the noise of footsteps outside her door Nervously she jumped up and listened the house itself was as still as ever the footsteps had retreated Through her wide open window the brilliant rays of the morning sun were flooding her room with light She looked up at the clock it was half past six too early for any of the household to be already astir She certainly must have dropped asleep quite unconsciously The noise of the footsteps also of hushed subdued voices had awakened her what could they be Gently on tip toe she crossed the room and opened the door to listen not a sound that peculiar stillness of the early morning when sleep with all mankind is at its heaviest But the noise had made her nervous and when suddenly at her feet on the very doorstep she saw something white lying there a letter evidently she hardly dared touch it It seemed so ghostlike It certainly was not there when she came upstairs had Louise dropped it or was some tantalising spook at play showing her fairy letters where none existed At last she stooped to pick it up and amazed puzzled beyond measure she saw that the letter was addressed to herself in her husband s large businesslike looking hand What could he have to say to her in the middle of the night which could not be put off until the morning She tore open the envelope and read A most unforeseen circumstance forces me to leave for the North immediately so I beg your ladyship s pardon if I do not avail myself of the honour of bidding you good bye My business may keep me employed for about a week so I shall not have the privilege of being present at your ladyship s water party on Wednesday I remain your ladyship s most humble and most obedient servant PERCY BLAKENEY Marguerite must suddenly have been imbued with her husband s slowness of intellect for she had perforce to read the few simple lines over and over again before she could fully grasp their meaning She stood on the landing turning over and over in her hand this curt and mysterious epistle her mind a blank her nerves strained with agitation and a presentiment she could not very well have explained Sir Percy owned considerable property in the North certainly and he had often before gone there alone and stayed away a week at a time but it seemed so very strange that circumstances should have arisen between five and six o clock in the morning that compelled him to start in this extreme hurry Vainly she tried to shake off an unaccustomed feeling of nervousness she was trembling from head to foot A wild unconquerable desire seized her to see her husband again at once if only he had not already started Forgetting the fact that she was only very lightly clad in a morning wrap and that her hair lay loosely about her shoulders she flew down the stairs right through the hall towards the front door It was as usual barred and bolted for the indoor servants were not yet up but her keen ears had detected the sound of voices and the pawing of a horse s hoof against the flag stones With nervous trembling fingers Marguerite undid the bolts one by one bruising her hands hurting her nails for the locks were heavy and stiff But she did not care her whole frame shook with anxiety at the very thought that she might be too late that he might have gone without her seeing him and bidding him God speed At last she had turned the key and thrown open the door Her ears had not deceived her A groom was standing close by holding a couple of horses one of these was Sultan Sir Percy s favourite and swiftest horse saddled ready for a journey The next moment Sir Percy himself appeared round the further corner of the house and came quickly towards the horses He had changed his gorgeous ball costume but was as usual irreproachably and richly apparelled in a suit of fine cloth with lace jabot and ruffles high top boots and riding breeches Marguerite went forward a few steps He looked up and saw her A slight frown appeared between his eyes You are going she said quickly and feverishly Whither As I have had the honour of informing your ladyship urgent most unexpected business calls me to the North this morning he said in his usual cold drawly manner But your guests to morrow I have prayed your ladyship to offer my humble excuses to His Royal Highness You are such a perfect hostess I do not think I shall be missed But surely you might have waited for your journey until after our water party she said still speaking quickly and nervously Surely this business is not so urgent and you said nothing about it just now My business as I had the honour to tell you Madame is as unexpected as it is urgent May I therefore crave your permission to go Can I do aught for you in town on my way back No no thanks nothing But you will be back soon Very soon Before the end of the week I cannot say He was evidently trying to get away whilst she was straining every nerve to keep him back for a moment or two Percy she said will you not tell me why you go to day Surely I as your wife have the right to know You have NOT been called away to the North I know it There were no letters no couriers from there before we left for the opera last night and nothing was waiting for you when we returned from the ball You are NOT going to the North I feel convinced There is some mystery and Nay there is no mystery Madame he replied with a slight tone of impatience My business has to do with Armand there Now have I your leave to depart With Armand But you will run no danger Danger I Nay Madame your solicitude does me honour As you say I have some influence my intention is to exert it before it be too late Will you allow me to thank you at least Nay Madame he said coldly there is no need for that My life is at your service and I am already more than repaid And mine will be at yours Sir Percy if you will but accept it in exchange for what you do for Armand she said as impulsively she stretched out both her hands to him There I will not detain you my thoughts go with you Farewell How lovely she looked in this morning sunlight with her ardent hair streaming around her shoulders He bowed very low and kissed her hand she felt the burning kiss and her heart thrilled with joy and hope You will come back she said tenderly Very soon he replied looking longingly into her blue eyes And you will remember she asked as her eyes in response to his look gave him an infinity of promise I will always remember Madame that you have honoured me by commanding my services The words were cold and formal but they did not chill her this time Her woman s heart had read his beneath the impassive mask his pride still forced him to wear He bowed to her again then begged her leave to depart She stood on one side whilst he jumped on to Sultan s back then as he galloped out of the gates she waved him a final Adieu A bend in the road soon hid him from view his confidential groom had some difficulty in keeping pace with him for Sultan flew along in response to his master s excited mood Marguerite with a sigh that was almost a happy one turned and went within She went back to her room for suddenly like a tired child she felt quite sleepy Her heart seemed all at once to be in complete peace and though it still ached with undefined longing a vague and delicious hope soothed it as with a balm She felt no longer anxious about Armand The man who had just ridden away bent on helping her brother inspired her with complete confidence in his strength and in his power She marvelled at herself for having ever looked upon him as an inane fool of course THAT was a mask worn to hide the bitter wound she had dealt to his faith and to his love His passion would have overmastered him and he would not let her see how much he still cared and how deeply he suffered But now all would be well she would crush her own pride humble it before him tell him everything trust him in everything and those happy days would come back when they used to wander off together in the forests of Fontainebleau when they spoke little for he was always a silent man but when she felt that against that strong heart she would always find rest and happiness The more she thought of the events of the past night the less fear had she of Chauvelin and his schemes He had failed to discover the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel of that she felt sure Both Lord Fancourt and Chauvelin himself had assured her that no one had been in the dining room at one o clock except the Frenchman himself and Percy Yes Percy she might have asked him had she thought of it Anyway she had no fears that the unknown and brave hero would fall in Chauvelin s trap his death at any rate would not be at her door Armand certainly was still in danger but Percy had pledged his word that Armand would be safe and somehow as Marguerite had seen him riding away the possibility that he could fail in whatever he undertook never even remotely crossed her mind When Armand was safely over in England she would not allow him to go back to France She felt almost happy now and drawing the curtains closely together again to shut out the piercing sun she went to bed at last laid her head upon the pillow and like a wearied child soon fell into a peaceful and dreamless sleep CHAPTER XVIII THE MYSTERIOUS DEVICE The day was well advanced when Marguerite woke refreshed by her long sleep Louise had brought her some fresh milk and a dish of fruit and she partook of this frugal breakfast with hearty appetite Thoughts crowded thick and fast in her mind as she munched her grapes most of them went galloping away after the tall erect figure of her husband whom she had watched riding out of sight more than five hours ago In answer to her eager inquiries Louise brought back the news that the groom had come home with Sultan having left Sir Percy in London The groom thought that his master was about to get on board his schooner which was lying off just below London Bridge Sir Percy had ridden thus far had then met Briggs the skipper of the DAY DREAM and had sent the groom back to Richmond with Sultan and the empty saddle This news puzzled Marguerite more than ever Where could Sir Percy be going just now in the DAY DREAM On Armand s behalf he had said Well Sir Percy had influential friends everywhere Perhaps he was going to Greenwich or but Marguerite ceased to conjecture all would be explained anon he said that he would come back and that he would remember A long idle day lay before Marguerite She was expecting a visit of her old school fellow little Suzanne de Tournay With all the merry mischief at her command she had tendered her request for Suzanne s company to the Comtesse in the Presence of the Prince of Wales last night His Royal Highness had loudly applauded the notion and declared that he would give himself the pleasure of calling on the two ladies in the course of the afternoon The Comtesse had not dared to refuse and then and there was entrapped into a promise to send little Suzanne to spend a long and happy day at Richmond with her friend Marguerite expected her eagerly she longed for a chat about old school days with the child she felt that she would prefer Suzanne s company to that of anyone else and together they would roam through the fine old garden and rich deer park or stroll along the river But Suzanne had not come yet and Marguerite being dressed prepared to go downstairs She looked quite a girl this morning in her simple muslin frock with a broad blue sash round her slim waist and the dainty cross over fichu into which at her bosom she had fastened a few late crimson roses She crossed the landing outside her own suite of apartments and stood still for a moment at the head of the fine oak staircase which led to the lower floor On her left were her husband s apartments a suite of rooms which she practically never entered They consisted of bedroom dressing and reception room and at the extreme end of the landing of a small study which when Sir Percy did not use it was always kept locked His own special and confidential valet Frank had charge of this room No one was ever allowed to go inside My lady had never cared to do so and the other servants had of course not dared to break this hard and fast rule Marguerite had often with that good natured contempt which she had recently adopted towards her husband chaffed him about this secrecy which surrounded his private study Laughingly she had always declared that he strictly excluded all prying eyes from his sanctum for fear they should detect how very little study went on within its four walls a comfortable arm chair for Sir Percy s sweet slumbers was no doubt its most conspicuous piece of furniture Marguerite thought of all this on this bright October morning as she glanced along the corridor Frank was evidently busy with his master s rooms for most of the doors stood open that of the study amongst the others A sudden burning childish curiosity seized her to have a peep at Sir Percy s sanctum This restriction of course did not apply to her and Frank would of course not dare to oppose her Still she hoped that the valet would be busy in one of the other rooms that she might have that one quick peep in secret and unmolested Gently on tip toe she crossed the landing and like Blue Beard s wife trembling half with excitement and wonder she paused a moment on the threshold strangely perturbed and irresolute The door was ajar and she could not see anything within She pushed it open tentatively there was no sound Frank was evidently not there and she walked boldly in At once she was struck by the severe simplicity of everything around her the dark and heavy hangings the massive oak furniture the one or two maps on the wall in no way recalled to her mind the lazy man about town the lover of race courses the dandified leader of fashion that was the outward representation of Sir Percy Blakeney There was no sign here at any rate of hurried departure Everything was in its place not a scrap of paper littered the floor not a cupboard or drawer was left open The curtains were drawn aside and through the open window the fresh morning air was streaming in Facing the window and well into the centre of the room stood a ponderous business like desk which looked as if it had seen much service On the wall to the left of the desk reaching almost from floor to ceiling was a large full length portrait of a woman magnificently framed exquisitely painted and signed with the name of Boucher It was Percy s mother Marguerite knew very little about her except that she had died abroad ailing in body as well as in mind while Percy was still a lad She must have been a very beautiful woman once when Boucher painted her and as Marguerite looked at the portrait she could not but be struck by the extraordinary resemblance which must have existed between mother and son There was the same low square forehead crowned with thick fair hair smooth and heavy the same deep set somewhat lazy blue eyes beneath firmly marked straight brows and in those eyes there was the same intensity behind that apparent laziness the same latent passion which used to light up Percy s face in the olden days before his marriage and which Marguerite had again noted last night at dawn when she had come quite close to him and had allowed a note of tenderness to creep into her voice Marguerite studied the portrait for it interested her after that she turned and looked again at the ponderous desk It was covered with a mass of papers all neatly tied and docketed which looked like accounts and receipts arrayed with perfect method It had never before struck Marguerite nor had she alas found it worth while to inquire as to how Sir Percy whom all the world had credited with a total lack of brains administered the vast fortune which his father had left him Since she had entered this neat orderly room she had been taken so much by surprise that this obvious proof of her husband s strong business capacities did not cause her more than a passing thought of wonder But it also strengthened her in the now certain knowledge that with his worldly inanities his foppish ways and foolish talk he was not only wearing a mask but was playing a deliberate and studied part Marguerite wondered again Why should he take all this trouble Why should he who was obviously a serious earnest man wish to appear before his fellow men as an empty headed nincompoop He may have wished to hide his love for a wife who held him in contempt but surely such an object could have been gained at less sacrifice and with far less trouble than constant incessant acting of an unnatural part She looked round her quite aimlessly now she was horribly puzzled and a nameless dread before all this strange unaccountable mystery had begun to seize upon her She felt cold and uncomfortable suddenly in this severe and dark room There were no pictures on the wall save the fine Boucher portrait only a couple of maps both of parts of France one of the North coast and the other of the environs of Paris What did Sir Percy want with those she wondered Her head began to ache she turned away from this strange Blue Beard s chamber which she had entered and which she did not understand She did not wish Frank to find her here and with a fast look round she once more turned to the door As she did so her foot knocked against a small object which had apparently been lying close to the desk on the carpet and which now went rolling right across the room She stooped to pick it up It was a solid gold ring with a flat shield on which was engraved a small device Marguerite turned it over in her fingers and then studied the engraving on the shield It represented a small star shaped flower of a shape she had seen so distinctly twice before once at the opera and once at Lord Grenville s ball 
3728_105398_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XIX THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL
3728_105398_000002_000000	train-clean-360	At what particular moment the strange doubt first crept into Marguerite s mind she could not herself have said 
none	none	With the ring tightly clutched in her hand she had run out of the room down the stairs and out into the garden where in complete seclusion alone with the flowers and the river and the birds she could look again at the ring and study that device more closely 
3728_105398_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Stupidly senselessly now sitting beneath the shade of an overhanging sycamore she was looking at the plain gold shield with the star shaped little flower engraved upon it 
none	none	Bah It was ridiculous she was dreaming her nerves were overwrought and she saw signs and mysteries in the most trivial coincidences 
3728_105398_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Had not everybody about town recently made a point of affecting the device of that mysterious and heroic Scarlet Pimpernel 
3728_105398_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Did she herself wear it embroidered on her gowns 
3728_105398_000005_000001	train-clean-360	set in gems and enamel in her hair 
3728_105398_000005_000002	train-clean-360	What was there strange in the fact that Sir Percy should have chosen to use the device as a seal ring 
3728_105398_000005_000003	train-clean-360	He might easily have done that yes quite easily and besides what connection could there be between her exquisite dandy of a husband with his fine clothes and refined lazy ways and the daring plotter who rescued French victims from beneath the very eyes of the leaders of a bloodthirsty revolution 
3728_105398_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Her thoughts were in a whirl her mind a blank 
none	none	She did not see anything that was going on around her and was quite startled when a fresh young voice called to her across the garden CHERIE CHERIE where are you and little Suzanne fresh as a rosebud with eyes dancing with glee and brown curls fluttering in the soft morning breeze came running across the lawn They told me you were in the garden she went on prattling merrily and throwing herself with a pretty girlish impulse into Marguerite s arms so I ran out to give you a surprise 
3728_105398_000008_000001	train-clean-360	You did not expect me quite so soon did you my darling little Margot CHERIE 
none	none	Marguerite who had hastily concealed the ring in the folds of her kerchief tried to respond gaily and unconcernedly to the young girl s impulsiveness
3728_105398_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed sweet one she said with a smile it is delightful to have you all to myself and for a nice whole long day 
3728_105398_000010_000001	train-clean-360	You won t be bored 
3728_105398_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh bored 
3728_105398_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Margot how CAN you say such a wicked thing 
none	none	Why when we were in the dear old convent together we were always happy when we were allowed to be alone together
3728_105398_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 And to talk secrets 
3728_105398_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The two young girls had linked their arms in one another s and began wandering round the garden 
3728_105398_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh how lovely your home is Margot darling said little Suzanne enthusiastically and how happy you must be 
none	none	Aye indeed 
3728_105398_000015_000001	train-clean-360	I ought to be happy oughtn t I sweet one said Marguerite with a wistful little sigh 
3728_105398_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 How sadly you say it CHERIE 
none	none	Ah well I suppose now that you are a married woman you won t care to talk secrets with me any longer Oh what lots and lots of secrets we used to have at school 
3728_105398_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Do you remember some we did not even confide to Sister Theresa of the Holy Angels though she was such a dear 
none	none	And now you have one all important secret eh little one said Marguerite merrily which you are forthwith going to confide in me Nay you need not blush CHERIE she added as she saw Suzanne s pretty little face crimson with blushes
3728_105398_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Faith there s naught to be ashamed of 
none	none	He is a noble and true man and one to be proud of as a lover and as a husband
3728_105398_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed CHERIE I am not ashamed rejoined Suzanne softly and it makes me very very proud to hear you speak so well of him 
3728_105398_000018_000001	train-clean-360	I think maman will consent she added thoughtfully and I shall be oh so happy but of course nothing is to be thought of until papa is safe 
3728_105398_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Marguerite started 
3728_105398_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Suzanne s father 
3728_105398_000019_000002	train-clean-360	the Comte de Tournay one of those whose life would be jeopardised if Chauvelin succeeded in establishing the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel 
none	none	She had understood all along from the Comtesse and also from one or two of the members of the league that their mysterious leader had pledged his honour to bring the fugitive Comte de Tournay safely out of France Whilst little Suzanne unconscious of all save her own all important little secret went prattling on Marguerite s thoughts went back to the events of the past night 
3728_105398_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Armand s peril Chauvelin s threat his cruel Either or which she had accepted 
3728_105398_000022_000000	train-clean-360	And then her own work in the matter which should have culminated at one o clock in Lord Grenville s dining room when the relentless agent of the French Government would finally learn who was this mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel who so openly defied an army of spies and placed himself so boldly and for mere sport on the side of the enemies of France 
3728_105398_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Since then she had heard nothing from Chauvelin 
3728_105398_000023_000001	train-clean-360	She had concluded that he had failed and yet she had not felt anxious about Armand because her husband had promised her that Armand would be safe 
3728_105398_000024_000000	train-clean-360	But now suddenly as Suzanne prattled merrily along an awful horror came upon her for what she had done 
3728_105398_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Chauvelin had told her nothing it was true but she remembered how sarcastic and evil he looked when she took final leave of him after the ball 
3728_105398_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Had he discovered something then 
3728_105398_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Had he already laid his plans for catching the daring plotter red handed in France and sending him to the guillotine without compunction or delay 
3728_105398_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Marguerite turned sick with horror and her hand convulsively clutched the ring in her dress 
3728_105398_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 You are not listening CHERIE said Suzanne reproachfully as she paused in her long highly interesting narrative 
3728_105398_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes yes darling indeed I am said Marguerite with an effort forcing herself to smile 
3728_105398_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 I love to hear you talking and your happiness makes me so very glad 
none	none	Have no fear we will manage to propitiate maman 
3728_105398_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Sir Andrew Ffoulkes is a noble English gentleman he has money and position the Comtesse will not refuse her consent But now little one tell me what is the latest news about your father 
3728_105398_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh said Suzanne with mad glee the best we could possibly hear 
3728_105398_000028_000001	train-clean-360	My Lord Hastings came to see maman early this morning 
3728_105398_000028_000002	train-clean-360	He said that all is now well with dear papa and we may safely expect him here in England in less than four days 
3728_105398_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Marguerite whose glowing eyes were fastened on Suzanne s lips as she continued merrily 
3728_105398_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh we have no fear now 
3728_105398_000030_000001	train-clean-360	You don t know CHERIE that that great and noble Scarlet Pimpernel himself has gone to save papa 
3728_105398_000030_000002	train-clean-360	He has gone CHERIE actually gone added Suzanne excitedly he was in London this morning he will be in Calais perhaps to morrow where he will meet papa and then and then 
3728_105398_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The blow had fallen 
none	none	She had expected it all along though she had tried for the last half hour to delude herself and to cheat her fears 
3728_105398_000031_000002	train-clean-360	He had gone to Calais had been in London this morning he the Scarlet Pimpernel 
3728_105398_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Percy Blakeney her husband whom she had betrayed last night to Chauvelin 
none	none	Percy 
3728_105398_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Percy her husband the Scarlet Pimpernel 
3728_105398_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Oh how could she have been so blind 
none	none	She understood it all now all at once that part he played the mask he wore in order to throw dust in everybody s eyes 
3728_105398_000033_000000	train-clean-360	And all for the sheer sport and devilry of course saving men women and children from death as other men destroy and kill animals for the excitement the love of the thing 
none	none	The idle rich man wanted some aim in life he and the few young bucks he enrolled under his banner had amused themselves for months in risking their lives for the sake of an innocent few Perhaps he had meant to tell her when they were first married and then the story of the Marquis de saint Cyr had come to his ears and he had suddenly turned from her thinking no doubt that she might someday betray him and his comrades who had sworn to follow him and so he had tricked her as he tricked all others whilst hundreds now owed their lives to him and many families owed him both life and happiness The mask of an inane fop had been a good one and the part consummately well played 
3728_105398_000035_000001	train-clean-360	No wonder that Chauvelin s spies had failed to detect in the apparently brainless nincompoop the man whose reckless daring and resourceful ingenuity had baffled the keenest French spies both in France and in England 
none	none	Even last night when Chauvelin went to Lord Grenville s dining room to seek that daring Scarlet Pimpernel he only saw that inane Sir Percy Blakeney fast asleep in a corner of the sofa 
3728_105398_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Had his astute mind guessed the secret then 
3728_105398_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Here lay the whole awful horrible amazing puzzle 
3728_105398_000036_000002	train-clean-360	In betraying a nameless stranger to his fate in order to save her brother had Marguerite Blakeney sent her husband to his death 
none	none	No no no a thousand times no Surely Fate could not deal a blow like that Nature itself would rise in revolt her hand when it held that tiny scrap of paper last night would have surely have been struck numb ere it committed a deed so appalling and so terrible
3728_105398_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 But what is it CHERIE said little Suzanne now genuinely alarmed for Marguerite s colour had become dull and ashen 
3728_105398_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 Are you ill Marguerite 
none	none	What is it
3728_105398_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing nothing child she murmured as in a dream 
none	none	Wait a moment let me think think 
3728_105398_000039_000002	train-clean-360	You said the Scarlet Pimpernel had gone today 
none	none	Marguerite CHERIE what is it 
3728_105398_000040_000001	train-clean-360	You frighten me 
none	none	It is nothing child I tell you nothing 
3728_105398_000041_000001	train-clean-360	I must be alone a minute and dear one 
none	none	I may have to curtail our time together to day 
3728_105398_000041_000003	train-clean-360	I may have to go away you ll understand 
3728_105398_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I understand that something has happened CHERIE and that you want to be alone 
none	none	I won t be a hindrance to you 
3728_105398_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Don t think of me 
3728_105398_000042_000003	train-clean-360	My maid Lucile has not yet gone we will go back together don t think of me 
none	none	She threw her arms impulsively round Marguerite 
3728_105398_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Child as she was she felt the poignancy of her friend s grief and with the infinite tact of her girlish tenderness she did not try to pry into it but was ready to efface herself 
none	none	She kissed Marguerite again and again then walked sadly back across the lawn 
3728_105398_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Marguerite did not move she remained there thinking wondering what was to be done 
3728_105398_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Just as little Suzanne was about to mount the terrace steps a groom came running round the house towards his mistress 
3728_105398_000045_000001	train-clean-360	He carried a sealed letter in his hand 
3728_105398_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Suzanne instinctively turned back her heart told her that here perhaps was further ill news for her friend and she felt that poor Margot was not in a fit state to bear any more 
3728_105398_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The groom stood respectfully beside his mistress then he handed her the sealed letter 
3728_105398_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 What is that asked Marguerite 
3728_105398_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Just come by runner my lady 
3728_105398_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Marguerite took the letter mechanically and turned it over in her trembling fingers 
3728_105398_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Who sent it she said 
3728_105398_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 The runner said my lady replied the groom that his orders were to deliver this and that your ladyship would understand from whom it came 
3728_105398_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Marguerite tore open the envelope 
3728_105398_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Already her instinct told her what it contained and her eyes only glanced at it mechanically 
none	none	It was a letter by Armand saint Just to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes the letter which Chauvelin s spies had stolen at The Fisherman s Rest and which Chauvelin had held as a rod over her to enforce her obedience Now he had kept his word he had sent her back saint Just s compromising letter for he was on the track of the Scarlet Pimpernel 
3728_105398_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Marguerite s senses reeled her very soul seemed to be leaving her body she tottered and would have fallen but for Suzanne s arm round her waist 
3728_105398_000055_000001	train-clean-360	With superhuman effort she regained control over herself there was yet much to be done 
3728_105398_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Bring that runner here to me she said to the servant with much calm He has not gone 
3728_105398_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 No my lady 
3728_105398_000058_000000	train-clean-360	The groom went and Marguerite turned to Suzanne 
3728_105398_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 And you child run within 
3728_105398_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Tell Lucile to get ready 
3728_105398_000059_000002	train-clean-360	I fear that I must send you home child 
none	none	And stay tell one of the maids to prepare a travelling dress and cloak for me 
3728_105398_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Suzanne made no reply 
3728_105398_000060_000001	train-clean-360	She kissed Marguerite tenderly and obeyed without a word the child was overawed by the terrible nameless misery in her friend s face 
3728_105398_000061_000000	train-clean-360	A minute later the groom returned followed by the runner who had brought the letter 
3728_105398_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Who gave you this packet asked Marguerite 
3728_105398_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 A gentleman my lady replied the man at The Rose and Thistle inn opposite Charing Cross 
3728_105398_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 at The Rose and Thistle 
none	none	inn opposite Charing Cross 
3728_105398_000063_000001	train-clean-360	He said you would understand 
none	none	At The Rose and Thistle What was he doing
3728_105398_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 He was waiting for the coach your ladyship which he had ordered 
none	none	The coach Yes my lady 
3728_105398_000067_000001	train-clean-360	A special coach he had ordered 
3728_105398_000067_000002	train-clean-360	I understood from his man that he was posting straight to Dover 
3728_105398_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 That s enough 
3728_105398_000068_000001	train-clean-360	You may go Then she turned to the groom My coach and the four swiftest horses in the stables to be ready at once 
none	none	The groom and runner both went quickly off to obey 
3728_105398_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Marguerite remained standing for a moment on the lawn quite alone 
3728_105398_000069_000002	train-clean-360	Her graceful figure was as rigid as a statue her eyes were fixed her hands were tightly clasped across her breast her lips moved as they murmured with pathetic heart breaking persistence 
3728_105398_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 What s to be done 
3728_105398_000070_000001	train-clean-360	What s to be done 
none	none	What s to be done 
3728_105398_000070_000002	train-clean-360	Where to find him Oh God grant me light 
3728_105398_000071_000000	train-clean-360	But this was not the moment for remorse and despair 
3728_105398_000071_000001	train-clean-360	She had done unwittingly an awful and terrible thing the very worst crime in her eyes that woman ever committed she saw it in all its horror 
none	none	Her very blindness in not having guessed her husband s secret seemed now to her another deadly sin 
3728_105398_000071_000003	train-clean-360	She ought to have known she ought to have known 
3728_105398_000072_000000	train-clean-360	How could she imagine that a man who could love with so much intensity as Percy Blakeney had loved her from the first how could such a man be the brainless idiot he chose to appear 
3728_105398_000072_000001	train-clean-360	She at least ought to have known that he was wearing a mask and having found that out she should have torn it from his face whenever they were alone together 
none	none	Her love for him had been paltry and weak easily crushed by her own pride and she too had worn a mask in assuming a contempt for him whilst as a matter of fact she completely misunderstood him 
3728_105398_000074_000000	train-clean-360	But there was no time now to go over the past 
3728_105398_000074_000001	train-clean-360	By her own blindness she had sinned now she must repay not by empty remorse but by prompt and useful action 
3728_105398_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Percy had started for Calais utterly unconscious of the fact that his most relentless enemy was on his heels 
3728_105398_000075_000001	train-clean-360	He had set sail early that morning from London Bridge 
3728_105398_000075_000002	train-clean-360	Provided he had a favourable wind he would no doubt be in France within twenty four hours no doubt he had reckoned on the wind and chosen this route 
3728_105398_000076_000000	train-clean-360	Chauvelin on the other hand would post to Dover charter a vessel there and undoubtedly reach Calais much about the same time 
3728_105398_000076_000001	train-clean-360	Once in Calais Percy would meet all those who were eagerly waiting for the noble and brave Scarlet Pimpernel who had come to rescue them from horrible and unmerited death 
3728_105398_000076_000002	train-clean-360	With Chauvelin s eyes now fixed upon his every movement Percy would thus not only be endangering his own life but that of Suzanne s father the old Comte de Tournay and of those other fugitives who were waiting for him and trusting in him 
none	none	There was also Armand who had gone to meet de Tournay secure in the knowledge that the Scarlet Pimpernel was watching over his safety All these lives and that of her husband lay in Marguerite s hands these she must save if human pluck and ingenuity were equal to the task 
3728_105398_000078_000000	train-clean-360	Unfortunately she could not do all this quite alone 
3728_105398_000078_000001	train-clean-360	Once in Calais she would not know where to find her husband whilst Chauvelin in stealing the papers at Dover had obtained the whole itinerary 
3728_105398_000078_000002	train-clean-360	Above every thing she wished to warn Percy 
3728_105398_000079_000000	train-clean-360	She knew enough about him by now to understand that he would never abandon those who trusted in him that he would not turn his back from danger and leave the Comte de Tournay to fall into the bloodthirsty hands that knew of no mercy 
3728_105398_000079_000001	train-clean-360	But if he were warned he might form new plans be more wary more prudent 
3728_105398_000079_000002	train-clean-360	Unconsciously he might fall into a cunning trap but once warned he might yet succeed 
none	none	And if he failed if indeed Fate and Chauvelin with all the resources at his command proved too strong for the daring plotter after all then at least she would be there by his side to comfort love and cherish to cheat death perhaps at the last by making it seem sweet if they died both together locked in each other s arms with the supreme happiness of knowing that passion had responded to passion and that all misunderstandings were at an end 
3728_105398_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Her whole body stiffened as with a great and firm resolution 
3728_105398_000081_000001	train-clean-360	This she meant to do if God gave her wits and strength 
3728_105398_000081_000002	train-clean-360	Her eyes lost their fixed look they glowed with inward fire at the thought of meeting him again so soon in the very midst of most deadly perils they sparkled with the joy of sharing these dangers with him of helping him perhaps of being with him at the last if she failed 
3728_105398_000082_000000	train-clean-360	The childlike sweet face had become hard and set the curved mouth was closed tightly over her clenched teeth 
3728_105398_000082_000001	train-clean-360	She meant to do or die with him and for his sake 
3728_105398_000082_000002	train-clean-360	A frown which spoke of an iron will and unbending resolution appeared between the two straight brows already her plans were formed 
3728_105398_000082_000003	train-clean-360	She would go and find Sir Andrew Ffoulkes first he was Percy s best friend and Marguerite remembered with a thrill with what blind enthusiasm the young man always spoke of his mysterious leader 
3728_105398_000083_000000	train-clean-360	He would help her where she needed help her coach was ready 
3728_105398_000083_000001	train-clean-360	A change of raiment and a farewell to little Suzanne and she could be on her way 
none	none	Without haste but without hesitation she walked quietly into the house CHAPTER XX THE FRIEND Less than half an hour later Marguerite buried in thoughts sat inside her coach which was bearing her swiftly to London She had taken an affectionate farewell of little Suzanne and seen the child safely started with her maid and in her own coach back to town She had sent one courier with a respectful letter of excuse to His Royal Highness begging for a postponement of the august visit on account of pressing and urgent business 
7699-105399-0001	train-other-500	and another on ahead to bespeak a fresh relay of horses at Faversham Then she had changed her muslin frock for a dark traveling costume and mantle had provided herself with money which her husband s lavishness always placed fully at her disposal
7699-105399-0002	train-other-500	and had started on her way She did not attempt to delude herself with any vain and futile hopes the safety of her brother Armand was to have been conditional on the imminent capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel
7699-105399-0003	train-other-500	As Chauvelin had sent her back Armand s compromising letter there was no doubt that he was quite satisfied in his own mind that Percy Blakeney was the man whose death he had sworn to bring about No there was no room for any fond delusions
7699-105399-0004	train-other-500	Percy the husband whom she loved with all the ardour which her admiration for his bravery had kindled was in immediate deadly peril through her hand She had betrayed him to his enemy unwittingly tis true but she HAD betrayed him
none	none	 and if Chauvelin succeeded in trapping him who so far was unaware of his danger then his death would be at her door His death when with her very heart s blood she would have defended him and given willingly her life for his She had ordered her coach to drive her to the Crown inn once there she told her coachman to give the horses food and rest Then she ordered a chair and had herself carried to the house in Pall Mall where Sir Andrew Ffoulkes lived 
7699-105399-0005	train-other-500	Among all Percy s friends who were enrolled under his daring banner
none	none	 she felt that she would prefer to confide in Sir Andrew Ffoulkes He had always been her friend 
7699-105399-0006	train-other-500	and now his love for little Suzanne had brought him closer to her still Had he been away from home gone on the mad errand with Percy perhaps
none	none	 then she would have called on Lord Hastings or Lord Tony for she wanted the help of one of these young men or she would indeed be powerless to save her husband Sir Andrew Ffoulkes however was at home 
7699-105399-0007	train-other-500	and his servant introduced her ladyship immediately She went upstairs to the young man s comfortable bachelor s chambers and was shown into a small though luxuriously furnished dining room
none	none	 A moment or two later Sir Andrew himself appeared He had evidently been much startled when he heard who his lady visitor was for he looked anxiously even suspiciously at Marguerite whilst performing the elaborate bows before her 
7699-105399-0008	train-other-500	which the rigid etiquette of the time demanded Marguerite had laid aside every vestige of nervousness
none	none	 she was perfectly calm 
7699-105399-0009	train-other-500	and having returned the young man s elaborate salute she began very calmly Sir Andrew I have no desire to waste valuable time in much talk You must take certain things I am going to tell you for granted These will be of no importance
none	none	 What is important is that your leader and comrade the Scarlet Pimpernel my husband Percy Blakeney is in deadly peril Had she the remotest doubt of the correctness of her deductions she would have had them confirmed now 
7699-105399-0010	train-other-500	for Sir Andrew completely taken by surprise had grown very pale and was quite incapable of making the slightest attempt at clever parrying
none	none	 No matter how I know this Sir Andrew she continued quietly 
7699-105399-0011	train-other-500	thank God that I do and that perhaps it is not too late to save him Unfortunately I cannot do this quite alone and therefore have come to you for help Lady Blakeney said the young man trying to recover himself
7699-105399-0012	train-other-500	I Will you hear me first she interrupted This is how the matter stands
none	none	 When the agent of the French Government stole your papers that night in Dover he found amongst them certain plans which you or your leader meant to carry out for the rescue of the Comte de Tournay and others The Scarlet Pimpernel Percy my husband has gone on this errand himself to day Chauvelin knows that the Scarlet Pimpernel and Percy Blakeney are one and the same person He will follow him to Calais and there will lay hands on him You know as well as I do the fate that awaits him at the hands of the Revolutionary Government of France No interference from England from King George himself would save him Robespierre and his gang would see to it that the interference came too late 
7699-105399-0013	train-other-500	But not only that the much trusted leader will also have been unconsciously the means of revealing the hiding place of the Comte de Tournay and of all those who even now are placing their hopes in him
7699-105399-0014	train-other-500	She had spoken quietly dispassionately and with firm unbending resolution Her purpose was to make that young man trust and help her for she could do nothing without him I do not understand
7699-105399-0015	train-other-500	he repeated trying to gain time to think what was best to be done
7699-105399-0016	train-other-500	Aye but I think you do Sir Andrew You must know that I am speaking the truth Look these facts straight in the face Percy has sailed for Calais I presume for some lonely part of the coast and Chauvelin is on his track HE has posted for Dover
none	none	 and will cross the Channel probably to night What do you think will happen The young man was silent Percy will arrive at his destination unconscious of being followed he will seek out de Tournay and the others among these is Armand saint Just 
7699-105399-0017	train-other-500	my brother he will seek them out one after another probably not knowing that the sharpest eyes in the world are watching his every movement When he has thus unconsciously betrayed those who blindly trust in him
7699-105399-0018	train-other-500	when nothing can be gained from him and he is ready to come back to England with those whom he has gone so bravely to save the doors of the trap will close upon him and he will be sent to end his noble life upon the guillotine
7699-105399-0019	train-other-500	Still Sir Andrew was silent You do not trust me she said passionately Oh God cannot you see that I am in deadly earnest
none	none	 Man man she added while with her tiny hands she seized the young man suddenly by the shoulders 
7699-105399-0020	train-other-500	forcing him to look straight at her
none	none	 tell me do I look like that vilest thing on earth a woman who would betray her own husband 
7699-105399-0021	train-other-500	God forbid Lady Blakeney said the young man at last that I should attribute such evil motives to you but But what tell me Quick man the very seconds are precious
none	none	 Will you tell me he asked resolutely and looking searchingly into her blue eyes whose hand helped to guide M Chauvelin to the knowledge which you say he possesses 
7699-105399-0022	train-other-500	Mine she said quietly I own it I will not lie to you for I wish you to trust me absolutely But I had no idea how COULD I have of the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel
7699-105399-0023	train-other-500	and my brother s safety was to be my prize if I succeeded In helping Chauvelin to track the Scarlet Pimpernel She nodded It is no use telling you how he forced my hand Armand is more than a brother to me and
7699-105399-0024	train-other-500	and how COULD I guess But we waste time Sir Andrew every second is precious in the name of God my husband is in peril
7699-105399-0025	train-other-500	your friend your comrade Help me to save him Sir Andrew felt his position to be a very awkward one The oath he had taken before his leader and comrade was one of obedience and secrecy
7699-105399-0026	train-other-500	and yet the beautiful woman who was asking him to trust her was undoubtedly in earnest his friend and leader was equally undoubtedly in imminent danger and Lady Blakeney he said at last
7699-105399-0027	train-other-500	God knows you have perplexed me so that I do not know which way my duty lies Tell me what you wish me to do There are nineteen of us ready to lay down our lives for the Scarlet Pimpernel if he is in danger
7699-105399-0028	train-other-500	There is no need for lives just now my friend she said drily my wits and four swift horses will serve the necessary purpose But I must know where to find him See she added while her eyes filled with tears
7699-105399-0029	train-other-500	I have humbled myself before you I have owned my fault to you shall I also confess my weakness
none	none	 My husband and I have 
7699-105399-0030	train-other-500	been estranged because he did not trust me and because I was too blind to understand You must confess that the bandage which he put over my eyes was a very thick one
none	none	 Is it small wonder that I did not see through it 
7699-105399-0031	train-other-500	But last night after I led him unwittingly into such deadly peril it suddenly fell from my eyes If you will not help me Sir Andrew I would still strive to save my husband
none	none	 I would still exert every faculty I possess for his sake but I might be powerless for I might arrive too late and nothing would be left for you but lifelong remorse and and for me a broken heart But Lady Blakeney said the young man touched by the gentle earnestness of this exquisitely beautiful woman do you know that what you propose doing is man s work you cannot possibly journey to Calais alone You would be running the greatest possible risks to yourself and your chances of finding your husband now were I to direct you ever so carefully are infinitely remote Oh I hope there are risks she murmured softly I hope there are dangers too 
7699-105399-0032	train-other-500	I have so much to atone for But I fear you are mistaken Chauvelin s eyes are fixed upon you all he will scarce notice me Quick Sir Andrew the coach is ready and there is not a moment to be lost I MUST get to him
none	none	 I MUST she repeated with almost savage energy to warn him that that man is on his track Can t you see can t you see that I MUST get to him even even if it be too late to save him at least 
7699-105399-0033	train-other-500	to be by his side at the least Faith Madame you must command me Gladly would I or any of my comrades lay down our lives for your husband If you WILL go yourself
7699-105399-0034	train-other-500	Nay friend do you not see that I would go mad if I let you go without me She stretched out her hand to him You WILL trust me
none	none	 I await your orders 
7699-105399-0035	train-other-500	he said simply Listen then My coach is ready to take me to Dover Do you follow me as swiftly as horses will take you We meet at nightfall at The Fisherman s Rest
none	none	 Chauvelin would avoid it as he is known there 
7699-105399-0036	train-other-500	and I think it would be the safest I will gladly accept your escort to Calais
none	none	 as you say I might miss Sir Percy were you to direct me ever so carefully We ll charter a schooner at Dover and cross over during the night 
7699-105399-0037	train-other-500	Disguised if you will agree to it as my lacquey you will I think escape detection I am entirely at your service Madame rejoined the young man earnestly I trust to God that you will sight the DAY DREAM before we reach Calais
none	none	 With Chauvelin at his heels every step the Scarlet Pimpernel takes on French soil is fraught with danger God grant it Sir Andrew 
7699-105399-0038	train-other-500	But now farewell We meet to night at Dover It will be a race between Chauvelin and me across the Channel to night and the prize the life of the Scarlet Pimpernel He kissed her hand
7699-105399-0039	train-other-500	and then escorted her to her chair A quarter of an hour later she was back at the Crown inn
none	none	 where her coach and horses were ready and waiting for her The next moment they thundered along the London streets 
7699-105399-0040	train-other-500	and then straight on to the Dover road at maddening speed She had no time for despair now She was up and doing and had no leisure to think
none	none	 With Sir Andrew Ffoulkes as her companion and ally hope had once again revived in her heart God would be merciful He would not allow so appalling a crime to be committed as the death of a brave man through the hand of a woman who loved him and worshipped him and who would gladly have died for his sake 
7699-105399-0041	train-other-500	Marguerite s thoughts flew back to him the mysterious hero whom she had always unconsciously loved when his identity was still unknown to her Laughingly in the olden days she used to call him the shadowy king of her heart
7699-105399-0042	train-other-500	and now she had suddenly found that this enigmatic personality whom she had worshipped and the man who loved her so passionately were one and the same what wonder that one or two happier visions began to force their way before her mind
7699-105399-0043	train-other-500	She vaguely wondered what she would say to him when first they would stand face to face She had had so many anxieties so much excitement during the past few hours
7699-105399-0044	train-other-500	that she allowed herself the luxury of nursing these few more hopeful brighter thoughts
none	none	 Gradually the rumble of the coach wheels with its incessant monotony acted soothingly on her nerves her eyes aching with fatigue and many shed and unshed tears closed involuntarily and she fell into a troubled sleep CHAPTER XXI SUSPENSE It was late into the night when she at last reached The Fisherman s Rest She had done the whole journey in less than eight hours thanks to innumerable changes of horses at the various coaching stations for which she always paid lavishly thus obtaining the very best and swiftest that could be had Her coachman too had been indefatigable the promise of special and rich reward had no doubt helped to keep him up and he had literally burned the ground beneath his mistress coach wheels The arrival of Lady Blakeney in the middle of the night caused a considerable flutter at The Fisherman s Rest Sally jumped hastily out of bed and mister Jellyband was at great pains how to make his important guest comfortable Both of these good folk were far too well drilled in the manners appertaining to innkeepers to exhibit the slightest surprise at Lady Blakeney s arrival alone at this extraordinary hour No doubt they thought all the more but Marguerite was far too absorbed in the importance the deadly earnestness of her journey to stop and ponder over trifles of that sort The coffee room the scene lately of the dastardly outrage on two English gentlemen was quite deserted mister Jellyband hastily relit the lamp rekindled a cheerful bit of fire in the great hearth and then wheeled a comfortable chair by it into which Marguerite gratefully sank Will your ladyship stay the night asked pretty Miss Sally who was already busy laying a snow white cloth on the table preparatory to providing a simple supper for her ladyship No not the whole night replied Marguerite At any rate I shall not want any room but this if I can have it to myself for an hour or two It is at your ladyship s service said honest Jellyband whose rubicund face was set in its tightest folds lest it should betray before the quality that boundless astonishment which the very worthy fellow had begun to feel I shall be crossing over at the first turn of the tide said Marguerite and in the first schooner I can get But my coachman and men will stay the night and probably several days longer so I hope you will make them comfortable Yes my lady I ll look after them Shall Sally bring your ladyship some supper Yes please Put something cold on the table and as soon as Sir Andrew Ffoulkes comes show him in here Yes my lady Honest Jellyband s face now expressed distress in spite of himself He had great regard for Sir Percy Blakeney and did not like to see his lady running away with young Sir Andrew Of course it was no business of his and mister Jellyband was no gossip Still in his heart he recollected that her ladyship was after all only one of them furriners what wonder that she was immoral like the rest of them Don t sit up honest Jellyband continued Marguerite kindly nor you either Mistress Sally Sir Andrew may be late Jellyband was only too willing that Sally should go to bed He was beginning not to like these goings on at all Still Lady Blakeney would pay handsomely for the accommodation and it certainly was no business of his Sally arranged a simple supper of cold meat wine and fruit on the table then with a respectful curtsey she retired wondering in her little mind why her ladyship looked so serious when she was about to elope with her gallant Then commenced a period of weary waiting for Marguerite She knew that Sir Andrew who would have to provide himself with clothes befitting a lacquey could not possibly reach Dover for at least a couple of hours He was a splendid horseman of course and would make light in such an emergency of the seventy odd miles between London and Dover He would too literally burn the ground beneath his horse s hoofs but he might not always get very good remounts and in any case he could not have started from London until at least an hour after she did She had seen nothing of Chauvelin on the road Her coachman whom she questioned had not seen anyone answering the description his mistress gave him of the wizened figure of the little Frenchman Evidently therefore he had been ahead of her all the time She had not dared to question the people at the various inns where they had stopped to change horses She feared that Chauvelin had spies all along the route who might overhear her questions then outdistance her and warn her enemy of her approach Now she wondered at what inn he might be stopping or whether he had had the good luck of chartering a vessel already and was now himself on the way to France That thought gripped her at the heart as with an iron vice If indeed she should not be too late already The loneliness of the room overwhelmed her everything within was so horribly still the ticking of the grandfather s clock dreadfully slow and measured was the only sound which broke this awful loneliness Marguerite had need of all her energy all her steadfastness of purpose to keep up her courage through this weary midnight waiting Everyone else in the house but herself must have been asleep She had heard Sally go upstairs mister Jellyband had gone to see to her coachman and men and then had returned and taken up a position under the porch outside just where Marguerite had first met Chauvelin about a week ago He evidently meant to wait up for Sir Andrew Ffoulkes but was soon overcome by sweet slumbers for presently in addition to the slow ticking of the clock Marguerite could hear the monotonous and dulcet tones of the worthy fellow s breathing For some time now she had realised that the beautiful warm October s day so happily begun had turned into a rough and cold night She had felt very chilly and was glad of the cheerful blaze in the hearth but gradually as time wore on the weather became more rough and the sound of the great breakers against the Admiralty Pier though some distance from the inn came to her as the noise of muffled thunder The wind was becoming boisterous rattling the leaded windows and the massive doors of the old fashioned house it shook the trees outside and roared down the vast chimney Marguerite wondered if the wind would be favourable for her journey She had no fear of the storm and would have braved worse risks sooner than delay the crossing by an hour A sudden commotion outside roused her from her meditations Evidently it was Sir Andrew Ffoulkes just arrived in mad haste for she heard his horse s hoofs thundering on the flag stones outside then mister Jellyband s sleepy yet cheerful tones bidding him welcome For a moment then the awkwardness of her position struck Marguerite alone at this hour in a place where she was well known and having made an assignation with a young cavalier equally well known and who arrived in disguise What food for gossip to those mischievously inclined The idea struck Marguerite chiefly from its humorous side there was such quaint contrast between the seriousness of her errand and the construction which would naturally be put on her actions by honest mister Jellyband that for the first time since many hours a little smile began playing round the corners of her childlike mouth and when presently Sir Andrew almost unrecognisable in his lacquey like garb entered the coffee room she was able to greet him with quite a merry laugh Faith Monsieur my lacquey she said I am satisfied with your appearance mister Jellyband had followed Sir Andrew looking strangely perplexed The young gallant s disguise had confirmed his worst suspicions Without a smile upon his jovial face he drew the cork from the bottle of wine set the chairs ready and prepared to wait Thanks honest friend said Marguerite who was still smiling at the thought of what the worthy fellow must be thinking at that very moment we shall require nothing more and here s for all the trouble you have been put to on our account She handed two or three gold pieces to Jellyband who took them respectfully and with becoming gratitude Stay Lady Blakeney interposed Sir Andrew as Jellyband was about to retire I am afraid we shall require something more of my friend Jelly s hospitality I am sorry to say we cannot cross over to night Not cross over to night she repeated in amazement But we must Sir Andrew we must There can be no question of cannot and whatever it may cost we must get a vessel to night But the young man shook his head sadly I am afraid it is not a question of cost Lady Blakeney There is a nasty storm blowing from France the wind is dead against us we cannot possibly sail until it has changed Marguerite became deadly pale She had not foreseen this Nature herself was playing her a horrible cruel trick Percy was in danger and she could not go to him because the wind happened to blow from the coast of France But we must go we must she repeated with strange persistent energy you know we must go can t you find a way I have been down to the shore already he said and had a talk to one or two skippers It is quite impossible to set sail to night so every sailor assured me No one he added looking significantly at Marguerite NO ONE could possibly put out of Dover to night Marguerite at once understood what he meant NO ONE included Chauvelin as well as herself She nodded pleasantly to Jellyband Well then I must resign myself she said to him Have you a room for me Oh yes your ladyship A nice bright airy room I ll see to it at once And there is another one for Sir Andrew both quite ready That s brave now mine honest Jelly said Sir Andrew gaily and clapping his worth host vigorously on the back You unlock both those rooms and leave our candles here on the dresser I vow you are dead with sleep and her ladyship must have some supper before she retires There have no fear friend of the rueful countenance her ladyship s visit though at this unusual hour is a great honour to thy house and Sir Percy Blakeney will reward thee doubly if thou seest well to her privacy and comfort Sir Andrew had no doubt guessed the many conflicting doubts and fears which raged in honest Jellyband s head and as he was a gallant gentleman he tried by this brave hint to allay some of the worthy innkeeper s suspicions He had the satisfaction of seeing that he had partially succeeded Jellyband s rubicund countenance brightened somewhat at the mention of Sir Percy s name I ll go and see to it at once sir he said with alacrity and with less frigidity in his manner Has her ladyship everything she wants for supper Everything thanks honest friend and as I am famished and dead with fatigue I pray you see to the rooms Now tell me she said eagerly as soon as Jellyband had gone from the room tell me all your news There is nothing else much to tell you Lady Blakeney replied the young man The storm makes it quite impossible for any vessel to put out of Dover this tide But what seems to you at first a terrible calamity is really a blessing in disguise If we cannot cross over to France to night Chauvelin is in the same quandary He may have left before the storm broke out God grant he may said Sir Andrew merrily for very likely then he ll have been driven out of his course Who knows He may now even be lying at the bottom of the sea for there is a furious storm raging and it will fare ill with all small craft which happen to be out But I fear me we cannot build our hopes upon the shipwreck of that cunning devil and of all his murderous plans The sailors I spoke to all assured me that no schooner had put out of Dover for several hours on the other hand I ascertained that a stranger had arrived by coach this afternoon and had like myself made some inquiries about crossing over to France Then Chauvelin is still in Dover Undoubtedly Shall I go waylay him and run my sword through him That were indeed the quickest way out of the difficulty Nay Sir Andrew do not jest Alas I have often since last night caught myself wishing for that fiend s death But what you suggest is impossible The laws of this country do not permit of murder It is only in our beautiful France that wholesale slaughter is done lawfully in the name of Liberty and of brotherly love Sir Andrew had persuaded her to sit down to the table to partake of some supper and to drink a little wine This enforced rest of at least twelve hours until the next tide was sure to be terribly difficult to bear in the state of intense excitement in which she was Obedient in these small matters like a child Marguerite tried to eat and drink Sir Andrew with that profound sympathy born in all those who are in love made her almost happy by talking to her about her husband He recounted to her some of the daring escapes the brave Scarlet Pimpernel had contrived for the poor French fugitives whom a relentless and bloody revolution was driving out of their country He made her eyes glow with enthusiasm by telling her of his bravery his ingenuity his resourcefulness when it meant snatching the lives of men women and even children from beneath the very edge of that murderous ever ready guillotine He even made her smile quite merrily by telling her of the Scarlet Pimpernel s quaint and many disguises through which he had baffled the strictest watch set against him at the barricades of Paris This last time the escape of the Comtesse de Tournay and her children had been a veritable masterpiece Blakeney disguised as a hideous old market woman in filthy cap and straggling grey locks was a sight fit to make the gods laugh Marguerite laughed heartily as Sir Andrew tried to describe Blakeney s appearance whose gravest difficulty always consisted in his great height which in France made disguise doubly difficult Thus an hour wore on There were many more to spend in enforced inactivity in Dover Marguerite rose from the table with an impatient sigh She looked forward with dread to the night in the bed upstairs with terribly anxious thoughts to keep her company and the howling of the storm to help chase sleep away She wondered where Percy was now The DAY DREAM was a strong well built sea going yacht Sir Andrew had expressed the opinion that no doubt she had got in the lee of the wind before the storm broke out or else perhaps had not ventured into the open at all but was lying quietly at Gravesend Briggs was an expert skipper and Sir Percy handled a schooner as well as any master mariner There was no danger for them from the storm It was long past midnight when at last Marguerite retired to rest As she had feared sleep sedulously avoided her eyes Her thoughts were of the blackest during these long weary hours whilst that incessant storm raged which was keeping her away from Percy The sound of the distant breakers made her heart ache with melancholy She was in the mood when the sea has a saddening effect upon the nerves It is only when we are very happy that we can bear to gaze merrily upon the vast and limitless expanse of water rolling on and on with such persistent irritating monotony to the accompaniment of our thoughts whether grave or gay When they are gay the waves echo their gaiety but when they are sad then every breaker as it rolls seems to bring additional sadness and to speak to us of hopelessness and of the pettiness of all our joys CHAPTER XXII CALAIS The weariest nights the longest days sooner or later must perforce come to an end Marguerite had spent over fifteen hours in such acute mental torture as well nigh drove her crazy After a sleepless night she rose early wild with excitement dying to start on her journey terrified lest further obstacles lay in her way She rose before anyone else in the house was astir so frightened was she lest she should miss the one golden opportunity of making a start When she came downstairs she found Sir Andrew Ffoulkes sitting in the coffee room He had been out half an hour earlier and had gone to the Admiralty Pier only to find that neither the French packet nor any privately chartered vessel could put out of Dover yet The storm was then at its fullest and the tide was on the turn If the wind did not abate or change they would perforce have to wait another ten or twelve hours until the next tide before a start could be made And the storm had not abated the wind had not changed and the tide was rapidly drawing out Marguerite felt the sickness of despair when she heard this melancholy news Only the most firm resolution kept her from totally breaking down and thus adding to the young man s anxiety which evidently had become very keen Though he tried to hide it Marguerite could see that Sir Andrew was just as anxious as she was to reach his comrade and friend This enforced inactivity was terrible to them both How they spent that wearisome day at Dover Marguerite could never afterwards say She was in terror of showing herself lest Chauvelin s spies happened to be about so she had a private sitting room and she and Sir Andrew sat there hour after hour trying to take at long intervals some perfunctory meals which little Sally would bring them with nothing to do but to think to conjecture and only occasionally to hope The storm had abated just too late the tide was by then too far out to allow a vessel to put off to sea The wind had changed and was settling down to a comfortable north westerly breeze a veritable godsend for a speedy passage across to France And there those two waited wondering if the hour would ever come when they could finally make a start There had been one happy interval in this long weary day and that was when Sir Andrew went down once again to the pier and presently came back to tell Marguerite that he had chartered a quick schooner whose skipper was ready to put to sea the moment the tide was favourable From that moment the hours seemed less wearisome there was less hopelessness in the waiting and at last at five o clock in the afternoon Marguerite closely veiled and followed by Sir Andrew Ffoulkes who in the guise of her lacquey was carrying a number of impedimenta found her way down to the pier Once on board the keen fresh sea air revived her the breeze was just strong enough to nicely swell the sails of the FOAM CREST as she cut her way merrily towards the open The sunset was glorious after the storm and Marguerite as she watched the white cliffs of Dover gradually disappearing from view felt more at peace and once more almost hopeful Sir Andrew was full of kind attentions and she felt how lucky she had been to have him by her side in this her great trouble Gradually the grey coast of France began to emerge from the fast gathering evening mists One or two lights could be seen flickering and the spires of several churches to rise out of the surrounding haze Half an hour later Marguerite had landed upon French shore She was back in that country where at this very moment men slaughtered their fellow creatures by the hundreds and sent innocent women and children in thousands to the block The very aspect of the country and its people even in this remote sea coast town spoke of that seething revolution three hundred miles away in beautiful Paris now rendered hideous by the constant flow of the blood of her noblest sons by the wailing of the widows and the cries of fatherless children The men all wore red caps in various stages of cleanliness but all with the tricolor cockade pinned on the left side Marguerite noticed with a shudder that instead of the laughing merry countenance habitual to her own countrymen their faces now invariably wore a look of sly distrust Every man nowadays was a spy upon his fellows the most innocent word uttered in jest might at any time be brought up as a proof of aristocratic tendencies or of treachery against the people Even the women went about with a curious look of fear and of hate lurking in their brown eyes and all watched Marguerite as she stepped on shore followed by Sir Andrew and murmured as she passed along SACRES ARISTOS or else SACRES ANGLAIS Otherwise their presence excited no further comment Calais even in those days was in constant business communication with England and English merchants were often seen on this coast It was well known that in view of the heavy duties in England a vast deal of French wines and brandies were smuggled across This pleased the French BOURGEOIS immensely he liked to see the English Government and the English king both of whom he hated cheated out of their revenues and an English smuggler was always a welcome guest at the tumble down taverns of Calais and Boulogne So perhaps as Sir Andrew gradually directed Marguerite through the tortuous streets of Calais many of the population who turned with an oath to look at the strangers clad in English fashion thought that they were bent on purchasing dutiable articles for their own fog ridden country and gave them no more than a passing thought Marguerite however wondered how her husband s tall massive figure could have passed through Calais unobserved she marvelled what disguise he assumed to do his noble work without exciting too much attention Without exchanging more than a few words Sir Andrew was leading her right across the town to the other side from that where they had landed and the way towards Cap Gris Nez The streets were narrow tortuous and mostly evil smelling with a mixture of stale fish and damp cellar odours There had been heavy rain here during the storm last night and sometimes Marguerite sank ankle deep in the mud for the roads were not lighted save by the occasional glimmer from a lamp inside a house But she did not heed any of these petty discomforts We may meet Blakeney at the Chat Gris Sir Andrew had said when they landed and she was walking as if on a carpet of rose leaves for she was going to meet him almost at once At last they reached their destination Sir Andrew evidently knew the road for he had walked unerringly in the dark and had not asked his way from anyone It was too dark then for Marguerite to notice the outside aspect of this house The Chat Gris as Sir Andrew had called it was evidently a small wayside inn on the outskirts of Calais and on the way to Gris Nez It lay some little distance from the coast for the sound of the sea seemed to come from afar Sir Andrew knocked at the door with the knob of his cane and from within Marguerite heard a sort of grunt and the muttering of a number of oaths Sir Andrew knocked again this time more peremptorily more oaths were heard and then shuffling steps seemed to draw near the door Presently this was thrown open and Marguerite found herself on the threshold of the most dilapidated most squalid room she had ever seen in all her life The paper such as it was was hanging from the walls in strips there did not seem to be a single piece of furniture in the room that could by the wildest stretch of imagination be called whole Most of the chairs had broken backs others had no seats to them one corner of the table was propped up with a bundle of faggots there where the fourth leg had been broken In one corner of the room there was a huge hearth over which hung a stock pot with a not altogether unpalatable odour of hot soup emanating therefrom On one side of the room high up in the wall there was a species of loft before which hung a tattered blue and white checked curtain A rickety set of steps led up to this loft On the great bare walls with their colourless paper all stained with varied filth there were chalked up at intervals in great bold characters the words Liberte Egalite Fraternite The whole of this sordid abode was dimly lighted by an evil smelling oil lamp which hung from the rickety rafters of the ceiling It all looked so horribly squalid so dirty and uninviting that Marguerite hardly dared to cross the threshold Sir Andrew however had stepped unhesitatingly forward English travellers citoyen he said boldly and speaking in French The individual who had come to the door in response to Sir Andrew s knock and who presumably was the owner of this squalid abode was an elderly heavily built peasant dressed in a dirty blue blouse heavy sabots from which wisps of straw protruded all round shabby blue trousers and the inevitable red cap with the tricolour cockade that proclaimed his momentary political views He carried a short wooden pipe from which the odour of rank tobacco emanated He looked with some suspicion and a great deal of contempt at the two travellers muttering SACRRRES ANGLAIS and spat upon the ground to further show his independence of spirit but nevertheless he stood aside to let them enter no doubt well aware that these same SACCRES ANGLAIS always had well filled purses Oh lud said Marguerite as she advanced into the room holding her handkerchief to her dainty nose what a dreadful hole Are you sure this is the place Aye tis the place sure enough replied the young man as with his lace edged fashionable handkerchief he dusted a chair for Marguerite to sit on but I vow I never saw a more villainous hole Faith she said looking round with some curiosity and a great deal of horror at the dilapidated walls the broken chairs the rickety table it certainly does not look inviting The landlord of the Chat Gris by name Brogard had taken no further notice of his guests he concluded that presently they would order supper and in the meanwhile it was not for a free citizen to show deference or even courtesy to anyone however smartly they might be dressed By the hearth sat a huddled up figure clad seemingly mostly in rags that figure was apparently a woman although even that would have been hard to distinguish except for the cap which had once been white and for what looked like the semblance of a petticoat She was sitting mumbling to herself and from time to time stirring the brew in her stock pot Hey my friend said Sir Andrew at last we should like some supper The citoyenne there he added is concocting some delicious soup I ll warrant and my mistress has not tasted food for several hours It took Brogard some few minutes to consider the question A free citizen does not respond too readily to the wishes of those who happen to require something of him SACRRRES ARISTOS he murmured and once more spat upon the ground Then he went very slowly up to a dresser which stood in a corner of the room from this he took an old pewter soup tureen and slowly and without a word he handed it to his better half who in the same silence began filling the tureen with the soup out of her stock pot Marguerite had watched all these preparations with absolute horror were it not for the earnestness of her purpose she would incontinently have fled from this abode of dirt and evil smells Faith our host and hostess are not cheerful people said Sir Andrew seeing the look of horror on Marguerite s face I would I could offer you a more hearty and more appetising meal but I think you will find the soup eatable and the wine good these people wallow in dirt but live well as a rule Nay I pray you Sir Andrew she said gently be not anxious about me My mind is scarce inclined to dwell on thoughts of supper Brogard was slowly pursuing his gruesome preparations he had placed a couple of spoons also two glasses on the table both of which Sir Andrew took the precaution of wiping carefully Brogard had also produced a bottle of wine and some bread and Marguerite made an effort to draw her chair to the table and to make some pretence at eating Sir Andrew as befitting his ROLE of lacquey stood behind her chair Nay Madame I pray you he said seeing that Marguerite seemed quite unable to eat I beg of you to try and swallow some food remember you have need of all your strength The soup certainly was not bad it smelt and tasted good Marguerite might have enjoyed it but for the horrible surroundings She broke the bread however and drank some of the wine Nay Sir Andrew she said I do not like to see you standing You have need of food just as much as I have This creature will only think that I am an eccentric Englishwoman eloping with her lacquey if you ll sit down and partake of this semblance of supper beside me Indeed Brogard having placed what was strictly necessary upon the table seemed not to trouble himself any further about his guests The Mere Brogard had quietly shuffled out of the room and the man stood and lounged about smoking his evil smelling pipe sometimes under Marguerite s very nose as any free born citizen who was anybody s equal should do Confound the brute said Sir Andrew with native British wrath as Brogard leant up against the table smoking and looking down superciliously at these two SACRRRES ANGLAIS In Heaven s name man admonished Marguerite hurriedly seeing that Sir Andrew with British born instinct was ominously clenching his fist remember that you are in France and that in this year of grace this is the temper of the people I d like to scrag the brute muttered Sir Andrew savagely He had taken Marguerite s advice and sat next to her at table and they were both making noble efforts to deceive one another by pretending to eat and drink I pray you said Marguerite keep the creature in a good temper so that he may answer the questions we must put to him I ll do my best but begad I d sooner scrag him than question him Hey my friend he said pleasantly in French and tapping Brogard lightly on the shoulder do you see many of our quality along these parts Many English travellers I mean Brogard looked round at him over his near shoulder puffed away at his pipe for a moment or two as he was in no hurry then muttered Heu sometimes Ah said Sir Andrew carelessly English travellers always know where they can get good wine eh my friend Now tell me my lady was desiring to know if by any chance you happen to have seen a great friend of hers an English gentleman who often comes to Calais on business he is tall and recently was on his way to Paris my lady hoped to have met him in Calais Marguerite tried not to look at Brogard lest she should betray before him the burning anxiety with which she waited for his reply But a free born French citizen is never in any hurry to answer questions Brogard took his time then he said very slowly Tall Englishman To day Yes Yes to day muttered Brogard sullenly Then he quietly took Sir Andrew s hat from a chair close by put it on his own head tugged at his dirty blouse and generally tried to express in pantomime that the individual in question wore very fine clothes SACRRE ARISTO he muttered that tall Englishman Marguerite could scarce repress a scream It s Sir Percy right enough she murmured and not even in disguise S

none	none	in the midst of all her anxiety and through her gathering tears at the thought of the ruling passion strong in death of Percy running into the wildest maddest dangers with the latest cut coat upon his back and the laces of his jabot unruffled Oh the foolhardiness of it she sighed Quick Sir Andrew ask the man when he went Ah yes my friend said Sir Andrew addressing Brogard with the same assumption of carelessness my lord always wears beautiful clothes the tall Englishman you saw was certainly my lady s friend And he has gone you say He went yes but he s coming back here he ordered supper Sir Andrew put his hand with a quick gesture of warning upon Marguerite s arm it came none too sooe for the next moment her wild mad joy would have betrayed her He was safe and well was coming back here presently she would see him in a few moments perhaps Oh the wildness of her joy seemed almost more than she could bear Here she said to Brogard who seemed suddenly to have been transformed in her eyes into some heaven born messenger of bliss Here did you say the English gentleman was coming back here The heaven born messenger of bliss spat upon the floor to express his contempt for all and sundry ARISTOS who chose to haunt the Chat Gris Heu he muttered he ordered supper he will come back SACRRE ANGLAIS he added by way of protest against all this fuss for a mere Englishman But where is he now Do you know she asked eagerly placing her dainty white hand upon the dirty sleeve of his blue blouse He went to get a horse and cart said Brogard laconically as with a surly gesture he shook off from his arm that pretty hand which princes had been proud to kiss At what time did he go But Brogard had evidently had enough of these questionings He did not think that it was fitting for a citizen who was the equal of anybody to be thus catechised by these SACRRES ARISTOS even though they were rich English ones It was distinctly more fitting to his newborn dignity to be as rude as possible it was a sure sign of servility to meekly reply to civil questions I don t know he said surlily I have said enough VOYONS LES ARISTOS He came to day He ordered supper He went out He ll come back VOILA And with this parting assertion of his rights as a citizen and a free man to be as rude as he well pleased Brogard shuffled out of the room banging the door after him CHAPTER XXIII HOPE Faith Madame said Sir Andrew seeing that Marguerite seemed desirous to call her surly host back again I think we d better leave him alone We shall not get anything more out of him and we might arouse his suspicions One never knows what spies may be lurking around these God forsaken places What care I she replied lightly now I know that my husband is safe and that I shall see him almost directly Hush he said in genuine alarm for she had talked quite loudly in the fulness of her glee the very walls have ears in France these days He rose quickly from the table and walked round the bare squalid room listening attentively at the door through which Brogard has just disappeared and whence only muttered oaths and shuffling footsteps could be heard He also ran up the rickety steps that led to the attic to assure himself that there were no spies of Chauvelin s about the place Are we alone Monsieur my lacquey said Marguerite gaily as the young man once more sat down beside her May we talk As cautiously as possible he entreated Faith man but you wear a glum face As for me I could dance with joy Surely there is no longer any cause for fear Our boat is on the beach the FOAM CREST not two miles out at sea and my husband will be here under this very roof within the next half hour perhaps Sure there is naught to hinder us Chauvelin and his gang have not yet arrived Nay madam that I fear we do not know What do you mean He was at Dover at the same time that we were Held up by the same storm which kept us from starting Exactly But I did not speak of it before for I feared to alarm you I saw him on the beach not five minutes before we embarked At least I swore to myself at the time that it was himself he was disguised as a CURE so that Satan his own guardian would scarce have known him But I heard him then bargaining for a vessel to take him swiftly to Calais and he must have set sail less than an hour after we did Marguerite s face had quickly lost its look of joy The terrible danger in which Percy stood now that he was actually on French soil became suddenly and horribly clear to her Chauvelin was close upon his heels here in Calais the astute diplomatist was all powerful a word from him and Percy could be tracked and arrested and Every drop of blood seemed to freeze in her veins not even during the moments of her wildest anguish in England had she so completely realised the imminence of the peril in which her husband stood Chauvelin had sworn to bring the Scarlet Pimpernel to the guillotine and now the daring plotter whose anonymity hitherto had been his safeguard stood revealed through her own hand to his most bitter most relentless enemy Chauvelin when he waylaid Lord Tony and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in the coffee room of The Fisherman s Rest had obtained possession of all the plans of this latest expedition Armand saint Just the Comte de Tournay and other fugitive royalists were to have met the Scarlet Pimpernel or rather as it had been originally arranged two of his emissaries on this day the second of October at a place evidently known to the league and vaguely alluded to as the Pere Blanchard s hut Armand whose connection with the Scarlet Pimpernel and disavowal of the brutal policy of the Reign of Terror was still unknown to his countryman had left England a little more than a week ago carrying with him the necessary instructions which would enable him to meet the other fugitives and to convey them to this place of safety This much Marguerite had fully understood from the first and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had confirmed her surmises She knew too that when Sir Percy realized that his own plans and his directions to his lieutenants had been stolen by Chauvelin it was too late to communicate with Armand or to send fresh instructions to the fugitives They would of necessity be at the appointed time and place not knowing how grave was the danger which now awaited their brave rescuer Blakeney who as usual had planned and organized the whole expedition would not allow any of his younger comrades to run the risk of almost certain capture Hence his hurried note to them at Lord Grenville s ball Start myself to morrow alone And now with his identity known to his most bitter enemy his every step would be dogged the moment he set foot in France He would be tracked by Chauvelin s emissaries followed until he reached that mysterious hut where the fugitives were waiting for him and there the trap would be closed on him and on them There was but one hour the hour s start which Marguerite and Sir Andrew had of their enemy in which to warn Percy of the imminence of his danger and to persuade him to give up the foolhardy expedition which could only end in his own death But there WAS that one hour Chauvelin knows of this inn from the papers he stole said Sir Andrew earnestly and on landing will make straight for it He has not landed yet she said we have an hour s start on him and Percy will be here directly We shall be mid Channel ere Chauvelin has realised that we have slipped through his fingers She spoke excitedly and eagerly wishing to infuse into her young friend some of that buoyant hope which still clung to her heart But he shook his head sadly Silent again Sir Andrew she said with some impatience Why do you shake your head and look so glum Faith Madame he replied tis only because in making your rose coloured plans you are forgetting the most important factor What in the world do you mean I am forgetting nothing What factor do you mean she added with more impatience It stands six foot odd high replied Sir Andrew quietly and hath name Percy Blakeney I don t understand she murmured Do you think that Blakeney would leave Calais without having accomplished what he set out to do You mean There s the old Comte de Tournay The Comte she murmured And saint Just and others My brother she said with a heart broken sob of anguish Heaven help me but I fear I had forgotten Fugitives as they are these men at this moment await with perfect confidence and unshaken faith the arrival of the Scarlet Pimpernel who has pledged his honour to take them safely across the Channel Indeed she had forgotten With the sublime selfishness of a woman who loves with her whole heart she had in the last twenty four hours had no thought save for him His precious noble life his danger he the loved one the brave hero he alone dwelt in her mind My brother she murmured as one by one the heavy tears gathered in her eyes as memory came back to her of Armand the companion and darling of her childhood the man for whom she had committed the deadly sin which had so hopelessly imperilled her brave husband s life Sir Percy Blakeney would not be the trusted honoured leader of a score of English gentlemen said Sir Andrew proudly if he abandoned those who placed their trust in him As for breaking his word the very thought is preposterous There was silence for a moment or two Marguerite had buried her face in her hands and was letting the tears slowly trickle through her trembling fingers The young man said nothing his heart ached for this beautiful woman in her awful grief All along he had felt the terrible IMPASSE in which her own rash act had plunged them all He knew his friend and leader so well with his reckless daring his mad bravery his worship of his own word of honour Sir Andrew knew that Blakeney would brave any danger run the wildest risks sooner than break it and with Chauvelin at his very heels would make a final attempt however desperate to rescue those who trusted in him Faith Sir Andrew said Marguerite at last making brave efforts to dry her tears you are right and I would not now shame myself by trying to dissuade him from doing his duty As you say I should plead in vain God grant him strength and ability she added fervently and resolutely to outwit his pursuers He will not refuse to take you with him perhaps when he starts on his noble work between you you will have cunning as well as valour God guard you both In the meanwhile I think we should lose no time I still believe that his safety depends upon his knowing that Chauvelin is on his track Undoubtedly He has wonderful resources at his command As soon as he is aware of his danger he will exercise more caution his ingenuity is a veritable miracle Then what say you to a voyage of reconnaissance in the village whilst I wait here against his coming You might come across Percy s track and thus save valuable time If you find him tell him to beware his bitterest enemy is on his heels But this is such a villainous hole for you to wait in Nay that I do not mind But you might ask our surly host if he could let me wait in another room where I could be safer from the prying eyes of any chance traveller Offer him some ready money so that he should not fail to give me word the moment the tall Englishman returns She spoke quite calmly even cheerfully now thinking out her plans ready for the worst if need be she would show no more weakness she would prove herself worthy of him who was about to give his life for the sake of his fellow men Sir Andrew obeyed her without further comment Instinctively he felt that hers now was the stronger mind he was willing to give himself over to her guidance to become the hand whilst she was the directing hand He went to the door of the inner room through which Brogard and his wife had disappeared before and knocked as usual he was answered by a salvo of muttered oaths Hey friend Brogard said the man peremptorily my lady friend would wish to rest here awhile Could you give her the use of another room She would wish to be alone He took some money out of his pocket and allowed it to jingle significantly in his hand Brogard had opened the door and listened with his usual surly apathy to the young man s request At the sight of the gold however his lazy attitude relaxed slightly he took his pipe from his mouth and shuffled into the room He then pointed over his shoulder at the attic up in the wall She can wait up there he said with a grunt It s comfortable and I have no other room Nothing could be better said Marguerite in English she at once realised the advantages such a position hidden from view would give her Give him the money Sir Andrew I shall be quite happy up there and can see everything without being seen She nodded to Brogard who condescended to go up to the attic and to shake up the straw that lay on the floor May I entreat you madam to do nothing rash said Sir Andrew as Marguerite prepared in her turn to ascend the rickety flight of steps Remember this place is infested with spies Do not I beg of you reveal yourself to Sir Percy unless you are absolutely certain that you are alone with him Even as he spoke he felt how unnecessary was this caution Marguerite was as calm as clear headed as any man There was no fear of her doing anything that was rash Nay she said with a slight attempt at cheerfulness that I can faithfully promise you I would not jeopardise my husband s life nor yet his plans by speaking to him before strangers Have no fear I will watch my opportunity and serve him in the manner I think he needs it most Brogard had come down the steps again and Marguerite was ready to go up to her safe retreat I dare not kiss your hand madam said Sir Andrew as she began to mount the steps since I am your lacquey but I pray you be of good cheer If I do not come across Blakeney in half an hour I shall return expecting to find him here Yes that will be best We can afford to wait for half an hour Chauvelin cannot possibly be here before that God grant that either you or I may have seen Percy by then Good luck to you friend Have no fear for me Lightly she mounted the rickety wooden steps that led to the attic Brogard was taking no further heed of her She could make herself comfortable there or not as she chose Sir Andrew watched her until she had reached the curtains across and the young man noted that she was singularly well placed there for seeing and hearing whilst remaining unobserved He had paid Brogard well the surly old innkeeper would have no object in betraying her Then Sir Andrew prepared to go At the door he turned once again and looked up at the loft Through the ragged curtains Marguerite s sweet face was peeping down at him and the young man rejoiced to see that it looked serene and even gently smiling With a final nod of farewell to her he walked out into the night CHAPTER XXIV THE DEATH TRAP The next quarter of an hour went by swiftly and noiselessly In the room downstairs Brogard had for a while busied himself with clearing the table and re arranging it for another guest It was because she watched these preparations that Marguerite found the time slipping by more pleasantly It was for Percy that this semblance of supper was being got ready Evidently Brogard had a certain amount of respect for the tall Englishman as he seemed to take some trouble in making the place look a trifle less uninviting than it had done before He even produced from some hidden recess in the old dresser what actually looked like a table cloth and when he spread it out and saw it was full of holes he shook his head dubiously for a while then was at much pains so to spread it over the table as to hide most of its blemishes Then he got out a serviette also old and ragged but possessing some measure of cleanliness and with this he carefully wiped the glasses spoons and plates which he put on the table Marguerite could not help smiling to herself as she watched all these preparations which Brogard accomplished to an accompaniment of muttered oaths Clearly the great height and bulk of the Englishman or perhaps the weight of his fist had overawed this free born citizen of France or he would never have been at such trouble for any SACRRE ARISTO When the table was set such as it was Brogard surveyed it with evident satisfaction He then dusted one of the chairs with the corner of his blouse gave a stir to the stock pot threw a fresh bundle of faggots on to the fire and slouched out of the room Marguerite was left alone with her reflections She had spread her travelling cloak over the straw and was sitting fairly comfortably as the straw was fresh and the evil odours from below came up to her only in a modified form But momentarily she was almost happy happy because when she peeped through the tattered curtains she could see a rickety chair a torn table cloth a glass a plate and a spoon that was all But those mute and ugly things seemed to say to her that they were waiting for Percy that soon very soon he would be here that the squalid room being still empty they would be alone together That thought was so heavenly that Marguerite closed her eyes in order to shut out everything but that In a few minutes she would be alone with him she would run down the ladder and let him see her then he would take her in his arms and she would let him see that after that she would gladly die for him and with him for earth could hold no greater happiness than that And then what would happen She could not even remotely conjecture She knew of course that Sir Andrew was right that Percy would do everything he had set out to accomplish that she now she was here could do nothing beyond warning him to be cautious since Chauvelin himself was on his track After having cautioned him she would perforce have to see him go off upon the terrible and daring mission she could not even with a word or look attempt to keep him back She would have to obey whatever he told her to do even perhaps have to efface herself and wait in indescribable agony whilst he perhaps went to his death But even that seemed less terrible to bear than the thought that he should never know how much she loved him that at any rate would be spared her the squalid room itself which seemed to be waiting for him told her that he would be here soon Suddenly her over sensitive ears caught the sound of distant footsteps drawing near her heart gave a wild leap of joy Was it Percy at last No the step did not seem quite as long nor quite as firm as his she also thought that she could hear two distinct sets of footsteps Yes that was it two men were coming this way Two strangers perhaps to get a drink or But she had not time to conjecture for presently there was a peremptory call at the door and the next moment it was violently open from the outside whilst a rough commanding voice shouted Hey Citoyen Brogard Hola Marguerite could not see the newcomers but through a hole in one of the curtains she could observe one portion of the room below She heard Brogard s shuffling footsteps as he came out of the inner room muttering his usual string of oaths On seeing the strangers however he paused in the middle of the room well within range of Marguerite s vision looked at them with even more withering contempt than he had bestowed upon his former guests and muttered SACRRREE SOUTANE Marguerite s heart seemed all at once to stop beating her eyes large and dilated had fastened on one of the newcomers who at this point had taken a quick step forward towards Brogard He was dressed in the soutane broad brimmed hat and buckled shoes habitual to the French CURE but as he stood opposite the innkeeper he threw open his soutane for a moment displaying the tri colour scarf of officialism which sight immediately had the effect of transforming Brogard s attitude of contempt into one of cringing obsequiousness It was the sight of this French CURE which seemed to freeze the very blood in Marguerite s veins She could not see his face which was shaded by his broad brimmed hat but she recognized the thin bony hands the slight stoop the whole gait of the man It was Chauvelin The horror of the situation struck her as with a physical blow the awful disappointment the dread of what was to come made her very senses reel and she needed almost superhuman effort not to fall senseless beneath it all A plate of soup and a bottle of wine said Chauvelin imperiously to Brogard then clear out of here understand I want to be alone Silently and without any muttering this time Brogard obeyed Chauvelin sat down at the table which had been prepared for the tall Englishman and the innkeeper busied himself obsequiously round him dishing up the soup and pouring out the wine The man who had entered with Chauvelin and whom Marguerite could not see stood waiting close by the door At a brusque sign from Chauvelin Brogard had hurried back to the inner room and the former now beckoned to the man who had accompanied him In him Marguerite at once recognised Desgas Chauvelin s secretary and confidential factotum whom she had often seen in Paris in days gone by He crossed the room and for a moment or two listened attentively at the Brogards door Not listening asked Chauvelin curtly No citoyen For a moment Marguerite dreaded lest Chauvelin should order Desgas to search the place what would happen if she were to be discovered she hardly dared to imagine Fortunately however Chauvelin seemed more impatient to talk to his secretary than afraid of spies for he called Desgas quickly back to his side The English schooner he asked She was lost sight of at sundown citoyen replied Desgas but was then making west towards Cap Gris Nez Ah good muttered Chauvelin and now about Captain Jutley what did he say He assured me that all the orders you sent him last week have been implicitly obeyed All the roads which converge to this place have been patrolled night and day ever since and the beach and cliffs have been most rigorously searched and guarded Does he know where this Pere Blanchard s hut is No citoyen nobody seems to know of it by that name There are any amount of fisherman s huts all along the course but That ll do Now about tonight interrupted Chauvelin impatiently The roads and the beach are patrolled as usual citoyen and Captain Jutley awaits further orders Go back to him at once then Tell him to send reinforcements to the various patrols and especially to those along the beach you understand Chauvelin spoke curtly and to the point and every word he uttered struck at Marguerite s heart like the death knell of her fondest hopes The men he continued are to keep the sharpest possible look out for any stranger who may be walking riding or driving along the road or the beach more especially for a tall stranger whom I need not describe further as probably he will be disguised but he cannot very well conceal his height except by stooping You understand Perfectly citoyen replied Desgas As soon as any of the men have sighted a stranger two of them are to keep him in view The man who loses sight of the tall stranger after he is once seen will pay for his negligence with his life but one man is to ride straight back here and report to me Is that clear Absolutely clear citoyen Very well then Go and see Jutley at once See the reinforcements start off for the patrol duty then ask the captain to let you have a half a dozen more men and bring them here with you You can be back in ten minutes Go Desgas saluted and went to the door As Marguerite sick with horror listened to Chauvelin s directions to his underling the whole of the plan for the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel became appallingly clear to her Chauvelin wished that the fugitives should be left in false security waiting in their hidden retreat until Percy joined them Then the daring plotter was to be surrounded and caught red handed in the very act of aiding and abetting royalists who were traitors to the republic Thus if his capture were noised abroad even the British Government could not legally protest in his favour having plotted with the enemies of the French Government France had the right to put him to death Escape for him and them would be impossible All the roads patrolled and watched the trap well set the net wide at present but drawing together tighter and tighter until it closed upon the daring plotter whose superhuman cunning even could not rescue him from its meshes now Desgas was about to go but Chauvelin once more called him back Marguerite vaguely wondered what further devilish plans he could have formed in order to entrap one brave man alone against two score of others She looked at him as he turned to speak to Desgas she could just see his face beneath the broad brimmed CURES S hat There was at that moment so much deadly hatred such fiendish malice in the thin face and pale small eyes that Marguerite s last hope died in her heart for she felt that from this man she could expect no mercy I had forgotten repeated Chauvelin with a weird chuckle as he rubbed his bony talon like hands one against the other with a gesture of fiendish satisfaction The tall stranger may show fight In any case no shooting remember except as a last resort I want that tall stranger alive if possible He laughed as Dante has told us that the devils laugh at the sight of the torture of the damned Marguerite had thought that by now she had lived through the whole gamut of horror and anguish that human heart could bear yet now when Desgas left the house and she remained alone in this lonely squalid room with that fiend for company she felt as if all that she had suffered was nothing compared with this He continued to laugh and chuckle to himself for awhile rubbing his hands together in anticipation of his triumph His plans were well laid and he might well triumph Not a loophole was left through which the bravest the most cunning man might escape Every road guarded every corner watched and in that lonely hut somewhere on the coast a small band of fugitives waiting for their rescuer and leading him to his death nay to worse than death That fiend there in a holy man s garb was too much of a devil to allow a brave man to die the quick sudden death of a soldier at the post of duty He above all longed to have the cunning enemy who had so long baffled him helpless in his power he wished to gloat over him to enjoy his downfall to inflict upon him what moral and mental torture a deadly hatred alone can devise The brave eagle captured and with noble wings clipped was doomed to endure the gnawing of the rat And she his wife who loved him and who had brought him to this could do nothing to help him Nothing save to hope for death by his side and for one brief moment in which to tell him that her love whole true and passionate was entirely his Chauvelin was now sitting close to the table he had taken off his hat and Marguerite could just see the outline of his thin profile and pointed chin as he bent over his meagre supper He was evidently quite contented and awaited events with perfect calm he even seemed to enjoy Brogard s unsavoury fare Marguerite wondered how so much hatred could lurk in one human being against another Suddenly as she watched Chauvelin a sound caught her ear which turned her very heart to stone And yet that sound was not calculated to inspire anyone with horror for it was merely the cheerful sound of a gay fresh voice singing lustily God save the King CHAPTER XXV THE EAGLE AND THE FOX Marguerite s breath stopped short she seemed to feel her very life standing still momentarily whilst she listened to that voice and to that song In the singer she had recognised her husband Chauvelin too had heard it for he darted a quick glance towards the door then hurriedly took up his broad brimmed hat and clapped it over his head The voice drew nearer for one brief second the wild desire seized Marguerite to rush down the steps and fly across the room to stop that song at any cost to beg the cheerful singer to fly fly for his life before it be too late She checked the impulse just in time Chauvelin would stop her before she reached the door and moreover she had no idea if he had any soldiers posted within his call Her impetuous act might prove the death signal of the man she would have died to save Long to reign over us God save the King sang the voice more lustily than ever The next moment the door was thrown open and there was dead silence for a second or so Marguerite could not see the door she held her breath trying to imagine what was happening Percy Blakeney on entering had of course at once caught sight of the CURE at the table his hesitation lasted less than five seconds the next moment Marguerite saw his tall figure crossing the room whilst he called in a loud cheerful voice Hello there no one about Where s that fool Brogard He wore the magnificent coat and riding suit which he had on when Marguerite last saw him at Richmond so many hours ago As usual his get up was absolutely irreproachable the fine Mechlin lace at his neck and wrists were immaculate and white his fair hair was carefully brushed and he carried his eyeglass with his usual affected gesture In fact at this moment Sir Percy Blakeney Bart might have been on his way to a garden party at the Prince of Wales instead of deliberately cold bloodedly running his head in a trap set for him by his deadliest enemy He stood for a moment in the middle of the room whilst Marguerite absolutely paralysed with horror seemed unable even to breathe Every moment she expected that Chauvelin would give a signal that the place would fill with soldiers that she would rush down and help Percy to sell his life dearly As he stood there suavely unconscious she very nearly screamed out to him Fly Percy tis your deadly enemy fly before it be too late But she had not time even to do that for the next moment Blakeney quietly walked to the table and jovially clapped the CURE on the back said in his own drawly affected way Odds s fish er M Chauvelin I vow I never thought of meeting you here Chauvelin who had been in the very act of conveying soup to his mouth fairly choked His thin face became absolutely purple and a violent fit of coughing saved this cunning representative of France from betraying the most boundless surprise he had ever experienced There was no doubt that this bold move on the part of the enemy had been wholly unexpected as far as he was concerned and the daring impudence of it completely nonplussed him for the moment Obviously he had not taken the precaution of having the inn surrounded with soldiers Blakeney had evidently guessed that much and no doubt his resourceful brain had already formed some plan by which he could turn this unexpected interview to account Marguerite up in the loft had not moved She had made a solemn promise to Sir Andrew not to speak to her husband before strangers and she had sufficient self control not to throw herself unreasoningly and impulsively across his plans To sit still and watch these two men together was a terrible trial of fortitude Marguerite had heard Chauvelin give the orders for the patrolling of all the roads She knew that if Percy now left the Chat Gris in whatever direction he happened to go he could not go far without being sighted by some of Captain Jutley s men on patrol On the other hand if he stayed then Desgas would have time to come back with the dozen men Chauvelin had specially ordered The trap was closing in and Marguerite could do nothing but watch and wonder The two men looked such a strange contrast and of the two it was Chauvelin who exhibited a slight touch of fear Marguerite knew him well enough to guess what was passing in his mind He had no fear for his own person although he certainly was alone in a lonely inn with a man who was powerfully built and who was daring and reckless beyond the bounds of probability She knew that Chauvelin would willingly have braved perilous encounters for the sake of the cause he had at heart but what he did fear was that this impudent Englishman would by knocking him down double his own chances of escape his underlings might not succeed so well in capturing the Scarlet Pimpernel when not directed by the cunning hand and the shrewd brain which had deadly hate for an incentive Evidently however the representative of the French Government had nothing to fear for the moment at the hands of his powerful adversary Blakeney with his most inane laugh and pleasant good nature was solemnly patting him on the back I am so demmed sorry he was saying cheerfully so very sorry I seem to have upset you eating soup too nasty awkward thing soup er Begad a friend of mine died once er choked just like you with a spoonful of soup And he smiled shyly good humouredly down at Chauvelin Odd s life he continued as soon as the latter had somewhat recovered himself beastly hole this ain t it now La you don t mind he added apologetically as he sat down on a chair close to the table and drew the soup tureen towards him That fool Brogard seems to be asleep or something There was a second plate on the table and he calmly helped himself to soup then poured himself out a glass of wine For a moment Marguerite wondered what Chauvelin would do His disguise was so good that perhaps he meant on recovering himself to deny his identity but Chauvelin was too astute to make such an obviously false and childish move and already he too had stretched out his hand and said pleasantly I am indeed charmed to see you Sir Percy You must excuse me h m I thought you the other side of the Channel Sudden surprise almost took my breath away La said Sir Percy with a good humoured grin it did that quite didn t it er M er Chaubertin Pardon me Chauvelin I beg pardon a thousand times Yes Chauvelin of course Er I never could cotton to foreign names He was calmly eating his soup laughing with pleasant good humour as if he had come all the way to Calais for the express purpose of enjoying supper at this filthy inn in the company of his arch enemy For the moment Marguerite wondered why Percy did not knock the little Frenchman down then and there and no doubt something of the sort must have darted through his mind for every now and then his lazy eyes seemed to flash ominously as they rested on the slight figure of Chauvelin who had now quite recovered himself and was also calmly eating his soup But the keen brain which had planned and carried through so many daring plots was too far seeing to take unnecessary risks This place after all might be infested with spies the innkeeper might be in Chauvelin s pay One call on Chauvelin s part might bring twenty men about Blakeney s ears for aught he knew and he might be caught and trapped before he could help or at least warn the fugitives This he would not risk he meant to help the others to get THEM safely away for he had pledged his word to them and his word he WOULD keep And whilst he ate and chatted he thought and planned whilst up in the loft the poor anxious woman racked her brain as to what she should do and endured agonies of longing to rush down to him yet not daring to move for fear of upsetting his plans I didn t know Blakeney was saying jovially that you er were in holy orders I er hem stammered Chauvelin The calm impudence of his antagonist had evidently thrown him off his usual balance But la I should have known you anywhere continued Sir Percy placidly as he poured himself out another glass of wine although the wig and hat have changed you a bit Do you think so Lud they alter a man so but begad I hope you don t mind my having made the remark Demmed bad form making remarks I hope you don t mind No no not at all hem I hope Lady Blakeney is well said Chauvelin hurriedly changing the topic of conversation Blakeney with much deliberation finished his plate of soup drank his glass of wine and momentarily it seemed to Marguerite as if he glanced all round the room Quite well thank you he said at last drily There was a pause during which Marguerite could watch these two antagonists who evidently in their minds were measuring themselves against one another She could see Percy almost full face where he sat at the table not ten yards from where she herself was crouching puzzled not knowing what to do or what she should think She had quite controlled her impulse now of rushing down and disclosing herself to her husband A man capable of acting a part in the way he was doing at the present moment did not need a woman s word to warn him to be cautious Marguerite indulged in the luxury dear to every tender woman s heart of looking at the man she loved She looked through the tattered curtain across at the handsome face of her husband in whose lazy blue eyes and behind whose inane smile she could now so plainly see the strength energy and resourcefulness which had caused the Scarlet Pimpernel to be reverenced and trusted by his followers There are nineteen of us ready to lay down our lives for your husband Lady Blakeney Sir Andrew had said to her and as she looked at the forehead low but square and broad the eyes blue yet deep set and intense the whole aspect of the man of indomitable energy hiding behind a perfectly acted comedy his almost superhuman strength of will and marvellous ingenuity she understood the fascination which he exercised over his followers for had he not also cast his spells over her heart and her imagination Chauvelin who was trying to conceal his impatience beneath his usual urbane manner took a quick look at his watch Desgas should not be long another two or three minutes and this impudent Englishman would be secure in the keeping of half a dozen of Captain Jutley s most trusted men You are on your way to Paris Sir Percy he asked carelessly Odd s life no replied Blakeney with a laugh Only as far as Lille not Paris for me beastly uncomfortable place Paris just now eh Monsieur Chaubertin beg pardon Chauvelin Not for an English gentleman like yourself Sir Percy rejoined Chauvelin sarcastically who takes no interest in the conflict that is raging there La you see it s no business of mine and our demmed government is all on your side of the business Old Pitt daren t say Bo to a goose You are in a hurry sir he added as Chauvelin once again took out his watch an appointment perhaps I pray you take no heed of me My time s my own He rose from the table and dragged a chair to the hearth Once more Marguerite was terribly tempted to go to him for time was getting on Desgas might be back at any moment with his men Percy did not know that and oh how horrible it all was and how helpless she felt I am in no hurry continued Percy pleasantly but la I don t want to spend any more time than I can help in this God forsaken hole But begad sir he added as Chauvelin had surreptitiously looked at his watch for the third time that watch of yours won t go any faster for all the looking you give it You are expecting a friend maybe Aye a friend Not a lady I trust Monsieur l Abbe laughed Blakeney surely the holy church does not allow eh what But I say come by the fire it s getting demmed cold He kicked the fire with the heel of his boot making the logs blaze in the old hearth He seemed in no hurry to go and apparently was quite unconscious of his immediate danger He dragged another chair to the fire and Chauvelin whose impatience was by now quite beyond control sat down beside the hearth in such a way as to command a view of the door Desgas had been gone nearly a quarter of an hour It was quite plain to Marguerite s aching senses that as soon as he arrived Chauvelin would abandon all his other plans with regard to the fugitives and capture this impudent Scarlet Pimpernel at once Hey M Chauvelin the latter was saying airily tell me I pray you is your friend pretty Demmed smart these little French women sometimes what But I protest I need not ask he added as he carelessly strode back towards the supper table In matters of taste the Church has never been backward Eh But Chauvelin was not listening His every faculty was now concentrated on that door through which presently Desgas would enter Marguerite s thoughts too were centered there for her ears had suddenly caught through the stillness of the night the sound of numerous and measured treads some distance away It was Desgas and his men Another three minutes and they would be here Another three minutes and the awful thing would have occurred the brave eagle would have fallen in the ferret s trap She would have moved now and screamed but she dared not for whilst she heard the soldiers approaching she was looking at Percy and watching his every movement He was standing by the table whereon the remnants of the supper plates glasses spoons salt and pepper pots were scattered pell mell His back was turned to Chauvelin and he was still prattling along in his own affected and inane way but from his pocket he had taken his snuff box and quickly and suddenly he emptied the contents of the pepper pot into it Then he again turned with an inane laugh to Chauvelin Eh Did you speak sir Chauvelin had been too intent on listening to the sound of those approaching footsteps to notice what his cunning adversary had been doing He now pulled himself together trying to look unconcerned in the very midst of his anticipated triumph No he said presently that is as you were saying Sir Percy I was saying said Blakeney going up to Chauvelin by the fire that the Jew in Piccadilly has sold me better snuff this time than I have ever tasted Will you honour me Monsieur l Abbe He stood close to Chauvelin in his own careless DEBONNAIRE way holding out his snuff box to his arch enemy Chauvelin who as he told Marguerite once had seen a trick or two in his day had never dreamed of this one With one ear fixed on those fast approaching footsteps one eye turned to that door where Desgas and his men would presently appear lulled into false security by the impudent Englishman s airy manner he never even remotely guessed the trick which was being played upon him He took a pinch of snuff Only he who has ever by accident sniffed vigorously a dose of pepper can have the faintest conception of the hopeless condition in which such a sniff would reduce any human being Chauvelin felt as if his head would burst sneeze after sneeze seemed nearly to choke him he was blind deaf and dumb for the moment and during that moment Blakeney quietly without the slightest haste took up his hat took some money out of his pocket which he left on the table then calmly stalked out of the room 
7717_105405_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XXVI THE JEW
none	none	 It took Marguerite some time to collect her scattered senses the whole of this last short episode had taken place in less than a minute and Desgas and the soldiers were still about two hundred yards away from the Chat Gris 
7717_105405_000004_000000	train-clean-360	When she realised what had happened a curious mixture of joy and wonder filled her heart 
none	none	It all was so neat so ingenious 
7717_105405_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Chauvelin was still absolutely helpless far more so than he could even have been under a blow from the fist for now he could neither see nor hear nor speak whilst his cunning adversary had quietly slipped through his fingers 
7717_105405_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Blakeney was gone obviously to try and join the fugitives at the Pere Blanchard s hut 
none	none	For the moment true Chauvelin was helpless for the moment the daring Scarlet Pimpernel had not been caught by Desgas and his men But all the roads and the beach were patrolled 
7717_105405_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Every place was watched and every stranger kept in sight 
7717_105405_000005_000004	train-clean-360	How far could Percy go thus arrayed in his gorgeous clothes without being sighted and followed 
7717_105405_000005_000005	train-clean-360	Now she blamed herself terribly for not having gone down to him sooner and given him that word of warning and of love which perhaps after all he needed 
none	none	He could not know of the orders which Chauvelin had given for his capture and even now perhaps But before all these horrible thoughts had taken concrete form in her brain she heard the grounding of arms outside close to the door and Desgas voice shouting Halt to his men 
7717_105405_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Chauvelin had partially recovered his sneezing had become less violent and he had struggled to his feet 
none	none	He managed to reach the door just as Desgas knock was heard on the outside Chauvelin threw open the door and before his secretary could say a word he had managed to stammer between two sneezes The tall stranger quick did any of you see him Where citoyen asked Desgas in surprise
7717_105405_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Here man through that door 
7717_105405_000011_000001	train-clean-360	not five minutes ago 
7717_105405_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 We saw nothing citoyen 
none	none	The moon is not yet up and And you are just five minutes too late my friend said Chauvelin with concentrated fury Citoyen I
7717_105405_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 You did what I ordered you to do said Chauvelin with impatience I know that but you were a precious long time about it 
7717_105405_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Fortunately there s not much harm done or it had fared ill with you Citoyen Desgas 
none	none	Desgas turned a little pale 
7717_105405_000016_000001	train-clean-360	There was so much rage and hatred in his superior s whole attitude 
7717_105405_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 The tall stranger citoyen he stammered 
none	none	Was here in this room five minutes ago having supper at that table Damn his impudence 
7717_105405_000018_000001	train-clean-360	For obvious reasons I dared not tackle him alone Brogard is too big a fool and that cursed Englishman appears to have the strength of a bullock and so he slipped away under your very nose 
7717_105405_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 He cannot go far without being sighted citoyen 
none	none	Ah Captain Jutley sent forty men as reinforcements for the patrol duty twenty went down to the beach 
7717_105405_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He again assured me that the watch had been constant all day and that no stranger could possibly get to the beach or reach a boat without being sighted 
7717_105405_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 That s good Do the men know their work They have had very clear orders citoyen and I myself spoke to those who were about to start They are to shadow as secretly as possible any stranger they may see especially if he be tall or stoop as if he would disguise his height 
none	none	In no case to detain such a person of course said Chauvelin eagerly
7717_105405_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 That impudent Scarlet Pimpernel would slip through clumsy fingers 
7717_105405_000023_000002	train-clean-360	We must let him get to the Pere Blanchard s hut now there surround and capture him 
none	none	The men understand that citoyen and also that as soon as a tall stranger has been sighted he must be shadowed whilst one man is to turn straight back and report to you
7717_105405_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 That is right said Chauvelin rubbing his hands well pleased 
none	none	I have further news for you citoyen What is it
7717_105405_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 A tall Englishman had a long conversation about three quarters of an hour ago with a Jew Reuben by name who lives not ten paces from here 
7717_105405_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and queried Chauvelin impatiently 
7717_105405_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 The conversation was all about a horse and cart which the tall Englishman wished to hire and which was to have been ready for him by eleven o clock 
7717_105405_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 It is past that now 
7717_105405_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Where does that Reuben live 
7717_105405_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 A few minutes walk from this door 
7717_105405_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Send one of the men to find out if the stranger has driven off in Reuben s cart 
7717_105405_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes citoyen 
7717_105405_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Desgas went to give the necessary orders to one of the men 
none	none	Not a word of this conversation between him and Chauvelin had escaped Marguerite and every word they had spoken seemed to strike at her heart with terrible hopelessness and dark foreboding 
7717_105405_000036_000000	train-clean-360	She had come all this way and with such high hopes and firm determination to help her husband and so far she had been able to do nothing but to watch with a heart breaking with anguish the meshes of the deadly net closing round the daring Scarlet Pimpernel 
7717_105405_000037_000000	train-clean-360	He could not now advance many steps without spying eyes to track and denounce him 
7717_105405_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Her own helplessness struck her with the terrible sense of utter disappointment 
7717_105405_000037_000002	train-clean-360	The possibility of being the slightest use to her husband had become almost NIL and her only hope rested in being allowed to share his fate whatever it might ultimately be 
7717_105405_000038_000000	train-clean-360	For the moment even her chance of ever seeing the man she loved again had become a remote one 
7717_105405_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Still she was determined to keep a close watch over his enemy and a vague hope filled her heart that whilst she kept Chauvelin in sight Percy s fate might still be hanging in the balance 
none	none	Desgas left Chauvelin moodily pacing up and down the room whilst he himself waited outside for the return of the man whom he had sent in search of Reuben 
7717_105405_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Thus several minutes went by 
7717_105405_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Chauvelin was evidently devoured with impatience 
7717_105405_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Apparently he trusted no one this last trick played upon him by the daring Scarlet Pimpernel had made him suddenly doubtful of success unless he himself was there to watch direct and superintend the capture of this impudent Englishman 
7717_105405_000040_000000	train-clean-360	About five minutes later Desgas returned followed by an elderly Jew in a dirty threadbare gaberdine worn greasy across the shoulders 
7717_105405_000040_000001	train-clean-360	His red hair which he wore after the fashion of the Polish Jews with the corkscrew curls each side of his face was plentifully sprinkled with grey a general coating of grime about his cheeks and his chin gave him a peculiarly dirty and loathsome appearance 
none	none	He had the habitual stoop those of his race affected in mock humility in past centuries before the dawn of equality and freedom in matters of faith and he walked behind Desgas with the peculiar shuffling gait which has remained the characteristic of the Jew trader in continental Europe to this day 
7717_105405_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Chauvelin who had all the Frenchman s prejudice against the despised race motioned to the fellow to keep at a respectful distance 
7717_105405_000041_000001	train-clean-360	The group of the three men were standing just underneath the hanging oil lamp and Marguerite had a clear view of them all 
7717_105405_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Is this the man asked Chauvelin 
7717_105405_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 No citoyen replied Desgas Reuben could not be found so presumably his cart has gone with the stranger but this man here seems to know something which he is willing to sell for a consideration 
none	none	Ah said Chauvelin turning away with disgust from the loathsome specimen of humanity before him 
7717_105405_000045_000000	train-clean-360	The Jew with characteristic patience stood humbly on one side leaning on the knotted staff his greasy broad brimmed hat casting a deep shadow over his grimy face waiting for the noble Excellency to deign to put some questions to him 
7717_105405_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 The citoyen tells me said Chauvelin peremptorily to him that you know something of my friend the tall Englishman whom I desire to meet 
none	none	MORBLEU keep your distance man he added hurriedly as the Jew took a quick and eager step forward
7717_105405_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes your Excellency replied the Jew who spoke the language with that peculiar lisp which denotes Eastern origin I and Reuben Goldstein met a tall Englishman on the road close by here this evening 
7717_105405_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you speak to him 
7717_105405_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 He spoke to us your Excellency 
none	none	He wanted to know if he could hire a horse and cart to go down along the saint Martin road to a place he wanted to reach to night
7717_105405_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 What did you say 
7717_105405_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I did not say anything said the Jew in an injured tone Reuben Goldstein that accursed traitor that son of Belial 
7717_105405_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Cut that short man interrupted Chauvelin roughly and go on with your story 
7717_105405_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 He took the words out of my mouth your Excellency when I was about to offer the wealthy Englishman my horse and cart to take him wheresoever he chose Reuben had already spoken and offered his half starved nag and his broken down cart 
none	none	And what did the Englishman do He listened to Reuben Goldstein your Excellency and put his hand in his pocket then and there and took out a handful of gold which he showed to that descendant of Beelzebub telling him that all that would be his if the horse and cart were ready for him by eleven o clock
7717_105405_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 And of course the horse and cart were ready 
none	none	Well they were ready for him in a manner so to speak your Excellency 
7717_105405_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Reuben s nag was lame as usual she refused to budge at first 
none	none	It was only after a time and with plenty of kicks that she at last could be made to move said the Jew with a malicious chuckle
7717_105405_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Then they started 
none	none	Yes they started about five minutes ago I was disgusted with that stranger s folly 
7717_105405_000059_000002	train-clean-360	An Englishman too He ought to have known Reuben s nag was not fit to drive 
7717_105405_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 But if he had no choice 
none	none	No choice your Excellency protested the Jew in a rasping voice did I not repeat to him a dozen times that my horse and cart would take him quicker and more comfortably than Reuben s bag of bones He would not listen 
7717_105405_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Reuben is such a liar and has such insinuating ways The stranger was deceived 
7717_105405_000061_000003	train-clean-360	If he was in a hurry he would have had better value for his money by taking my cart 
none	none	You have a horse and cart too then asked Chauvelin peremptorily
7717_105405_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Aye that I have your Excellency and if your Excellency wants to drive 
none	none	Do you happen to know which way my friend went in Reuben Goldstein s cart 
7717_105405_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Thoughtfully the Jew rubbed his dirty chin 
7717_105405_000065_000001	train-clean-360	Marguerite s heart was beating well nigh to bursting 
7717_105405_000065_000002	train-clean-360	She had heard the peremptory question she looked anxiously at the Jew but could not read his face beneath the shadow of his broad brimmed hat 
none	none	Vaguely she felt somehow as if he held Percy s fate in his long dirty hands There was a long pause whilst Chauvelin frowned impatiently at the stooping figure before him at last the Jew slowly put his hand in his breast pocket and drew out from its capacious depths a number of silver coins 
7717_105405_000066_000001	train-clean-360	He gazed at them thoughtfully then remarked in a quiet tone of voice 
none	none	This is what the tall stranger gave me when he drove away with Reuben for holding my tongue about him and his doings Chauvelin shrugged his shoulders impatiently How much is there there he asked
7717_105405_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Twenty francs your Excellency replied the Jew and I have been an honest man all my life 
none	none	Chauvelin without further comment took a few pieces of gold out of his own pocket and leaving them in the palm of his hand he allowed them to jingle as he held them out towards the Jew
7717_105405_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 How many gold pieces are there in the palm of my hand he asked quietly 
7717_105405_000073_000000	train-clean-360	Evidently he had no desire to terrorize the man but to conciliate him for his own purposes for his manner was pleasant and suave 
7717_105405_000073_000001	train-clean-360	No doubt he feared that threats of the guillotine and various other persuasive methods of that type might addle the old man s brains and that he would be more likely to be useful through greed of gain than through terror of death 
none	none	The eyes of the Jew shot a quick keen glance at the gold in his interlocutor s hand
7717_105405_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 At least five I should say your Excellency he replied obsequiously 
7717_105405_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Enough do you think to loosen that honest tongue of yours 
none	none	What does your Excellency wish to know
7717_105405_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Whether your horse and cart can take me to where I can find my friend the tall stranger who has driven off in Reuben Goldstein s cart 
none	none	My horse and cart can take your Honour there where you please
7717_105405_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 To a place called the Pere Blanchard s hut 
7717_105405_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Your Honour has guessed said the Jew in astonishment 
7717_105405_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 You know the place 
7717_105405_000082_000001	train-clean-360	Which road leads to it 
none	none	The saint Martin Road your Honour then a footpath from there to the cliffs
7717_105405_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 You know the road repeated Chauvelin roughly 
7717_105405_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Every stone every blade of grass your Honour replied the Jew quietly 
7717_105405_000086_000000	train-clean-360	Chauvelin without another word threw the five pieces of gold one by one before the Jew who knelt down and on his hands and knees struggled to collect them 
7717_105405_000086_000001	train-clean-360	One rolled away and he had some trouble to get it for it had lodged underneath the dresser 
7717_105405_000086_000002	train-clean-360	Chauvelin quietly waited while the old man scrambled on the floor to find the piece of gold 
none	none	When the Jew was again on his feet Chauvelin said
7717_105405_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 How soon can your horse and cart be ready 
none	none	They are ready now your Honour Where
7717_105405_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Not ten meters from this door 
7717_105405_000091_000001	train-clean-360	Will your Excellency deign to look 
7717_105405_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t want to see it 
7717_105405_000092_000001	train-clean-360	How far can you drive me in it 
none	none	As far as the Pere Blanchard s hut your Honour and further than Reuben s nag took your friend 
7717_105405_000093_000001	train-clean-360	I am sure that not two leagues from here we shall come across that wily Reuben his nag his cart and the tall stranger all in a heap in the middle of the road 
7717_105405_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 How far is the nearest village from here 
7717_105405_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 On the road which the Englishman took Miquelon is the nearest village not two leagues from here 
none	none	There he could get fresh conveyance if he wanted to go further
7717_105405_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 He could if he ever got so far 
none	none	Can you Will your Excellency try said the Jew simply
7717_105405_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 That is my intention said Chauvelin very quietly but remember if you have deceived me I shall tell off two of my most stalwart soldiers to give you such a beating that your breath will perhaps leave your ugly body for ever 
7717_105405_000100_000001	train-clean-360	But if we find my friend the tall Englishman either on the road or at the Pere Blanchard s hut there will be ten more gold pieces for you 
7717_105405_000100_000002	train-clean-360	Do you accept the bargain 
7717_105405_000101_000000	train-clean-360	The Jew again thoughtfully rubbed his chin 
none	none	He looked at the money in his hand then at this stern interlocutor and at Desgas who had stood silently behind him all this while 
7717_105405_000101_000002	train-clean-360	After a moment s pause he said deliberately 
7717_105405_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 I accept 
none	none	Go and wait outside then said Chauvelin and remember to stick to your bargain or by Heaven I will keep to mine 
7717_105405_000104_000000	train-clean-360	With a final most abject and cringing bow the old Jew shuffled out of the room 
7717_105405_000104_000001	train-clean-360	Chauvelin seemed pleased with his interview for he rubbed his hands together with that usual gesture of his of malignant satisfaction 
none	none	My coat and boots he said to Desgas at last Desgas went to the door and apparently gave the necessary orders for presently a soldier entered carrying Chauvelin s coat boots and hat He took off his soutane beneath which he was wearing close fitting breeches and a cloth waistcoat and began changing his attire You citoyen in the meanwhile he said to Desgas go back to Captain Jutley as fast as you can and tell him to let you have another dozen men and bring them with you along the saint Martin Road where I daresay you will soon overtake the Jew s cart with myself in it 
7717_105405_000108_000001	train-clean-360	There will be hot work presently if I mistake not in the Pere Blanchard s hut 
7717_105405_000108_000002	train-clean-360	We shall corner our game there I ll warrant for this impudent Scarlet Pimpernel has had the audacity or the stupidity I hardly know which to adhere to his original plans 
none	none	He has gone to meet de Tournay saint Just and the other traitors which for the moment I thought perhaps he did not intend to do When we find them there will be a band of desperate men at bay 
7717_105405_000108_000005	train-clean-360	Some of our men will I presume be put HORS DE COMBAT 
7717_105405_000108_000006	train-clean-360	These royalists are good swordsmen and the Englishman is devilish cunning and looks very powerful 
7717_105405_000108_000007	train-clean-360	Still we shall be five against one at least 
none	none	You can follow the cart closely with your men all along the saint Martin Road through Miquelon 
7717_105405_000108_000009	train-clean-360	The Englishman is ahead of us and not likely to look behind him 
7717_105405_000109_000000	train-clean-360	Whilst he gave these curt and concise orders he had completed his change of attire 
none	none	The priest s costume had been laid aside and he was once more dressed in his usual dark tight fitting clothes At last he took up his hat I shall have an interesting prisoner to deliver into your hands he said with a chuckle as with unwonted familiarity he took Desgas arm and led him towards the door We won t kill him outright eh friend Desgas 
7717_105405_000110_000002	train-clean-360	The Pere Blanchard s hut is an I mistake not a lonely spot upon the beach and our men will enjoy a bit of rough sport there with the wounded fox 
none	none	Choose your men well friend Desgas of the sort who would enjoy that type of sport eh We must see that Scarlet Pimpernel wither a bit what shrink and tremble eh before we finally He made an expressive gesture whilst he laughed a low evil laugh which filled Marguerite s soul with sickening horror Choose your men well Citoyen Desgas he said once more as he led his secretary finally out of the room CHAPTER XXVII ON THE TRACK Never for a moment did Marguerite Blakeney hesitate The last sounds outside the Chat Gris had died away in the night She had heard Desgas giving orders to his men and then starting off towards the fort to get a reinforcement of a dozen more men six were not thought sufficient to capture the cunning Englishman whose resourceful brain was even more dangerous than his valour and his strength Then a few minutes later she heard the Jew s husky voice again evidently shouting to his nag then the rumble of wheels and noise of a rickety cart bumping over the rough road Inside the inn everything was still Brogard and his wife terrified of Chauvelin had given no sign of life they hoped to be forgotten and at any rate to remain unperceived Marguerite could not even hear their usual volleys of muttered oaths She waited a moment or two longer then she quietly slipped down the broken stairs wrapped her dark cloak closely round her and slipped out of the inn The night was fairly dark sufficiently so at any rate to hide her dark figure from view whilst her keen ears kept count of the sound of the cart going on ahead She hoped by keeping well within the shadow of the ditches which lined the road that she would not be seen by Desgas men when they approached or by the patrols which she concluded were still on duty Thus she started to do this the last stage of her weary journey alone at night and on foot Nearly three leagues to Miquelon and then on to the Pere Blanchard s hut wherever that fatal spot might be probably over rough roads she cared not The Jew s nag could not get on very fast and though she was wary with mental fatigue and nerve strain she knew that she could easily keep up with it on a hilly road where the poor beast who was sure to be half starved would have to be allowed long and frequent rests The road lay some distance from the sea bordered on either side by shrubs and stunted trees sparsely covered with meagre foliage all turning away from the North with their branches looking in the semi darkness like stiff ghostly hair blown by a perpetual wind Fortunately the moon showed no desire to peep between the clouds and Marguerite hugging the edge of the road and keeping close to the low line of shrubs was fairly safe from view Everything around her was so still only from far very far away there came like a long soft moan the sound of the distant sea The air was keen and full of brine after that enforced period of inactivity inside the evil smelling squalid inn Marguerite would have enjoyed the sweet scent of this autumnal night and the distant melancholy rumble of the autumnal night and the distant melancholy rumble of the waves she would have revelled in the calm and stillness of this lonely spot a calm broken only at intervals by the strident and mournful cry of some distant gull and by the creaking of the wheels some way down the road she would have loved the cool atmosphere the peaceful immensity of Nature in this lonely part of the coast but her heart was too full of cruel foreboding of a great ache and longing for a being who had become infinitely dear to her Her feet slipped on the grassy bank for she thought it safest not to walk near the centre of the road and she found it difficult to keep up a sharp pace along the muddy incline She even thought it best not to keep too near to the cart everything was so still that the rumble of the wheels could not fail to be a safe guide The loneliness was absolute Already the few dim lights of Calais lay far behind and on this road there was not a sign of human habitation not even the hut of a fisherman or of a woodcutter anywhere near far away on her right was the edge of the cliff below it the rough beach against which the incoming tide was dashing itself with its constant distant murmur And ahead the rumble of the wheels bearing an implacable enemy to his triumph Marguerite wondered at what particular spot on this lonely coast Percy could be at this moment Not very far surely for he had had less than a quarter of an hour s start of Chauvelin She wondered if he knew that in this cool ocean scented bit of France there lurked many spies all eager to sight his tall figure to track him to where his unsuspecting friends waited for him and then to close the net over him and them Chauvelin on ahead jolted and jostled in the Jew s vehicle was nursing comfortable thoughts He rubbed his hands together with content as he thought of the web which he had woven and through which that ubiquitous and daring Englishman could not hope to escape As the time went on and the old Jew drove him leisurely but surely along the dark road he felt more and more eager for the grand finale of this exciting chase after the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel The capture of the audacious plotter would be the finest leaf in Citoyen Chauvelin s wreath of glory Caught red handed on the spot in the very act of aiding and abetting the traitors against the Republic of France the Englishman could claim no protection from his own country Chauvelin had in any case fully made up his mind that all intervention should come too late Never for a moment did the slightest remorse enter his heart as to the terrible position in which he had placed the unfortunate wife who had unconsciously betrayed her husband As a matter of fact Chauvelin had ceased even to think of her she had been a useful tool that was all The Jew s lean nag did little more than walk She was going along at a slow jog trot and her driver had to give her long and frequent halts Are we a long way yet from Miquelon asked Chauvelin from time to time Not very far your Honour was the uniform placid reply We have not yet come across your friend and mine lying in a heap in the roadway was Chauvelin s sarcastic comment Patience noble Excellency rejoined the son of Moses they are ahead of us I can see the imprint of the cart wheels driven by that traitor that son of the Amalekite You are sure of the road As sure as I am of the presence of those ten gold pieces in the noble Excellency s pockets which I trust will presently be mine As soon as I have shaken hands with my friend the tall stranger they will certainly be yours Hark what was that said the Jew suddenly Through the stillness which had been absolute there could now be heard distinctly the sound of horses hoofs on the muddy road They are soldiers he added in an awed whisper Stop a moment I want to hear said Chauvelin Marguerite had also heard the sound of galloping hoofs coming towards the cart and towards herself For some time she had been on the alert thinking that Desgas and his squad would soon overtake them but these came from the opposite direction presumably from Miquelon The darkness lent her sufficient cover She had perceived that the cart had stopped and with utmost caution treading noiselessly on the soft road she crept a little nearer Her heart was beating fast she was trembling in every limb already she had guessed what news these mounted men would bring Every stranger on these roads or on the beach must be shadowed especially if he be tall or stoops as if he would disguise his height when sighted a mounted messenger must at once ride back and report Those had been Chauvelin s orders Had then the tall stranger been sighted and was this the mounted messenger come to bring the great news that the hunted hare had run its head into the noose at last Marguerite realizing that the cart had come to a standstill managed to slip nearer to it in the darkness she crept close up hoping to get within earshot to hear what the messenger had to say She heard the quick words of challenge Liberte Fraternite Egalite then Chauvelin s quick query What news Two men on horseback had halted beside the vehicle Marguerite could see them silhouetted against the midnight sky She could hear their voices and the snorting of their horses and now behind her some little distance off the regular and measured tread of a body of advancing men Desgas and his soldiers There had been a long pause during which no doubt Chauvelin satisfied the men as to his identity for presently questions and answers followed each other in quick succession You have seen the stranger asked Chauvelin eagerly No citoyen we have seen no tall stranger we came by the edge of the cliff Then Less than a quarter of a league beyond Miquelon we came across a rough construction of wood which looked like the hut of a fisherman where he might keep his tools and nets When we first sighted it it seemed to be empty and at first we thought that there was nothing suspicious about until we saw some smoke issuing through an aperture at the side I dismounted and crept close to it It was then empty but in one corner of the hut there was a charcoal fire and a couple of stools were also in the hut I consulted with my comrades and we decided that they should take cover with the horses well out of sight and that I should remain on the watch which I did Well and did you see anything About half an hour later I heard voices citoyen and presently two men came along towards the edge of the cliff they seemed to me to have come from the Lille Road One was young the other quite old They were talking in a whisper to one another and I could not hear what they said One was young and the other quite old Marguerite s aching heart almost stopped beating as she listened was the young one Armand her brother and the old one de Tournay were they the two fugitives who unconsciously were used as a decoy to entrap their fearless and noble rescuer The two men presently went into the hut continued the soldier whilst Marguerite s aching nerves seemed to catch the sound of Chauvelin s triumphant chuckle and I crept nearer to it then The hut is very roughly built and I caught snatches of their conversation Yes Quick What did you hear The old man asked the young one if he were sure that was right place Oh yes he replied tis the place sure enough and by the light of the charcoal fire he showed to his companion a paper which he carried Here is the plan he said which he gave me before I left London We were to adhere strictly to that plan unless I had contrary orders and I have had none Here is the road we followed see here the fork here we cut across the saint Martin Road and here is the footpath which brought us to the edge of the cliff I must have made a slight noise then for the young man came to the door of the hut and peered anxiously all round him When he again joined his companion they whispered so low that I could no longer hear them Well and asked Chauvelin impatiently There were six of us altogether patrolling that part of the beach so we consulted together and thought it best that four should remain behind and keep the hut in sight and I and my comrade rode back at once to make report of what we had seen You saw nothing of the tall stranger Nothing citoyen If your comrades see him what would they do Not lose sight of him for a moment and if he showed signs of escape or any boat came in sight they would close in on him and if necessary they would shoot the firing would bring the rest of the patrol to the spot In any case they would not let the stranger go Aye but I did not want the stranger hurt not just yet murmured Chauvelin savagely but there you ve done your best The Fates grant that I may not be too late We met half a dozen men just now who have been patrolling this road for several hours Well They have seen no stranger either Yet he is on ahead somewhere in a cart or else Here there is not a moment to lose How far is that hut from here About a couple of leagues citoyen You can find it again at once without hesitation I have absolutely no doubt citoyen The footpath to the edge of the cliff Even in the dark It is not a dark night citoyen and I know I can find my way repeated the soldier firmly Fall in behind then Let your comrade take both your horses back to Calais You won t want them Keep beside the cart and direct the Jew to drive straight ahead then stop him within a quarter of a league of the footpath see that he takes the most direct road Whilst Chauvelin spoke Desgas and his men were fast approaching and Marguerite could hear their footsteps within a hundred yards behind her now She thought it unsafe to stay where she was and unnecessary too as she had heard enough She seemed suddenly to have lost all faculty even for suffering her heart her nerves her brain seemed to have become numb after all these hours of ceaseless anguish culminating in this awful despair For now there was absolutely not the faintest hope Within two short leagues of this spot the fugitives were waiting for their brave deliverer He was on his way somewhere on this lonely road and presently he would join them then the well laid trap would close two dozen men led by one whose hatred was as deadly as his cunning was malicious would close round the small band of fugitives and their daring leader They would all be captured Armand according to Chauvelin s pledged word would be restored to her but her husband Percy whom with every breath she drew she seemed to love and worship more and more he would fall into the hands of a remorseless enemy who had no pity for a brave heart no admiration for the courage of a noble soul who would show nothing but hatred for the cunning antagonist who had baffled him so long She heard the soldier giving a few brief directions to the Jew then she retired quickly to the edge of the road and cowered behind some low shrubs whilst Desgas and his men came up All fell in noiselessly behind the cart and slowly they all started down the dark road Marguerite waited until she reckoned that they were well outside the range of earshot then she too in the darkness which suddenly seemed to have become more intense crept noiselessly along CHAPTER XXVIII THE PERE BLANCHARD S HUT As in a dream Marguerite followed on 
7795-105407-0000	train-other-500	the web was drawing more and more tightly every moment round the beloved life which had become dearer than all To see her husband once again to tell him how she had suffered how much she had wronged
7795-105407-0001	train-other-500	and how little understood him had become now her only aim She had abandoned all hope of saving him she saw him gradually hemmed in on all sides and in despair she gazed round her into the darkness
7795-105407-0002	train-other-500	and wondered whence he would presently come to fall into the death trap which his relentless enemy had prepared for him
none	none	 The distant roar of the waves now made her shudder 
7795-105407-0003	train-other-500	the occasional dismal cry of an owl or a sea gull filled her with unspeakable horror She thought of the ravenous beasts in human shape who lay in wait for their prey
7795-105407-0004	train-other-500	and destroyed them as mercilessly as any hungry wolf for the satisfaction of their own appetite of hate Marguerite was not afraid of the darkness she only feared that man on ahead who was sitting at the bottom of a rough wooden cart
7795-105407-0005	train-other-500	nursing thoughts of vengeance which would have made the very demons in hell chuckle with delight Her feet were sore Her knees shook under her from sheer bodily fatigue
none	none	 For days now she had lived in a wild turmoil of excitement 
7795-105407-0006	train-other-500	she had not had a quiet rest for three nights now she had walked on a slippery road for nearly two hours and yet her determination never swerved for a moment She would see her husband tell him all
none	none	 and if he was ready to forgive the crime 
7795-105407-0007	train-other-500	which she had committed in her blind ignorance
none	none	 she would yet have the happiness of dying by his side 
7795-105407-0008	train-other-500	She must have walked on almost in a trance instinct alone keeping her up and guiding her in the wake of the enemy when suddenly her ears attuned to the slightest sound by that same blind instinct
7795-105407-0009	train-other-500	told her that the cart had stopped and that the soldiers had halted They had come to their destination No doubt on the right somewhere close ahead was the footpath that led to the edge of the cliff and to the hut Heedless of any risks
7795-105407-0010	train-other-500	she crept up quite close up to where Chauvelin stood surrounded by his little troop he had descended from the cart and was giving some orders to the men These she wanted to hear what little chance she yet had of being useful to Percy
7795-105407-0011	train-other-500	consisted in hearing absolutely every word of his enemy s plans The spot where all the party had halted must have lain some eight hundred meters from the coast the sound of the sea came only very faintly as from a distance
none	none	 Chauvelin and Desgas followed by the soldiers had turned off sharply to the right of the road 
7795-105407-0012	train-other-500	apparently on to the footpath which led to the cliffs The Jew had remained on the road with his cart and nag Marguerite with infinite caution and literally crawling on her hands and knees had also turned off to the right
7795-105407-0013	train-other-500	to accomplish this she had to creep through the rough low shrubs trying to make as little noise as possible as she went along tearing her face and hands against the dry twigs intent only upon hearing without being seen or heard
7795-105407-0014	train-other-500	Fortunately as is usual in this part of France the footpath was bordered by a low rough hedge beyond which was a dry ditch filled with coarse grass In this Marguerite managed to find shelter
7795-105407-0015	train-other-500	she was quite hidden from view yet could contrive to get within three yards of where Chauvelin stood giving orders to his men Now he was saying in a low and peremptory whisper where is the Pere Blanchard s hut
none	none	 About eight hundred meters from here along the footpath 
7795-105407-0016	train-other-500	said the soldier who had lately been directing the party and half way down the cliff Very good You shall lead us Before we begin to descend the cliff you shall creep down to the hut as noiselessly as possible and ascertain if the traitor royalists are there
none	none	 Do you understand I understand citoyen 
7795-105407-0017	train-other-500	Now listen very attentively all of you continued Chauvelin impressively and addressing the soldiers collectively for after this we may not be able to exchange another word so remember every syllable I utter
7795-105407-0018	train-other-500	as if your very lives depended on your memory Perhaps they do he added drily We listen citoyen
none	none	 said Desgas 
7795-105407-0019	train-other-500	and a soldier of the Republic never forgets an order You who have crept up to the hut will try to peep inside If an Englishman is there with those traitors a man who is tall above the average or who stoops as if he would disguise his height
none	none	 then give a sharp quick whistle as a signal to your comrades 
7795-105407-0020	train-other-500	All of you he added once more speaking to the soldiers collectively then quickly surround and rush into the hut and each seize one of the men there before they have time to draw their firearms if any of them struggle
7795-105407-0021	train-other-500	shoot at their legs or arms but on no account kill the tall man Do you understand We understand citoyen The man who is tall above the average is probably also strong above the average
7795-105407-0022	train-other-500	it will take four or five of you at least to overpower him There was a little pause then Chauvelin continued
none	none	 If the royalist traitors are still alone 
7795-105407-0023	train-other-500	which is more than likely to be the case then warn your comrades who are lying in wait there and all of you creep and take cover behind the rocks and boulders round the hut and wait there in dead silence until the tall Englishman arrives
7795-105407-0024	train-other-500	then only rush the hut when he is safely within its doors But remember that you must be as silent as the wolf is at night when he prowls around the pens I do not wish those royalists to be on the alert
7795-105407-0025	train-other-500	the firing of a pistol a shriek or call on their part would be sufficient perhaps to warn the tall personage to keep clear of the cliffs and of the hut and he added emphatically
7795-105407-0026	train-other-500	it is the tall Englishman whom it is your duty to capture tonight You shall be implicitly obeyed citoyen
none	none	 Then get along as noiselessly as possible 
7795-105407-0027	train-other-500	and I will follow you What about the Jew citoyen
none	none	 asked Desgas 
7795-105407-0028	train-other-500	as silently like noiseless shadows one by one the soldiers began to creep along the rough and narrow footpath Ah yes I had forgotten about the Jew said Chauvelin and turning towards the Jew
7795-105407-0029	train-other-500	he called him peremptorily Here you Aaron Moses Abraham or whatever your confounded name may be he said to the old man who had quietly stood beside his lean nag as far away from the soldiers as possible
7795-105407-0030	train-other-500	Benjamin Rosenbaum so it please your Honour he replied humbly It does not please me to hear your voice but it does please me to give you certain orders which you will find it wise to obey
7795-105407-0031	train-other-500	So it please your Honour Hold your confounded tongue You shall stay here do you hear with your horse and cart until our return You are on no account to utter the faintest sound or to even breathe louder than you can help
7795-105407-0032	train-other-500	nor are you on any consideration whatever to leave your post until I give you orders to do so Do you understand
none	none	 But your Honour protested the Jew pitiably 
7795-105407-0033	train-other-500	There is no question of but or of any argument said Chauvelin in a tone that made the timid old man tremble from head to foot If when I return I do not find you here I most solemnly assure you that
7795-105407-0034	train-other-500	wherever you may try to hide yourself I can find you and that punishment swift sure and terrible will sooner or later overtake you Do you hear me But your Excellency I said do you hear me
7795-105407-0035	train-other-500	The soldiers had all crept away the three men stood alone together in the dark and lonely road with Marguerite there behind the hedge
none	none	 listening to Chauvelin s orders as she would to her own death sentence 
7795-105407-0036	train-other-500	I heard your Honour protested the Jew again while he tried to draw nearer to Chauvelin and I swear by Abraham Isaac and Jacob that I would obey your Honour most absolutely
7795-105407-0037	train-other-500	and that I would not move from this place until your Honour once more deigned to shed the light of your countenance upon your humble servant but remember your Honour I am a poor man my nerves are not as strong as those of a young soldier
7795-105407-0038	train-other-500	If midnight marauders should come prowling round this lonely road I might scream or run in my fright And is my life to be forfeit is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help
7795-105407-0039	train-other-500	The Jew seemed in real distress he was shaking from head to foot Clearly he was not the man to be left by himself on this lonely road The man spoke truly he might unwittingly in sheer terror
7795-105407-0040	train-other-500	utter the shriek that might prove a warning to the wily Scarlet Pimpernel Chauvelin reflected for a moment
none	none	 Will your horse and cart be safe alone here do you think 
7795-105407-0041	train-other-500	he asked roughly I fancy citoyen
none	none	 here interposed Desgas 
7795-105407-0042	train-other-500	that they will be safer without that dirty cowardly Jew than with him There seems no doubt that if he gets scared he will either make a bolt of it or shriek his head off But what am I to do with the brute
7795-105407-0043	train-other-500	Will you send him back to Calais citoyen No for we shall want him to drive back the wounded presently said Chauvelin with grim significance There was a pause again
none	none	 Desgas waiting for the decision of his chief 
7795-105407-0044	train-other-500	and the old Jew whining beside his nag Well you lazy lumbering old coward said Chauvelin at last
none	none	 you had better shuffle along behind us Here Citoyen Desgas tie this handkerchief tightly round the fellow s mouth Chauvelin handed a scarf to Desgas 
7795-105407-0045	train-other-500	who solemnly began winding it round the Jew s mouth Meekly Benjamin Rosenbaum allowed himself to be gagged he evidently preferred this uncomfortable state to that of being left alone on the dark saint Martin Road
7795-105407-0046	train-other-500	Then the three men fell in line Quick said Chauvelin impatiently we have already wasted much valuable time
none	none	 And the firm footsteps of Chauvelin and Desgas 
7795-105407-0047	train-other-500	the shuffling gait of the old Jew soon died away along the footpath Marguerite had not lost a single one of Chauvelin s words of command Her every nerve was strained to completely grasp the situation first
7795-105407-0048	train-other-500	then to make a final appeal to those wits which had so often been called the sharpest in Europe and which alone might be of service now Certainly the situation was desperate enough a tiny band of unsuspecting men
7795-105407-0049	train-other-500	quietly awaiting the arrival of their rescuer who was equally unconscious of the trap laid for them all It seemed so horrible this net as it were drawn in a circle at dead of night on a lonely beach round a few defenceless men
7795-105407-0050	train-other-500	defenceless because they were tricked and unsuspecting of these one was the husband she idolised another the brother she loved She vaguely wondered who the others were
none	none	 who were also calmly waiting for the Scarlet Pimpernel 
7795-105407-0051	train-other-500	while death lurked behind every boulder of the cliffs For the moment she could do nothing but follow the soldiers and Chauvelin She feared to lose her way or she would have rushed forward and found that wooden hut
7795-105407-0052	train-other-500	and perhaps been in time to warn the fugitives and their brave deliverer yet For a second the thought flashed through her mind of uttering the piercing shrieks
none	none	 which Chauvelin seemed to dread as a possible warning to the Scarlet Pimpernel and his friends 
7795-105407-0053	train-other-500	in the wild hope that they would hear and have yet time to escape before it was too late But she did not know if her shrieks would reach the ears of the doomed men Her effort might be premature
7795-105407-0054	train-other-500	and she would never be allowed to make another Her mouth would be securely gagged like that of the Jew and she
none	none	 a helpless prisoner in the hands of Chauvelin s men 
7795-105407-0055	train-other-500	Like a ghost she flitted noiselessly behind that hedge she had taken her shoes off and her stockings were by now torn off her feet She felt neither soreness nor weariness indomitable will to reach her husband
7795-105407-0056	train-other-500	in spite of adverse Fate and of a cunning enemy killed all sense of bodily pain within her and rendered her instincts doubly acute She heard nothing save the soft and measured footsteps of Percy s enemies on in front
7795-105407-0057	train-other-500	she saw nothing but in her mind s eye that wooden hut and he her husband walking blindly to his doom Suddenly those same keen instincts within her made her pause in her mad haste
7795-105407-0058	train-other-500	and cower still further within the shadow of the hedge The moon which had proved a friend to her by remaining hidden behind a bank of clouds now emerged in all the glory of an early autumn night and in a moment
7795-105407-0059	train-other-500	flooded the weird and lonely landscape with a rush of brilliant light There not two hundred metres ahead was the edge of the cliff and below stretching far away to free and happy England
7795-105407-0060	train-other-500	the sea rolled on smoothly and peaceably Marguerite s gaze rested for an instant on the brilliant silvery waters and as she gazed her heart which had been numb with pain for all these hours seemed to soften and distend
7795-105407-0061	train-other-500	and her eyes filled with hot tears not three miles away with white sails set a graceful schooner lay in wait Marguerite had guessed rather than recognized her It was the DAY DREAM
7795-105407-0062	train-other-500	Percy s favourite yacht and all her crew of British sailors her white sails glistening in the moonlight seemed to convey a message to Marguerite of joy and hope which yet she feared could never be
7795-105407-0063	train-other-500	She waited there out at sea waited for her master like a beautiful white bird all ready to take flight and he would never reach her never see her smooth deck again never gaze any more on the white
7795-105407-0064	train-other-500	cliffs of England the land of liberty and of hope The sight of the schooner seemed to infuse into the poor wearied woman the superhuman strength of despair There was the edge of the cliff
7795-105407-0065	train-other-500	and some way below was the hut where presently her husband would meet his death But the moon was out she could see her way now she would see the hut from a distance run to it rouse them all
7795-105407-0066	train-other-500	warn them at any rate to be prepared and to sell their lives dearly rather than be caught like so many rats in a hole She stumbled on behind the hedge in the low thick grass of the ditch
none	none	 She must have run on very fast and had outdistanced Chauvelin and Desgas 
7795-105407-0067	train-other-500	for presently she reached the edge of the cliff and heard their footsteps distinctly behind her But only a very few yards away and now the moonlight was full upon her
7795-105407-0068	train-other-500	her figure must have been distinctly silhouetted against the silvery background of the sea Only for a moment though the next she had cowered like some animal doubled up within itself She peeped down the great rugged cliffs
7795-105407-0069	train-other-500	the descent would be easy enough as they were not precipitous and the great boulders afforded plenty of foothold Suddenly as she gazed she saw at some little distance on her left and about midway down the cliffs
7795-105407-0070	train-other-500	a rough wooden construction through the wall of which a tiny red light glimmered like a beacon Her very heart seemed to stand still the eagerness of joy was so great that it felt like an awful pain
7795-105407-0071	train-other-500	She could not gauge how distant the hut was but without hesitation she began the steep descent creeping from boulder to boulder caring nothing for the enemy behind
7795-105407-0072	train-other-500	or for the soldiers who evidently had all taken cover since the tall Englishman had not yet appeared On she pressed forgetting the deadly foe on her track running stumbling foot sore
none	none	 half dazed 
7795-105407-0073	train-other-500	but still on When suddenly a crevice or stone or slippery bit of rock threw her violently to the ground She struggled again to her feet
7795-105407-0074	train-other-500	and started running forward once more to give them that timely warning to beg them to flee before he came and to tell him to keep away away from this death trap away from this awful doom
7795-105407-0075	train-other-500	But now she realised that other steps quicker than her own were already close at her heels The next instant a hand dragged at her skirt
none	none	 and she was down on her knees again 
7795-105407-0076	train-other-500	whilst something was wound round her mouth to prevent her uttering a scream Bewildered half frantic with the bitterness of disappointment she looked round her helplessly and bending down quite close to her
7795-105407-0077	train-other-500	she saw through the mist which seemed to gather round her a pair of keen malicious eyes
none	none	 which appeared to her excited brain to have a weird supernatural green light in them 
7795-105407-0078	train-other-500	She lay in the shadow of a great boulder Chauvelin could not see her features but he passed his thin white fingers over her face A woman he whispered by all the saints in the calendar
7795-105407-0079	train-other-500	We cannot let her loose that s certain
none	none	 he muttered to himself 
7795-105407-0080	train-other-500	I wonder now Suddenly he paused after a few moments of deadly silence he gave forth a long low curious chuckle while once again Marguerite felt with a horrible shudder
7795-105407-0081	train-other-500	his thin fingers wandering over her face Dear me dear me he whispered with affected gallantry this is indeed a charming surprise
7795-105407-0082	train-other-500	and Marguerite felt her resistless hand raised to Chauvelin s thin mocking lips The situation was indeed grotesque had it not been at the same time so fearfully tragic the poor weary woman broken in spirit
7795-105407-0083	train-other-500	and half frantic with the bitterness of her disappointment
none	none	 receiving on her knees the BANAL gallantries 
7795-105407-0084	train-other-500	of her deadly enemy Her senses were leaving her half choked with the tight grip round her mouth
none	none	 she had no strength to move or to utter the faintest sound The excitement which all along had kept up her delicate body 
7795-105407-0085	train-other-500	seemed at once to have subsided and the feeling of blank despair to have completely paralyzed her brain and nerves Chauvelin must have given some directions which she was too dazed to hear for she felt herself
7795-105407-0086	train-other-500	lifted from off her feet the bandage round her mouth was made more secure and a pair of strong arms carried her towards that tiny red light on ahead which she had looked upon as a beacon
none	none	 and the last faint glimmer of hope CHAPTER XXIX TRAPPED She did not know how long she was thus carried along she had lost all notion of time and space and for a few seconds tired nature mercifully deprived her of consciousness When she once more realised her state she felt that she was placed with some degree of comfort upon a man s coat with her back resting against a fragment of rock The moon was hidden again behind some clouds and the darkness seemed in comparison more intense The sea was roaring some two hundred feet below her and on looking all round she could no longer see any vestige of the tiny glimmer of red light That the end of the journey had been reached she gathered from the fact that she heard rapid questions and answers spoken in a whisper quite close to her There are four men in there citoyen they are sitting by the fire and seem to be waiting quietly The hour Nearly two o clock The tide Coming in quickly The schooner Obviously an English one lying some three kilometers out But we cannot see her boat Have the men taken cover Yes citoyen They will not blunder They will not stir until the tall Englishman comes then they will surround and overpower the five men Right And the lady Still dazed I fancy She s close beside you citoyen And the Jew He s gagged and his legs strapped together He cannot move or scream Good Then have your gun ready in case you want it Get close to the hut and leave me to look after the lady Desgas evidently obeyed for Marguerite heard him creeping away along the stony cliff then she felt that a pair of warm thin talon like hands took hold of both her own and held them in a grip of steel Before that handkerchief is removed from your pretty mouth fair lady whispered Chauvelin close to her ear I think it right to give you one small word of warning What has procured me the honour of being followed across the Channel by so charming a companion I cannot of course conceive but if I mistake it not the purpose of this flattering attention is not one that would commend itself to my vanity and I think that I am right in surmising moreover that the first sound which your pretty lips would utter as soon as the cruel gag is removed would be one that would prove a warning to the cunning fox which I have been at such pains to track to his lair He paused a moment while the steel like grasp seemed to tighten round her wrist then he resumed in the same hurried whisper Inside that hut if again I am not mistaken your brother Armand saint Just waits with that traitor de Tournay and two other men unknown to you for the arrival of the mysterious rescuer whose identity has for so long puzzled our Committee of Public Safety the audacious Scarlet Pimpernel No doubt if you scream if there is a scuffle here if shots are fired it is more than likely that the same long legs that brought this scarlet enigma here will as quickly take him to some place of safety The purpose then for which I have travelled all these miles will remain unaccomplished On the other hand it only rests with yourself that your brother Armand shall be free to go off with you to night if you like to England or any other place of safety Marguerite could not utter a sound as the handkerchief was would very tightly round her mouth but Chauvelin was peering through the darkness very closely into her face no doubt too her hand gave a responsive appeal to his last suggestion for presently he continued What I want you to do to ensure Armand s safety is a very simple thing dear lady What is it Marguerite s hand seemed to convey to his in response To remain on this spot without uttering a sound until I give you leave to speak Ah but I think you will obey he added with that funny dry chuckle of his as Marguerite s whole figure seemed to stiffen in defiance of this order for let me tell you that if you scream nay if you utter one sound or attempt to move from here my men there are thirty of them about will seize saint Just de Tournay and their two friends and shoot them here by my orders before your eyes Marguerite had listened to her implacable enemy s speech with ever increasing terror Numbed with physical pain she yet had sufficient mental vitality in her to realize the full horror of this terrible either or he was once more putting before her either or ten thousand times more appalling and horrible than the one he had suggested to her that fatal night at the ball This time it meant that she should keep still and allow the husband she worshipped to walk unconsciously to his death or that she should by trying to give him a word of warning which perhaps might even be unavailing actually give the signal for her own brother s death and that of three other unsuspecting men She could not see Chauvelin but she could almost feel those keen pale eyes of his fixed maliciously upon her helpless form and his hurried whispered words reached her ear as the death knell of her last faint lingering hope Nay fair lady he added urbanely you can have no interest in anyone save in saint Just and all you need do for his safety is to remain where you are and to keep silent My men have strict orders to spare him in every way As for that enigmatic Scarlet Pimpernel what is he to you Believe me no warning from you could possibly save him And now dear lady let me remove this unpleasant coercion which has been placed before your pretty mouth You see I wish you to be perfectly free in the choice which you are about to make Her thoughts in a whirl her temples aching her nerves paralyzed her body numb with pain Marguerite sat there in the darkness which surrounded her as with a pall From where she sat she could not see the sea but she heard the incessant mournful murmur of the incoming tide which spoke of her dead hopes her lost love the husband she had with her own hand betrayed and sent to his death Chauvelin removed he handkerchief from her mouth She certainly did not scream at that moment she had no strength to do anything but barely to hold herself upright and to force herself to think Oh think think think of what she should do The minutes flew on in this awful stillness she could not tell how fast or how slowly she heard nothing she saw nothing she did not feel the sweet smelling autumn air scented with the briny odour of the sea she no longer heard the murmur of the waves the occasional rattling of a pebble as it rolled down some steep incline More and more unreal did the whole situation seem It was impossible that she Marguerite Blakeney the queen of London society should actually be sitting here on this bit of lonely coast in the middle of the night side by side with a most bitter enemy and oh it was not possible that somewhere not many hundred feet away perhaps from where she stood the being she had once despised but who now in every moment of this weird dreamlike life became more and more dear it was not possible that HE was unconsciously even now walking to his doom whilst she did nothing to save him Why did she not with unearthly screams that would re echo from one end of the lonely beach to the other send out a warning to him to desist to retrace his steps for death lurked here whilst he advanced Once or twice the screams rose to her throat as if by instinct then before her eyes there stood the awful alternative her brother and those three men shot before her eyes practically by her orders she their murderer Oh that fiend in human shape next to her knew human female nature well He had played upon her feelings as a skilful musician plays upon an instrument He had gauged her very thoughts to a nicety She could not give that signal for she was weak and she was a woman How could she deliberately order Armand to be shot before her eyes to have his dear blood upon her head he dying perhaps with a curse on her upon his lips And little Suzanne s father too he an old man and the others oh it was all too too horrible Wait wait wait how long The early morning hours sped on and yet it was not dawn the sea continued its incessant mournful murmur the autumnal breeze sighed gently in the night the lonely beach was silent even as the grave Suddenly from somewhere not very far away a cheerful strong voice was heard singing God save the King

7635_105409_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Marguerite s aching heart stood still 
7635_105409_000004_000001	train-clean-100	She felt more than she heard the men on the watch preparing for the fight 
7635_105409_000004_000002	train-clean-100	Her senses told her that each with sword in hand was crouching ready for the spring 
none	none	The voice came nearer and nearer in the vast immensity of these lonely cliffs with the loud murmur of the sea below it was impossible to say how near or how far nor yet from which direction came that cheerful singer who sang to God to save his King whilst he himself was in such deadly danger Faint at first the voice grew louder and louder from time to time a small pebble detached itself apparently from beneath the firm tread of the singer and went rolling down the rocky cliffs to the beach below 
7635_105409_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Marguerite as she heard felt that her very life was slipping away as if when that voice drew nearer when that singer became entrapped 
none	none	She distinctly heard the click of Desgas gun close to her No no no no Oh God in heaven this cannot be let Armand s blood then be on her own head let her be branded as his murderer let even he whom she loved despise and loathe her for this but God oh God save him at any cost With a wild shriek she sprang to her feet and darted round the rock against which she had been cowering she saw the little red gleam through the chinks of the hut she ran up to it and fell against its wooden walls which she began to hammer with clenched fists in an almost maniacal frenzy while she shouted Armand Armand for God s sake fire your leader is near he is coming he is betrayed Armand Armand fire in Heaven s name She was seized and thrown to the ground She lay there moaning bruised not caring but still half sobbing half shrieking
7635_105409_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Percy my husband for God s sake fly 
none	none	Armand 
7635_105409_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Armand why don t you fire 
none	none	One of you stop that woman screaming hissed Chauvelin who hardly could refrain from striking her Something was thrown over her face she could not breathe and perforce she was silent The bold singer too had become silent warned no doubt of his impending danger by Marguerite s frantic shrieks 
7635_105409_000015_000001	train-clean-100	The men had sprung to their feet there was no need for further silence on their part the very cliffs echoed the poor heart broken woman s screams 
none	none	Chauvelin with a muttered oath which boded no good to her who had dared to upset his most cherished plans had hastily shouted the word of command
7635_105409_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Into it my men and let no one escape from that hut alive 
none	none	The moon had once more emerged from between the clouds the darkness on the cliffs had gone giving place once more to brilliant silvery light Some of the soldiers had rushed to the rough wooden door of the hut whilst one of them kept guard over Marguerite 
7635_105409_000019_000000	train-clean-100	The door was partially open one of the soldiers pushed it further but within all was darkness the charcoal fire only lighting with a dim red light the furthest corner of the hut 
none	none	The soldiers paused automatically at the door like machines waiting for further orders Chauvelin who was prepared for a violent onslaught from within and for a vigorous resistance from the four fugitives under cover of the darkness was for the moment paralyzed with astonishment when he saw the soldiers standing there at attention like sentries on guard whilst not a sound proceeded from the hut Filled with strange anxious foreboding he too went to the door of the hut and peering into the gloom he asked quickly What is the meaning of this I think citoyen that there is no one there now replied one of the soldiers imperturbably You have not let those four men go thundered Chauvelin menacingly I ordered you to let no man escape alive Quick after them all of you 
7635_105409_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Quick in every direction 
none	none	The men obedient as machines rushed down the rocky incline towards the beach some going off to right and left as fast as their feet could carry them You and your men will pay with your lives for this blunder citoyen sergeant said Chauvelin viciously to the sergeant who had been in charge of the men and you too citoyen he added turning with a snarl to Desgas for disobeying my orders You ordered us to wait citoyen until the tall Englishman arrived and joined the four men in the hut No one came said the sergeant sullenly
7635_105409_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 But I ordered you just now when the woman screamed to rush in and let no one escape 
none	none	But citoyen the four men who were there before had been gone some time I think
7635_105409_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 You think You said Chauvelin almost choking with fury and you let them go 
none	none	You ordered us to wait citoyen protested the sergeant and to implicitly obey your commands on pain of death 
7635_105409_000031_000001	train-clean-100	We waited 
none	none	I heard the men creep out of the hut not many minutes after we took cover and long before the woman screamed he added as Chauvelin seemed still quite speechless with rage Hark said Desgas suddenly In the distance the sound of repeated firing was heard Chauvelin tried to peer along the beach below but as luck would have it the fitful moon once more hid her light behind a bank of clouds and he could see nothing One of you go into the hut and strike a light he stammered at last Stolidly the sergeant obeyed he went up to the charcoal fire and lit the small lantern he carried in his belt it was evident that the hut was quite empty Which way did they go asked Chauvelin I could not tell citoyen said the sergeant they went straight down the cliff first then disappeared behind some boulders
7635_105409_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 Hush what was that 
7635_105409_000040_000000	train-clean-100	All three men listened attentively 
none	none	In the far very far distance could be heard faintly echoing and already dying away the quick sharp splash of half a dozen oars Chauvelin took out his handkerchief and wiped the perspiration from his forehead The schooner s boat was all he gasped Evidently Armand saint Just and his three companions had managed to creep along the side of the cliffs whilst the men like true soldiers of the well drilled Republican army had with blind obedience and in fear of their own lives implicitly obeyed Chauvelin s orders to wait for the tall Englishman who was the important capture They had no doubt reached one of the creeks which jut far out to sea on this coast at intervals behind this the boat of the DAY DREAM must have been on the lookout for them and they were by now safely on board the British schooner As if to confirm this last supposition the dull boom of a gun was heard from out at sea The schooner citoyen said Desgas quietly she s off It needed all Chauvelin s nerve and presence of mind not to give way to a useless and undignified access of rage There was no doubt now that once again that accursed British head had completely outwitted him How he had contrived to reach the hut without being seen by one of the thirty soldiers who guarded the spot was more than Chauvelin could conceive That he had done so before the thirty men had arrived on the cliff was of course fairly clear but how he had come over in Reuben Goldstein s cart all the way from Calais without being sighted by the various patrols on duty was impossible of explanation It really seemed as if some potent Fate watched over that daring Scarlet Pimpernel and his astute enemy almost felt a superstitious shudder pass through him as he looked round at the towering cliffs and the loneliness of this outlying coast But surely this was reality and the year of grace seventeen ninety two there were no fairies and hobgoblins about Chauvelin and his thirty men had all heard with their own ears that accursed voice singing God save the King fully twenty minutes AFTER they had all taken cover around the hut by that time the four fugitives must have reached the creek and got into the boat and the nearest creek was more than a mile from the hut Where had that daring singer got to Unless Satan himself had lent him wings he could not have covered that mile on a rocky cliff in the space of two minutes and only two minutes had elapsed between his song and the sound of the boat s oars away at sea 
7635_105409_000048_000002	train-clean-100	He must have remained behind and was even now hiding somewhere about the cliffs the patrols were still about he would still be sighted no doubt 
none	none	Chauvelin felt hopeful once again One or two of the men who had run after the fugitives were now slowly working their way up the cliff one of them reached Chauvelin s side at the very moment that this hope arose in the astute diplomatist s heart We were too late citoyen the soldier said we reached the beach just before the moon was hidden by that bank of clouds The boat had undoubtedly been on the look out behind that first creek a mile off but she had shoved off some time ago when we got to the beach and was already some way out to sea We fired after her but of course it was no good She was making straight and quickly for the schooner We saw her very clearly in the moonlight Yes said Chauvelin with eager impatience she had shoved off some time ago you said and the nearest creek is a mile further on Yes citoyen I ran all the way straight to the beach though I guessed the boat would have waited somewhere near the creek as the tide would reach there earliest The boat must have shoved off some minutes before the woman began to scream
7635_105409_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Bring the light in here he commanded eagerly as he once more entered the hut 
none	none	The sergeant brought his lantern and together the two men explored the little place with a rapid glance Chauvelin noted its contents the cauldron placed close under an aperture in the wall and containing the last few dying embers of burned charcoal a couple of stools overturned as if in the haste of sudden departure then the fisherman s tools and his nets lying in one corner and beside them something small and white
7635_105409_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Pick that up said Chauvelin to the sergeant pointing to this white scrap and bring it to me 
none	none	It was a crumpled piece of paper evidently forgotten there by the fugitives in their hurry to get away The sergeant much awed by the citoyen s obvious rage and impatience picked the paper up and handed it respectfully to Chauvelin
7635_105409_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 Read it sergeant said the latter curtly 
none	none	It is almost illegible citoyen a fearful scrawl I ordered you to read it repeated Chauvelin viciously The sergeant by the light of his lantern began deciphering the few hastily scrawled words I cannot quite reach you without risking your lives and endangering the success of your rescue When you receive this wait two minutes then creep out of the hut one by one turn to your left sharply and creep cautiously down the cliff keep to the left all the time till you reach the first rock which you see jutting far out to sea behind it in the creek the boat is on the look out for you give a long sharp whistle she will come up get into her my men will row you to the schooner and thence to England and safety once on board the DAY DREAM send the boat back for me tell my men that I shall be at the creek which is in a direct line opposite the Chat Gris near Calais 
7635_105409_000061_000002	train-clean-100	They know it 
none	none	I shall be there as soon as possible they must wait for me at a safe distance out at sea till they hear the usual signal 
7635_105409_000061_000004	train-clean-100	Do not delay and obey these instructions implicitly 
none	none	Then there is the signature citoyen added the sergeant as he handed the paper back to Chauvelin 
7635_105409_000063_000000	train-clean-100	But the latter had not waited an instant 
none	none	One phrase of the momentous scrawl had caught his ear I shall be at the creek which is in a direct line opposite the Chat Gris near Calais that phrase might yet mean victory for him Which of you knows this coast well he shouted to his men who now one by one all returned from their fruitless run and were all assembled once more round the hut I do citoyen said one of them I was born in Calais and know every stone of these cliffs
7635_105409_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 There is a creek in a direct line from the Chat Gris 
none	none	There is citoyen 
7635_105409_000066_000001	train-clean-100	I know it well 
7635_105409_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 The Englishman is hoping to reach that creek 
none	none	He does NOT know every stone of these cliffs he may go there by the longest way round and in any case he will proceed cautiously for fear of the patrols 
7635_105409_000067_000002	train-clean-100	At any rate there is a chance to get him yet 
none	none	A thousand francs to each man who gets to that creek before that long legged Englishman I know of a short cut across the cliffs said the soldier and with an enthusiastic shout he rushed forward followed closely by his comrades 
7635_105409_000069_000000	train-clean-100	Within a few minutes their running footsteps had died away in the distance 
none	none	Chauvelin listened to them for a moment the promise of the reward was lending spurs to the soldiers of the Republic The gleam of hate and anticipated triumph was once more apparent on his face Close to him Desgas still stood mute and impassive waiting for further orders whilst two soldiers were kneeling beside the prostrate form of Marguerite Chauvelin gave his secretary a vicious look His well laid plan had failed its sequel was problematical there was still a great chance now that the Scarlet Pimpernel might yet escape and Chauvelin with that unreasoning fury which sometimes assails a strong nature was longing to vent his rage on somebody The soldiers were holding Marguerite pinioned to the ground though she poor soul was not making the faintest struggle Overwrought nature had at last peremptorily asserted herself and she lay there in a dead swoon her eyes circled by deep purple lines that told of long sleepless nights her hair matted and damp round her forehead her lips parted in a sharp curve that spoke of physical pain 
7635_105409_000072_000000	train-clean-100	The cleverest woman in Europe the elegant and fashionable Lady Blakeney who had dazzled London society with her beauty her wit and her extravagances presented a very pathetic picture of tired out suffering womanhood which would have appealed to any but the hard vengeful heart of her baffled enemy 
none	none	It is no use mounting guard over a woman who is half dead he said spitefully to the soldiers when you have allowed five men who were very much alive to escape Obediently the soldiers rose to their feet You d better try and find that footpath again for me and that broken down cart we left on the road Then suddenly a bright idea seemed to strike him
7635_105409_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah by the bye where is the Jew 
7635_105409_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 Close by here citoyen said Desgas I gagged him and tied his legs together as you commanded 
none	none	From the immediate vicinity a plaintive moan reached Chauvelin s ears He followed his secretary who led the way to the other side of the hut where fallen into an absolute heap of dejection with his legs tightly pinioned together and his mouth gagged lay the unfortunate descendant of Israel 
7635_105409_000080_000000	train-clean-100	His face in the silvery light of the moon looked positively ghastly with terror his eyes were wide open and almost glassy and his whole body was trembling as if with ague while a piteous wail escaped his bloodless lips 
none	none	The rope which had originally been wound round his shoulders and arms had evidently given way for it lay in a tangle about his body but he seemed quite unconscious of this for he had not made the slightest attempt to move from the place where Desgas had originally put him like a terrified chicken which looks upon a line of white chalk drawn on a table as on a string which paralyzes its movements
7635_105409_000081_000000	train-clean-100	 Bring the cowardly brute here commanded Chauvelin 
none	none	He certainly felt exceedingly vicious and since he had no reasonable grounds for venting his ill humour on the soldiers who had but too punctually obeyed his orders he felt that the son of the despised race would prove an excellent butt With true French contempt of the Jew which has survived the lapse of centuries even to this day he would not go too near him but said with biting sarcasm as the wretched old man was brought in full light of the moon by the two soldiers I suppose now that being a Jew you have a good memory for bargains
7635_105409_000084_000000	train-clean-100	 Answer he again commanded as the Jew with trembling lips seemed too frightened to speak 
7635_105409_000085_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes your Honour stammered the poor wretch 
none	none	You remember then the one you and I made together in Calais when you undertook to overtake Reuben Goldstein his nag and my friend the tall stranger Eh B b but your Honour
7635_105409_000088_000000	train-clean-100	 There is no but I said do you remember 
none	none	Y y y yes your Honour
7635_105409_000090_000000	train-clean-100	 What was the bargain 
none	none	There was dead silence The unfortunate man looked round at the great cliffs the moon above the stolid faces of the soldiers and even at the poor prostate inanimate woman close by but said nothing Will you speak thundered Chauvelin menacingly He did try poor wretch but obviously he could not There was no doubt however that he knew what to expect from the stern man before him Your Honour he ventured imploringly Since your terror seems to have paralyzed your tongue said Chauvelin sarcastically I must needs refresh your memory It was agreed between us that if we overtook my friend the tall stranger before he reached this place you were to have ten pieces of gold 
7635_105409_000096_000000	train-clean-100	A low moan escaped from the Jew s trembling lips 
7635_105409_000097_000000	train-clean-100	 But added Chauvelin with slow emphasis if you deceived me in your promise you were to have a sound beating one that would teach you not to tell lies 
none	none	I did not your Honour I swear it by Abraham And by all the other patriarchs I know Unfortunately they are still in Hades I believe according to your creed and cannot help you much in your present trouble Now you did not fulfil your share of the bargain but I am ready to fulfil mine 
7635_105409_000099_000003	train-clean-100	Here he added turning to the soldiers the buckle end of your two belts to this confounded Jew 
none	none	As the soldiers obediently unbuckled their heavy leather belts the Jew set up a howl that surely would have been enough to bring all the patriarchs out of Hades and elsewhere to defend their descendant from the brutality of this French official I think I can rely on you citoyen soldiers laughed Chauvelin maliciously to give this old liar the best and soundest beating he has ever experienced 
7635_105409_000101_000001	train-clean-100	But don t kill him he added drily 
none	none	We will obey citoyen replied the soldiers as imperturbably as ever He did not wait to see his orders carried out he knew that he could trust these soldiers who were still smarting under his rebuke not to mince matters when given a free hand to belabour a third party When that lumbering coward has had his punishment he said to Desgas the men can guide us as far as the cart and one of them can drive us in it back to Calais The Jew and the woman can look after each other he added roughly until we can send somebody for them in the morning They can t run away very far in their present condition and we cannot be troubled with them just now 
7635_105409_000105_000000	train-clean-100	Chauvelin had not given up all hope 
none	none	His men he knew were spurred on by the hope of the reward That enigmatic and audacious Scarlet Pimpernel alone and with thirty men at his heels could not reasonably be expected to escape a second time But he felt less sure now the Englishman s audacity had baffled him once whilst the wooden headed stupidity of the soldiers and the interference of a woman had turned his hand which held all the trumps into a losing one If Marguerite had not taken up his time if the soldiers had had a grain of intelligence if it was a long if and Chauvelin stood for a moment quite still and enrolled thirty odd people in one long overwhelming anathema Nature poetic silent balmy the bright moon the calm silvery sea spoke of beauty and of rest and Chauvelin cursed nature cursed man and woman and above all he cursed all long legged meddlesome British enigmas with one gigantic curse The howls of the Jew behind him undergoing his punishment sent a balm through his heart overburdened as it was with revengeful malice He smiled It eased his mind to think that some human being at least was like himself not altogether at peace with mankind He turned and took a last look at the lonely bit of coast where stood the wooden hut now bathed in moonlight the scene of the greatest discomfiture ever experienced by a leading member of the Committee of Public Safety 
7635_105409_000109_000000	train-clean-100	Against a rock on a hard bed of stone lay the unconscious figure of Marguerite Blakeney while some few paces further on the unfortunate Jew was receiving on his broad back the blows of two stout leather belts wielded by the stolid arms of two sturdy soldiers of the Republic 
none	none	The howls of Benjamin Rosenbaum were fit to make the dead rise from their graves They must have wakened all the gulls from sleep and made them look down with great interest at the doings of the lords of the creation
7635_105409_000110_000000	train-clean-100	 That will do commanded Chauvelin as the Jew s moans became more feeble and the poor wretch seemed to have fainted away we don t want to kill him 
none	none	Obediently the soldiers buckled on their belts one of them viciously kicking the Jew to one side Leave him there said Chauvelin and lead the way now quickly to the cart 
7635_105409_000112_000001	train-clean-100	I ll follow 
7635_105409_000113_000000	train-clean-100	He walked up to where Marguerite lay and looked down into her face 
none	none	She had evidently recovered consciousness and was making feeble efforts to raise herself Her large blue eyes were looking at the moonlit scene round her with a scared and terrified look they rested with a mixture of horror and pity on the Jew whose luckless fate and wild howls had been the first signs that struck her with her returning senses then she caught sight of Chauvelin in his neat dark clothes which seemed hardly crumpled after the stirring events of the last few hours He was smiling sarcastically and his pale eyes peered down at her with a look of intense malice With mock gallantry he stooped and raised her icy cold hand to his lips which sent a thrill of indescribable loathing through Marguerite s weary frame I much regret fair lady he said in his most suave tones that circumstances over which I have no control compel me to leave you here for the moment But I go away secure in the knowledge that I do not leave you unprotected Our friend Benjamin here though a trifle the worse for wear at the present moment will prove a gallant defender of your fair person I have no doubt At dawn I will send an escort for you until then I feel sure that you will find him devoted though perhaps a trifle slow Marguerite only had the strength to turn her head away 
7635_105409_000116_000001	train-clean-100	Her heart was broken with cruel anguish 
none	none	One awful thought had returned to her mind together with gathering consciousness What had become of Percy What of Armand She knew nothing of what had happened after she heard the cheerful song God save the King which she believed to be the signal of death
7635_105409_000118_000000	train-clean-100	 I myself concluded Chauvelin must now very reluctantly leave you AU REVOIR fair lady 
none	none	We meet I hope soon in London Shall I see you at the Prince of Wales garden party No Ah well AU REVOIR Remember me I pray to Sir Percy Blakeney And with a last ironical smile and bow he once more kissed her hand and disappeared down the footpath in the wake of the soldiers and followed by the imperturbable Desgas CHAPTER XXXI THE ESCAPE Marguerite listened half dazed as she was to the fast retreating firm footsteps of the four men All nature was so still that she lying with her ear close to the ground could distinctly trace the sound of their tread as they ultimately turned into the road and presently the faint echo of the old cart wheels the halting gait of the lean nag told her that her enemy was a quarter of a league away How long she lay there she knew not She had lost count of time dreamily she looked up at the moonlit sky and listened to the monotonous roll of the waves The invigorating scent of the sea was nectar to her wearied body the immensity of the lonely cliffs was silent and dreamlike Her brain only remained conscious of its ceaseless its intolerable torture of uncertainty She did not know She did not know whether Percy was even now at this moment in the hands of the soldiers of the Republic enduring as she had done herself the gibes and jeers of his malicious enemy She did not know on the other hand whether Armand s lifeless body did not lie there in the hut whilst Percy had escaped only to hear that his wife s hands had guided the human bloodhounds to the murder of Armand and his friends The physical pain of utter weariness was so great that she hoped confidently her tired body could rest here for ever after all the turmoil the passion and the intrigues of the last few days here beneath that clear sky within sound of the sea and with this balmy autumn breeze whispering to her a last lullaby All was so solitary so silent like unto dreamland Even the last faint echo of the distant cart had long ago died away afar Suddenly a sound the strangest undoubtedly that these lonely cliffs of France had ever heard broke the silent solemnity of the shore So strange a sound was it that the gentle breeze ceased to murmur the tiny pebbles to roll down the steep incline So strange that Marguerite wearied overwrought as she was thought that the beneficial unconsciousness of the approach of death was playing her half sleeping senses a weird and elusive trick It was the sound of a good solid absolutely British Damn The sea gulls in their nests awoke and looked round in astonishment a distant and solitary owl set up a midnight hoot the tall cliffs frowned down majestically at the strange unheard of sacrilege Marguerite did not trust her ears Half raising herself on her hands she strained every sense to see or hear to know the meaning of this very earthly sound All was still again for the space of a few seconds the same silence once more fell upon the great and lonely vastness Then Marguerite who had listened as in a trance who felt she must be dreaming with that cool magnetic moonlight overhead heard again and this time her heart stood still her eyes large and dilated looked round her not daring to trust her other sense Odd s life but I wish those demmed fellows had not hit quite so hard This time it was quite unmistakable only one particular pair of essentially British lips could have uttered those words in sleepy drawly affected tones Damn repeated those same British lips emphatically Zounds but I m as weak as a rat In a moment Marguerite was on her feet Was she dreaming Were those great stony cliffs the gates of paradise Was the fragrant breath of the breeze suddenly caused by the flutter of angels wings bringing tidings of unearthly joys to her after all her suffering or faint and ill was she the prey of delirium She listened again and once again she heard the same very earthly sounds of good honest British language not the least akin to whisperings from paradise or flutter of angels wings She looked round her eagerly at the tall cliffs the lonely hut the great stretch of rocky beach Somewhere there above or below her behind a boulder or inside a crevice but still hidden from her longing feverish eyes must be the owner of that voice which once used to irritate her but now would make her the happiest woman in Europe if only she could locate it Percy Percy she shrieked hysterically tortured between doubt and hope I am here Come to me Where are you Percy Percy It s all very well calling me m dear said the same sleepy drawly voice but odd s life I cannot come to you those demmed frog eaters have trussed me like a goose on a spit and I am weak as a mouse I cannot get away And still Marguerite did not understand She did not realise for at least another ten seconds whence came that voice so drawly so dear but alas with a strange accent of weakness and of suffering There was no one within sight except by that rock Great God the Jew Was she mad or dreaming His back was against the pale moonlight he was half crouching trying vainly to raise himself with his arms tightly pinioned Marguerite ran up to him took his head in both her hands and look straight into a pair of blue eyes good natured even a trifle amused shining out of the weird and distorted mask of the Jew Percy Percy my husband she gasped faint with the fulness of her joy Thank God Thank God La m dear he rejoined good humouredly we will both do that anon an you think you can loosen these demmed ropes and release me from my inelegant attitude She had no knife her fingers were numb and weak but she worked away with her teeth while great welcome tears poured from her eyes onto those poor pinioned hands Odd s life he said when at last after frantic efforts on her part the ropes seemed at last to be giving way but I marvel whether it has ever happened before that an English gentleman allowed himself to be licked by a demmed foreigner and made no attempt to give as good as he got It was very obvious that he was exhausted from sheer physical pain and when at last the rope gave way he fell in a heap against the rock Marguerite looked helplessly round her Oh for a drop of water on this awful beach she cried in agony seeing that he was ready to faint again Nay m dear he murmured with his good humoured smile personally I should prefer a drop of good French brandy an you ll dive in the pocket of this dirty old garment you ll find my flask I am demmed if I can move When he had drunk some brandy he forced Marguerite to do likewise La that s better now Eh little woman he said with a sigh of satisfaction Heigh ho but this is a queer rig up for Sir Percy Blakeney Bart to be found in by his lady and no mistake Begad he added passing his hand over his chin I haven t been shaved for nearly twenty hours I must look a disgusting object As for these curls And laughingly he took off the disfiguring wig and curls and stretched out his long limbs which were cramped from many hours stooping Then he bent forward and looked long and searchingly into his wife s blue eyes Percy she whispered while a deep blush suffused her delicate cheeks and neck if you only knew I do know dear everything he said with infinite gentleness And can you ever forgive I have naught to forgive sweetheart your heroism your devotion which I alas so little deserved have more than atoned for that unfortunate episode at the ball Then you knew she whispered all the time Yes he replied tenderly I knew all the time But begad had I but known what a noble heart yours was my Margot I should have trusted you as you deserved to be trusted and you would not have had to undergo the terrible sufferings of the past few hours in order to run after a husband who has done so much that needs forgiveness They were sitting side by side leaning up against a rock and he had rested his aching head on her shoulder She certainly now deserved the name of the happiest woman in Europe It is a case of the blind leading the lame sweetheart is it not he said with his good natured smile of old Odd s life but I do not know which are the more sore my shoulders or your little feet He bent forward to kiss them for they peeped out through her torn stockings and bore pathetic witness to her endurance and devotion But Armand she said with sudden terror and remorse as in the midst of her happiness the image of the beloved brother for whose sake she had so deeply sinned rose now before her mind Oh have no fear for Armand sweetheart he said tenderly did I not pledge you my word that he should be safe He with de Tournay and the others are even now on board the DAY DREAM But how she gasped I do not understand Yet tis simple enough m dear he said with that funny half shy half inane laugh of his you see when I found that that brute Chauvelin meant to stick to me like a leech I thought the best thing I could do as I could not shake him off was to take him along with me I had to get to Armand and the others somehow and all the roads were patrolled and every one on the look out for your humble servant I knew that when I slipped through Chauvelin s fingers at the Chat Gris that he would lie in wait for me here whichever way I took I wanted to keep an eye on him and his doings and a British head is as good as a French one any day Indeed it had proved to be infinitely better and Marguerite s heart was filled with joy and marvel as he continued to recount to her the daring manner in which he had snatched the fugitives away right from under Chauvelin s very nose Dressed as the dirty old Jew he said gaily I knew I should not be recognized I had met Reuben Goldstein in Calais earlier in the evening For a few gold pieces he supplied me with this rig out and undertook to bury himself out of sight of everybody whilst he lent me his cart and nag But if Chauvelin had discovered you she gasped excitedly your disguise was good but he is so sharp Odd s fish he rejoined quietly then certainly the game would have been up I could but take the risk I know human nature pretty well by now he added with a note of sadness in his cheery young voice and I know these Frenchmen out and out They so loathe a Jew that they never come nearer than a couple of yards of him and begad I fancy that I contrived to make myself look about as loathsome an object as it is possible to conceive Yes and then she asked eagerly Zooks then I carried out my little plan that is to say at first I only determined to leave everything to chance but when I heard Chauvelin giving his orders to the soldiers I thought that Fate and I were going to work together after all I reckoned on the blind obedience of the soldiers Chauvelin had ordered them on pain of death not to stir until the tall Englishman came Desgas had thrown me down in a heap quite close to the hut the soldiers took no notice of the Jew who had driven Citoyen Chauvelin to this spot I managed to free my hands from the ropes with which the brute had trussed me I always carry pencil and paper with me wherever I go and I hastily scrawled a few important instructions on a scrap of paper then I looked about me I crawled up to the hut under the very noses of the soldiers who lay under cover without stirring just as Chauvelin had ordered them to do then I dropped my little note into the hut through a chink in the wall and waited In this note I told the fugitives to walk noiselessly out of the hut creep down the cliffs keep to the left until they came to the first creek to give a certain signal when the boat of the DAY DREAM which lay in wait not far out to sea would pick them up They obeyed implicitly fortunately for them and for me The soldiers who saw them were equally obedient to Chauvelin s orders They did not stir I waited for nearly half an hour when I knew that the fugitives were safe I gave the signal which caused so much stir And that was the whole story It seemed so simple and Marguerite could but marvel at the wonderful ingenuity the boundless pluck and audacity which had evolved and helped to carry out this daring plan But those brutes struck you she gasped in horror at the bare recollection of the fearful indignity Well that could not be helped he said gently whilst my little wife s fate was so uncertain I had to remain here by her side Odd s life he added merrily never fear Chauvelin will lose nothing by waiting I warrant Wait till I get him back to England La he shall pay for the thrashing he gave me with compound interest I promise you Marguerite laughed It was so good to be beside him to hear his cheery voice to watch that good humoured twinkle in his blue eyes as he stretched out his strong arms in longing for that foe and anticipation of his well deserved punishment Suddenly however she started the happy blush left her cheek the light of joy died out of her eyes she had heard a stealthy footfall overhead and a stone had rolled down from the top of the cliffs right down to the beach below What s that she whispered in horror and alarm Oh nothing m dear he muttered with a pleasant laugh only a trifle you happened to have forgotten my friend Ffoulkes Sir Andrew she gasped Indeed she had wholly forgotten the devoted friend and companion who had trusted and stood by her during all these hours of anxiety and suffering She remembered him now tardily and with a pang of remorse Aye you had forgotten him hadn t you m dear said Sir Percy merrily Fortunately I met him not far from the Chat Gris before I had that interesting supper party with my friend Chauvelin Odd s life but I have a score to settle with that young reprobate but in the meanwhile I told him of a very long very circuitous road which Chauvelin s men would never suspect just about the time when we are ready for him eh little woman And he obeyed asked Marguerite in utter astonishment Without word or question See here he comes He was not in the way when I did not want him and now he arrives in the nick of time Ah he will make pretty little Suzanne a most admirable and methodical husband In the meanwhile Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had cautiously worked his way down the cliffs he stopped once or twice pausing to listen for whispered words which would guide him to Blakeney s hiding place Blakeney he ventured to say at last cautiously Blakeney are you there The next moment he rounded the rock against which Sir Percy and Marguerite were leaning and seeing the weird figure still clad in the Jew s long gaberdine he paused in sudden complete bewilderment But already Blakeney had struggled to his feet Here I am friend he said with his funny inane laugh all alive though I do look a begad scarecrow in these demmed things Zooks ejaculated Sir Andrew in boundless astonishment as he recognized his leader of all the The young man had seen Marguerite and happily checked the forcible language that rose to his lips at sight of the exquisite Sir Percy in this weird and dirty garb Yes said Blakeney calmly of all the hem My friend I have not yet had time to ask you what you were doing in France when I ordered you to remain in London Insubordination What Wait till my shoulders are less sore and by God see the punishment you ll get Odd s fish I ll bear it said Sir Andrew with a merry laugh seeing that you are alive to give it Would you have had me allow Lady Blakeney to do the journey alone But in the name of heaven man where did you get these extraordinary clothes Lud they are a bit quaint ain t they laughed Sir Percy jovially But odd s fish he added with sudden earnestness and authority now you are here Ffoulkes we must lose no more time that brute Chauvelin may send some one to look after us Marguerite was so happy she could have stayed here for ever hearing his voice asking a hundred questions But at mention of Chauvelin s name she started in quick alarm afraid for the dear life she would have died to save But how can we get back she gasped the roads are full of soldiers between here and Calais and We are not going back to Calais sweetheart he said but just the other side of Gris Nez not half a league from here The boat of the DAY DREAM will meet us there The boat of the DAY DREAM Yes he said with a merry laugh another little trick of mine I should have told you before that when I slipped that note into the hut I also added another for Armand which I directed him to leave behind and which has sent Chauvelin and his men running full tilt back to the Chat Gris after me but the first little note contained my real instructions including those to old Briggs He had my orders to go out further to sea and then towards the west When well out of sight of Calais he will send the galley to a little creek he and I know of just beyond Gris Nez The men will look out for me we have a preconcerted signal and we will all be safely aboard whilst Chauvelin and his men solemnly sit and watch the creek which is just opposite the Chat Gris The other side of Gris Nez But I I cannot walk Percy she moaned helplessly as trying to struggle to her tired feet she found herself unable even to stand I will carry you dear he said simply the blind leading the lame you know Sir Andrew was ready too to help with the precious burden but Sir Percy would not entrust his beloved to any arms but his own When you and she are both safely on board the DAY DREAM he said to his young comrade and I feel that Mlle Suzanne s eyes will not greet me in England with reproachful looks then it will be my turn to rest And his arms still vigorous in spite of fatigue and suffering closed round Marguerite s poor weary body and lifted her as gently as if she had been a feather Then as Sir Andrew discreetly kept out of earshot there were many things said or rather whispered which even the autumn breeze did not catch for it had gone to rest All his fatigue was forgotten his shoulders must have been very sore for the soldiers had hit hard but the man s muscles seemed made of steel and his energy was almost supernatural It was a weary tramp half a league along the stony side of the cliffs but never for a moment did his courage give way or his muscles yield to fatigue On he tramped with firm footstep his vigorous arms encircling the precious burden and no doubt as she lay quiet and happy at times lulled to momentary drowsiness at others watching through the slowly gathering morning light the pleasant face with the lazy drooping blue eyes ever cheerful ever illumined with a good humoured smile she whispered many things which helped to shorten the weary road and acted as a soothing balsam to his aching sinews The many hued light of dawn was breaking in the east when at last they reached the creek beyond Gris Nez The galley lay in wait in answer to a signal from Sir Percy she drew near and two sturdy British sailors had the honour of carrying my lady into the boat Half an hour later they were on board the DAY DREAM The crew who of necessity were in their master s secrets and who were devoted to him heart and soul were not surprised to see him arriving in so extraordinary a disguise Armand saint Just and the other fugitives were eagerly awaiting the advent of their brave rescuer he would not stay to hear the expressions of their gratitude but found the way to his private cabin as quickly as he could leaving Marguerite quite happy in the arms of her brother Everything on board the DAY DREAM was fitted with that exquisite luxury so dear to Sir Percy Blakeney s heart and by the time they all landed at Dover he had found time to get into some of the sumptuous clothes which he loved and of which he always kept a supply on board his yacht The difficulty was to provide Marguerite with a pair of shoes and great was the little middy s joy when my lady found that she could put foot on English shore in his best pair The rest is silence silence and joy for those who had endured so much suffering yet found at last a great and lasting happiness But it is on record that at the brilliant wedding of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes Bart with Mlle Suzanne de Tournay de Basserive a function at which H R H the Prince of Wales and all the ELITE of fashionable society were present the most beautiful woman there was unquestionably Lady Blakeney whilst the clothes of Sir Percy Blakeney were the talk of the JEUNESSE DOREE of London for many days It is also a fact that M Chauvelin the accredited agent of the French Republican Government was not present at that or any other social function in London after that memorable evening at Lord Grenville s ball End of the
